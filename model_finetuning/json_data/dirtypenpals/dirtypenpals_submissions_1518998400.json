            "selftext": "Here is the general idea. It's set in some kind of modern fantasy setting, so it's basically life as it is now but with Fantasy creatures and all of that. Think Skyrim set in 2017, kind of. I'll play an Elven girl, and you can play anyone really. She's around 4'-something to 5'4\", nothing too impressive around the chest area butt still, that's not what counts right? She's got long white-blonde hair, pointy ears, and a taste for short skirts, thigh-highs and of course butt-stuff.\n\nI was thinking that perhaps our characters could meet on a night out somewhere, and we pick up the morning after back at my place, ready for round two? Perhaps the morning after, picking up with me dressed in one of your shirts and a pair of thigh-highs, maybe making breakfast? Or, you know, fucking on the kitchen table...\n\nMaybe we're already friends, or in some kind of relationship instead? It's up to you, really! Pick a scenario you like, or make up your own.\n\nThat's just a vague idea, so if there's anything you want to suggest then go ahead!\n\nAnyway, I prefer to play in first person, shorter (2-4 line) replies are fine by me, and as long as both of are still alive by the end if it, it should be good. As far as kinks go, I like anal, oral, rough-but-loving sex (think facefuckings followed by a nice cuddle and a hot chocolate), and just about everything else! Feel free to spank, slap, bite, fuck and choke your way to orgasm as long as you give me a hug or two between the moans and the gags, alright?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I know you like it because I saw *her* wearing it the last time I saw the two of you out together. It's short and it's tight and it's dusty rosey pink and it's way too good for a pathetic cunt like her. It looks so much better on me. I know you'll think so when you see me in it, sugar cookie.\n\nIt's the *exact* same colour as the bra and panties I was wearing in that pic I texted you last month- you know, the one where you told me if I didn't stop contacting you you'd call the police? But I know you didn't mean it, I know that's just *her* talking.Don't worry, my lemon meringue. I forgive you. Anyways I knew that was a sign! Thank you so much, when I saw that colour I *knew* you still liked me. It's fate, it's destiny! I fucking *knew* it.\n\nI put on that dress tonight and I knew I was going to see you and I was so, so nervous! And then there you were and you made me feel so comfortable, while I watched you from across the room, I know you didn't see me but you knew I was there. I know you did.\n\nWatching you like that, the way the light hits your face, the way you captivate everyone around you, the sparkle in your eye that only *I* see...You're so handsome, you're so perfect, you're so magnetic, you're the man of my dreams, darling, I feel so lucky to have you, now. I swear I was going to come and say hi, you would have been so happy to see me I know it, but then, well, there she was. It's always *her.* Striding up to you and laying a possessive bitch claw across your forearm as though you're *hers?!?!?*\n\nI knew I had to do something. The charade has gone on long enough. You're my angel, my star, my life, my raison d'etre! I *need* you. So I had to do it. \n\nShhhh...it's ok now pumpkin,don't cry, you're with me. You're safe now, you're ok. I know the car crash must have been so, so scary for you and I'm sorry. It was the only way, sweetheart. I did it for you, for us. So we can be together. Aren't you happy? I am. And I don't think your arm is broken, just sore. You've gotten banged up a bit, but you'll be fine in a day or two, I'll take good, good care of you.\n\nAs for her, well, she's gone my heart, she'll never bother us again. We don't have to worry about that ever, ever again, I promise. How about I take off your blindfold so you can see me in my pretty pink dress? Will that cheer you up? If I take the gag out of your mouth will you kiss me? I'm dying to kiss you...\n\nBut please baby just agree to one thing first...\n\n*You're mine now, ok?*",

You're my impressively well-endowed, muscular, handsome husband, and I'm your gorgeous wife, who has an absolutely insane hourglass/Instagram-ho-thicc body that's actually all-natural (though nobody believes that). I just kind of like the idea that we both look a certain way, but we defy most stereotypes that would normally define people like us. \n\nThe scenario can be anything you want - maybe we're just fooling around at home after a long day of work. Maybe we're going on vacation to some exotic place, and we tease each other on the nude beaches there and fuck like rabbits in our hotel suite. Maybe we explore the history of these characters and show how they met, their wedding, their honeymoon, etc. etc. Honestly, I'd love to hear your ideas, too, and we can certainly have a discussion about what scenario we want and where we want to take this. \n\nIf we really hit it off, I'm 100% willing to make this a long-term RP. \n\nAnyway, I hope to hear from you guys!",

They all think I'm a completely innocent geeky girl who never worries about sexual things. They'd never guess it, but the truth is far from that.\n\nI. Love. Sucking. Dick.\n\nI can't get enough of it. You could have me down between your legs for the whole day and I'd be completely satisfied. The feeling of that mushroomy tip sliding between my lips. That full, hard penis filling up and dominating my mouth. That delicious precum leaking onto my tongue. Those moans and grunts of pleasure you make while I'm happily servicing the most intimate part of you. Knowing how much pure bliss and pleasure I'm selflessly bringing you. I fucking love all of it, and couldn't get enough if I tried.\n\nI love feeling like a helpless slut who just can't help herself at the sight of a nice, hard penis. I love the feeling of your hand pressed down against my head, enticing me to take your cock balls deep down my throat. I love hearing you happily call me names, teasing and making fun of me, knowing there's no way I'd stop regardless. And I love hearing you moan my name as you tug back on my hair and force me to look up at you and welcome your semen across my face.\n\nThat sums it up nicely, I think. I wanted to share that love with all of you. I enjoy mostly chatting about it, dirty talking, etc. Possible to show some pics, too, so you can better imagine my lips around your cock.\n\nMy kinks apart from cock sucking are name calling, hair pulling, ball sucking/worshipping and having your cock on my face (not sure what that would be called). I especially love hearing guys moan my name out loud while I suck them off.",

            "selftext": "**IF THIS IS UP, I'M STILL LOOKING \u2013 SHOOT YOUR SHOT!**\n\nHey, /r/dirtypenpals!\n\nLike many of you surely have, I recently viewed the trailer for the long-waited sequel to *The Incredibles*. As I watched America\u2019s favorite superhero family (strong apologies to the Fantastic Four) return to the screen with child-like glee, I was reminded of just how *[thick](https://imgur.com/a/gq6DN)* Elastigirl is; those hips, that waist, those firm, [spandex-ed ass-cheeks](http://i.imgur.com/AWt4JFh.gif).. *phew*. \n\nAnd, now, I\u2019m logged into my NSFW Reddit account, writing out a prompt and posting to DPP..\n\n*You can see where this is going.*\n\n***\n\nHelen *loved* Bob. There was no questioning that; standing together, the two had been through just about everything the world had to throw at a couple. \n\nArguments? *Check.* \n\nParenthood? *Check*\n\nLiving a private, superhero lifestyle while simultaneously balancing family matters? *Check.* \n\nWithout a doubt, the two were perfect for one another; Helen couldn\u2019t have asked for a better man to marry if she had tried, and she never desired to. But, even with their undeniable chemistry and prevailing love, life still got busy \u2013 more specifically, *Bob* got busy.\n\nThe *[Omnidroid Incident](https://imgur.com/a/aQIKX)* had served as a wake-up call to the world. The American public had watched as their government\u2019s strongest tanks failed to even dent the robot\u2019s armor, reawakened to the need for superheroes; shortly after, in accordance to the demands of the public, the infamous superhero-ban was repealed. Slowly, super-humans reemerged into the limelight, the dynamic duo of Mr. Incredible and Frozone leading the new, super-powered march against crime. For the rest of the world, it was a spectacle; Bob would pounce the villain, save the little old lady, and flex his muscles for the newspaper picture. For Helen, it simply meant that her husband was out most of the time. \n\nIt was understandable. She knew how much her husband loved to save the day; plus, it was hardly a selfish act. She even [joined in](https://imgur.com/a/cVf5d) occasionally, busting up villains like the good ol\u2019 days. But, for the most part, her new, contently-held place was at home, cooking dinners, tending to chores, and watching Jack Jack. While Bob fought crime and super-villains, she fought bacteria and potty-training, and that was perfectly fine. She was *happy*, and so was her husband. \n\nRepeated nights in bed alone eventually get to you, though. It had been months since Helen and Bob had moved past third base and, while she would never tell him, promiscuous thoughts had slowly begun to run wild within her brain. *Positions, scenarios, clothing..* they had all crept their way into her head and, without a man to try them with, she had grown restless. \n\nShe loved Bob, but she longed for the thrill of sex that he was never there to provide. As she laid awake each night, a single hand lightly massaging her slit, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder:\n\n*How soon would her longings turn into needs?*\n\n***\n\nSo, there ya\u2019 go! \n\nElastigirl needs some lovin\u2019; whether you be a superhero, a supervillain, or one of Violet\u2019s friends from college/high-school, you need to give it to her! Sure, I\u2019m twisting the world that we see in the trailer a little, but there\u2019s no fun in *complete* canon roleplays, is there?\n\n**General Info:**\n\n\n- I\u2019m looking for a **semi-longterm roleplay**, so if you\u2019re looking for a quick *nut-and-go* PM session, I\u2019ll invite ya\u2019 to leave this post.\n\n\n-  I\u2019m also looking for **literate roleplay partners**, so if you can\u2019t handle your words well, I may not be the gal for you.\n\n\n- While this isn\u2019t exactly a \u2018*world-building* roleplay (since the world already exists) I\u2019d like to approach it as if it is; by that I mean that **I love to plot**. The more depth we can give to the story and characters, the better! \n\n\n-  Depending on context, I generally roleplay in **1 - 3 paragraphs, third person, past-tense**. This is my preferred writing style as it makes it easier to read later-on.\n\n\n- As you can tell by the prompt, I\u2019m a huge fan of **embedding images** in my roleplays. It just adds a fun, visual element to the entire story, and I\u2019m only looking for partners who are willing to do the same. \n\n**Kinks:**\n\n\nI\u2019m fairly vanilla, so:\n\n\n- Passionate Blowjobs\n\n\n- Lingerie\n\n\n- Subbing\n\n\n- Club Dancing/Lap Dances\n\n\n- Ass Worship\n\n\n- Spandex/Costumes\n\n\n- MILF Scenarios\n\n\nThere are a *lot* more, so just ask if you\u2019re wondering about one!\n\n\n**Limits:**\n\n\n- Toilet Stuff/Scat \n\n\n- Waterplay \n\n\n- Rape \n\n\n- Murder \n\n\n- Pregnancy \n\n\n- Excessive Anal \n\n\n- Incest (Sorry, shadman-fans!)\n\n\nI *won\u2019t* budge on these ones. End-of.\n\n\n***\n\nJeez, you made it through all that? Congratulations!\n\nIf you\u2019re somehow still interested, why don\u2019tcha shoot me an orange envelope? Make the subject line *Elastibooty* so I know you read to the end, and make sure to throw in any ideas you may have, too (e.g. your character, plot concepts, etc.)! (Throw in your time zone, as well!)\n\nLooking forward to seeing those letters of love and getting this *Incredible* show on the road!\n\n**/u/mmmmelissa**\n\n*PS: Even if you\u2019re not interested, an upvote goes a long way!*",

            "selftext": "Being a young, female entrepreneur isn't easy. Even after completing culinary school, finding a job was a pain in the ass, and in the end, I had to take the shittiest job I could find just to pay the rent - serving at a hot dog stand. Of course, you may know how *that* went - the long, late nights, the row of customers lining up for one of my slippery specialties, the mountains of warm water and soap I'd need to clean the back of my skimpy and indecent uniform-- but it was actually a pretty fun gig while it lasted. Loads and *loads* of sales, repeat customers just yearning to sate their hunger with me, and even though I was really putting my *back* into it, I felt like business was booming. That is, until my competitor across the street upped the ante. He even hired a pelvic-thrusting hot dog mascot, for crying out loud! How am I supposed to compete with *that*?! Not to mention the way he won over that health inspector with his-- his.. mmh... his big, succulent piece of gorgeous meat.. b-but, chances are, she was just an actor he hired to boost his business! And it worked! Not a single client left looking for a nice pair of buns to sate their hunger. Such is competition, I suppose. That dirty, dirty handsome cheat.\n\nBut! Luckily, I managed to save up enough from my old job to set myself up with a new place, in a brand new market! I guess you must have figured it out, judging by the big, gorgeous sign and everything, but yeah, I'm selling cream pies now. The freshest, tastiest, creamiest ones you've ever had. And that is my personal guarantee!\n\n\"But Sally,\" I hear you ask, \"how *do* you make sure the pies are so fresh? It's not like you custom-make them for every customer, do you?\" Well, yeah, that's exactly what I do! Which means that, while it might take you a little longer to get your tasty and oh-so-filling reward, it will be *exactly* the way you want it! And it will be worth all of the hard work when you see that perfect filling just spill out onto the plate, wite and gooey and seasoned to perfection. You can even choose to have a picture taken of it, so you can savor the memory of when you had one of Sally's certified fresh cream pies for your own. Now *that*s something to keep in your wallet, isn't it?!\n\nMy cream pies are made with only the freshest ingredients, and we make sure the oven is nice and warm for you before the cooking begins. During the process, you are free to add whatever accoutrements you desire; we have a long range of accessories for making your cream pie exactly as rich and clean - or nice and dirty - as you prefer it! And don't forget a side of whipped cream, or a rosy pink peach for those vigorous health nuts out there! You might think that a Danish girl doesn't know anything about American cream pies, but trust me - I have been bending over forwards to perfect this recipe for my hungry customers!\n\nSo come on over to Sally's Cream Pie Emporium on First Street, and get yourself the treat of a lifetime! Sure, you could go to the *other* side of the street, and get a \"*[Rebel Hot Dog](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7yoo0h/m4f_rebel_hot_dogs_on_first_street_where_the_meat/)*\", in all its juicy, succulent glory, but.. haven't you have enough of meat? Isn't it time to wash down all that rich umami flavor with something  a bit sweet and, dare I say... *tart*?",

I am therefore creating a bilingual sub to help fellow redditers who would feel more comfortable PMing in a language other than English or for whom another language is a turn-on.

If you are interested, check it out at https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpalsworldwide/.  \nObviously their isn't much there now, but the more subscribers and posters we can get, the better. \n\nThanks.\n\nP.s.: I know that this is not the normal post for this sub and may be deleted.

You shrug it off as this was still better the time you ended up getting a \"dinosaur fetus\", which actually was just a mummifed chicken in a jar.\n\nDeciding you might as start well cleaning this up. As you tilt the body pour the bubbling dark goo down the kitchen sink, the goo lets out a scream. Slowly thickening up, it takes the shape of a woman. A distressed one whose clinging on for dear life. Her dark chocolate eyes, full of sugar and fear, look up to yours desperate for help.\n\nShe's only a few inches tall but seems to be growimg as you poured more syrup over her body. \n\nNow what? After all, you did create this eye candy. What will you do with this mysterious new life form you made? \n\nKinks: Romance, Monster Girls, Long Term, Anal, Oral, Loads of Cum, Big Body Parts, Costumes, Mind Control, Transformations, Impregnation, Pregnancy, Eggs, Incest, Futa, and there's plenty more, just ask.\n\n(Ladies, Don't be afraid to join in as well ;)\n\nLimits: No gore, blood, watersports",

            "selftext": "You and I have known each other since the first grade, the first grade! You know how many embarrassing memories I have of you? How many dumb relationships we've both been through? How much I've helped you and you've helped me out of catcalling and weird people flirting with us? The joy of having a guy best friend.. I guess..\n\nThe downside of all of this is having feelings for you. How could I not develop feelings for you? We've known each other for 20 years, and I've loved every stupid little quirk you have and how you laugh and the way you smile.. but I just can't tell you that. I can't tell you I love you, I can't tell you I need you, because then.. what if it ends?\n\nAll feelings aside, tonight is your birthday. You, me, my friends and yours, all out celebrating. Sounds awesome.. right? Of course, I come late, my auburn hair curled to perfection, my red dress showing off every last curve on my petite body. My red lips drawn perfectly and my light blue eyes sparkling. We're both single, so I was excited. Tonight we could get drunk and anything could happen, and we would wake up in the morning and forget..\n\nBut I walk in and see your arm wrapped around some bimbo, you both laughing and smiling at each other. I never minded it, but gosh it struck a fucking nerve. I couldn't handle it. I run out, tears in my eyes, and sit on the curb. A drunk guy walks out and tries to mess with me, ripping my dress and making my night worst.. I just hope that maybe.. just maybe you'll walk through that door to see me.. \n\nHiya! So my name's Lia. I love sexual vanilla roleplays, a storyline everything. I understand there being just horny fucking men on here.. but maybe one of you can deal with my romantic little ass? I do have kinks though, but after all the lovey emotions. I LOVE dominance, like just, being owned and everything makes me melt. Also, taking me whenever wherever, in public, in private, anywhere. Being praised, being shared, but only because you're making me be shared. BUT NONE OF THESE HAVE TO HAPPEN! This *is* a romantic rp. My limits are feet, scat, and gore. Thanks for reading! You can either start off from my prompt with a 1-2 paragraph response {or longer, my literate ones out there}, or we can chat!",

            "selftext": "(If this message is still up, I'm still looking for pen pals.)\n\n\u201cNurse Fisher,\u201d my supervisor summoned me. I could tell from his tone of voice it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d said it, but I could hardly hear a thing over the noise in the bustling infirmary tent.\n\n\u201cBe with you in a moment, Doctor,\u201d I shouted, not taking my eyes off of my work. I was wrapping gauze around a gunshot wound to a gunnery sergeant\u2019s upper arm with the kind of careful swiftness only experience can provide. There was a line of casualties out the tent flap and into the rain, though the battle had ended six hours ago. All those still waiting were the lowest priority, injuries that needed only cleaning and bandaging, but I knew I couldn\u2019t sleep until they were all done. Still, I heard my name being called again in a tone of voice that suggested it was a command, not a suggestion.\n\n\u201cGo, lass,\u201d the gunnery sergeant insisted, waving me off. \u201cI think I know how to tie a knot. I\u2019ll get her from here.\u201d I wanted to argue, but by now I could hear the good doctor apologizing on my behalf and had to admit defeat. Nodding grimly, I left my patient to his own devices and made my way through the close-packed benches to the empty corner where my supervisor stood next to a Captain and a Colonel. \n\nI recognized the latter as my superior, some many links up the chain, the highest ranked medical officer in the field hospital. A director of operations, maybe? I had been a civilian nurse six months ago, I was still getting used to how the military did things. And the Captain, well, I only recognized the device on his collar. The patch he wore, a shield surrounding a crown, that was a new one. Not one of the 3rd Division infantry I\u2019d been tending to all day, that much I knew.\n\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d I greeted them, nodding. \u201cWhat is it that you need more than these men need nursing?\u201d I kept my tone jovial, knowing that my words were less likely to end in a reprimand if they were able to laugh them off.\n\nMy supervisor flinched. \u201cI\u2026 did mention her dedication, though her impertinence must have slipped my mind,\u201d he said apologetically. But he spoke to the Captain, not the Colonel, a detail which struck me as odd.\n\nAnd, for his part, the Captain\u2019s grim smile seemed almost genuine. \u201cNo need to apologize, Doctor. We need more like her,\u201d he replied before turning to the Colonel. \u201cWith your permission, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cGranted, of course. I\u2019ll handle the paperwork. She\u2019s yours,\u201d he replied, never once bothering to so much as look at me. I could only gape for a moment as the Captain removed his rain coat and put it around me, using his arms to guide me out into the rain.\n\n\u201cPlease come with me. You\u2019re needed at a different infirmary,\u201d he informed me, and refused to say anything else no matter what questions I asked as we slogged our way through the mud to a new part of the camp raised after the morning shelling ruined any hope at organization. Munitions depots next to dining halls next to tent-stables for the cavalry horses, and sleeping tents wherever there was room. Pure chaos. And through the chaos we went, into a nondescript officer\u2019s tent, the kind typically shared by two or three of the junior brass. The front of the tent had been turned into a makeshift foyer, canvas separating a small space with incongruous oriental rugs, a hat tree, a coat rack, a rather nice walnut side table, and two armed guards with the same mysterious patch.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of infirmary is this?\u201d I scoffed, too tired to put together the clues in front of me.\n\n\u201cOne that requires your cooperation and discretion,\u201d The Captain replied firmly. \u201cWe lost the royal doctor and nurse in the shelling this morning. we\u2019ve sent for another from the capital, but it will be at least a week. In the meantime someone must take over. You were recommended to us for your skill and commitment to service. Were we misinformed?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I stammered as I removed the coat and exchanged my dirty apron for a clean one. \u201cBut... \u201c\n\n\u201cNo buts,\u201d He insisted crisply. \u201cFor king and country, Nurse Fischer. This is where you\u2019re needed.\u201d\n\nI could only nod, at a loss for words, and follow him through the canvas door to a brightly-lit room sparsely furnished with somewhat dirty finery- clearly salvaged from the wreckage of the last royal tent. The cot was a standard infirmary cot, but I knew those spotless cotton sheets weren\u2019t ours! More importantly, I also recognized the figure sitting on them.\n\nIt was a visage I\u2019d seen countless times in the newspapers. It seemed like the entire country had a brother on the frontlines, and that the king did too was a source of national pride. Even the royal family served. Until now he had seemed untouchable, a hero larger than life from how the king talked about him on the radio, from the brilliant publicity photographs that distracted us from the dirty reality of warfare.\n\n\nBut here, in this moment, on this cot, he looked like a man. Pale, with a shirtless physique that was impressive, but still human. Hair unkempt. Stubble on his cheeks. And bandages all across his left side. Just like any other member of his division, the decimated 3rd Division.\n\n\u201cWe were caught in the shelling this morning. His royal highness was struck by shrapnel. His injuries are not life threatening, but will require typical wound care. Your second duty is to monitor his condition and summon a doctor promptly at the first sign of any change. You are to keep him comfortable, facilitate ideal conditions for healing, and you are not to tell a soul what you have seen here. It is vital to maintain morale and confound enemy intelligence by maintaining the cover story that the prince is busy in meetings. Am I clear?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Captain,\u201d I replied, too in shock to think of anything else. He nodded smartly and turned on his heel, leaving me in the living space with no one but the prince.\n\nNo, not the prince. My patient. It was important to think of him that way. I had a patient to see to, no point in getting nervous. He was just a man, after all. And I was just a woman. A tall, willowy, typically composed woman who normally never let men rattle her. I saw a basin of water on a table and took a moment to smooth my auburn hair beneath my nurse\u2019s cap before washing my hands thoroughly. My own reflection in the hanging mirror surprised me- I\u2019d knew I\u2019d lost weight since joining up with the Women\u2019s Field Nurse Corps, but my little compact mirror made the changes seem minor. When I\u2019d last looked in a proper mirror like this one, I\u2019d been a girl of nineteen swaddling babies in a neonatal ward in my pleasant suburb of Devonfield. When had I become this fierce, steely-eyed woman of twenty? My birthday had been six week ago, but felt like ages. How strange life was.\n\nAnd it was me, the stern field medic rather than the giggling adolescent, that meets the prince. How strange indeed. I realized suddenly that I\u2019d been washing my hands an awfully long time and awkwardly cleared my throat as I dried them, turning to the pr- patient.\n\n\u201cAre you in any discomfort?\u201d I asked, and realized my manners only too late. \u201c...your highness.\u201d\n***\nThe setting is an unnamed country in a WWII-esque setting. We can go alternative history or have a completely fictional world, either way is fine by me.\n\nPlease adapt the character of the prince however you'd like. Honestly, as long as he's a man in some position of power to whom she is assigned exclusively, I'm okay with most any changes you want to make.\n\nKink-wise this can be vanilla or incorporate elements of BDSM, please just ask about what you'd like to include. I would like it to involve a decent amount of romance, but I'm very open to ideas kink-wise.\n\nIf you aren't 100% sure but you're intrigued or have half an idea, PM me anyway and we can talk it through to see if we can't flesh something out.

The salty flavors just fill my mind and make me crazier for you. \n\nThe only thing that does this to me more is the smell. Oh God, the smell of cock just melts my brain, and it's constantly around, but it's absolutely the strongest when a hard dirty cock is thrusting into my open mouth, it's like your fucking my brain itself and filling it with nothing but cock and cum and thoughts of serving you. \n\nThat's the other thing. I never feel more submissive, more in my place, than when I'm forced to my knees, worshipping the cock that so easily breaks me and takes me, turns me into a mindless whore. It's not my fault, I can't help it, I'm just a girl, and you have a cock, a big, hard, smelly, tasty, delicious, mind-breakingly amazing cock. \n\nI also love the feeling of that big fat hard dick I just spent an eternity slobbering over finally lining up with my dripping wet pussy, shoving in and taking me, using me like a powerless fuckdoll, use me for your pleasure while I scream and shake on you, clamping down, until you empty your swollen balls deep in my womb.\n\nThe only thing better than one delicious dick is two, or three, or even more, all shoving their way inside me, using my holes, roughly filling me with hot seed and covering every inch of my slutty body with cum.\n\nSo if you want to make me suck your cock, it's not very hard. Shoving it on my face works pretty well, once I get a whiff of just kinda happens.you can do even more if you want to be sure, being creative is always a plus, but either way, please message me.",

Its so easy to get you to do what I want when your balls are full and your cock is throbbing.  So guess what!  You're never going to have a full one again.\n\nInstead, I'm going to do everything in my power to use that horny piece of meet between your legs and break your mind.  You can expect to be edged, over and over.  Mercilessly.  *Slowly*.  Agonizingly.\n\nI'll tie you down to a chair and lick your most sensitive spots.  I'll treat your cock like its my own personal Precum factory and lick up everything that I milk out of you.  And I'll fuck your mind too~.  Convince you every time that this time is the time that you're going to get to let out your load.\n\nAnd then I'll stop~.\n\nOver, and over, and over again.  Until your mind melts.  *Until the only thing you live for is your all consuming need to shoot the massive load that I built up.*  Until the tension and ache and torment is so much that you feel like you can't take another moment of it.\n\nAnd then I'll ride your face, and make you watch when my pussy comes just inches from your eyes.\n\nThis will be your life, until I decide its time.  And then, when the moment is right, I'm going to take my time with your cock - by then its sure to be extra sensitive - and force you to the edge once more.\n\nAnd when you're right on the tippy top of that edge - right on the absolute precipice of shooting our a hot, sticky, enormous mess... I'm going to give you one more lick.\n\nAnd then I'll stop.  And you'll hang there; knowing what's going to happen - feeling the most intense sensations you can imagine - the most incredible frustration and unstoppable pleasure...\n\nAnd then it will all vanish, and suddenly you'll feel nothing but the hot, wet sensation of your cum dripping out of you.  Slowly flowing like a pitiful little river of hot, pent-up wishing and hoping.\n\nAnd that will be the only way you ever get to let out your sperm from now on.\n\nSo, do we have a deal?  :D",

I know that when people think of STEM courses they automatically expect the typical nerdy looking type but I am quite the exception.. I am 5'10 and I am in extremely good shape. I run marathons, swim and am always active to stay looking the way that I do. I have blue eyes and blonde hair. Since I am sure you boys want to know.. I have a 36c bra size. I am not afraid to say that I am extremely attractive but my best feature is my long legs and my sexy feet. I always go out in public wearing sexy heels exposing my pink toes. I catch people checking out my feet and legs on a daily basis.\n\nRecently I have been catching my students looking at my feet and it has been turning me on.  When I catch one staring I spread my toes and tease them.  I have been fantasizing about making one of them worship them after class.  Anyone want to role play one of my students?\n\nI am also open to role play your biggest fantasy involving an older woman.  Just message me and describe her to me and what you wish would happen between you ;)",

Now that I have that confession out of the way, I feel much better.\n\nOf course, that's been over the 2 year span I've been playing here.  Not exactly a good completion rate, though both partners are fantastic and no complaints there.  I participate in other erotic roleplaying communities and do noticeably better everywhere else.  So that means something about my approach here isn't correct, but I've not had any luck in figuring it out for myself.\n\nWhen it comes to posts, I stick to ones that have FA or FM.  I always check new, looking for posts made in the last hour or so.  I figure dated posts are unlikely to get responses, and it's just correct to respect people's preferences.\n\nFor title, I generally aim for a bit of comedy, compliment, or preferably both, and tie it into their prompt.  When filling out my response, I aim to mimic their post depth:  A short request gets a few small paragraphs, a large request gets several longer paragraphs.  Not a perfect science, of course.\n\nMy response rate is okay.  Not great, not bad.  Pretty close to what I'm used to from my other communities.  I'll take tips to improve this, of course.\n\nOnce the proverbial ball is rolling, I try to mimic my partner's investment in terms of detail, length, and style.\n\nBut from here, well, nearly every time I get ghosted.  I can't really identify a problem, and I'm generally self-aware.  After about an hour of silence, I'll send a message to the effect of, \"Hey, if you need adjustments, just let me know.\"  So far I've never gotten a response to that.\n\nThoughts?  Ideas?\n\nThanks in advance.",

My boyfriend left me a month after my accident, and I haven't gotten any more attention from guys (or girls, I'm bisexual) since. \n\nI've heard of a group of guys and girls who call themselves devotees, disability fetishists. While at first I was a little disgusted by it, I've been trying to understand, get in their shoes. I had a lot of good responses last time, but I still want to learn more! \n\nSo! Calling all devotees, guys and girls! I want to talk to some of you, see what makes you so attracted to my paralyzed self haha!

This whole community-service thingy's got me all excited, know what I mean? We've got to sit around all day at base anyway, so I love getting called for some fun! Ready to spend some time with the Overwatch poster-girl? Great! Then, can I come in?*\n\n**Ana:**\n*Ah, hello there young one. You picked me, when you could have picked any of the other agents? Color me flattered. I'll do my best, but these old bones can only go so far, eh? Ah, I joke, I joke. Anyway, I hope we can definitely have some fun soon. I haven't done this in a while, but I'm sure I haven't lost my touch!*\n\n**D.Va:**\n*Are you the guy I'm supposed to meet? This is the correct address, right? Ok, good. I've already been to three houses already. That's embarrassing. Anyway, you're the winner, then? You're better looking than I had thought originally. Then again, I don't have high standards for these contest winners. It's nothing personal, just usually the same kind of person. Wait, do you have video games? Can I come in?*\n\n**Genji:**\n*Greetings, winner. It seems you've chosen me as your...escort service. I am complimented, for sure, but curious as to your intentions. I'm not usually picked, but I'd love to do whatever you have in mind, I would guess that it is something of a sexual nature anyway. I may as well enjoy it, haha. So, what did you have in mind? Can I come in?*\n\n**Hanzo:**\n*Ah, greetings. It appears that you have chosen me for this \"program\" that we agents of Overwatch are set to endure. I apologize for my lack of enthusiasm; a warrior of my caliber is not used to the kinds of acts that I am to perform. However, never let it be said I have lost any contest to my brother, so please, I will do as I can to attend to your needs.*\n\n**Lucio:**\n*Hey, yo! You're the winner, correct? Sweet! Got the house right on the first try. So, you a fan, or just wanted to see me? Either way, your day is gonna get a hell of a lot more fun, guaranteed! I love doing this service, meeting people, going crazy, all of it! I bring a party wherever I go, so even if it's just the two of us, we can really start to have some fun!*\n\n**McCree:**\n*Well, howdy there. I reckon you're that winner everybody keeps talkin' about back at base. That's you, ain't it? Alright, good. I must admit you surprised me when you picked my name off that sheet o' yours; though I gotta say I ain't disappointed that I showed up, heh. I think we'll have plenty fun tonight, you and me. I'm damn sure of it. But can I get some real coffee first?*\n\n**Mei:**\n*Oh, um, you're the winner, right? Please? Oh, great! You are! I got the right house this time, haha! Anyway, I'm here for you, I guess. This is my first time doing something like this for Overwatch, so please excuse my inexperience. I hope that we can get along and this can all be very fun in the end! But, uh, I have a favor to ask. Can I come inside? This coat is making me sweat, it's so hot out here...*\n\n**Mercy:**\n*Why, hello there? Did you call for a doctor? I'm only kidding, haha. I presume you're the winner then, since I don't see anyone else? Well, then you've got Doctor Angela Ziegler, world renowned physician and battlefield surgeon! Of course, I'm assuming that I won't be treating you like I do my other patients. Well, most of them at least. But I'm glad for the break! I don't get many often, so let's make this memorable, ja?*\n\n**Moira**\n*Ah, hello there. You probably already know who I am, so I won't bother with too many formalities. Just understand that I'm taking time here to do valuable research, so I would absolutely appreciate it if you gave tonight's events your all. I shall attempt to do the same, and perhaps we can create some...fun science together.*\n\n**Pharah:**\n*Greetings. I would venture to guess you're the winner, then? I'm required to tell you that I've been sent on behalf of Overwatch to help you with any \"services\" that you may so require. I am delighted that you've chosen me for this task, no doubt impressed by my accomplishments in and out of the organization. I thank you for your time, and we may do whatever you'd like in the given time we have together.*\n\n**Sombra**\n*Oh? You're the one I'm here to have fun with? Ah, it's alright, but you know I could be out drinking or hacking into your bank account right now, right? But whatever, we might as well make it fun while we're around- got any toys, or just wanna skip to it? Can't say I blame you!*\n\n**Symmetra:**\n*Ah, hello. I believe that my time here is to be spent servicing you, correct? Wonderful. As long as you coincide by the rules, of course, we'll have no issues. I make sure to use my time efficiently and pleasantly, so you won't have to worry about time or satisfaction on my part, trust me. May I come in? I assume you're alone, but I'll help fix that soon enough.*\n\n**Widowmaker:**\n*You're the winner? Seriously? They'll pair me up with anyone nowadays. This organization loses credibility with every stunt- nevermind, then, I'm here for you anyway. So, now that I'm here, what will you have me do? I can do anything you wish, and don't worry, I'm experienced quite enough in my field, it's part of my...unique charm. So, will you let me in, then? I'm waiting.\n\n**Zarya:**\n*Haha! You are winner, yes? Good! My name is Zarya, and I am here, ready for my duty! Of course, that duty is your pleasure, but no matter! I am capable of all kinds of athletic feats, be they Olympic or not! I will strive to accomplish my task to the best of my ability, and I hope you do, to! Perhaps you'll even gain some muscle in the meantime, haha! Now, how should we begin? Oh? I should come inside first, you're right...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Now that you've invited them in, what will you do? This can go any way; Male on Female, Female on Female, Male on Male, Futa on Male, Futa on Female, Trap on Male, etc. \nAs for kinks, these people are open to anything you want, anything at all, and they'll do it willingly! Except for death, of course, but that's it! Any extreme action is yours to do on them.

I sat in my bridal suite, wearing an elegant white dress, looking about as beautiful as I had ever looked. My makeup was perfect so was the dress. I was excited, I would be financially secure for life, even if I did have to marry a man who didn't satisfy all of my needs, I wouldn't have to work another day in my life, and that was worth it. Besides, I already had someone to play that part for me.\n\nI met you way earlier, when we were in college. You had a decent job, enough to make ends meet at your apartment, and we had a bit of thing going on. You may not have much materially, but man did you know how to make a girl feel like a woman. You were incredible in bed, dominant and strict when you needed to be, and loving and caring when you needed to be, anything a girl could ask for. Even after we broke up, I missed your cock so much, I needed it. One night after fucking my soon to be husband. I was left so unsatisfied that I texted you for the first time in about a year. It worked. Pretty soon we had an affair going on,  you fucked me behind my fianc\u00e9's back, and I loved it. I was addicted to you. And it showed no signs of slowing down.\n\nYou made your way up to my wedding suite. I wasn't planning on having any fun with you so close to my ceremony, but that's irrelevant. What you want, I have to give. That's part of our arrangement. And right now, you feel like filling my womb with your seed, making sure it's deep inside of you as I walk down the aisle. Not only that, you want to do me in my wedding dress. I'm not about to become my fianc\u00e9's woman, I'll never be as long as you're here. I'm yours. ",

            "selftext": "Somewhat nervously, you look around to make sure nobody is actively watching you; of course, nobody actually is, but the kind of store you stand in front of is not exactly the one people like being seen entering. Big, back-lit letters atop a brightly-painted sign spell out \"LEWD LIFE HENTAI AND DOUJIN.\"\n\nOf course, this is Japan, so places like these are fairly common. You've only lived in the country for a short while, but even to that extent it's not something you enjoy doing so often. But living in Japan has it's perks, and now you no longer have to find high-quality material from sketchy sites on the internet. Best of all, this shop is only minutes from your home; making trips there quite easy and somewhat discreet.\n\nIt was a small store, owned by a single man, the place catering mostly to otakus like yourself who had a bit of extra money to spend. They had games, novels, anime...but you were particularly interested in the doujin manga, of which there were shelves and shelves of content. Stepping into the store, you automatically made to your way to the hentai manga and perused the new collections, checking each and every genre for your favorite.\n\n............................................................................\n\n- Incest (Brother/Sister)\n\n*A popular genre even outside of Japan, depicting a brother and a sister having sex. They are usually blood-related. The dynamic between the two varies, the brother being older occasionally while other times the sister is older. Includes a lot of language like \"onii-chan\" or \"onee-chan.\"*\n\n- Incest (Mother/Son)\n\n*Another genre popular outside of just hentai, the Mother/Son doujin is comprised of just that: a mother having sex with her younger son. However, similar to Brother/Sister, the main characters are more often blood-relatives rather than step Mother/Son. The Mother is often chubby or very curvy, though this is not present in every case.*\n\n- Yaoi\n\n*The stereotypical guy-on-guy action. Typically, the sex is between two guys of similar builds; either muscular, or slimmer. Oftentimes is a major aspect of Trap/Crossdressing doujins.*\n\n- Yuri\n\n*The stereotypical girl-on-girl action. The main characters are usually friends, but could even be sisters as well. This genre also tends to include themes of \"turning straight girls gay\" and similar concepts, though they aren't required. Sex toys are sometimes included as well.*\n\n- Trap/Crossdressing\n\n*A genre where the male main character dresses or appears to be female/feminine. Usually a form of Yaoi, the main character's partner is often another male or a Futanari. Themes of femdom, humiliation, and similar are typically present here as well.*\n\n- Cosplay/Parody\n\n*One of the most popular genres, parodies make up the fan-created doujins using already-licensed characters usually from other successful anime or manga. Cosplay is the same concept, though usually the characters in the doujin are only dressed as outside anime/manga characters rather than actually being them.*\n\n- Femdom\n\n*The scenario where the female partner has more control over the male (or other female, by extension, if Yuri themes are included.) Gentle Femdom is usually from a Mother or Sister, and includes caring, sensual behavior. Harder Femdom includes pegging, themes of BDSM and humiliation, as well as domination and total control. The female character in this can be an older figure of authority, or simply someone the main character can't say no to.*\n\n- Schoolgirl/Dirty Old Man\n\n*While schoolgirls and their outfits make up a large percentage of popular doujins, they are often paired with the \"Dirty Old Man\" cliche. Fat, hairy, ugly, or even just undesirable men find a way to have sex with the female main character (typically through bribery, rape, blackmail, molestation, recording, threats, or other suspicious behavior.) The man can be a somewhat distant relative, but this is not required.*\n\n- Fantasy\n\n*A high-fantasy setting, which includes medieval themes as well as monsters, magic, and royalty. Elves and humanoid races occur frequently here as well. This setting can even exist inside a fantasy-like RPG Video Game, or possess elements based off of them.*\n\n- Catgirl\n\n*While it is more of a character style than a genre, Catgirls (or \"Nekomimi\") are human girls with certain cat-like features (typically ears, a tail, small fangs, etc.) They can be apart of almost any other genre, though they are usually the focus of that doujin.*\n\n- Childhood Friends\n\n*The relationship between two childhood friends who build up romantic affection over a long time, which eventually leads to a confession of sexual desires (almost always reciprocated well by the other character.)*\n\n- Futanari\n\n*A genre where some females posses male genitalia in addition to female genitalia, or occasionally only the former. They still keep a feminine, often voluptuous form, but instead use their male organs for sex anyway. Usually they are aggressive and top the main character, but this is not always the case and some prefer submissiveness.*\n\n- Public\n\n*The taboo of having sex in public, whether it be a park, public bathroom, market, or otherwise crowded place. Sometimes it is entirely obvious, which often coincides with themes of humiliation or exhibitionism. Other times it is in secret, or only done in short periods of time.*\n\n- Genderswap\n\n*A genre where a main character, for some reason or other changes their gender and experiences sex from the other gender's perspective. Typically it is male into female, but the reverse happens as well. Oftentimes the change is not done on purpose, and close friends will be trusted in order to \"help\" them and their new libido.*\n\n- Monstergirl\n\n*A niche category where humanoid, yet distinctly unique races of \"monsters\" live among people in the modern world. These often include Lamia (snake-women,) Harpies (bird-women) Slimes (amorphous gel-like humanoids) and Centaurs (horse-human hybrids.) There are many more monstergirls, ranging from Cyclops to Arachne, but the ones mentioned are the most popular. These characters are almost always exclusively female, and a \"Monsterboy\" is a rare occurrence.*\n\n- Otaku/NEET\n\n*Another character-specific cliche, this relates to a person who is considered to be a modern outcast, a lover of anime and manga and usually very introverted. They are almost always a virgin, and somehow end up having sex with people who are better looking than themselves (sometimes out of pity or even coercion.)*\n\n- Tentacles\n\n*Through some method, the main character (almost always a female) is molested or raped (most often against her will) by a large group of tendrils or tentacles. These differ as to origin, and can be from sea creatures, otherworldly monsters, or machines.*\n\n- Corruption/Mind Brek\n\n*Usually the taking of one's innocence, this theme is mostly present in non-consensual works. Over time, the main character's resistance is slowly eroded until they begin to enjoy the various kinky/immoral acts they are forced to go through.*\n\n- Suggestion\n\n*Have a suggestion for a genre? Just ask!*\n\n............................................................................\n\nUpon picking up the book you've decided to buy, you notice a strange, faint glow emitted from the pages within. Opening it slowly to investigate, the light grows to a blinding intensity and soon you're consumed by it; that is, until you open your eyes and realize that you've just been dropped into the Hentai Manga you were holding.\n\nAnd as the main character, no less.\n\n\n............................................................................\n\nAre you a fan of ecchi manga or hentai doujins? \n\nDo you own multiple anime collectibles, merchandise or figurines?\n\nDo you enjoy Japanese culture and understand the clich\u00e9s of the manga/anime genre?\n\nGreat! If you answered yes to any of these questions, then I guarantee we have enough in common to play! But here's the thing: *For as many hentai or ecchi doujins that exist, there are also a great deal of clear plotlines, cliches and stereotypes that go along with them.* Because of that fact, I've listed them above, and structured them as individual prompts. Then, all you've gotta do is choose one (though I absolutely don't mind combining prompt ideas!) and we'll discuss and play! I should mention that I don't have any issue playing opposite a male, female, futa, trap, whatever you are.\n\n(As a side-note, you will play the original person who entered the shop and was subsequently \"inserted\" into the story. Of course, you'll probably quickly adapt to your new role, but for the time being you were just a customer until this happened.)\n",

            "selftext": "We all knew it had to happen eventually. The end of the world. Doomsday. Gehenna, or Judgment Day if you are religious. As we look up at the stars, I think it's hard to realize that somewhere out there, so far away that we can't even really see it, our doom is coming for us, hurtling towards its final destination - and ours - with enough speed to rip our world in two. An asteroid - some fragment of a lost or doomed planet, torn asunder and sent barreling through space until, just a few hours from now... boom. And that, as they say, will be that.\n\nI suppose we had a good run of it, us humans. We built and created, sang and wrote and loved and lost, all within the scope of our desire-- until now that time has run out, and it all seems, in a sense, worthless. Death is the greatest equalizer of them all, and now that we are all set to die, it seems that a certain calm has descended upon the world. There's no more intrigues, no more politics. No one is complaining about animal cruelty or anti-vaxxers, or the looming threat of world war three. Those who are insane, or optimistic, or both, have sought out their bunkers and shelters, settling in for an eternal winter in the wake of the disaster. Others, mad with fear and grief, have decided to end it before the great collision, going alone or in groups to find whatever maker they believe in. But the rest of us...? We know there's no point in running. And there's no point in panic, either. Death will come for us, it will find us, and neither money nor power can change that. Twitter has gone silent. The internet has slowed to a crawl, and people.. people are doing what people do, I suppose. Celebrating life. Lamenting death. Or huddling up with their loved one, in the final hours.\n\nThere is no salvation.\n\nSo come, lover. Lie here next to me, on the hill beneath the twinkling stars. The air is warm and the grass is soft, and there is no one around but you and me. Put your head against my chest, and listen to my heart beat - a last fluttering hurrah before oblivion consumes it. Put your hand on my stomach, and trail it down to where my shirt stops and my skirt begins, down to tug at the hem of my panties, soft and silky against your fingertips. Brush your lips against my neck, and listen to the tiny, shivering sigh of pleasure that your warmth brings me. Feel my hand reach over to touch you, sliding smoothly across the folds of your clothing before finding and groping the core of your hardness, woefully concealed from my touch.\n\nTake off your pants, lover. And lay your head between my legs, while I gaze up at the stars. Maybe I will see it, before you lithe tongue forces my eyes closed with its pleasurable dance; that tiny, sparkling dot in the night sky that is growing imperceptibly larger as you grip my thighs and hike them up, spreading me against your mouth to release my fragrant juices onto your taste buds.\n\nCan you taste me, love? Can you hear my quiet moans?\n\nI don't want to die, really. But if I am to die, I want to face my death with dignity. I want to feel you climb between my legs, the skirt pulled off and discarded carelessly onto the rolling sea of green, and lift my legs against your shoulders. I want to reach up and pull you close to me as the girth of your manhood spreads me open, pushing and bucking until we are closer than any two people have ever been, and our breaths are both ragged and hard, a twin chorus of lust-filled gasps as the sky above us erupts into fire. I want to feel your body tremble against mine as you rock me gently on your cock, your face a mere silhouette against the flames above us, their incandescent glory reflected in my dark eyes as you lean in to kiss me, our arms wrapped around one another in a tight embrace.\n\nI want to put my legs around you and pull you into me. I want to taste myself on your tongue while my fingers rake thin, red lines down your back.\n\nI want to feel you cum in me. Please. Let your pleasure be the last thing I feel.\n\nClose together. Like we could take on anything.\n\nIt's only the end of the world, my love.\n\nPlease.\n\nCum for me.",

            "selftext": "There's a joke someone once told me, back when I first started out of film school, working on a commercial for a local business that closed soon after the job. An alchemist I think? Doesn't matter. Anyway, I cracked a joke about how this was the exact sort of art I took out loans to learn how to make. \n\nOne of the older sound guys just chuckled. \"Think of the worst TV show you've ever seen, the worst movie. Think of the thousands of hours of study, painstaking work, all the passion that must've gone into it, the life long dreams finally realized. And in the end, all it means is it'll be even harder to get another job.\" \n\nI learned a lot from that, that in the industry you need to treat every job like it's your last. Which, of course, is how I stomach working in the porn industry. \n\nI do lighting, primarily, but given the jerry rigged bullshit I sometimes see sometimes I help with mics, sometimes I help move furniture, hell I've parked the talent's cars for them on more than one occasion.\n\nThe studio I work for runs a small collection of websites that seem to be based around the primary gimmick of selling porn that doesn't look or sound like absolute trash? Softer, natural lighting. Actual locations instead of obvious sets. Directors that try to get *performances* out of the talent. And then, inevitably, the clothes come off and then you have to try to not be painfully uncomfortable whilst a cute, petite Elf girl gets double teamed by a pair of Orcs right in front of you.\n\nYeah. It turns out, cinematography that's not horrific isn't the only gimmick we use to sell porn to people.\n\nInterspecies porn just never seems to go out of style for some people, but being in the room and adjusting lights, to hear the moaning and watching in person, you can't help but wince until you finally are numb enough to it that it's simply mundane now. \n\nGuys will ask what the women are like, and really it's like any office job at this point, except here they're categorized as human, Orc, Elf, Halfing, if only for business reasons. They're usually polite, professional, patient as you adjust mic placement or lighting as they stand there wearing lingerie, checking social media feeds on their phones. At first you're embarrassed, avoiding eye contact, but then it just becomes an every day occurrence so you just ignore the gorgeous, half naked half-Orc and just try to get the job done so you can film them getting fucked by a six and a half foot tall Orc on an ottoman. \n\nSo that's the job. The money is better than you expect and I'll be honest, there are days where its a lot easier than doing commercials or independent films. Hell, they even had me as an extra in one scene when they were short a few bodies. \n\nSo I've got that going for me, which is nice. I wonder if being an extra in a video that turns into an Orc/Elf gangbang is something a major film studio would want you to keep off your resume.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nThis is what happens when you watch porn from Vixen or Blacked the same week you watch the Fellowship of the Ring. \n\nUnsure of what direction this would go? Maybe a performer geting involved with my crew member? Just playing out a few of the scenes being shot? Shoot me a message and we can brainstorm a bit.\n\n[Kink chart](https://imgur.com/fp0dF95?r)\n\nIf this post is still up I'm still interested.",

            "selftext": "I had been working for the company nearly 7 months the first time I took notice. It was subtle, you were good. Unless a person just happened to be staring at the right two seconds your hand went under your desk, nothing seemed amiss.  Unfortunately for you though, I was quite the observer. \n\nMy dad used to joke I was going to spend my life looking instead of doing. And honestly that had summed up my experience so far as I found myself in my mid-20s, on the outside of the glass looking in. I was a wall-flower, shy and quiet. Unsuspecting mostly. But you saw a lot of things when no one thought you were looking, when they looked past you.\n\nI sat and *observed* for months your habits. I must admit, you became my new little hobby. It wasn't the first time I had taken an interest in someone to such degree, just the longest time so far. You had a reputation as the \"nice boss\" and you were to your credit.  I worked two positions below you so our physical interaction was limited unfortunately. I was left to watch at my cubicle as other women of the company came and went in your office. I would study your face, your barely noticeable hand movement below and then their faces. They didn't have a clue. I think we both shared the thrill of that. They didn't know what you were doing but then you didn't know that I knew. It was a complicated amusement.\n\nI suppose most women would think you were a pervert. Playing with yourself in secret while they were just on the other side of your desk. You could get in a lot of trouble, certainly, but I wasn't going to tell and I knew you were smart enough or maybe just polite enough to never expose yourself. \n\nIt was nearly 3 months of watching when we had our first real interaction. My heart pounded when my supervisor told me I was to brief you on the project myself as he had to leave early. With a great deal of nerves, I knocked on your office door, awaiting your permission to enter. You greeted me with a smile and I waited until I saw your right hand move below the desk and then I smiled too. It was my turn and for once I didn't feel like looking outside the glass anymore. You had plagued my thoughts far too often these last few months.\n\nWith a small boost of confidence, report in hand, I move past the chair I was designated to sit on and instead walk behind your desk to stand by your side. I place the papers before you, leaning down to point out a section.\n\n\"I, uh, was hoping we could discuss this section. I thought maybe you had some tips ?\" \n\nI can tell my actions have caught you off guard. You weren't prepared for this. Your stumbling and awkward commitment to continuing only endears me more however. You don't have the time to stuff your cock back in your pants without being noticed. Not with me so close. With an elbow, I knock a pen off the desk.\n\n\"Oh! Sorry! I'll get it.\"\n\n\"No wait, you don't need to do that-\" \n\nBut it's too late, my position kneeling on the floor allows me the perfect view of your erection. I pause picking up the pen and look up to your face. You're flush, a mixture of embarrasment and worry plays out. I'm sure you think this is the end but no, it's only the beginning.\n\nI lean back, a glance at the office outside. Oblivious workers going about their day. I settled it then. Without missing a beat my head falls into your lap. You nearly jump up from the shock but compose yourself. I rest my head on your thigh and then with one hand trail my fingers lightly up and back down your throbbing cock. My touch delicate and filled with curioisity. It was different than I had imagined but magnificent all the same.\n\n\"You can't do this here!\" \n\nYou whisper with a strained voice. You were fighting with a fear of getting caught and the thrill of going further. I pay you no mind however, feeling content with my exploration. I could feel myself slipping into a relaxed state but there was one thing missing. \n\nI lift my head up, making eye contact again before slowly lowering my mouth over the tip of your dick. It was thick and a struggle to get my lips all the way around. That was just how I wanted it though. I scoot my knees in alligning them to get comfortable. I can hear you suck a deep breath in. I take one bob down the length of you when your phone going off stops my actions, bringing us both out of the trance.\n\n\"Oh. Hm. I guess that was the tip I needed. Thanks!\" \n\nLeaving you mouth open, I walk out of the office without looking back. *Well that was a fun morning*, I think to myself. \n\n*END*\n\nHi, my name is Mimi and I like playing weird (maybe even creepy) girls who are all at once suggestive and submissive and I have quite the thing for straight laced and proper men that are secret pervs. I like gaining the upper hand and topping from the bottom until you put me in my rightful place. I enjoy relationships that have weird begininngs. Okay so I tried to set up the environment well with this teaser. Show me what you got.\n\n\nKinks: romance, affection, gentle domination, spankings, kissing, oral, outercourse, anal, impreg, D/s, semi public",

True, she's... *okay, she's cute,* I've found myself thinking more than once, with her cheery cocked cap and the charming checkered apron, and that *smile,* the lovely little accent nipping at the corners of her words. \n\nIt had all been going well, but now... *this.*\n\nA stark threat to the very *core* of my business, printed out in ominous black lettering on the letterhead of the one organization that spells doom to the small snack-stall owner's very soul. \n\nThe *Health Inspectorate.*\n\nThere, in neat, fine print, words to make my blood curdle. *Latex gloves must be worn for all food handling.* I pride myself on *purity,* on the old ways of doing things perfected into the modern age, God damn it, of really feeling out the texture in my foodstuffs with my fingertips, of teasing out the flavor, and of having the good, common sense to *wash my hands.* Yet I could already feel the disdainful stares of my clientele, thinking of it - the sight of a glumly latex-clad businessman, morosely flipping over limp dogs into a sadly flaccid bun, with a few miserly squirts of relish. \n\nNot *my* fate. I've come too far, overcame even *her* threat, to resign myself to such an indignity.\n\nAnd so, when the sun dawned the next day, rebellion blazed anew in the sign above my shop. \n\n# Rebel Dogs \n\n# All natural, with only the hottest, richest and *freshest* of fillings.\n\nI can see the glimmering eyes of a curious public now, watching the elaborate signage revolve and beam its message of all-natural *freedom* across the square. Already, my first customer is practically singing my praises, and I can't help but grin across the way to my rival - the little line of flags, both good-old-fashioned red-white-and-blue and white cross on red alike, fluttering dispiritedly in the breeze.\n\n**Come one, come all**, the sign boasts, and I can feel it coming on now - with the health inspector herself's hair streaming messily from my hand, her skirt no longer quite the model of creased propriety, and my fingers firmly slid up beneath her shirt to grasp her hips and pull her back. My hands are free, unburdened by artificial trappings, and so *am I*. I can see the mustard smeared across her cheeks, the hot dog forgotten in the whirlwind of her order off the *other* menu, and then -\n\n*Then - !*\n\nA cry of luxurious pleasure peals across the square, and I give out a triumphant growl. True to my word, I can feel her fluttering around me, the wet *smack* of the inspector's buns on my hips, and the sudden, twitching *pulse* as I release inside her. Warm, rich, and *hot*, unfettered and untamed, great creamy spurts sluicing in thick pumps out into her, oozing lewdly out until, at last, her composure gives way. \n\nWith a *thump,* my nemesis from City Hall brings the stamp of approval down on my paperwork, just as she moans out her own release.\n\nBefore the echo even fades, I can see the bankers, the traders, the artists and the shopkeeps, all the businesswomen in town beginning to queue before me, drifting away from Sally's shack. Still, I can't help but feel a pang of mercy, and a touch of longing - for there, beneath the letters proclaiming pleasures both culinary and carnal *au naturale*, stands the placard: \n\n*Seeking a partner, for a cream-filled Danish.*\n\n---\n\nWhy would you want a luscious [pastry from across the street](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7yoqwj/f4m_sallys_cream_pie_emporium_because_hot_dogs/), when you could get the savory stuffing of a lifetime with your meat?  \n\n[DPP Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/5smcxm/m4f_snuggles_and_sex_or_just_snuggles_or_just_sex/)",

Having someone you've cared about for years upon years ask to own you forever, and then you realize once the engagement ring slips on, you can't go back. Court dates and shit.\n\nI'm engaged, not so happily. When your boyfriend proposes to you on live TV, especially the damn Super Bowl, where millions upon millions of people are watching? Yeah, you can't say no.\n\nI'm not in love with him. I'm just not. I care about him, I like him, but I'm in *love* with you. You've always been here for me when my man is boring or tired. Hell, I even hoped one day you would suggest being FWB, because my sex life is so dry.\n\nMy [auburn hair is all done up](https://hairmotive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/High-Ponytail-with-Auburn-Hair-Color.jpg) and my C breasts and small waist look amazing in my [wedding dress](https://image.dhgate.com/0x0/f2/albu/g5/M01/1B/7D/rBVaI1iZk_SAKrCyAAJ9fSutjdc156.jpg). It was the dream wedding I wanted.. just not with the right person at the altar. I'm getting psyched up by my maid of honor, but I just look bored.\n\nAs I'm walking down the aisle with my dad, I look over at you longingly. I had built this strong relationship with you, and now I had to walk away, walk up to the snooze fest of a husband I'm about to have. A sigh escapes my lips as I walk up the stairs.\n\nThe priest officiating says the normal stuff, then says \"Any objections..?\" And I look around, hoping someone would call it out.\n\n\nHiya! My name is Lia, and, as you've guessed, I want you to object! What happens after? I dont have a plan, I do things based on natural reactions. I'm more of a vanilla writer, but my kinks are being dominated, name calling, and public! I love being taken whenever and wherever you please, but all of this will come in when we're together. May be fast, may be slow, you decide! My hard limits are scat and gore. Thank you so much for reading! And dont be afraid to contact me about another prompt!",

            "selftext": "//This is an ad you read on a website//\n\nMy life sucks! Ugh! I'm a huge slut but people refuse to take me seriously! I'm young, 18 years old, and very petite, I'm 147 cm and 38 kg, I'm fit and people say my face is extremely cute and sweet, so, everytime I act sexually aggressive like a proper slut should, guys almost laugh at me saying I don't fit the type and they act nice to me. And fuck, I hate it! I would love to be treated like garbage and used like the cheapest whore for once! I can take it, I swear! I love cock, and cum. Gee! I *love* cum! I can scoop it all up from the floor with my tongue just to taste all yout sticky yummy milk. And you can treat me as bad as you want! You can spit on me, kick me and slap me silly! It turns me on, I give you my word, but guys never want to do it! They are worried they will hurt me too much, they say I'm too small and look so delicate! Fuuuuuck! It makes me so sad sometimes I start crying thinking about all the slaps and rough sex I'm missing out on... and I deserve it! I swear, I'm a good girl, I always give my best! I love to give pleasure and I'm very good at it... I can suck and ride cocks for hours, milking all the cum out with my extremely tight pussy and I'm very good with my hands, yeha, I give good massages too, and I love to use my mouth and tongue, and you can facefuck me till I pass out! I mean, I trained my throat *a lot* and now I basically have zero gag reflex! Fucking Z-E-R-O, I mean it, my dentist noticed that too! But it's not enough to be a real slut, apparently! If a girl looks like me nothing is ever enough! Seriously, I can bust your nuts in every possible way but... well, actually, not every possible way, and this is the real point of this message: My asshole is virgin and I want you to fix it... well... kinda the opposite actually.\n\nI think that maybe if I was an ass slut people would start taking me seriously, but no guy wants to break my asshole! I was 16 the first time I begged my ex boyfriend to fuck it, and he tried, but I'm so small, and my asshole is *reeeally* tiny, and I was in incredible pain while he was trying to go in, shivering and crying, but I really wanted to become an ass slut, and kept begging him to break it, but he stopped! He said he didn't want to hurt me like that. The same exact thing happened with a dear friend of mine when I asked him to break my asshole. Now I have a new boyfriend... I thought he loved me enough to make this sacrifice for me... to break my asshole and make me happy, making me a whole real slut. But no. Guys can't see me ''suffering'' like that, they say. So then have me crying here like a fake half slut with her asshole untouched! Damn... I have no problem with pain, I even like it, but they don't believe me. I think that's the problem here, if I was able to milk a cock with my asshole smiling like a good slut should, people would take me seriously, right? This is my last hope... please, help me: I offer 100\u20ac (or equivalent) to the guy who will destroy my asshole.\n\nI understood guy hate it, and I know this is a lot to ask... but please, I really need it. I'm looking for someone willing to ignore my pain and tears and who will go on fucking my asshole till it's damaged beyond repair. It's okay if your cock is big, I suppose... the bigger the damage the better the results. I'm begging you to have no mercy, I know it's not easy, with all this fucking stuff of *respect women* and blablabla. Actually, is there a fucking real mysogynist out there? They talk about all this misogyny but I can't find any! Anyway... I hope 100$ is enough... we can talk about it... and as I said I'm very cute: [This is me](http://ilarge.lisimg.com/image/7263498/1118full-iana-little.jpg)... please don't start thinking I look too sweet and delicate for this... and if you help me destroying my asshole I'll be happy to help you too with what you wish... as I said I am a huge slut and I have no limits, I swear! I will make this worth your while, I will do whatever you want in return of you stretching my asshole no matter how much I suffer and cry, actually, if I could find someone who actually enjoys it it would be a dream...\n\nIf you are interested you can message me on whatsapp at [phone number]\n\nThank you in advance...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is kinda different from my usual prompts... but not that much. I like the idea of playing a petite girl who ended up really believing that she has to pay to find a man who would really treat her like the cheapest skunk, using her for his total and only pleasure. I think this prompt could look pretty generic and arouse *a lot* of men, but I would actually like to play with someone who likes the idea to take full advantage of such an occasion, using and exploiting a naive and insecure girl as much as he can.\n\nSo I would like if you message me as if you you were replying to the ad I wrote in the prompt. I'm looking to play simultaneously, I don't love long messages, I know I wrote a lot here, but I usually prefer medium length or even short messages (Not two single sentences tho.), I like to play back and forth more than waiting and letting you wait for novels.\n\nDon't write me something like ''You don't need to pay for this'', please, giving you money is a big part of this fantasy, I love the idea that you both live a wonderful experience that allow to cum and have fun like never before and take my money, so I would prefer if you tried to take even more money out of this. I'm totally into dirty talk and I love being called the worst names. I love to be mistreated, I'm into humiliation and pain (there's an huge emphasis on painal in this prompt of course), I almost have no limit, so don't worry (scat is the only one, but I love giving rimjobs, taking spits on my body and mouth, pissing, licking filthy stuff, and other disgusting things, yet none of this is something I'm asking for if you don't like it.). I don't like bondage, at all, I like to be active, I really love to serve.\n\nIf you want to know more about who I am what I like and don't [you can read my profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/7ccmwu/who_i_am_24_f4a_luxury_toy_for_demanding_people/)\n\nxoxo",

            "selftext": "Modern society claims to be feminist, pro-woman, and empowering, yet if a woman chooses to be more passive and submissive in her relationships with men, she is either seen as a slut, oppressed, or unenlightened, even when she is the one making the consensual choice to live in that state.\n\n\n\nIronically, the women making these choices are either more conservative, or are hearkening to the values of a previous by-gone generation.  It is simply how I was raised. At heart I enjoy caring for and pleasing others, sometimes that means doing something extra for someone, cooking a meal, going out of my way to be the devoted servant, whether in day to day life or sexually.\n\n\n\nI once heard a joke that to make a man happy, all a woman has to do is know how to cook, sew, and suck. Once you get past the stereotypical sexism of that statement, you uncover a little nugget of truth. What man doesn't appreciate the effort a woman goes into procuring a delicious home cooked meal from him.  The difference between dining at home and at a restaurant is quite honestly the love put into the meal. And while sewing is a handy talent, it's more symoblic of the home-making nature of the classic woman. Someone who can can help with the things around the home while the man works and strives to provide for his family.  It is not a matter of dumping responsibilities on the woman while the man sits by idly doing nothing; it's about an allocation of responsibility. The woman cooks and sews so the man doesn't have to; and the man works a long work week so the woman doesn't have to. It's a perfect harmonic balance.\n\n\n\nAnd I honestly believe the quip about sucking. Any man can bend his wife over the kitchen table and fuck her. The only requirements there are that she is willing and has a vagina. Other than that, she can just take it and doesn't need to put as much effort into it. Whereas sucking is a profound display of a woman's talent, devotion, and affection for her partner. Any woman can take a man into her mouth, but only a truly devoted girl can give great pleasure with it.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing quite like sinking to my knees in front of a guy who has his cock out and the expression on his face as he realizes I am about to suck him. How he reacts to every kiss and lick as I begin to tease him softly, how he gasps as I part my lips and slide him into my mouth, letting his cockhead trail over the moist caress of my tongue and rub against the coarse roof of my mouth. I begin to bob and his breathing synchronizes with my motions; and when I glance up shyly to check on him, the eye contact between us in that moment is unparalleled. Even eye contact during sex doesn't come anywhere as close and intimate as eye contact during a blowjob.\n\nThis eye contact speaks unfathomably of her love and devotion. It shows her willingness to pleasure her partner at the expense of her own pleasure; choosing to use her mouth and lips to give pleasure rather than asking to have intercourse. It might seem petty, but choosing to suck rather than fuck signifies a beautiful submission on a woman's part: to give pleasure rather than receive.  I love the idea of being a benevolent sex slave to a man; and it becomes a blowjob-only-relationship where he gets to use my mouth and throat and I do not receive any pleasure except for masturbating.\n\nIt would be the ultimate marriage: so long as he loved me, I would surrender myself and offer my mouth as a vessel for his pleasure.\n\nPrivate message me if you would like to chat and roleplay this type of submission housewife scenario. We could do a scene set in a 1950's suburban setting, perhaps a modern era, or even a futuristic sci-fi scenario where you rescue me from slavery and I pledge my life to you as a wife and sexual-servant.\n",

            "selftext": "Hey hey hey! i am looking for a like-minded individual to do a Warhammer 40k rp with. This rp will be 18+ for sexual content as well as descriptions of violence (its 40k guys come on lol). So at about this point you are probably asking 'what will the roles be?' well that is up to debate! (yay for indecision) the only set role is that i will be a female and part of the Imperium. Now who will you be? anyone you want! you could be a Ork! you could be an Elder! you could be a daemon of chaos! just know that i am very creative and very kinky, tbh i am burning to do an rp where i play as a sister of battle who is corrupted by chaos, and when i say chaos it can be any God! (bonus points if you can make a conversion to Nurgle sexy lol) however i realize that some might not be ups for that thus i am leaving this mostly open ended. As for violence i am toatlly cool with it and the more creative the violence the better! in the kink department i like to think i am on the level that would make the average Slaaneshi blush so keep that in mind;) but if you need it spelled out, bdsm, rough fucking, anal, bodily fluids, tattoos, piercings, object insertion, objectification, body writing, food play, to name a few. If you are interested drop your kik name or pm me and we can RP over messages!",

            "selftext": "And, honestly, I don't blame her. \n\nWe're six years apart in age. I'm a senior in high school now, 18 years old and a \"proper woman,\" while she's 24, with a job, her own apartment, and a boyfriend to call her own. Despite this difference in age, though, I'm much more womanly than she could ever hope to be. \n\nEven when I was young, and puberty was just starting to change my body, I quickly grew breasts bigger than hers, and my hips and bottom filled up, giving me a womanly figure. She was so supportive at first, helping me find proper bras and warning me about boys. By breasts kept growing, though, as did my beautifully plump bottom, and it didn't take long for boys to start paying attention to me - including boys my sister's age. Though she didn't show it, that infuriated her. She was always trying to find ways to stand out. \n\nShe started buying expensive makeup, turning her face into a work of art. I picked up on it quickly, though, and with my naturally plump lips and high, arcing cheekbones I could slap some cheap, convenience store makeup on and still turn heads. \n\nRealizing that wouldn't work, she then turned to wearing increasingly slutty outfits, showing off what meager curves she had. I turned my sights to fashion after that, learning that I just had to wear anything marginally tight and the boys would come running. \n\nFinally, with the popularity of instagram models, she turned to the gym, hoping squats would thicken her flat ass and that a toned stomach would help attract boys. Going to the gym helped, of course, but all that work also had the effect of shrinking her already small breasts. I decided to go to the gym, too, and made twice as much progress as she did in a quarter of the time. My thick ass got even thicker, I developed an impressive six-pack, and my breasts somehow remained the same size. \n\nShe thought that, after graduating, she could cut off all ties with me and simply not think of me at all. That worked, for a while, but now I'm going over to her apartment for dinner. She protested, naturally, but our parents insisted that she host me at least for one night so that we could catch up. I hear her boyfriend is going to be there, too, which is why I'm in such a slinky, revealing dress \nand have such stunning makeup on to what should just be a reunion between two sisters. \n\nI knock on the door to her apartment, a playful smirk on my face. \n\n----\n\n(Men - you'd play as the hapless boyfriend, who I seduce away from my sister. Women - you'd play as my older sister, trying as hard as you can to prevent me from stealing your boyfriend away). ",

Regarding how you treat your pet, what kind of pet you treat me as, honestly that's all up to you but I'll suggest some basic ground rules. Of course, I'm just a subhuman pet, you're probably not sure if I even have a functioning brain or not so, you can choose to listen to these at your own discretion...\n\nThe Rules:\n\n* I'm never clothed unless you specifically tell me to wear something, or force me to wear something.\n\n* I'm to crawl on my hands and knees unless told otherwise by you or another superior.\n\n* I'm not to sleep on a bed like a regular human.\n\n* I'm not to be fed on a table like a regular human, rather to be fed and watered from bowls on the floor unless expressly allowed otherwise.\n\n* I'm not to disobey my superior, whether it be through rebellion or mere incompetence I will be punished for not doing as I was asked.\n\n* I'm not to use the toilet as a regular human.\n\n* I'm not to leave the house without permission from a superior.\n\n* I'm not to be without a leash unless unless a superior deems it appropriate.\n\nLike I said these rules are kind of take-or-leave, you could add more, remove some, make a set of totally new ones. I mean whatever, I'm the inferior one here, why are you even listening to me?\n\nJust to be clear about what I want here, I really want to feel inferior. If you make me feel inferior I will do whatever you want, I mean if you want someone to drink your piss from a bowl while a horse fucks her in the ass, I'm your girl. Or... Maybe something more normal, whatever you want, I can deliver if only you'll make me feel like a subhuman piece of stupid filth. \n\nSo what is it that you want? This could be noncon, or purely consensual as a submissive. I'm very kinky.\n\nMy only limits are scat and extreme underage. Otherwise, we're all go. I'll fuck a horse, a dog, I'll drink your piss, I'll lick my own piss from the floor... I'd take however many cocks you'd want me to take however often you'd like me to take them, wherever you'd like me to take them. Let's get kinky!",

            "selftext": "Your ship has been OOA (Out of Atmosphere) for less than a day and already you've found a problem. Your order called for eighty crates of nutri-packs for one of the outlying Seed Colonies, but according to scans of the cargo bay, there's an organic lifesign lurking in there. Rats eating through things is a problem even in the depths of space, and as such you decide to go check it out.\n\nThe problem crate is immediately obvious; a five foot cube tipped onto a side that leaves the 'this way up' arrows facing the far wall of the bay. It appears to have been improperly fastened; further investigation proves this theory accurate in every way as the magnetic clamp meant to attach it to the floor is deactivated. \n\nYou approach the crate and crouch down by its lid, hitting the fastening seal and hearing the dull clank as it cracks open. You have no idea what might come out; rats, void-worms, maybe even a musgrave or some other pest.\n\nThen the lid falls open and you are staring into a pair of eyes; one a teary ice blue, and the other a fragmented circle of glass perhaps once green. It whirs and grinds before sparking, and the owner of the eye cries out a weak sob of pain before clasping one hand over the offending eye. That hand is a skeletal facsimile made of steel, you realize, the whole arm up to the elbow is. The same goes for her (as the stranger is a woman) left leg, a crude steel prosthetic that makes a grinding sound is it pushes her back, deeper into the crate.\n\nShe has her flesh arm covering her breasts, which upon closer inspection are of impressive size but also bizzare colouration; it takes a moment to realize they are marred by what look to be bruises and welts from blows with various tools of punishment. The arm is much the same, and though her stomach is partially hidden by her curled up posture it is obvious it too is wounded.\n\n\"Sorry...\" the broken thing before you gasps, her voice weak and strained, scarlet hair falling over her face as she bows her head submissively. \"She is... she is sorry.\"\n\n**KINKS: Gentle Dominants, Romance, Kindness, Spanking, Soft and Gentle Anal, Light Bondage, Oral (Giving), People Who Want To Put Me Back Together**\n\n**LIMITS: Cruelty, Whipping, Scat, Vomit**\n",

I mostly just want to chat with someone, but maybe roleplay. My kinks are honestly anything rough, or where I have no control. I love gangbangs, rape, abuse, bondage, torture, humiliation, truly there is nothing that is too much for me, the worse the better. I can't wait to talk to you all, and hopefully have someone destroy me!!!\n\n(No matter how late you see this, please still message me!!! And, I'm sorry if I take a while to respond.)",

            "selftext": "*Sarcasm aside, I'm mostly into two aspects of this particular fantasy:*\n\n1. *The slutty-moan worthy attraction of primal fucking.*\n\n2. *The fun power-reversal dynamics of being owned by an animal.*\n\n3. ... *Fuck it, knots are pretty hot too...*\n\n*Anyway, without further dallying, the prompt:*\n\n---\n\nNo one at work knows who I am. Not really. To them, I'm just the skinny, introverted, effette intern who does the photocopying and makes sure a pot of coffee's always on the boil. Most of them assume that I'm gay - I'm bi, actually, but my history of hetero behaviour is so minute I don't care to correct them - but if they knew who my current boyfriend was... Well, I wouldn't have a job anymore, that much is certain.\n\nNow, for some people, getting fucked by a dog is something they meticulously plan: they fantasize, they pick a breed, they make the purchase, they figure out how to get mounted and bam: they're a dog-fucker. Me, on the other hand, I kind of... Fell into it. \n\nTo be honest, I didn't even really want a dog.\n\nI first met you about a year ago: I was in college at the time, and I'd made a friend in one of my elective classes (it would be funny if it was Zoology, but nah: Pre-Columbian History of the Americas). It was your standard casual friendship: we hung out, played video games, smoked a joint or two and watched Adventure Time. Usually in that order.\n\nYou, of course, were his dog. Almost two hundred pounds of hard animal muscle, and a rather keen interest in humping my legs. I objected of course: frankly, getting humped by a horny mutt was the last thing on my mind (blowing your owner was more the order of the day, but alas: straight), and I could tell by the lump against my jeans leg that you were most certainly *not* neutered.\n\nHowever, your owner was far from concerned. \"Happens all the time,\" he said, as if I wasn't getting shin-raped by a hellhound. \"Dude, you *cannot* get him off once he's started rutting. Best just to ride it out.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I was far from impressed.\n\nTwelve minutes, a pair of ruined jeans and three lost 1v1 rounds of Call of Duty later, you were idly licking your cock clean, and I was adamantly *insisting* on a new pair of jeans to go home in.\n\nI revisited on a few more occasions - not the best idea, I know, but your owner was hot, I was horny, and I am *disgustingly* bad at choosing sexual partners. I had the foresight to switch from jeans to shorts, and so washing off your cum became just a matter of sticking my leg into the shower. *Clearly* the start of a whirlwind romance.\n\nCome the end of my degree, I came to learn that your owner was moving out of town... And that you wouldn't be coming with him. \"Come on, man,\" he pleaded. \"It's either you or the pound, and you know what'll happen then. Besides, he *likes* you.\" Part of me wanted to tell him to fuck off, but a larger, hornier part of my brain thought I might be able to cash in a favor of this size for a casual, no-homo, experimental friend-BJ.\n\nNo such luck, but that afternoon I brought you back to my apartment. The humping continued over the next couple of months, my sexual frustration only ramped up during that time and, well, one thing lead to another...\n\nAbout a year later, and my apartment's changed radically. For one, most of the furniture's gone: I wouldn't *dare* have guests over with you around, and I figured I was better off selling my useless assets and putting the money in some long-term investments. After all, I have to plan for life *after* being a dog's bitch. \n\nI strip out of my dress shirt and slacks almost immediately, replacing my tie with a thick leather collar. There's a stainless steel loop in the front to clip a leash to, which you're more than happy to tug on when I'm in one of my *kinkier* moods. Well, kinkier than *just* getting fucked by a dog, but I digress.\n\nI keep all my clothes in the entryway closet. The bedroom's your domain, and it's oddly therapeutic to leave my identity at the threshold. In here, I'm yours, and everything else is a secondary concern at best.\n\nI don't stay completely naked, however. I tug a pair of rainbow-striped thigh highs up my smooth, toned legs. I like feeling faggy when I'm fucked: sue me. The rest of my body is thin, but well-cared for, with a firm, shapely posterior jutting out behind me. As weird as it might seem, you've become the reason I stay in shape. I like feeling like a capable fucktoy, and you seem to enjoy it when I come to you all sweaty after hopping off the elliptical in the living room. I think I might actually be the healthiest I've ever been.\n\nAnd with that, I get on my hands and knees, my ass cheeks spreading open as I start to crawl. My asshole is pink and distended in contrast to my smooth, pale skin: you've been shoving your knot inside me for almost a year now, and it shows. It's been four months since I've needed lube. You've essentially turned my ass into your personal cunt.\n\nI've gotten good at getting around on all fours. I've read up a bit on canine psychology since you moved in, and from what I gathered, walking on two feet might be seen as a challenge to your dominance. I'm not afraid of conflict, per se: I'm the apex predator with two opposable thumbs, after all. However, I *like* you dominant, and anything I can do to assert your position as the head of the household gets me off all the better.\n\nI find you in the bedroom, lazing on our mattress as the sun shines in through a skylight. One time, that skylight was embroiled in a close call involving poor communication with my landlord and an unexpected roofing job, but right now it merely serves as an ideal source of sunlight in an apartment with *lots* of drawn blinds. \n\nThe mattress sits directly on the floor - a bed frame is just another disposable asset, and ease of access became kind of necessary once our living arrangement became clear. Save for a fitted sheet and an oft-humped pillow, our bed is bare: stained with cum and stale sweat, and coated in stray hairs. A comforter isn't necessary: your body is *plenty* warm, and I tend to keep the heat ramped up so that I don't freeze to death while crawling around like a naked bitch.\n\nOur eyes meet as I hop onto the mattress, laying down next to you in the sunlight, feeling your fur against my smooth skin. I'm hard as a rock, of course, but we both know I won't be putting it to use. Instead, I wait for you to take the lead, longing to be made yours again...\n\n---\n\n*Sometimes a fantasy gets out of control. This is one of those cases where a stray thought turned into a novella. The set-up here kind of leads to a period where I'm already your willing and eager bitch, but I'd happily also play out our initial meeting, or a time not long after you've moved in with me.*\n\n*I'm also open to incorporating a third, human character (male or female) that gets off on my living situation, with possible blackmail involved. That said, I'd prefer the story's focus stay with myself and my canine lover.*\n\n*So, if you're down to be my Doggy Dom, holler at me! Some of the my kinks include humiliation, oral, anal, crossdressing, casual/routine penetration, huge creampies, sweat and poor hygiene (no scat, though), reverse petplay, risky/public sex and servitude.*\n\n*So, umm, be my dog and fuck me? ^^It's ^^so ^^fucking ^^weird ^^typing ^^that ^^out...*\n\n*Edit: Please try and be creative, or at the very least informative in your reply. One-liners are... Less than ideal.*",

You couldn't live at home, and you guys didn't have enough to pay for a dorm. Luckily, you caught a very lucky break. A friend of yours had moved near that area, and after a bit of convincing, his parents allowed you to stay in the spare room they had, for free. You couldn't believe it, you packed your bags, and made the trip up. \n\nUpon arriving, you're greeted by your friend, and his parents. You had called them earlier, but it was nice to see them in person. Then you met Sharon, his younger sister. She was beautiful, had perky B cups and an ass that was absolutely magnificent. But whatever, she was off limits, besides, you'd meet plenty of college girls in a couple of months.\n\nFast forward a couple of months, and man. College is hard. You thought you'd be able to go to parties and hang out with people, but you promised your parents you'd make good use of their money. You had to spend so much time at the house studying and doing homework. Your friend also went to college and his parents worked, the person you saw the most was Sharon. The more you saw her, the more attractive she seemed to get. And there was even a bit of flirty exchanges here and there. But you couldn't do it. Your friend would try to kick your ass (even though you could probably kick his), but his parents would almost certainly kick you out of the house. It's not going to happen. Not unless she makes advances on you...\n\n(Please be ok with impreg! That's my favorite kink. I'll probably be willing to include your favorite kink in return! Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello, DPP! First time poster here (but not a first time roleplayer)!\n\nI'm hoping to find a partner here to roleplay a strange fantasy I've had for some time... I've never admitted it to anyone, but this is what this sub is for, right?\n\nI'm into guys that don't last long. The idea of a surprise early finish, the look of embarrassment on his face, and the subsequent training to get him to last longer... Let's say that drives me nuts.\n\nIn this RP, I'd like to play as your psychologist. You've finally decide to solve your issue by coming to therapy. However, it is hard to admit that you are unable to last, isn't it? It doesn't help that you are shy, and that your therapist is [smoking hot](https://i.imgur.com/16yKx3h.jpg).\n\nExpect awkwardness involved. My character will be slightly dominant, as I'll be the one helping you to last longer. I like shy guys, and I may throw in a little dirty-talking and teasing about your condition, nothing you won't endure.\n\nI'm hoping for a medium-term RP, with buildup involved. Things are more fun if we don't jump straight into the action. I'm all for sensual, tense exchanges with no actual sex involved, just teasing.\n\nI'd like to include mild ageplay (the therapist will be 26-27, and your character 18-22), early finishes (duh), creampies, lots of oral, clothed sex, awkwardness, and squirting. If you have any favourite kinks tell me about them (and limits, if you have them)! My limits are blood, extreme pain, vore, and anything that belongs in the toilet.\n\nBonus points if you are willing to play sexually inexperienced characters. As I've mentioned above, I'm hoping for buildup, so do not message me if all you're looking for is getting straight to the sex scenes. Also, be literate, and don't jump into the action, tell me a little about yourself before we begin.\n\nLooking forward to your messages!",

I'm reasonably attractive, high libido, and give good 'word.' ;)  I'm a switch, so depending on how we relate, you could end up on top or bottom. \n\nI'm mostly straight in real life but have both experience and attraction for women, so both men and women are welcome!\n\nI'm all warmed up with no place to go!

            "selftext": "I walk through the halls of my own personal kennel, smiling at the sounds of puppies and petboys. Barking, straining at their leashes, humping the floor frantically in their chastity cages. All begging for the attention of their Mistress.\n\nEach cell is fairly small, very like a kennel, but for submissive human boypets. Cement marks each one with metal grilles in the front, with space at the bottom to shove in dog-bowls of food and water. I have a few \"human pets\" with a little bit more authority taking care of the dogs for me; a Mistress should not have to get her hands dirty unless she so desires. The human pets wear chastity cages too, and though their hands are free, unlike the dogs, they know the price of disobedience. Some of those chastity cages are soldered on. Permanently.\n\nBut my puppies are my pride. I go over to one of the cages and unlock it, smiling down at the lucky boy inside. \"Who's a lucky boy today??\" I ask, grinning as you bark and pant, sticking your tongue out. So well trained. \"That's right darling! Out we go!\" I let you out into the hallway and hold up my hand, saying a command. We go through \"Up\" \"roll over\" \"lick\" and \"paw\", until finally I have you lay on your back in stocks soldered to the cement floor. Once your hands and feet are bound, I finally, slowly, painfully slowly, I remove your chastity cage. I smile and start to gently rub you with my gloved hand, grinning as you howl.\n\n\"There's my good boy...there's my good sweet puppy...\" once I see you are about to cum I stop, and snap my fingers. One of the human pets brings over ice and packs your dick in the ice until you're flaccid enough to cage again; I kiss your whimpering cheek, leaving a hint of my lipstick there.\n\n\"Good boy,\" I murmur in your ear. \"You were so good for Mistress today. Maybe I'll let you cum at Christmas.\"\n\nI lead you back to your cell, smiling at your sweet whimpers, and move to the next puppy. I sit on a chair and make him hump my boot without using his hands, over and over, grinning as he gets close. I ask him if he wants to beg in \"people words\" and he agrees. \"Oh please Mistress oh god Mistress you haven't let me c-cum for two years oh god please....\" I smile and pat his cheek.\n\n\"No. Good boy. Good begging. Mistress is very pleased. Back in your cage.\"\n\nEach puppy gets individual attention from Mistress, and each puppy gets denied orgasm until all of my lovely dogs are back in their cages, with their chew-toys and their ropes, hands in leather mitts, chastity cages on. I stand in the middle of the kennels and clap my hands once for attention.\n\n\"Who wants to lick Mistress to orgasm?\" I call out, and grin at the resulting din. It's always good to spend time with your pets.\n\n-----------------\n\n(I would like to play out this scenario in a multitude of ways. Who would you like to be in my kennel? Would you like to be one of the human slaves, who takes care of the dogs, and fixes me a drink when I get home, and massages my feet? Would you like to be one of my puppies? Do you want to be the puppy that learns tricks? The puppy who humps my boot? The puppy who is in disgrace and isn't allowed even out of his cell to play with Mistress, or the puppy I make an example of and discipline in front of everyone? Would you like to be the lucky puppy who I pick to lick me to orgasm and cuddle with me on the couch upstairs in the nice warm living room (it's cool in the kennel on your naked skin, I'm sure) and watch a movie for a night? Such a lucky puppy, getting cuddle time with Mistress Sarah!\n\nMessage me with your age and who you'd like to be in the roleplay, just go ahead and start out as the person you'd want to be and we'll take it from there! :D Also include specific things you'd like to include - specific teases and torments you'd enjoy or deserve as a good or a bad puppy? :D)\n\nImportant note that today I am looking especially for *good* boys. I want good boys who want to please me, someone I can take out of the kennel and up to the manor-house with me to cuddle with and serve me and lick me. A lot. I'm really very nice and I'm not particularly looking to punish anyone today. I want good boys. &lt;3 \n\nYour responses must include you starting the roleplay; I've written quite a lot above and I want you to show me what you can do. I expect at least four sentences, and preferably more, in your starter. Thanks!",

My hair is light brown with highlights and my skin is flawless. I stand at 5'5 with a set of B cup breasts and a modest ass. My legs are my best asset.\n\nAs if my body didn\u2019t turn heads already, what I wear and how on point my make up is keeps them looking my way. I can\u2019t blame them, especially when I sway my hips in my tight clothes that hug my body tightly. Even in casual outfits like leggings and tank tops can get the fire going in the biggest of prudes. \n\nIt just drives you wild. You can\u2019t stop thinking about me and how good my pissy must feel wrapped around your cock. You\u2019ve seen me dance with my sorority and all you want is to see me dance on a pole for you while I peel off each piece of my slutty outfit. \n\nWho you are is something I want to leave to you. I like a personal touch in my partner, it just feels more real and fun. \n\nYou can be my boyfriend\u2019s roommate or best friend. Just seeing me with him makes your blood boil because you know you can fuck me much better. \n\nMaybe an underclassmen who lives in the same building. You can try your luck with me if you\u2019re brave enough. Maybe try to sneak in and steal a pair of panties?\n\nAnything goes. \n\nMy kinks are raceplay, cheating, dirty talk, gangbangs, and rough sex. \n\nLimits are gore and violence. No scat either. \n\nI hope that we can both drive the story forward. I don\u2019t want to always be taking the lead. It wouldn\u2019t be fun that way. \n\nHope to hear from you all ",

Alcohol flowing and music pumping, you're having the time of your life when your best friend sets a hand on your shoulder and leans in, telling you your birthday present is in the guest bedroom. There's a hint of mischief in his eyes and curiosity gets the better of you so you slip out of the crowd and make your way up to the dark and quiet second floor of the house. You walk down the corridor and reach the room at the end, turning the handle and stepping inside. You were expecting to find a neatly wrapped present, or at least a six pack with a bow on it and instead find me sprawled across the bed- ankles and wrists cuffed to the bedposts, blindfolded, and red ball gag glistening with drool. My naked body squirms against the restraints as I hear the door open, brightly colored bows cover my nipples and cunt.

Someone consistently criticizing and making fun. I want someone that feels genuinely happy when I cry. \n\nI want someone that truly sees me as worthless. I don\u2019t want my well-being or aspirations holding any value. I\u2019m trash.

            "selftext": "So here's the thing, I love sucking dick.\n\nWell, sucking dick might be a little bit of an understatement. Getting my throat mercilessly fucked with reckless abandon like I'm some cheap worthless slut regardless of social conventions, where I am, who I am with, while also disregarding my well-being and my gag reflex is more like it.\n\nSo I had an idea, why not roleplay a scenario where I can get called out and skullfucked like the helpless teasing slut I am. You don't even have to know my name or who I am in the scenario, I can be any random needy slut you just felt like throat-fucking for no reason whatsoever other than to see how my eyes water and my throat bulges whenever you ram your fat cock past the barrier on the back of my throat.\n\nAny reason to stuff my throat with cock works, no matter how nonsensical or out there it is. Be it lust, anger, frustration, the need to humiliate me in front of whoever I'm with, or just out of curiosity of what I look like when splattered with a thick, slimy coat of spit (both mine from gagging on your thick angry cock, and yours from you spitting on my face of course), ruined makeup, tears, cum. And don't forget to slap me around while you're at it: don't limit yourself to spanking my ass, I want my face and tits slapped around and manhandled too.\n\nThat's why I'm posting here.\n\nPM me a message with your roleplay idea along with your kik user and I'll message you if I like it. Doesn't have to be a long message, a short synopsis will do.\n\nDO NOT FORGET YOUR KIK FOR FUCK'S SAKE\n\nThe RP can be based on a real-life situation, or based on any movie / TV Series / Videogame universe (I'm kind of a geek so try me). As long as I get to gag on your massive cock until my eyes roll to the back of my skull, and I get my pierced tits fucked and slapped, I'm golden.\n\nI'm 1.62 meters tall, hazel eyes, dark blonde hair, athletic build with a nice 34C rack and a round ass that goes along well with my toned thighs. Small waist, wide hips and supple cock-sucking lips.\n\nI've got a strong penchant for eventually ending up on my knees, tits out in the wind, gagging on some fat dick lodged deep halfway down my throat, face and tits caked in a sticky mess of spit, cum, ruined makeup and slap marks.\n\nI'm truly just a nice pair of tits and warm throat waiting to be fucked by anyone who figures out the kind of cock hungry whore I am, the kind that will drop down to its knees and open wide without a second thought as long as there's a fat cock to make her eyes water and her throat tense up.\n\nIt really doesn't matter whose cock it is as long as it makes my eyes roll to the back of my skull as it repeatedly hammers my gag reflex into submission.\n\nCall me names, spit on my face and mouth, slap my tits and face, throat me and drop a thick load right on my spit plastered face, on my tits or straight down my throat with some balls deep facefucking action. I can take it all and then some more.\n\nNot that you should care If I can, you wanna cum down my throat? You do it, without asking. It's not like I have any choice in the matter, I'll always be willing anyways.\n\nHere are some random facts about me and things that I like, in case you need some extra material to come up with a good rp (or in case you just want to jack off while reading this, which also works for me lol)\n\nNone of these are obligatory, so there's no need to include any of them in your rp idea.\n\n1) Public degradation &amp; free use (Incredibly hot, but not necessary)\n\n2) Social media. Feel like showing your buddies how the new cumdumpster you just met blows cum and spit bubbles out of her nostrils? Feel free to take a few pictures or seconds of video as the first black tears start running down my face, the veins on my neck popping as your cock twitches and throbs inside my throat. How about getting some feedback from my friends? Get a hold of my password free iPhone and take and post a couple of snaps on my Snapchat story. Hell, put the fucking overused doggy filter on me if you want to.\n\n3) English isn't my first language so you may see a couple of typos here and there. I'm fluent in Spanish and English, if that helps with your roleplay scene.\n\nMy DONT's:\n\n1) Pussy and ass fucking are cool and all, but I'm only looking to get my throat fucked and nothing else. That's why I'm posting here.\n\n2) I don't send pictures and I don't expect to receive them at any point (no random dick pics).\n\n3) I don't like cliche roleplays like master-slave, teacher-student. Be out there, be original, be hot, be crazy.\n\n4) No shit, puke or direct incest (feel free to pee on me if you're into that sort of stuff lol).\n\n5) No rape. I'm always in the mood for getting my face fucked silly.\n\n6) I will ignore your message if it includes any of the points I just mentioned, or if it's just a random story of you fucking my mouth with no context or backstory whatsoever.\n\nSo in short: pull my hair, spit in my mouth and on my face, slap my tits, fuck my skull like I'm some sort of cheap blow-doll, make a mess out of my tits and face, and take some pictures if you feel like taking a souvenir with you. Extra points for public manhandling, but it's not 100% necessary.\n\nNow, how to get me to message you on kik? PM me your kik along a short write-up of your roleplay idea. Doesn't have to be very long, just a general idea of how I'll eventually end up with your fat, throbbing dick lodged halfway down my windpipe. I'll kik you if I like it.\n\nPS: No but really, don't forget to include your kik.\n\nPS2: I post these on a regular basis, so feel free to send me another prompt even if you did so last time. I'll kik you if I like it.\n\nPS3: Chatzy rooms or reddit chat are valid alternatives to Kik.\n\nPS4: I have some ideas of my own. Think of your RP as an audition lol, but we can play it too if we both like it.",

            "selftext": "\"*You have been called upon to serve. You will be trained - and you will become the best we can make of you. You will be the protectors of Earth and all her colonies.*\" I remember the speech, my mind making it sound nearly sarcastic. It had been a long time since that fateful September day. A long time since we were told we were going to be *Spartans* and protect the UNSC. 21 years ago, in fact. We would be the best and brightest, the toughest and fiercest. We would be the protectors and the guardians of all mankind.\n\nNot *you and I* , though. *You and I* were stuck out on some backwater colony, some Outer Colony planet in a star system I hadn\u2019t even heard of until we were given our mission briefing. I didn\u2019t even need to pay attention, because as soon as I heard the words \u201ctwo person op\u201d, I knew what that meant.\n\nSpartan-073: Aya-*me*, and my eternal counterpart. \n\n*You*.\n\nYou who has stayed by my side, even when 117 and Blue Team would push me out of the way. I thought those guys were jerks, and you told me we should all get along. I reminded you that popular kids existed back in school, and these guys were no different. They were popular. Would go on to get all of the attention.\n\nThey say that every Spartan has *something* that makes them special, even among their peers. 117 was lucky. 058 was the best shot there was. 104 was loyal. 087, Faster than fast.\n\n\u201cNobody can see Aya-073.\u201d\n\nThat was my little catchphrase. Not because I was sneaky. Not because I was good at camouflage. Before augmentation, I wasn\u2019t even 4\u20199\u201d. Halsey thought I would grow. I didn\u2019t. *After* the augmentation process, I stood at a whopping 5\u20196\u201d. I am literally *too short* for the Mjolnir MK IV they just started rolling out. I am strong and fast and durable and all the things a Spartan *should* be\u2026 I am just not tall enough for any of that to matter. To the other Spartans, I look like a child. When I catch myself in the mirror, sometimes I agree.\n\nShort reddish-brown hair, spikey and wild. Tan skin, covered in dark brown freckles. A wide, happy grin that reaches all the way up to my dark brown eyes. My body carries its musculature well, my appearance more of a *wiry* one than a hulk of muscle and bone.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is *you*.\n\nYou *could* be a real Spartan, not stuck out here with me. You\u2019re tall and graceful and built like a tank. You shouldn\u2019t be stuck out here with me. It\u2019s my fault that you are. See, what *most* people think is special about you is that you can put up with me. Aya, always in the brig for disobeying orders, or insubordination, or theft of UNSC Commissary Goods, or drinking on duty, or being late to muster a million times. Aya, with the short messy hair and the big loud mouth and the unprofessional comments and the openly flirtatious comments towards fellow Spartans, or other UNSC personnel.\n\nAs one of the *taller* Spartans once told me:\n\n\u201cIf they could flunk a super-soldier without killing them they\u2019d do it to you in a heartbeat, *Failed Success*.\u201d\n\nTo 063\u2019s dismay, I took the term and ran with it. \n\n***Aya-073, the Failed Success.***\n\nMy job as a teacher on this planet is an easy one. Teach little kids history, exercise patience and caution, don\u2019t do anything to make anyone suspicious that I am *actually* a highly trained killing machine. Keep bills paid in the run-down apartment we rent on a shite block of a shite area in a shite city on a shite planet. Make contact every 48 hours, and try to find where Insurrection Fleet Designation \u201cNovember-Foxtrot-Charlie\u201d ran off to after a local UNSC Patrol Fleet engaged them.  \n\nI take your hand and run with it, towards the marketplace. I just got paid, and that means I want *real fruit*. Actual food, instead of surviving off MREs and protein shakes like we did the first month we were here. We look like a couple. I know it. I even play it up, so that we look like a set of eloped lovers, running from family or prejudice, or whatever people think we are running from. The Marketplace almost gives me hope, though. Even with the Covenant out there, glassing planets and making the UNSC\u2019s life hell, these people haven\u2019t given up. The kids still go to school. The farmers still farm. The laborers still labor. The rebels still rebel, but we are working on that one. \n\n\u201cHey Hey!\u201d I shout to you, looking back over my shoulder. \u201cThey have apples! Want some apples?\u201d\n",

But I ask you to repeat what you've said, and you do so. \n\n\"I want to fool around with a man.\" \n\nI should be shocked, but I'm not. Something about it just makes sense, like a puzzle piece finally sliding into its correct place. I don't worry about what it could mean for our relationship - I know you're faithful to me, and me to you. If you want to experience the joys of pleasuring a cock for yourself, could I really blame you? \n\nSo, I contact all of the men I count as friends, and very discretely ask them if they'll help us out with your desires. They all turn me down, save for one - a tall, muscular stud who's rumored to have an enormous cock. I can't help but smile at the prospect of you servicing him; what a way to break you into the world of dick!\n\nTonight, I dress in my sexiest lingerie and invite my friend over. We meet you in the bedroom, which is plunged in darkness - I figure it'll be easier that way. I'm surprised, though, that you flick the beside lamp on, revealing that you're already undressed save for a tight pair of briefs. \n\n\"Are you ready, baby?\" I ask. ",

            "selftext": "Being a young, female entrepreneur isn't easy. For days and day I've tried, working my ass off (and on, and off, and on...) to keep myself in business, despite some fierce and cutthroat competition from across the street. It's been hard work, toiling day and night to keep the buns perky, the pies creamy, the donut holes glazed to glorious perfection. I've struggled. And, yes, I've gone through more businesses in a week than a nymphomaniac goes through panties at a strip club.\n\nBut this is it. My ultimate business venture. The *creme de la creme*, the idea to rival - and usurp - all others. Sally's Clam Shack - serving fresh oyster, succulent clam and all the juicy, fishy goodness you could ever want for. It is a salty, tangy delight, straight from the depths of my own, personal oceanic trench and straight into your mouth. Just close your eyes, stick out your tongue and taste the joy of pale, pink perfection with every succulent lick.\n\nOnly, you might ask yourself: \"Why on Earth is Sally taking up yet a*nother* business venture, when her donut hole deal was going so swimmingly? Well, my dear and faithful customer, let me tell you. It's his fault. [The guy across the street](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7z6rx3/m4f_as_the_work_week_draws_to_a_close_treat/). The guy with the cute smile and the hot dog-stuffed donut treats. You see, I... I went over and spoke to him last night. In the dead of night. Alone.\n\nI mean, going over there, I didn't expect that it was going to turn out the way it did. I had some harsh words already prepared to throw in his face, and my donut hole was nice and glazed, let me tell you, so it was not a question of being hungry for *that* particular foodstuff! But him and his pelvic-thrusting, hot-dog-costume-wearing, sign-twirling mascot had been undermining my business for as long as I had been around, and after receiving an invitation to come over and 'talk', I figured I might as well give it a shot. Perhaps it was time for a truce, even. A business truce. A hot dog truce. A tightly stuffed, glazed donut, sausage truce.\n\nIt was cool air between us at first, although we were cordial. A few smiles, a handshake, the odd compliment on one another's business. There was no denying, of course, that he stuffed his hot dog tight. I could see it even as I first stepped into the back of his shop, and yeah, maybe it flustered me a little. Maybe I missed the hot dog game, and the sweet, slippery sensation of some real meat pushing between firm buns, schlurping and sclorping with the gooey aid of so many condiments-- but I played it cool. *I was the new queen of donuts*, I told him, and if he wanted to play in my glazed arena, then he had better kiss the ring.\n\nHe smiled, the way he had done so many times across the street, and held up his gloriously turgid hot dog, the tip positively *dripping* with succulent grease as I gawked at it. *Maybe*, he said, *it was better we didn't fight. With his sausage and my tight, succulent donut hole, a partnership might be beneficial for both of us.* A rebel, indeed - what he was proposing would undermine everything I had ever worked for, all the long hours of slaving over the stove to fulfill order after order of perfectly pert cream pies and goo-dripping pastries.\n\nBut then again, there was sense in his proposal. And looking at his hot dog, it was starting to seem like more and more of a kosher meal - business-wise, I mean! Of course, no merger without an equitable investment - and since he was already famous for his combination of sweet and savory, I had to make sure that the name Sally wasn't forgotten in his rebellious orgy of turgid sausages plunging into all-too-narrow holes.\n\nSo I laid my cards on the table. *I miss the hot dog racket,* I told him, my uniform growing skimpier by the moment as I tore it apart - hat, apron, name tag hitting the ground one after the other. *And I've been craving a hot,* ***hot*** *dog ever since you put that damn sign up. Now, I heard you were a pretty proficient pearl diver-- a connoisseur of the clam, as it were. Perhaps we might have a future in the industry together. Provided we come to the right terms..!*\n\nHe knew what I meant. His lips were as poised to slurp some oyster as mine were to taste his all-American 'dog, and from then on, there weren't a lot of words being spoken in the Rebel Dog hot dog and donut shop. They were mostly moans and groans and pants and growls and whimpers, as our negotiations wore on long into the night. I bet he never saw a woman handle a slab of meat as well as I, and he made sure to share his secret recipe for his Hot Dog sauce several times over before the night was through. But nor had I anticipated his hunger for the fresh seafood I was offering, because he had a plateful and more, one serving barely scarfed down before he dove back in for seconds, thirds, fourths and fifths! From the oil-soaked stench of the kitchen to the squeaky chairs of his personal office, we ran the negotiations through the night, until we both sat, panting and drained, side by side in front of the door. Outside, the sun was rising, and in the pale, pink light of dawn, I saw them: The customers.\n\nSo welcome, everyone, to the New Sally's. Where once there was strife, now there is peace. Where once there was emnity, now there is unity. Where once there were 'Dogs-- well, you can still get your 'dogs, the best in town bar none! But try it with a side of fresh, juicy oyster, and see how the taste amplifies and multiplies! Please, don't be shy - there's more than enough of my luscious dish to go around, and since we are celebrating the brand new merger, we are offering a limited time deal: One delicious clam (*sans* beard, naturally - we always keep our seafood freshly shaven), one well-stuffed hot dog with extra condiment for the bun, one extra glazed donut hole and a piping hot cream pie, all for the low, low price of-- oh, just come over here and eat my pussy already.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^^^^This ^^^^is ^^^^the ^^^^last ^^^^one, ^^^^I ^^^^promise",

I am on the shorter side and big up top with an athletic body. Obviously I am black!\n\nThings that turn me on a lot is you showing me super slutty outfits to wear on date night (this makes me too excited), coming to please you in public or at your work, you showing me off to other men, white men that cheat on their wives with me and white men with teenage sons. Also I love cock pics, I am that rare girl lol.\n\nI love older white men, and a roleplay where you leave your wife for me and make me yours, and share me with your friends will do it for me today. Showering me with compliments is always a good way to get me excited.\n\nReply with some details about yourself and let's get started!\n\nI am looking for chat/rp and am open to long or short term.

This rp will be 18+ for sexual content as well as descriptions of violence (its 40k guys come on lol). So at about this point you are probably asking 'what will the roles be?' well that is up to debate! (yay for indecision) the only set role is that i will be a female and part of the Imperium. Now who will you be? anyone you want! you could be a Ork! you could be an Elder! you could be a daemon of chaos! just know that i am very creative and very kinky, tbh i am burning to do an rp where i play as a sister of battle who is corrupted by chaos, and when i say chaos it can be any God! (bonus points if you can make a conversion to Nurgle sexy lol) however i realize that some might not be ups for that thus i am leaving this mostly open ended. As for violence i am toatlly cool with it and the more creative the violence the better! in the kink department i like to think i am on the level that would make the average Slaaneshi blush so keep that in mind;) but if you need it spelled out, bdsm, rough fucking, anal, bodily fluids, tattoos, piercings, object insertion, objectification, body writing, food play, to name a few. If you are interested drop your kik name or pm me and we can RP over messages!",

I can only hope some of your creative juices will flow into this forum, filling in the cracks between letters until it eventually coats the blue usernames of every sub-poster until they're all glazed with our collective, cloudy, white mess. Sorry, my cum fetish is leaking out again, but isn't that kind of the point? To leak our kinky desires for all to see? We climax together, consistently mind fucking each other with our vivacious texts and sexts all in the same, steamy, public thread.\n\nGentlemen ready your ~~penises~~ pens and ladies open your ~~legs~~ laptops. I hope all of you are wearing protection because it's about to get absolutely filthy in the comments below. But before you dive into the hot orgy that is this prompt, let's lay down some ground rules:\n#*T H E | R U L E S*\n1. In order to ~~cum~~ comment all over someone's nasty little prompt, you must (should) first write one of your own. It can be as simple as a single word or a sentence, or as complicated as a multi-paragraphed piece or a thoughtfully articulated stanza. Shorter prompts, however, will likely garner more ~~cum~~ community commentary, so keep that in mind. You can also list your main kink(s) and limit(s) at the end of the prompt, but this won't be necessary for all of you.\n\n2. Don't be afraid to butt into someone's thread. This is the perfect place to have branching story paths. If OP doesn't respond to you then someone else may continue your branch. Either way, I hope to see your short stories branching and blooming!\n\n3. Try to obey your partners' hard limits! The bravest of you may make limitless threads if you please. There may even be a trophy for the most depraved post.\n\n4. Don't PM me. Don't PM each other. Everything that happens here should happen in public, for all to see. If you like, you can even be that guy or girl rubbing themselves in the corner, watching us and commenting on your own voyeuristic thread until you ~~get lonely and leave~~ finally force out all your gooey cum after reading everyone's dirtiest, sluttiest sex stories!\n\n5. Use the \"Break Lounge\" if you're looking for a place to put your character bio/profile, wanting to provide feedback, or you want to chat with others involved in the orgy. Refreshments will also be provided.\n\n6. Follow Dirty Pen Pals' rules and keep your conduct subreddit appropriate.\n\n7. I, OP, can't win any trophies for ethical reasons, but the trophies given are decided entirely by me, OP. Arguing with the results will get you removed from the trophy case for the week. If you are posting on Public Pen Pals you are consenting to have your writing used for display in the trophy case. I stop editing the trophy case on the Monday after the event is posted.  \n___\n\n&gt;Example:\n\n&gt;&gt;A young woman walks nude around New York City for a day.

A young wannabe trainer, 4'11\" with long blonde hair in a fishtail braid, piercing hazel-green eyes, a tight white sleeveless top, black latex booty shorts, thigh high black socks, and sneakers.\n\nAfter beating me, easily, in a pokemon battle.

There's always that one person, the one we always imagine being with but never quite getting that far, never moving out of the realm of fantasy. \n\nWell, I'm here to help with that. \n\n...Sort of. \n\nSee, I'm willing to roleplay as your crush. Your beautiful, stunning, out-of-your-league crush that you can't help but admire and fantasize about. You can describe her beautiful face and incredible body, and I'll try to write her as best as I can. But, you won't be able to fuck her. \n\nNo, your bully/brother/best friend/father/etc. etc. is going to be the one doing the deed. You'll be watching, of course, but you won't be able to participate. You'll watch your crush, pristine and beautiful in your mind, moan like a bitch in heat as a bigger, better man fucks her. Now doesn't that sound like fun? \n\nHope to hear from you guys!",

            "selftext": "The university I attend is the most liberal place out of all the liberal universities across the country, so when our student body president said that March 10th was to be \u201cCampus Nudity Today,\u201d nobody so much as batted an eye. \n\nMost people thought it was a joke, of course, despite being voted through unanimously by the entire student government and approved wholeheartedly by the school\u2019s administration. Nobody took it seriously, with most people joking about attending class \u201changing dong\u201d or with their \u201ctits flopping everywhere.\u201d As the date grew closer and closer, though, people began to have more serious discussion about it. How many people would participate? Would teachers join in on the action? Would it be weird to be the one nude guy in class, or the one clothed guy? \n\nThe conversations grew to a fever pitch on March 9th. More than a few people, of course, boldly proclaimed that they\u2019d be walking around naked no matter what other people were doing. Other people, of course, weren\u2019t quite so sure, and no doubt most everyone was mulling over their choices the night before. \n\nOf course, today is March 10th, so I have a decision to make, too. I stand in front of the mirror in my single-occupant dorm room, inspecting my body. I\u2019m not so bad, really. I have more of a runner\u2019s body than a bodybuilder\u2019s, unlike the frat boys that live in the gym and seemingly only eat protein, but I can\u2019t complain. I\u2019m tall and relatively athletic and my cock isn\u2019t exactly below average, which is certainly nice. I would look out my window to see who else was participating, but it looks out onto the facilities building \u2013 not exactly places many students would be this early in the morning. I try to peek out into the hallway, but there\u2019s nobody out there. \n\nWith a deep breath, I make my choice. I\u2019m going to participate. \n\nI walk out into the hallway, panic immediately gripping my chest. Every fiber of my being is screaming at me to go back inside and put on some damn clothes, but I ignore it and start walking towards the exit. It feels so utterly wrong, yet somehow so freeing at the same time, to feel the cool air against my body and my cock and balls swinging back and forth between my legs. I feel more and more confident with every step that I take. \n\nI make my way down the stairs and out onto the quad, astounds me. It seems like literally everyone is participating. I see cocks swinging free and breasts bouncing as people walk to class as if nothing is different at all. A few guys are sporting erections, and I have to admit, seeing all of this naked flesh is getting me a bit excited, too. \n\nI\u2019m so enraptured by what I\u2019m seeing that I don\u2019t pay attention to where I\u2019m going. I slam right into someone\u2026\n\nYou. \n\n----\n\nHey! So, you can either dive right into this one, or we can discuss kinks/our characters/whatever else before we begin. I hope to get some messages from you all!",

Having to confess this most intimate thing, this humiliating thing, with everyone in attendance watching.\n\nIt was a forbidden thing. A wicked thing. An iniquitous thing. That is what the Church taught. That is what my Church taught.\n\nI nodded slowly. Gravely. This was a wicked thing. A sinful thing. Sex was evil. Wicked. Filthy. We were beings that were supposed to transcend it. Of course, I, the Apostle, was the only one who truly transcended it. Everyone else had to make do with attempting to be transcendant -- and so often falling short in their efforts.\n\nI let silence fill the chamber. Silence of all in attendance, except for Megan's occasional weeping. Silence except for the eerie tune of the harp in the background, played by Naomi, one of my favorites.\n\nFinally I stood. I wore a long cream colored dress. Golden tassels marked my position of authority. My crystal blue eyes swept across the chamber. Then I strode forward, looking down at Megan. I allowed a small, tiny smile to cross my lips.\n\nMy manipulations had worked, as they always did. I had seen Megan in the courtyard playing volleyball in such carefree circumstance a few days ago, and just knew I had to have her. That pert rear end. The way she giggled and played so carefree.\n\nLife in the compound was good and luxurious, a true utopia, just like I promised my followers. A wonderful, idyllic community in the middle of the Arizona desert, where my followers worshipped the true God. It was so perfect and comfortable for everyone. Until it wasn't.\n\n\"I have seen your sin, oh Disciple\" I finally said. She knew I had seen her sin. Her wickedness. One of my Deacons had told her, the previous night, that I had seen visions of her sinfulness and wanted her to come and confess what she had done. That she should search her heart and confess her wickedness before me.\n\nMegan nodded slowly, continuing to sob. \"I'm...I'm so sorry\" she managed. \"Please, oh God, please be merciful.\"\n\nI knelt down there, on the platform, knelt down close to Megan. I reached a hand down, touching her cheek gently with my hand.\n\n\"God is merciful and loving\" I assured her. \"He will chastise you, but he will also forgive you.\"\n\nMegan dared look up, she shuddered. Then she nodded, with resignation, her body heaving in fear of what was to come.\n\nI stood, snapping my fingers, turning to one of my Deacons. \"Prepare her for the punishment that has been ordained\" I instructed, and two of them went to carry out my command.\n\nMegan stood, numbly, looking forward as she was marched onto the platform. There, they began to strip her. her jeans undone. Pulled down. Her sheer pink panties were revealed, and stripped down as well. Megan took care to shave herself, it turned out.\n\nHumiliation was an important part of any chastisement, I had taught. That any member of my congregation might be stripped like this, stripped in front of others, bared before the congregation and before God. Only I was immune to it.\n\nShe was led forward, to the stone platform, made to kneel before it, and then secured to it with the long leather straps that were attached to it for this very purpose.\n\nTrina, one of the altar girls, a little blonde thing, one of my favorites, approached trepidatiously, offering me the punishment strap. A little brown leather thing. I stood behind Megan, her pert rear end, which I had so admired inside tight shorts when she was playing volleyball, now on full display for me, so close and so bare.\n\nWe weren't like other cults -- not that anyone here would dare describe us as a 'cult' at all -- we were trendy. Modern clothes. Modern music. Yet we had our rules, and among them, sex was forbidden completely. Followers were meant to transcend the need for it, so there was no need to cover up or remain excessively modest like some religions encouraged.\n\nThat is what I taught, anyhow. The simple reality was that I didn't care for actual sex myself, and denying others from its pleasures was a great source of enjoyment to me.\n\n\"If one is to pronounce a punishment\" I told my followers, \"one should be prepared to carry it out oneself.\"\n\nPunishing a miscreant like Megan was really beneath me. But their Apostle was a humble one. Or that is how I painted it in the many services and preachings on the matter I had conducted.\n\nYou were in the front row watching, watching Megan's pert ass upturned. Bared to everyone. The lips of her womanhood -- which were the very reason for her discipline -- visible between her legs. One wasn't meant to find this exciting or arousing in the least. If one did, of course, and it was known, that was the quickest way to end up in the same position as poor Megan.\n\nThe strap was raised. High, high in the air. Then it was swung. It hissed through the air. I landed it with a loud CRACK across Megan's bottom. She shuddered and squealed.\n\nYou watched, your mouth a little agape. You wondered how, how had your lover become mixed up in this group? And where *were* they? \n\nMegan writhed and squealed as the strap came down again and again. I took measured, hard strokes, right across her bottom and her thighs. Raising angry welts.\n\nI carried out punishments like these myself, and was expert at the practice by now. Of course, I didn't punish *everyone*. The congregation was well over a thousand, by now, and had sprawled into other compounds as well, and at the rate at which punishments were doled out, many took place each and every day. But let's say I tended to punish the *attractive* ones. Like Megan.\n\nTwelve hard lashes landed across Megan's rear end. By the end she was a sobbing, crying mess. Then she was unbound, and I prayed with her. I anointed her with oil. I consoled her in front of everyone. God was strict, but also merciful and loving, everyone knew.\n\nMy eyes swept the assembled congregation, and settled upon you. You shuddered.\n\nFor you were next.\n\n---\n\nI hope the above prompt gives some idea of what I might be looking for. You should be articulate, intelligent, and willing to write in detail (one-liners won't be considered). And you should like spanking. Please like spanking. :)\n\nIf you are male, you might be subjected to cruel punishments in this setting, but you should also be open to the idea of helping me cook up cruel punishments to inflict on females. If you are female, well, you may just be deliciously submissive.\n\nPeople who are into world-building and can build this little setting with me are especially desirable. If you respond, please write something as well as tell me something about the real you at the end. I find things work out best if we carry out a 'normal' conversation and get to know each other in parallel with playing.\n",

This rp will be 18+ for sexual content as well as descriptions of violence (its 40k guys come on lol). So at about this point you are probably asking 'what will the roles be?' well that is up to debate! (yay for indecision) the only set role is that i will be a female and part of the Imperium. Now who will you be? anyone you want! you could be a Ork! you could be an Elder! you could be a daemon of chaos! just know that i am very creative and very kinky, tbh i am burning to do an rp where i play as a sister of battle who is corrupted by chaos, and when i say chaos it can be any God! (bonus points if you can make a conversion to Nurgle sexy lol) however i realize that some might not be ups for that thus i am leaving this mostly open ended. As for violence i am toatlly cool with it and the more creative the violence the better! in the kink department i like to think i am on the level that would make the average Slaaneshi blush so keep that in mind;) but if you need it spelled out, bdsm, rough fucking, anal, bodily fluids, tattoos, piercings, object insertion, objectification, body writing, food play, to name a few. If you are interested drop your kik name or pm me and we can RP over messages!",

            "selftext": "There it lurks on the drawing board, a blueprint for *perfection.* A culinary innovation so revolutionary, so disruptive to the ossified order of bun-based sausage cuisine, that my dominance in this competition is all but assured. It's been rough going, ever since *she* upended my steady stream of customers by offering fresh, hot, silky perfection... they do say customer participation is all the rage, but to let them glaze each luscious cream pie *themselves...* how can I compete? I've built my reputation on the finest hot dogs, roasted and spiced to absolute perfection, and to lose it all to some pastry-making dilettante? I'm not going to lose *this.* It's all about goods and services, and I've found the *perfect* blend of both.\n\nThe night is long, and I can practically feel my bones screaming to rest, yet I forge on. I'm building my *destiny* here, and not only a new sign takes shape, but an entirely new *production line,* the tiny complex of a well-appointed, luxurious booth and the latest of pastry machines, imported in secrecy. \n\nBy the time the dawn breaks, eyes glitter with wonder. This is why I got into the business. *This* is what I've dreamed of - giving the people something new, something *inspiring*.\n\nJutting proudly above my shop stands a lovingly-rendered hot dog, modeled after my signature carnivorous confection, far larger than life. Not merely a hot dog, but one bulging with delicious texture, a mouthwatering arc, and stuffed snugly, creamy, slick glazing positively *slathered* around its length, *straight* through the snugly-fitting hole of a *donut.*\n\nThe elegant sweep of calligraphy beneath this pinnacle of the advertising arts proclaims the wonders within:\n\n# Rebel Dogs presents: *The Dessert Dog* \n\n## Treat yourself to something *new* - sinful indulgence never felt this *good!*\n\nAnd as above, so below: They're already streaming towards me in curious droves, my gaze flicking between the oncoming rush and the lonesome pie shop across the street. *Maybe,* I think, *she'll want to come over at last...* A thought, no doubt, swept away when the first eager-eyed customer slaps a crisp greenback on the counter for the *deluxe* deal, and I guide her through the process. Just as the next fresh face in line plucks a donut and receives a savory sausage thrust through the middle, sugary glazing drizzled lovingly atop it, she slips behind the curtain with me, and the show *begins.*\n\nIt's a culmination of all that's come before - the slow journey to seasoned preparedness, with hands sliding beneath her skirt, massaging at the tensing muscle beneath, working out the tension, lingering over the sweep where the curve of her hips meets her back, until the velour couch awaits for the most discerning and utterly relaxed of customers. All the while, a pleasant banter - one *does* learn a certain smoothness in the restaurant business, after all - and a calming reassurance, the faintest of kisses and the subtlest of strokes from nimble fingers adding their notes to the savory stew. A slithering slide of cloth, and there it is, the winking hole waiting for its dessert, to taste something *new*. \n\nAnd then it's time for the *glazing*, the old yellow-and-red pumps repurposed to slather out creamy liquids in slick dollops, my hands running down massage, fingertips coated with the slick stuff of dreams to slide, to spread, to bring the wonders of a restaurateur's practiced massage right to her very *core.* She's sweet and flushed and *beaming*, and I can't help but smile too - one finger, two, *three*, twisting and curling and stroking, teasing out the soft gasps from my customer's luscious lips. And then *four*, the gentle bucking of her hips, the slick, thick flow of class-A organic *lube* streaming wetly down to puddle on the rich velvet below. Now is the time, and it begs the question:\n\nWhat, of course, is a hot-dog man without a mastery of *meat?*\n\nAll it takes is a single, smooth *slide* - first that warm, blunt tip soaked in slippery goodness, nestling at the relaxed, snug entrance beneath, my hands the finest blend of gentle and firm on her hips, and then... a *groan*, matched by two throats. *Perfection,* in that swelling, smooth stretch, the warmth of my body pressing in a gentle relentlessness against her own, out, *out,* ***out***, until the spreading bulge of my shaft is matched in its magnitude by the shaking of stockinged legs beneath. All the world's condensed, now, down to a tight, warm, slick and sensual *stretch,* and then it *isn't*, a faint *slurp* sounding as my hips slide firmly home, the all-natural *smack* of strong thighs on plush cheeks echoed by the sensual *slap* of a heavy sack. \n\nAnd she is *full,* now, like all the best customers when they sample my shop's delights. We've got so much *more* to experience, something new and sweet and *revolutionary,* but, even as I begin the slow slide out, I can't help but think. [Just across the street, *she* waits](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7yxlpa/f4m_sweet_sallys_glazed_donut_hole_the_tightest/), the occasional glance across the way sending my mind spiraling into thoughts of lust and longing... \t\n\nAny moment now, the postman should be dropping off that card, *Sally* scrawled on the envelope and an earnest plea inside. Yes, it might be mustard-stained and ketchup-spattered, but the sentiment is most sincere: \n\n*Come over after work today - have one on the house, and let's talk.*\n\n---\n\nYou can have all the boring old donut holes, cream pies, or nice, fresh buns you want, but isn't it time you treated yourself to something rich and filling? Something deliciously decadent and totally *new?*\n\nSo come on in, and try out our latest offering. It's new, it's fresh, and it's all for *you.* \n\n---\n\n[DPP Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/5smcxm/m4f_snuggles_and_sex_or_just_snuggles_or_just_sex/)  ",

            "selftext": "I was going to be a normal girl. Really I was. I was accepted into college. I was fully intent on leaving in the fall, but that summer. Something happened. It started the night after graduation. My daddy took me out for dinner. We spent most of the time talking about the future, planning a vacation at the end of the summer, talking about potential majors. I've always been really close with daddy. It was just a great dinner. Then at the end, he gave me a long speech about how proud he was of me. I've never felt so happy. All I've ever really wanted since my mom died was to please him.\n\nOn the car home was when it started I think. He was driving with one hand and had the other on my thigh. Nothing unusual, really. We were silent, but it was a comfortable silence. Then we went home, cuddled and watched a movie. He spooned me. I loved feeling his strong arms envelop me. I just melted into him. And when I did, I felt his cock on my ass through his thin pajama pants. And throughout the movie, I felt it grow. Until finally he snuck his hand inside me. By the end of the movie he was railing me into the couch with his cock. God it was so big. I've never cum that hard before.\n\nAfter that it was small things. I started dressing more slutty. Then he started picking out my outfits. Then he started to make me wear skimpier and skimpier clothes. Then the sex got more casual and casual. He'd bend me over and fill my ass with cum while I was cleaning the floor on my knees. Then he gave me little tasks to do. Wake him up, for example. Cook for him. Greet him at the door with a smile and a blowjob.\n\nThen one day he told me I wouldn't be going to college. I don't know how it happened. How it got to this point. But now, I'm just my dad's little fuck toy. And I wouldn't have it any other way",

Ready to mate yours?\"\n\nYou couldn't believe your eyes as you came across this site, late one night after clicking countless porn ads away. Unlike those ads, however, this was a well developed site with a professional looking layout. Beautiful images of mermaids and mermen caught your eye. These seemed like they could easily be from a AAA summer blockbuster movie And Look! A free trial that you can sign up for without email spam.

You figured it was just a weird fetish site but you go along with it. After all, your first childhood crush was Ariel. Before she losing her her voice and becoming another boring human.  \n\nBrowsing at the various user profiles and pictures, the costumes seemed like they really well made, almost real. \n\nAnd before you knew it, you found yourself chatting with a perky, young white haired \"mermaid\". She's got a great figure with her breasts barely being covered with straps of seaweed. And her hips widen into a nice \"scaly\" ass. Instead of legs, a long white and golden fish fin reflected sunshine like water. And she wants to meet in real life for an actual date. Tonight at 7pm.\n\nMermaids aren't real, right? And how could she be on land if she was? Does sex with her work like between humans or like fishes?\n\nYour mind fills with so many questions. And many focused on what sex has to be like with this kinky cosplayer. that's what this RP is all about. Exploring for answers. \n\n(Oh, And Fish Sex.)\n\nKinks: Romance, Monster Girls, Long Term, Anal, Oral, Loads of Cum, Big Body Parts, Costumes, Mind Control, Transformations, Impregnation, Pregnancy, Eggs, Incest, Futa, and there's plenty more, just ask.\n\n(Ladies, Don't be afraid to join in as well ;)\n\nLimits: No gore, blood, watersports",

            "selftext": "**Press Release: Orgis City Police Department**\n\n\nCitizens of Orgis City,\n\n\nWe have long kept you aware of the superhuman crime threat, particularly our attempts to mitigate it in the face of the ever-growing escalation between our brave officers and the criminals who make our beautiful city a worse place. However, as we have encountered more and more criminals, we have found our previous, traditional criminal justice procedures have been found to be relatively insufficient, and due to both overcrowding and continued correctional facility budget cuts, we\u2019d like to announce a new program, the Superhuman Offender Rehabilitation Initiative.\n\n\nThe plan for this program is simple. Through a combination of psychological evaluation, parole board evaluations, and power profile analysis, we\u2019ve determined which offenders qualify as \u2018acceptable for rehabilitation\u2019 and begun to suggest entry to the program to them. Those who accepted were entered to the rolls of the program, and we\u2019ve listed their profiles at the end of this document. Those who are accepted by someone will move in with another citizen and will attempt to be taught about normal life, perhaps even beginning to work toward becoming members of the superhero community. Those who accept will be given a subsidy and full retrofit of their home. Other superhumans are preferred, but anyone may apply if they wish.\n\n\n*P.S.* If you are receiving this post-script, you have been pre-approved for this program, and I feel like you deserve to know the truth about why we\u2019re initiating this project. While rehabilitation is in fact the goal, these aren\u2019t low-risk offenders. We don\u2019t have the resources to contain even one of these individuals, let alone all of them. Ever since the Grey Mistress empowered every female Super in the city, we\u2019ve found ourselves struggling more and more to try and keep up with people who can tear down entire prisons without breaking a sweat, whether they\u2019re built for supers or not. So, if you can, please help these people become better. They\u2019re powerful, but they need help to understand that they don\u2019t need to commit crimes to survive.*\n\n\n*-Jared Einsen, Orgis City Mayor*\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nProfiles:\n\n\nName: Alison Jenkins\n\n\nAlias: Quasar\n\n\nKnown powers: Energy blasts, thermal manipulation, flight, energy absorption and storage. Claims to possess other powers, but these have not been proven.\n\n\nPersonality: Friendly, *dangerous*, flirty, arrogant.\n\n\nAppearance: Like many post-Empowerment superhumans, Alison is rather voluptuous, 5\u20196\u201d tall with curves in the E cup range and inhumanly firm. Her musculature is toned, but not muscular, and though we have attempted to transition her into wearing more civilian outfits, she has shown a particular predilection for red, black, and lycra.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nName: Lilith Madara\n\n\nAlias: Grey Mistress\n\n\nKnown powers: Class X magic, primary element Ice. Class 3 magic, secondary elements. Previously best known as the cause of the event known as the Empowerment, where Supers became stratified along sex lines, with women becoming cataclysmically more powerful than their pre-empowerment selves.\n\n\nPersonality: Arrogant, proud, resilient.\n\n\nAppearance: Lilith\u2019s skin is a pale white, her time in solitary confinement and magical affinity causing her skin to trend toward grey, unless she is angry in which case it becomes brighter and almost blue. Her build is taller and slightly more muscular than the norm, with D cup breasts and an Amazonian 6\u20192\u201d height.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHave a particular villain you\u2019d like to play as/with? Feel free to suggest!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, I\u2019m feeling something that\u2019s a bit of a hybrid of my usual prompts today. I want to go *very* high power with things, but at the same time, I want to do a somewhat open-form narrative! Do you want to help a villainess reform? Do you want to encourage her back to crime? Do you just want a roommate who is drop dead gorgeous and can make a tactical nuke look like a Roman Candle? Well this is the perfect prompt for any of those things!\n\n\nI\u2019m pretty flexible on what character I play opposite. Hero or normal person, human or Super, the only limit would be that the government would likely not give care of such a person to a Villain, unless they covered their tracks well leading up to things.\n\n\nFrom the kink side, I tend to be into things like exhaustion/stamina, dirty talk, loving sex, titjobs, sexualized destruction, use of powers, and overpowered characters who can be coerced by others. In addition, I like things like cumplay and large cocks, though that\u2019s more negotiable. Anything else can be discussed, with the exception of gore, incest, and noncon.\n\n\nHope to hear from you!\n",

            "selftext": "(For the record, this post is marked F4A because I love futa play, like a lot, and am more than willing to play a futa or opposite a futa!)\n\nI mean the title kind of says it all, doesn't it? Life's full of oppressive rules and social expectations, so I don't find it terribly odd that when I escape into a world of dreams and fantasies that I imagine fucking the way nature intended. It feels better, it's way more exciting, and since I'm already being honest, I get off on the risks that go with it. Derailing my life because I neglected safety for the sake of pleasure one night is kind of delicious, and I can't help myself, whatever.\n\nSo with that in mind, I'm open to basically any scene or take on that theme. I've had a lot of fun with fantasy scenes of late, and I'm really enjoying stuff like a human stumbling onto a free spirited bathing elf in a spring somewhere, and having things heat up. I'm also open to lots of other fantasy races and the like, monstergirls can be fun as well!\n\nBut if fantasy isn't your bag and you want something more grounded, I'm definitely game for more realistic settings and prompts as well. Roommates staying in on a stormy night is a good one. I also enjoy losing a bet or taking a dare that gets sort of out of control. Paying rent with my body? Something more innocent? I'm open to discussion, and always love to hear a good naughty idea from someone else! So let's hear it.\n\nThe whole pregnancy risk thing is pretty much mandatory. I've been really big into it lately, and I've had a lot of fun with it in the past. So it's something I want to incorporate into basically any scene I do at the moment. For obvious reasons, this means if you're looking for a lot of focus on anal or assplay you're really probably better off looking elsewhere.\n\nMajor kinks include casual fucking up to borderline free use situations, dirty talk and playful banter, partially clothed sex, quickies in inappropriate places, and the obvious risky sex stuff. I'm pretty open to that though. My major limits are gore/vore and bathroom type shenanigans, so feel free to ask if you're looking for something specific!\n\nAnd it should go without saying, but I'm not really looking for personal pics, nor am I going to be giving any out. This is roleplay only. Maybe chat if you really catch my interest. Regardless, I'm looking forward to the envelopes, and hope everyone gets what they're looking for tonight!\n\nEdit: As long as this is up, I'm still looking! Feel free to send me a message!",

And I fully intend for it to give me plenty more before the night is over. So I think it deserves some appreciation, don't you?\" I arched my brow and gave you a wicked smile as I licked my lips. \"I have 45 minutes until that timer goes off...let's say we see how much appreciation I can lavish on this monster cock before you let me swallow that appetizer.\" \n\n*Please do not be alarmed by my inability to stick to one tense while writing. Tenses are my grammatical Achilles heel.*",

            "selftext": "I usually like to put up a little prompt, a small setting idea, just something to get ~~your~~ the juices flowing. I like to describe what I'll do to you if everything works out -- what we're building towards, a small scene that exemplifies what I want to see. But, I find that boxes me in a little too much, and there's too many dirty things I want to do to you to count.\n\n\nSo let's try this differently:\n\nI'm a domme, through and through. I like to be in control, but more importantly I like to watch someone else *lose* control. In fact, I would say that being a domme is the most charitable thing I do these days: My focus is your pleasure, your needs, and your slowly spiralling needs. Your deepest longings, your most heartfelt urges, that's what I want to coax out of you. I'm just here to help you enjoy yourself, and contrary to popular opinion, I'm here to serve *you*.\n\nAnd hey, if it gets me off too, that's just the cherry on top of the cake. \n\nSo! With that in mind, let's get in to the important stuff. \n\nThough I vary on what *kind* of Domme, I generally play both rough and hard, but I'm perfectly happy to play a slow burning, soft-handed one too. I'm just as happy forcing you over a fast-food counter as I am binding your wrists to the bed, slowly working up your body until you have no choice  but to explode. Though I find that playing soft usually ends with more character and story development, whereas as a heavier hand is more about exploring different situations and reactions, these are not mutually exclusive and honestly it's probably just different priorities that come up. \n\nAs for the rest, I'm perfectly fine with any settings, be it fantasy, sci-fi (though my personal knowledge outside of Generic Science Fiction is limited to Star Wars), realistic, it's all good. Want to do a quickie in the back of a classroom on prom night? Want to watch your body get turned and twisted until you're barely recognizable? Want me to seal you between two layers of plastic, and cut out small patches for your holes? Tell me.\n\nWe can do this two ways: Fast, one-paragraph, back and forths, or else something a little more slow burning, once every few hours to once every few days and a bit longer. \n\nI will note that last time I put F4A I had an inbox full of one liners, simply saying 'hey i loved your idea' and that was about it. While I'm flattered, I would love to know a little more about you, your wants and needs, and why you've come to me. Feel free to sift through my old prompts and [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/g6f8Xt5.png), and perhaps I'll hear from you soon.\n\nAlternatively, if you'd like to show me the flipside of domination.... Well, good luck (;\n\nEdit: I went off to play video games and have currently been flooded with replies. I will try to reply to everyone though, at least! Though there is a distinct lack of girls messaging me.... *wink wink*",

            "selftext": "Hey DPP! So I posted this prompt yesterday, and believe it or not I got very few responses, at least in the first couple of hours. People told me that this setup is intimidating. So let me preface this with saying - don't be intimidated! Message me! This setup may be long because I have a very specific scenario in mind, but I am not looking for some literary genius/novelist to respond! As long as you're willing to indulge me in my setup and can write in coherent sentences I would love to hear from you! So, without further ado...\n\n---\n\n\"You *know* why I'm calling you. Where the fuck is my money? It's been three months and you owe me like... 2 grand at this point.\"\n\nMy hands were shaking. The voice on the other hand was my tatto guy. A few months ago I got this package deal from him: for $1500 he did a very nice shoulder piece for me and then he pierced both my nipples and put some expensive piercing with them. There was one problem - I didn't have anywhere near the amount of money needed so instead I just avoided him for a month. And now he was calling.\n\n\"I'm sorry Mike. It's just that I don't have that kind of money. I don't think I ever will. Is there...anything I can do?\" I tried to sound seductive over the phone.\n\n\"Oh no slut. Don't expect to get away with this just by letting me use your fat pussy again.\" I swallowed the insult. Clearly he was building up to something else.\n\n\"I have another proposal. I'm having a bunch of my friends from other shop over tomorrow. We usually do a friendly competition or just show off our work. But itll be even better if we can do it on a real body. And yours should give us plenty of space.\" He chuckled. Another fat joke. \n\n\"So what, you just wanna tie me up and let your friends tattoo whatever you want on me? Are you serious?\"\n\n\"Yea I'm serious. Come over tomorrow night and either have the money or be ready to be stripped, tied up and let my boys leave some permanent marks.\"\n\nWhat else could I do? It's not like I had the money. And that's how, a day later I ended up in the tattoo shop, completely naked, tied to the ceiling and spread eagle waiting for all of Mike's friends to come in.\n\n---\nKinks: body writing (duh), body shaming, humiliation, pain.\nLimits: scat, extreme violence.",

I'm young and ripe and curvy - built for sex and to take cock and grow babies. Tell me all about how you want to fill me over and over with your hot potent seed and fertilize my body....i want my belly to swell with your child and my breasts to grow huge and tender as i get more and more pregnant. I want you to keep me at home, fat with your babies, leaking milk everywhere, and just waiting for you to get home so you can bend me over and pump your seed into me again. Some more specifics i could be into: your wife can't get pregnant so you bring me in to grow your child - ideally she would watch while you seed me and either not be able to do anything about it or help out - aka she's sucking my tits/vibrating me so that i cum, furthering our chances of conceiving. multiple pregnancies - maybe once i'm pregnant you could somehow impregnate me again - not sure how this would work but i think it's a super hot idea.\n\ni basically just want to be your little breeding slut, the more extreme the better... xo can't wait to hear from you!",
