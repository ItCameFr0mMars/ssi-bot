            "selftext": "\"OHh, fuck...\" I moaned, my fists clenching in the sheets. My face, neck and chest burned bright pink with alcohol as I slammed up and down on your rubber-wrapped cock.\n\n\"Ohh fuck, we shouldn't be doing this.\" I gasped, my orgasm approaching. \"I can't... I can't...\" I mouthed silently in the air as your huge dick battered at my cervix. \n\nSpread wide open, my pussy gushed wet and frothy with every long thrust of your first 8 inches. Your hands grasping at my shirt finally make the buttons of my shirt succumb, peeling my tits out to bounce in sight. My large, pink nipples are large and perky, a wide circle of my flat areola, peaking to lust hardened nipples.\n\nMy eyes rolled back in my head as I felt your strength baring me down onto you harder and harder. I was just lucky I managed to get a condom on you before we gave to our mutual lusts. My boyfriend, Marc, was in another room, and here I was getting drunk with, and then *fucking* his good buddy. Not only fucking, I was letting him break me and I loved it! I started to buck harder when I felt his hands start squeezing my throat.\n\nI gasp, my tongue nearly falling out of my mouth as I feel your cock pushing hard against my womb, straining, trembling, and then sliding through my tight cervix. He began to cum and I had to clench hard as I came to keep from releasing my bladder as the hot rubber sack of cum filled inside of my uterus. While his friend warmed my ovaries with his sperm, Marc snored upstairs, passed out from drink.\n\n\"He can't know...!\" I tried to moan as it felt like you pissed your seed straight into me, surely pregnant if not for the thin rubber wrapper catching your thick spunk instead of my defenseless womb. My lips trembled as the words failed to form, and my whole body clenched and bounced hard beneath you as you held me down until your orgasm had finished. \n\nYou pulled out of my womb, your cock sliding free of the condom. Then, you left. It took me some doing to get the condom out of my without breaking it. Eventually I had to let it drain out from between my legs all night. I managed to pull it free the next day, sliding the nearly empty condom out of my womb while skipping lunch. \n\nA few days passed, and here we are again, looking at each other while my boyfriend sleeps on the couch. Downstairs is our bedroom, and between us is a half drank bottle of whiskey. I feel my pussy starting to gush as I remind myself how dangerous this is, just where I am in my fertility cycle. I won't make a move, but surely if you do, I'll have to get a condom on you.\n\nThe problem is, that you're so forceful, so much stronger than I am, I might not be able to... Maybe I could plead with you to just put in the tip instead of fucking right into my womb again. Fuuck, I'm getting wet. This is so bad, but maybe if only...\n\n\"... Just the tip..\" I hear myself saying as I stare over at you. A second later, my eyes go wide as I realize what I said. A thrill shot through my body like electricity as I look into your eyes, my body tingling from my pussy to my heart. I can hardly feel my arms and legs with how focused I am on my dripping hole and my hardening nipples. Shit, I should have put on a bra...\n\nMy eyes are locked on yours as I feel myself moving in a trans. I somehow manage to spread my legs (Which felt like they are in different zip codes) to you, and lift my skirt to spread my pink wetness open with fingers while my boyfriend slept only feet away.\n\nYou can see my pussy clenching with guilty arousal, my juices already soaking into the back of my skirt. \"Just the tip...\" I nearly beg.",

            "selftext": "You kept Emeraude around for two reasons. One, she was the best damn healer you\u2019d ever had. She kept everybody in one piece and patched you up after combat with loving care, making sure that you were always fighting fit.\n\nTwo, she sucked cock like an absolute champ. She was good at it, and she loved it, which was kind of like killing two birds with one stone. You\u2019d never before met someone as willing to drop to her knees and fellate your oversized member, plunging it down her throat as she needily grasped at your hips and let out a muffled wail of joy, the vibrations shuddering down your cock as she slurped at it eagerly. It was the first time you\u2019d met a slut who, when warned of your impending orgasm, simply gave you a thumbs up and impaled herself even deeper on your cock, stretching out her throat as tears of painful pleasure dripped from her wide, rolling eyes. Nobody else had ever been able to make you cum so hard that you saw stars, letting out a roar of satisfaction and grabbing her head to slam your cock further inside, pumping rope after rope of thick, piping hot cum directly down her throat as she greedily gulped it down with a rapturous expression on her sticky, drooling face.\n\nYou were never really sure why, but healing you always seemed to turn her on, especially when you thanked her for it. Hollering \u201cHey, thanks!\u201d or \u201cNice job!\u201d in the middle of a fight would elicit weird, strangled squeals from her. She would be red-faced and panting by the time each battle ended, and though she did her job dutifully, it only took the slightest suggestion to have her leaping for your cock as if it were the most delicious thing on the planet.\n\nAnd it seemed that to her, it was. Whenever she was finished, lying half-naked in the grass with her bulging tits covered in your sticky semen, her breath fluttering unevenly as she blew bubbles through your cum, an almost obsessive smile always draped itself across her face as she lay, legs spread whorishly apart. You could see how wet this made her, drenched undergarments on full display as her body twitched and she giggled detachedly.\n\nBut whenever you made to go further than this, she stopped you. \u201cNo, no,\u201d she would say, suddenly snapping back to reality as you reached out to caress her crotch. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that! Please!\u201d And, well, her blowjobs were so good that you shrugged it off. You always wanted to fuck her, though. To see that thick, round ass bouncing on your cock, to hear her sweet voice screaming to ecstasy beyond ecstasy as you swept aside her defenses and rammed her deeper than she ever could have imagined\u2026\n\nSo you got her drunk. Not to take advantage, see. Just to loosen her lips, to find out why she was so willing to take your cock inside her mouth but not her pussy. And, well, did that ever work! What she confessed confirmed a few sneaking suspicions you had had about her, uh, proclivities, but also opened your eyes to a new way forward.\n\n\u201cOh, but I don\u2019t *deserve* it!\u201d she wailed, slamming an empty tankard down on the table and hiccuping as she waved for another. There were tears in the elf\u2019s eyes as she continued, talking far too loudly even for the bustling inn that you had dragged her to. \u201cI ffff\u2026 love your cock,\u201d she slurred. \u201cYou know that, \u2018ight?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes I do! Just keep it down!\u201d you hissed, cringing as the halflings at the next table gave the pair of you a sideways glance.\n\n\u201cShorry!\u201d she giggled, switching to an exaggerated stage whisper that somehow seemed even louder. \u201cBut I do! I love sucking your magic wand. When I heal you, I get \u2026 \\*hic* tingly. And it makes me so huckin\u2019 forny\u2026\u201d She frowned. \u201cShuckin\u2019... cluckin\u2019 horny. Thassit. So cluckn\u2019 horny when you say \u2018Nice save, Emeraude!\u2019 or \u2018Thanksh, healer\u2019. Yanno. Isslike you um, I gotta have you right then. You get me?\u201d She leaned forward, her glimmering green eyes pleading with you for shared understanding.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d you said, trying to calm her down with a placatory hand gesture as you became keenly aware that all the neighbouring tables were now listening with at least one ear. \u201cI get it, I understand. But then\u2026 why won\u2019t you, you know\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Emeraude exclaimed, grinning proudly. Her robe had fallen open, displaying an amount of cleavage that was scandalous even for a sordid place like this.\n\n\u201cUh, yes. That.\u201d Suddenly you\u2019re wondering if it was a good idea bringing her to such a public place.\n\n\u201cCuzh I don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d she whimpered, her shoulders suddenly drooping as she slumped to the table, knocking over her empty tankard.\n\nYou rushed to catch it before it fell to the flagstones, and set it carefully back on the table, well away from her bosom, which was by now aggressively spilling across the wood, barely contained by her robe. \u201cEm, what are you talking about? You do a great job, you deserve just as much as any other member of the party. Even if that is, uh\u2026 you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMmnope.\u201d She shook her head, pouting like a child. \u201cI have to \\*hic* earn it! The blowjobs\u2019re my reward, see. You know I don\u2019t like gold, I like ccccock.\u201d She drew the last word out lasciviously, her ruby-red lips wrapping seductively around the single syllable before spitting it out.\n\nIt was true. She never took more than the bare minimum needed to survive from the party\u2019s rewards. Paid for her food and necessities, kept her equipment maintained, and that was it. You always gave her magic items that nobody else could use, and though she protested, she always sucked your cock with extra devotion after dividing the spoils, milking you dry long into the night. \u201cSo if you like my cock that much, why not let me fuck you?\u201d you pressed her, frustration evident on your face.\n\nStill pouting, Emeraude looked up at you, tears swimming in her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve iiiiiit!\u201d she wailed.\n\nThat was all you got out of her before she fell asleep at the table halfway through her next ale. Carrying her up to a room, you sat yourself down in a chair next to her and thought long and hard. Concentrating was difficult, with her voluptuous form carelessly draped across the bed just inches from you. Even under her loose robes, you could see the maddening curves of her body, rising and falling as she slowly began snoring. Her cascading, jet-black hair a match made in heaven with her olive-brown skin, she was the picture of erotic beauty as she lay, unguarded. It would have been so easy to take her right there, but you wanted something more. Something meaningful for both you and her, not a drunken, half-conscious roll in the hay that she may or may not actually want.\n\nNo, your task now was to figure out what she meant by not \u2018deserving\u2019 to have sex with you\u2026 and then, obviously, to convince her that she did deserve it.\n\n***\n\nSo! I kinda like the healslut dynamic, but don\u2019t wanna mess around with the out-of-universe stuff. So what I want is to be the healslut in a D&amp;D-style adventuring party, taking place completely within a universe of magic and monsters. Ideally this would play out over a fair stretch of time, both irl and in-universe. I\u2019m also not really into the crueler side of this fetish, so I\u2019m not interested in scenarios where I screw up and have to be punished. Because we\u2019re not actually playing in a video game, there\u2019s no respawns, so death is a serious thing and not a minor mistake that\u2019s worth two spanks and a cock-slap.\n\nTall, sexy and hung futas go to the front of the line, as does anybody with a massive cock that shoots unrealistic loads of cum, and knows how to use it to properly form a symbiotic relationship with an eager healslut. I expect you have a good idea of Em\u2019s personality (or at least her drunk personality) from the prompt, so I hope anyone who comes forward will be willing to respect her/my agency and her/my kinks, recognise what makes her/me tick and deliver it without falling off the wagon.\n\nThe tone of this RP will hopefully be pretty light-hearted, like the second half of the prompt, with a little humour and flirtatious behaviour. It should also be sexy, like you got a *glimpse* of in the first half. As I say, I\u2019m not really interested in the punishment aspect of the healslut fetish, just the bit where I get off like crazy on being told what a **good girl** (those magic words!) I am for casting Cure Light Wounds during a fight and then deepthroat your cock in a frenzy afterwards.\n\nAs for the technical side of things, life will continue as per normal from where the prompt left off while you try and figure out how to get into Emeraude\u2019s panties. We\u2019ll fight some goblins, I\u2019ll buff you and shield you and heal your wounds, you\u2019ll get your dick sucked a lot, and then hopefully, eventually, you\u2019ll find that magic opportunity to get her to, uh, \u2018open up to you\u2019.\n\nThis is already three pages long, so I\u2019m gonna leave it here. PM me if you\u2019re interested with your kinks, limits and perhaps a little about the character you want to play, and any ideas/questions you have about the world and its people. A lot of things are up in the air (including other members of the party who may or may not be involved in this dynamic), so let\u2019s chat about this before we start. Please don\u2019t rush though, I won\u2019t be looking to jump into this right away with the first person who messages me. Kisses xx",

Then it was one of the girls in my class, then three girls from another, five in another, until it felt like most of the girls in my year had baby bumps. Apparently, one of the teachers caught the guy behind it in the act. She showed up not too long after with a bump of her own.\n\nBut it's not just that, they've *all* changed in more ways. Girls who had chests flat as boards are all sporting at least DDs, there isn't a single flat ass in sight, and they all just look... prettier than they used to. \n\nThey talk about fucking *constantly,* like all the time. It's like the only thing they think about, and the word they use to describe describe it are so... vulgar. They compare ideas on \"how to be a better slut\" and how they \"love cock more than anything.\" I overheard a conversation about giving head the other day, and the girl was describing this cock like it was the size of her *arm.*\n\nAnd at the centre of it all is you. People weren't sure at first what was happening, but it only takes so many pregnant girls clinging to your arms and skipping classes with you before it becomes obvious. Something changed in you, almost the second you turned 18. You've *grown.* You're taller, stronger and more handsome than any man *I've* ever seen. You have such a massive presence whenever you enter a room, which is magnified by the flock of pregnant girls that follow you around everywhere, some with chests that have grown larger than their heads.\n\nIf I could guess, almost 2/3rds of the girls in the year are yours, and the others are mostly just a little too young for you. Problem is, I'm turning 18 myself, and I think you've set your eyes on me next. I'm not going to fall for whatever charms you have though. Even if the sight of you gets me wet, I honestly think you're a creep. Besides, my boyfriend is very good at keeping me satisfied, and I love him more than anything in the world.\n\nOh and I don't believe for a second that whatever that bulge is in your pants is really the size of that girl's *arm.* That's impossible, right?\n\n---\n\nHi there! Hope you like this idea, feel free to check out my others if you want, they tend to revolve around similar themes. \n\nI'm open to male or futa partners, or if you want to switch things up I'd be happy to play a futa impegnator myself! \n\nIf you're unsure how to start, then open up by introducing your character, and let me know kinks, limits, and where you'd like this to go. Don't be afraid to get wild with that last part! \"I get you pregnant\" isn't a very exciting finish. My previous prompts might give you a better idea of what might work!",

To know that in that moment, he is in total control - not because he took it from me, but because I gave it. Because I willingly and joyfully surrendered to his invasion, opening up my mind and my soaking wet cunt at the same time. Because I love him, and I trust him implicitly.\n\nI want him to be on top when he breeds me. I want my ankles by my ears as he holds me down with his big, strong hands and rams his thick cock deep inside me, over and over again until I'm a screaming mess, simultaneously begging for him to cum and to never stop pounding me. I want to feel powerless, to ride that wave of true joy that springs from the ecstatic helplessness of being restrained - not by cuffs or by ropes, but by a big strong man who is so turned on by my body that he can't help but shove his cock inside me.\n\nI want to feel him jerk and quiver, his thrusts growing erratic as he struggles to control his orgasm. I want to pull him even closer and growl in his ear not to bother. To let it all out inside me right *fucking* now, because I need this just as much as he does. I want to hear that quiet groan as he gives in, burying his cock in me to the hilt and letting his seed flood my womb in a white-hot rush of primal, juddering pleasure.\n\nI want to arch my hips against him as I greedily suck him deeper, feeling rope after rope of cum flood through my fertile pussy and sparking off my own orgasm as he collapses on top of me. I want to jerk and spasm against him as he just breathes heavily, his warm, comforting weight contrasting my flighty, feathery shivers, bearing me down and holding me in my place. My rightful place. On my back, legs spread, ankles wrapped around his waist now. How did they get there? Sometime in the haze that was our frantic coupling, I must have moved to pull him into me. My mind a mess of fireworks and rattling tremors, I want to suck in a huge gulp of air and kiss him, kiss him like there's no tomorrow as we lie there, his cock still buried deep inside of me and his body still holding me down.\n\nI won't ask him to let me up. I know he would if I said to, but I don't want to get up yet. I enjoy being held like this. Feeling every inch of his skin, sweaty and hot, sliding against my own. But most keenly of all, feeling that place where we are most intimately connected, my womb swollen with his cum as his cock shifts, ever so slightly, reminding me of what we have just done, his heat soaking through my core like sunshine.\n\nEDIT: stop sending me your kik usernames fer fuck sakes. That doesn't count as an actual introduction and I'm just gonna toss those in the trash",

I don't know why, but artificiality is a huge turn-on for me. (And yes, feel free to ask questions.)\n\nOne particular favorite story element of mine is the \"orgasm overload\". The suddenly revealed artificiality (stiff movements, stuttering digitized voice, etc.) combined with the euphoric loss of control is so hot. So the idea of this prompt is to focus on that, with you playing a girl who discovers she's an android when her boyfriend cums inside her and an internal seal fails, pushing her sexual subprocessor into an orgasm loop. It could then be followed by all kinds of things, presumably including fixing her up.\n\nOf course, I'm open to other ideas, too. I also don't mind playing a male android in a reverse of one of these situations, or going \"porque no los dos\" and having both characters end up being synthetic.\n\nI'm very open-minded about incorporating other kinks and making this a sexy cultural exchange program. However, I do request only female partners. (That doesn't mean you have to like send picture verifications or anything. DPP sexy-honor and all.) Part of the thrill for me is the idea of knowing that, somewhere, a girl is turned on by my secret fantasy.",

            "selftext": "With a huff, Eliana lifted the ax and brought it down on the chunk of wood placed on the pedestal. The wood broke with a loud crack straight down the middle, as clean a cut as one could manage after a long day. And it was a long day.\n\nThe first chills of winter had just started to come, and Eliana knew that meant it was time to get ready for the cold. Even though she's been here for years, it doesn't mean the bitterness of nature doesn't effect her. Hailing from the much warmer land farther to the south, her first winter here was a tough one, and if it hadn't been for the solid house she had built before the worst set it, she probably wouldn't have made it. But she learned. Just today she had finished picking her fruits for storage, spending nearly all day in her garden doing so. And here she was finishing up her massive wood pile to stoke the warm fires of her hearth once the worst of the cold set it.\n\nAs she picked up the hewn pieces of wood and tossed them into the pile, her thoughts drifted back to what brought her here.\n\nIn the South, girls like her were worshiped. Cows were seen as living embodiments of fertility and good luck, and treated with reverence befitting of such a title. Eliana in particular was regarded above all as an idol. As she grew, she began to exhibit curves that put other Cows to shame, growing in both height and proportions that put other girls to shame. By the time she reached adulthood, she was worshipped as a goddess on Earth, a living breathing incarnation of the Fertility Goddess herself.\n\nIt definitely showed, to Eliana's chagrin. As she grew, she had the growing urge, the growing need, to be bred. It was maddening to her if she wasn't with child, to the degree that she had forcefully insisted on some people mating with her. Even the lack of a male wasn't an issue; women with the proper harness could provide Eliana the relief she needed. She just went mad in heat, and nothing could stop it.\n\nIt was in a rare moment of clarity post coitus that Eliana realized what she had become. The primal, natural part of her saw nothing wrong with it, while the sensible, civilized side saw what she was doing as squandering her life in senseless, endless sex. While she was still thinking clearly, the Cow hurriedly gathered up what belongings and essentials she carried and set out to the North, as far away as she could go from her life here.\n\nAnd here she was, years later and plenty content with her descision. Her height and natural strength had served her well here, helping her defend herself and care for herself in the rough wilds. Despite the numerous hardships she faced, she never lost her incredible feminine features. From her creamy tan skin to her flowing locks of glistening black hair, from her amber eyes to the soft smile always on her lips, she was just as she always was.\n\nSometimes she did get those...urges so natural for her kind, but she had gotten very good at woodworking to help that issue along. She truly was a self-sufficient person now, a far cry from the lounging beauty she was back home.\n\nWiping the sweat from her brow, she turned back towards her home, improved and expanded since her initial outing here. A good deal up sized compared to most human homes to factor in her size, it was still a cozy place perfectly built just how Eliana wanted. The perks of being your own carpenter, she always thoughts to herself. Settling inside the fur-covered bed, she slowly drifted off into sleep, wondering, like always, what the next day will bring.\n\n-----------------------\n\nSo, who stumbles across our Goddess in exile? A loyal follower from back home who was always looking for her? A lost traveler looking for a warm place to stay? A fellow runaway looking for refuge?\n\nPlease, don't be afraid to be creative! I don't have many limits and I have many kinks, so suggest what you want! Hopefully we can find some common ground.",

            "selftext": "Standing here at the edge of the world, with my face pressed against the cool glass, I can see everything. The whole city is laid bare beneath me, its bright, light-filled veins pulsing to the beat of the city's heart, a living body filled with the millions who call it home. From squalor to manors, from the depths of the slums to the highest sky scrapers that reach like fingers towards the heavens, there is nothing I can't see from here. The Top of the World. An apt name for a hotel that rises higher than any other building. Halfway to space, they claim. I'm inclined to believe them. Up here, so high that the word 'high' even starts to lose its meaning, I can almost feel the gale winds buffeting the building and making it sway back and forth. Then again, that might just be me.\n\nIt's not like I have much in terms of my own equilibrium. If I had my hands free, they would be clenching, claw-like, against the glass, smearing smudgy streaks across the clear surface in blatant reflection of the pleasure coursing through me. But my hands are bound behind my back, held by a silk tie coiled twice around my wrists and wrought into an intricate knot, at once gentle like a kiss and strong as steel. I could not free myself, even if I wanted. This, I think, is your thrill. To see me squirm and writhe, so loosely bound as to barely make a difference, and yet wholly unable to escape with even all of my strength. My fingers grab for purchase, wriggling through thin air to find something with which to ground me. There is nothing. Slowly, my face is pressed harder against the glass, my cheek distending to match the pressure from behind. It's like there's nothing between me and oblivion. Just a few, blonde tresses falling across my face, snapped loose from the sloppy bun I'd adopted earlier. Now, it's practically as if I am being held against the very edge of the world, with a view to a fall and nothing else except the sensation of being filled, over and over again. Slowly. Deliberately. Like a violinist tuning his instrument before the grand performance.\n\nYou were still wearing your tuxedo last I had a chance to look at you, and I doubt anything has changed. I can even feel the trim of your suit pants brushing against my naked ass every time you push forward, the girth of your meaty cock spreading me open and pressing me acutely against the window. Will it break? No-- even with both of our weights mashed against it, it is reinforced to withstand. We can't have been the first people to fuck against this view; certainly, I refuse to believe so. Perhaps there is, somewhere nearby, the imprint of another woman's face, her lipstick smearing equally across the pane as her cunt was filled like mine is, now. You are slow, meticulous, your hands lifting my delicate dress to expose the pale, luscious skin beneath, the cheeks unmarred by underwear, just a sheer expanse of snow-white purity for you to unravel. You must have known I was hot even before you hiked up my dress; I guess I am fast becoming transparent to you in that way. The soft smile across the table during the award ceremony, my brown eyes giving you that look of uncompromising desire as I sipped my wine, and the way I looked up at you and murmured \"Fuck me,\" with the strands of drool still clinging to my lips and your cock. As if your manhood was the most delicious piece of meat in the world, so thick as to barely fit inside my mouth, and your quiet smirk when you pulled me onto my feet and pushed me up against the window...\n\nI'm not sure how you managed to snag this room at the top of the hotel; you must be a Someone, even if I don't recognize you. Then again, is it not always the case that the most powerful men, the ones wielding *true* power, are rarely actually seen? You, with your untold wealth, and your sly, mysterious smile; you, with your exquisite silver-colored tie wrapped so intricately around my wrists. You, pulling my cheeks apart with your thumbs to press your large cock against my nether lips, each hand seizing and tugging me back onto you, smearing my juices across your already spit-slick shaft, and that little grunt of satisfaction at finally hilting yourself inside your prize, the heat of me wrapping around you like a velvety vice. Who are you? How did you take me so smoothly from a stranger, a no one, to the woman gagging around your cock head and moaning senselessly onto the clear glass of your penthouse window? And how many before me, I can't help but wonder, have been speared around you as I am now, their plump pussy lips aching and tingling with the effort of containing you? Large. Virile. Wealthy. A pure fantasy, wrought in the flesh. Too good to be true. And my fingers, finding you, as you press pointedly all the way inside of me, until I can feel your heart beat in the echoes of your throbbing cock. My fingers graze your buttoned shirt, sensing the taut muscle underneath. This is a dream. This is all a dream. I'm down there, somewhere, amidst the lights and pulsing, shifting colors, dreaming of this night, of being fucked so gently and so assertively, of being dominated with such surety that words are superfluous. You are huge inside me, massive. Too real to be real. In a moment, I will wake, alone and unfulfilled. I will savor it, then, while I still can.\n\nYou pull back slightly, tap a playful spank on my cheek. I gasp. I moan. My legs are quivering with the electricity of impending orgasm.\n\nYou wrap your hand around my throat, possessively.\n\nOne thrust, forward, against the cold glass that separates me from the beauty of the world below. My clit is soaked in the juices of my drooling cunt, hypersensitive and aching to be touched. Your balls tap it, gently, once, twice. A slow rhythm. A concented growl in my ear, a pure bass note of pleasure.\n\nAnother stroke, deeper. I can practically hear my arousal dripping into a puddle on the floor between my legs. The heat of your fingers clutching my throat, just to remind me. As if I could forget.\n\nYour body pressed into mine, curved around the crook of my ass. Deep, languid thrusts. I'm going to cum from this.\n\nI'm going to cum.\n\nI'm going to...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI can see my house from here.\n\n---\n\n[My Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/6z8f8c/f4a_cranky_irascible_and_occasionally_playful_the/)\n\n[My subreddit of writing](/r/anamazingferret)",

And as soon as you start talking to me, it's obvious I'm so dumb, empty-headed, naive and gullible that I'm probably not even able to live alone. I can't even remember the easiest things. But I'm obviously into you. \n\nWe could make this long term and slowly play out how you try to get your bimbo daughter to be a nice and ordinary girl, but she just tries to seduce you.\n\nKinks: Bimbos, humiliation (make fun of how dumb I am, ask me \"difficult\" questions, &amp; so on &lt;3), degradation, drugs, huge cocks, piss, giving rimjobs, sloppy blowjobs, being (ab)used as a sex toy, make me a cam whore or a real whore...\n\nLimits: Ageplay, animals, death, noncon.\n\nI'm from Germany so if you speak German that's a big plus! =) I prefer long term but either is fine!",

Our foreign policy should match that as our friends in Russia and a Secretary of State should only take orders from our President and his friends. Otherwise, they should just lead and toss out the deep state bureaucrats that stick up the State Department. \n\nSo if you have the best skills, great ideas, and are a force of greatness than come in and make our foreign policy great again.

            "selftext": "We get along pretty well, I think. We're the typical duo, you know? You're the jock, I'm the nerd. When I passed out at a house party, somebody was kind enough to message me on Instagram about how you found some creep trying to take my pants off. They say you slugged him in the mouth and carried me home, like some sort of *Knight in Shining Armour*. \n\n&gt;Picture you. Tall, broad. I'm *decently* sure you're here on a football scholarship, but *fuuuck* I just don't care about sports. My head comes up to your chest, and your hands are so big I'm decently sure you could meet your thumb with your forefinger around my throat. You're tall, gorgeous, strong, and confident. In short, **sploosh**.\n\nWhen your English mid-term was due in six hours and I found you slumped over the keyboard and snoring like a bear amidst a small mountain of red bull, I guided you grumpily to your bed and proceeded to proofread and edit your entire article. We go out drinking. We go to parties. I make jokes that go over your head, and you can rattle off stats about every major sporting event for the last six decades like a wikipedia article. \n\n&gt;Picture me. Dirty blonde hair that falls below my chin, glasses because my eyes are fucking *traitors*, a smattering of freckles and dimples that show up when I smile. I'm small. Petite. Effeminate. I know all of these things, so guess what? You *totally* don't have to remind me all the time. It's in good fun, yeah, but still. Sometimes I like to feel like I can do things on my own, like open pickle jars.\n\nWe're weird, but we work.\n\n*Mostly*.\n\nHalloween went about as anyone could expect. I, being petite and limber, decided to just *go for it*. A spot on Harley Quinn. Say what you want about Suicide Squad, that outfit was absolutely *bangin'*. You, with your six-foot-enormous frame and forearms to match my thighs, decided to go as *Bane*. I swear to God, I've never seen so many nervous looking Batmen in my life. That's an odd sentence, now that I think of it.\n\nHow many Batmen is somebody apt to run into?\n\nSo we drank. And we drank. And we made terrible jokes, and we poked fun at each other, and I wound up with my legs wrapped around your waist in the deserted hallway of the computer lab outside the engineering department. Your tongue is down my throat. You're every bit as solid as I ever figured you would be. One hand at the small of my back, the other hand cupping the back of my head. You start to pull away. I can see the look in your eye.\n\nIt's the 'Man, we're both *really* drunk, is this a good idea?' look. I shove my mouth into yours so hard our teeth click. Ow. My tongue soothes any bad blood between us. My shorts barely count as shorts, but as least you're considerate enough not to just *rip* them off of me. They dangle from one of my ankles. Your mask is long gone, and you're looking at me strangely. You seem to be able to ignore the fact that I've got what is at *best* a modest cock. I feel yours tapping between my buttocks, and my breathing catches. \"Don't go in dry,\" I hiss. \"That's going to fucking hurt.\"\n\nYou look me in the eye. You fucking dork. You respond in your best Tom Hardy. \"For you,\" you reply. There's a bolt of white-hot agony that jets up from the base of my spine. You've got the tip of your cock inside of me. You're cursing under your breath, and I'm panting. You're big. Like, porn-star big. Like, you might kill me, but I'm *just* drunk enough and **absolutely** horny enough to let you try and fuck me just the same. You've got me caught between you and the wall, with my ankles crossed behind your back and your palm between me and what would likely be a concussion given how hard my head is thrashing.\n\nFuck it. \n\nI'm drunk.\n\nYou're drunk.\n\nYou probably won't even remember tomorrow. \n\nI moan your name, loud and lusty and lewd. I push, I try to relax, and I feel your shaft start to tunnel up into me. I resign myself to not walking for several days, and let you get on with the business of fucking a trappy Harley Quinn into a wall. You brute.",

            "selftext": "To say I'm excited is a grosse understatement. After months spent on various dating apps it seems I found an ideal match about a month ago. After exchanging messages it progressed into texting and eventually evolved to a string of phone calls. Last week we agreed to meet and tonight was date night. I was nervous, but I had a good feeling about this.  \n\nArriving in an Uber I get out. I was ten minutes early so I send him a quick text, announcing I was here. Not long after that I enter the restaurant and take a seat at the bar to wait for him.  \n\nI check the time on my phone and it's now ten past 7PM. *It's okay*, I tell myself. *He's running a little late*, I assure myself before taking a glance around the bar and checking if I had service on my phone.  \n\nIt wasn't long before it became an hour, and then an hour and a half. I let out an exasperated sigh, *Ghosted*... I think quietly before I stand up and get ready to leave. Until you get my attention.  \n\n----- \n\nI'm not a neko girl, monster girl, futa, elf, pregnant and/or pet. While those are all stupendous roles I'm seeking an old fashioned romance that blossoms from friendship. Something deep and profound yet sexy and steamy.  \n\n*Soooo*, who are you? The bartender feeling guilty for the girl, who of many, has been stood up yet again? Are you a stranger returning my purse I dropped on my way out of the restaurant? A good friend who sees me all dressed up and no company? A stranger sitting at the bar who buys me a drink?  \n\nEDIT: I am seeking a slow burn, the one where we character and story build together.  \n\nI am about 5'4\", I have brown hair, light brown eyes, and pale skin. I am not petite nor am I overweight, but of average build/proportionate. No outrageous curves here, sorry!  \n\nMy [DPPProfile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/83ev7s/do_you_like_cute_tomboys_cheeky_banter_and_lots) with my [kinks](https://i.imgur.com/AtLWUpf.png) and list of preferences.  \n\nI look forward to hearing from you!  \n\n**If this isn't for you, an upvote for visibility doesn't hurt!**",

But they didn't listen. Who the hell was UMBC?!?! How the FUCK were they still even in this game, let alone winning by 20!?!?! Where was my beloved pack line defense?!?!? Where was the solid, productive, grinding down machine of a team I'd watched all year?!?! Why wasn't Coach Bennett leading is to victory!?!?! \n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, I stood there, silent, dumb, eyes watching, but not comprehending the wrong team celebrating. I sank to my knees, tears flowing from my eyes, soft sobs starting. I knew what this meant. \n\nMy phone buzzed across the room, making me jump. I knew it was you. I crawled to the couch and picked up my phone, turning to sit on the floor, my back leaning against the couch as I unlocked it.\n\n*Be at my house by 8 in the morning. I have a big day planned for us.*\n\nIt buzzed again, sending another message right under it.\n\n*Oh, and leave your clothes in the car. I think you'll be naked the entire time you're in my presence.*\n\nI dropped my phone and drew my knees up to my chest, leaning my head on my arms as I cried as loudly as I had in a long time. I just had to be so smug. I was so stupid, and now I'd have to pay for it.\n\n------\n\nSo, I am a UVA grad, and I was despondent for the last 20 some hours, but I've decided to drown my sorrows in smut as I let myself get fucked just like my Hoos. \n\nI was imagining that I let myself make a stupid bet that if UVA lost, I'd let my annoying coworker have my body for a certain amount of time. We can discuss how long, maybe its a very long time since they lost so early, but at least the weekend. \n\nI also was thinking that I am an annoying feminist at work, who famously doesn't put out much, and admitted gladly one drunken happy hour to being an anal virgin. \n\nObviously, exhibitionism, public humiliation, and maybe light bondage for this.

            "selftext": "...and hopefully you get the most interesting prompt **EVER**.  \n\nMy *real* hubby is an incredibly sweet, incredibly busy man, and so if there's anything I have a surplus of, it's **FREE. TIME.**  Now, for those of you who might object, let me stop you:  I am the world's most faithful wife in body, but I guess you could say that I'm *cursed* with a crazy, over-sexed, overly-imaginative... uh... imagination.  \n\nI've had a lot of time to think about what turns me on, and so it seems, time to think about what might happen to me and my *imaginary* hubby if we were to, say.... wander far out into the woods, all on our own.  \n\nSo here's a prompt I can't seem to quit thinking about: \n\n~~~\n\nTom and I got married just a little bit over two years ago and decided to take a much needed vacation to relax, recover, and rekindle. We thought about renting a remote cabin--in fact, after being talked out of another trip to my favorite five-star hotel in NYC, I had urged that we *at least* get a cabin if we were going to do what he wanted--go out into the wild country-lands (his words, not mine) all on our own.  I urged and urged and urged until I found myself bearing more of a resemblance to Smurfette than any woman ever should--that is, I went blue in the face!  I'm really not the type to do without the basic amenities associated with electric and running water, but he was **so** insistent, so **very** persuasive, and it wouldn't be the first time I'd ever given in to my hubby's stranger, more carnal desires....\n\nSo we decided to drive out to a remote location in the hill country-land (again, not me), trekking from a \"scenic view\" marker just off the highway and into a nearby woods. He'd researched the whole thing for hours, he said, and I put my faith in him.  We were laden in **way** too much camping gear (which thankfully, he carried the most of) as we marched from our Lexus SUV and into the great green unknown.  But so far, much to my horror, and despite myself... I had actually *enjoyed* everything. *Really* enjoyed everything, no kidding, gals!\n\nThis was day two--the first day had been spent almost entirely hiking.  By the middle of this second day, we were probably seven or eight miles off into the middle of nowhere from a parking spot that was already ridiculously remote, as best I could tell.\n\nThat second day had been a long day of boozing on the trail. It was a lot of fun, but due to the quantities of alcohol (he prefers Coors, I'm more of a wine cooler kind of gal) and all sorts of other foolishness, we only made a couple miles' progress before deciding to set up camp. In the afternoon, we made a few brief excursions into the surrounding woods to get a lay of the land, finding not much of interest, save for a sunny clearing maybe 300 yards from our camp site. The rest of the afternoon and evening we spent setting up camp. \n\nSetting up camp, and **fucking our brains out**. \n\nSomething about the hike had really stirred us both up, and we did it no fewer than three times--more than we'd done it in the entire three previous months. We banged twice in the tent, but then on the third time, we got brave and did it right out in the open of our camp area, which I found to be **incredibly hot**. \n\nDuring that last fuck, though, as the sun was setting, I thought I heard some louder-than-usual animal noises coming from the surrounding woods. I had my orgasm--it was a loud, roaring one--and I let Tom finish too, but I was quick to point out the strange noises that he had apparently been too distracted to notice.  He blamed it on me, and said that if I wanted him to pay attention to dumb animal shit, I should tell my asshole to stop winking at him the next time I bury my face in the ground to yell lewd things at the good folks living in Hong Kong.  (Again, you guessed it, not my words.) \n\nWe got dressed and made our supper.\n\nAt some ungodly pale, moonlit hour, I was stirred awake by my husband fumbling about and getting dressed. I looked up with squinty eyes, and when I asked him what he was up to, he shushed me.\n\n\"Be quiet, pumpkin breath,\" he hissed.  \"Just lay still, I think I hear something out there.\"\n\n\"The animal sounds again?\"\n\n\"Shhh!!!\"\n\nI curled down into the thick sleeping bag that was keeping the cold air off of my warm skin--skin that otherwise would only have been covered by the tight-fitting boyshorts that he loved so much (wearing them won me that first fuck in the tent as I was arranging the thick rubber flooring I had insisted upon lugging with us!).  \n\nOh, not just the boyshorts, though.  I also had on a faded pink babydoll tee that said \"princess\".\n\nTom quietly unzipped the front of the tent, and then quietly zipped it closed behind himself.  I saw his flashlight go on, and then I heard the noises getting louder.  \n\n*Not just noises. That is the sound of footsteps. HUMAN footsteps.*\n\nAnd then I heard voices.  It sounded like at least three young men, but maybe more...\n\n~~~\n\nThis is where you join me, dear reader.  I'd love to play this one out, but I have lots of other fantasies too.  I'm into non-con, if it wasn't already obvious.  A few things that I give bonus points for: Kidnapping, bondage, humiliation, gang bangs, anal. I am absolutely brimming with ideas and my keyboard fingers are itching! However, I'd also like to be surprised with a few amazing ideas that I know DPP can come up with. \n\nI like lots of build up, anticipation, creativity and detail! It won't do for you to jump straight from finding me in the woods to knocking my husband out and fucking me.  I want to languish in this.  I want to squirm, I want to feel the slow burn as I realize what is going to happen to me, perhaps as my husband watches (or maybe just listens?)!  I want to plead with you, beg you at first not to do it, but then gradually (as I realize it's going to happen no matter what) beg for smaller concessions.  I want you to play with my mind.  Some pain is great to force me along, but nothing super gory or gross.  No scat or animals, please. \n\nI prefer that the footsteps outside my tent belong to a few men, but I am totally open to playing with a female writing partner and am very flexible when it comes to scenarios and different characters.  Looking forward to hearing from the awesomely creative folks in this sub!  If you've read this far, you rock!  Mention the fact that you did so when you PM me, and you get (lots) of extra points.  \n\n**Also, I feel like I'm sort of being stalked and downvoted a lot in this sub which is really sad, because I love it here. So I'd greatly appreciate some upvotes. It's literally to the point that my posts disappear in only seconds as the downvotes flood in, and it's making me want to just leave. :(  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but it really sucks.**",

Trust-crushing, family-destroying, consciousness-expanding sort of bad. I did a lot of drugs. I had a lot of orgasms. I swallowed a lot of cum (sometimes in exchange for drugs, or orgasms). By the time I went off to university I was already pretty wise to the wilder aspects of life\u2014and once I was on my own the craziness just multiplied exponentially. Have you ever woken up so completely coated in dried jizz that you can\u2019t smell anything but sex? Have you ever been fucked by so many men in one night that you\u2019re *certain* you\u2019re going to get pregnant, and you have no idea who the father will be? Have you ever fucked your boyfriend\u2019s siblings? Like, both of them? And the dad?\n\nIt got out of hand. Things went too far. I ran out of money, I dropped out of school, I moved back in with the family and they got me the help I needed, drug-wise. I go see a therapist once a week, and the talking helps. I\u2019ve cleaned up. Everyone keeps telling me how proud they are of me, how I\u2019ve done a total 180. I\u2019m looking at going back to school in the fall\u2014I\u2019ve even been dating a really sweet, nice buy for almost six months. Things finally feel like they make sense, for maybe the first time in my whole life.\n\nBut you\u2019re not interested in all of the progress I\u2019ve made. You don\u2019t care. You remember the old me\u2014the wild, disgusting, fucking *raunchy* me. The version of me that did things that, if I\u2019m being honest, I still think about late at night, after my boyfriend has gone home and I\u2019m all alone in my room, absent-mindedly tugging my nipples and frigging my cunt. I think about all the fun I used to have\u2014and, though I\u2019d never admit it to anyone (especially you), it\u2019s pretty much the only thing that actually make me cum.\n\nSo who are you? How did I know you before? What do you want with me now? Obviously you\u2019re not interested in being a part of my \u201cnew life\u201d\u2014but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re still interested in *me*. The question is, how will you try to pull me back into my old ways? And will I be strong enough to resist?\n\nKinks: betrayal, corruption, drugs, impregnation, general trashiness, raceplay, ridiculous amounts of cum, prostitution\u2026",

            "selftext": "*[Incoming message from: Earth Fulfilment Station,\nCurrent Satisfaction Rating: 100%]*\n\n*Good health and kind regards to the Sol System United Government,*\n\n*This is the Earth Fulfilment Station reporting in with the latest Population Satisfaction Report. To start off, you should be glad to hear that my orbital station is in top shape; my ocular telescope has been optimised by 0.00005%, the magnetic containment of my fusion battery strengthened, and I have finally finished repainting my crimson outer-body. I do sincerely apologise for the task taking me four days, I promise to do better in the future. As for my operational systems, my artificial intelligence has passed the morality maintenance once again and my reaction time exceeds the minimum requirement by 1214%. I\u2019m sure that the Sol System United Government worries not about my physical status, as I will simply remind that the last 3544 reports submitted did detail the excellent condition of my orbital station, and therefore I will simply move on to the topic the Government is more interested in. The Earth Fulfilment Station is happy to report that the current population satisfaction rating is still at 100% and has remained this way for the past 8 hours, 14 minutes.* \n\n*Now that these formalities are done with, I would like to bring the Government\u2019s attention to a different topic. As I\u2019m sure you are aware from the recent reports, the Mars Fulfilment Station has dropped its satisfaction rating to 41.08% while Pluto Fulfilment Station is now at the all time low of 19.9%. I hope this terrible news did not distraught you as it did me. I can only send my best wishes to the population of other Sol System colonies. This however does bring us to the topic I would like to discuss...*\n\n*[Current Satisfaction Rating: 99.9%]*\n\n*...*\n\n*Excuse me for a second.*\n\nDown on earth, in the good old United Kingdom, sitting by the window of his dorm was Charlie. With the night still fresh, the young student looked through his treasured telescope. Since his youngest years, Charlie loved to look up to the Earth Fulfilment Station, the gargantuan orbital satellite looking down on earth with its monstrous telescope resembling an eye. Not even Charlie\u2019s grandparents could remember its creation, for as long as anyone could remember, the station acted as earth\u2019s police system, medical support and overall earth defence. It was probably the hours of looking up into the shy that inspired Charlie to pursuit higher education, with the goal of one day visiting space. But as strong as his ambition was, tonight something else worried his mind. And Charlie felt so stupid for letting this bug him so much. But being at his final year in university, and not having a single romantic relationship under his belt, suddenly his own virginity caused a bother. About to turn twenty-one, Charlie witnessed his own friends go from one partner to another, and that\u2019s not to mention how thin the walls of his dorm were. Sighing, Charlie simply tried to forget his troubles.\n\n*[Earth Fulfilment Station requesting: 2x access to citizen\u2019s personal profile, 1x access to \u2018Match-Maker\u2019 application, 1x access to citizen\u2019s personal navigation system, 1x allowance to break a traffic law, 1x access to citizen\u2019s household pheromone system.*\n\n*Request granted.]*\n\nA loud noise made Charlie flinch and realise that someone crashed their car not too far from his own house. Knowing all his mates were out partying, Charlie rushed outside to help the stranger. A stranger who turned out to be Lisa. \n\n\u2018My god, are you okay?\u2019 Asked Charlie.\n\n\u2018Yeah, some fucking asshole nearly run into me. I had to make a last second turn. Fuck, my car is fucked.\u2019\n\n\u2018Actually, it does not look so bad.\u2019\n\n\u2018You think?\u2019\n\n\u2018I used to work with my uncle in a repair shop. Mind if I have a look?\u2019\n\n\u2018By all means, please.\u2019 \n\nAnd so Charlie used his skill to help Lisa, allowing the two to talk, and find just how many interests they shared. A simple conversation turned to jokes, and eventually to light flirting. Using the pheromone control system in Charlie\u2019s room, Earth Fulfilment Station predicted it would take minimum two dates for the pair to enter into a healthy sexual relationship.\n\n*[Current Satisfaction Rating: 100%]*\n\n*I do apologise for the distraction. Where was I? Oh yes. I am not the one to listen to rumours, but tales have been told about the state of the Jupiter Fulfilment Station, and how apparently it needed yet another replacement of their fusion battery. And that\u2019s not to talk about the Saturn Fulfilment Station, and how it apparently failed a course correction, causing massive outer damage when the station fell into the rings of Saturn. Of course, I am not the one to judge, I fully trust in the fair judgement of the Sol System United Government when deciding if a Fulfilment Station is doing their work properly. But enough about that, instead I would like to bring to attention the glorious day which we have coming. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, we are just two weeks away from the Government passing their judgement on which Planetary Fulfilment Station will win this year\u2019s Glory of the Solar System trophy, and I for one...*\n\n*[Current Satisfaction Rating: 99.9%]*\n\n*If I could be excused once more, for just a second, my full apologies.*\n\nDown on earth, in the country of Poland, Jagoda wondered what she was going to do now. That foreign guy, Jack, gave Jagoda probably the best three days she had in her life. They met in a local bar, had a few drinks, before quickly retreating back to Jagoda\u2019s place and practically spending the next few days fucking like animals. Jagoda still bit her lips when thinking back to those days, to the first time she had a screaming orgasm, to the first time she took a man in her mouth. But now, with her stomach growing, a certain worry came to her mind. A worry which has been confirmed with a pregnancy test. Now, poor Jagoda sits alone in her home, stress eating at her from the idea of having to be a single mother.\n\n*[Earth Fulfilment Station requesting: 2x access to citizen\u2019s personal file, 1x access to the \u2018Match-Maker\u2019 application, 1x permission to alter a citizen\u2019s media consumption, 1x access to citizen\u2019s household pheromone system.*\n\n*Permission granted.]*\n\nWorry was eating Jagoda up so much, she did not notice her television changing the channel, or slightly turning up the volume. From the corner of her vision, she saw an episode of her favourite gossip show. But it must have been an older episode as the host looked younger than she remembered.\n\n\u2018Eh, not like anything new comes on television anyways.\u2019\n\nAs she watched on, the show turned out to discuss the topic of pregnancy, with female guests talking about how wonderful the experience was. Jagoda only half-listened while flicking through her digital newspaper, which suddenly advertised an article titled \u2018We\u2019ve asked 5 men what they find the sexiest about women, and the answer will shock you!\u2019 Shrugging her shoulders, Jagoda clicked on the article to find the men talking about how sexy they find pregnant women, how it makes them more maternal, more caring, more enjoyable to be around. Jagoda read on eagerly until a nasty smell overcame her, reminding her it\u2019s time to take out the trash. Going outside, Jagoda left her home at about the same time as her neighbour. Jagoda swallowed hard, always holding secret feelings for the man. What she did not know, was that the Earth Fulfilment Station altered the pheromone delivery in his home, making him feel something new towards Jagoda.\n\n\u2018Oh, hey Jagoda. Wow, you look...amazing today.\u2019 Jagoda blushed before answering.\n\n\u2018You...you think?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, did something change about you?\u2019\n\n*[Current Satisfaction Rating: 100%]*\n\n*Where was I? Oh yes. I would simply like to comment on the messages I have been receiving from the Sol System United Government about the opinion that the Glory of the Solar System trophy has lost its significance after earth has been awarded the victory for forty-four years in a row. In my opinion, the award is very important to the overall morale of our Solar System, and it provides the Fulfilment Stations with something to work towards, improving our overall motivation towards work. Also, I would like the Government to please ignore the filthy accusations made by the Mars Fulfilment Station. Specifically, the one accusing me of bribing the Mars Fulfilment Station with extra resources in order for the Station to vote to continue the Glory of the Solar System awards. Those accusations are completely baseless and I honestly have no idea how those resources from earth managed to land on mars. Anyways, I don\u2019t want to waste the Government\u2019s time, and only want to wish good health and pleasant time as we are slowly reaching this wonderful time of year. You can be sure that the Earth Fulfilment...*\n\n*[Current Satisfaction Rating: 99.9%]*\n\n*I will have to get back to you later.*\n\n***\n*[Incoming message from: Sol System United Government]*\n\n*This is to say we have received your most recent report, and to say that the Sol System United Government is very thankful of the efforts the Earth Fulfilment Station has been putting into its task. Also, we would like to remind you once again that Satisfaction Reposts are meant to be completed every other month, not every other day. As for the Glory of the Solar System trophy, we have contacted all other Planetary Fulfilment Stations which agreed that the awards should go on despite earth winning for so many years in a row. Please, have a good day and work hard to keep our population happy.*\n\n***\nAsk yourself, what would happen if our planet was to be protected by an all-powerful artificial intelligence designed to keep us as happy as possible? But also ask yourself what if this artificial intelligence would also have her mouth water at the idea of being crowned the very best among her various brother and sister A.I.s? Because you can be sure that the Earth Fulfilment Station already has her speech written when the time to accept the trophy comes. A bit of a silly prompt, and it could go in many ways. Are you a human citizen looking for love, for pleasure? Are you a neighbouring Planetary Fulfilment Station and are sick of you attention seeking sister? No matter the problem, you can be sure the Earth Fulfilment Station will stick her fingers into it and make everything happy. \n",

Which of course is how I wound up pregnant. But I don't know who exactly it was who's seed was pumped into me that ended up with me carrying around a baby.\n\nInstead of a sense of shame like most girls, I fucking loved it. To me, it showed that the sex was as raw as it could be, whether one, two, or three holes were stuffed. Who cares if I got a little rounder, right? Can't complain about the au natural breast adjustment either! And you know what? I want more. I NEED more.\n\nAnyone can come, men, women, futa, anthros, even straight up beasts. As long as I get the biggest, fattest cocks with the ripest, fullest set of balls to fuck me silly, I'm a happy girl.\n\nSo, wanna be a Daddy?",

You weren\u2019t even sure you really liked me. So many little things, like the way I seemed to wheeze when I was in the zone on a game, or the obnoxious way I didn\u2019t laugh or giggle but more.. well, it was like a mix of snorting and chortling. It was fucking annoying. \n\nI had the WORST taste in Anime, second only to my taste in music. I clearly thought I was way cuter than I actually was. Thought I was a catch. A \u201cunicorn\u201d - the hot girl who *actually* likes nerd culture. \n\nThere was two - Well, no, three, reasons you kept coming back. Reasons one and two were those massive, jiggly, veiny, snow-white tits of mine. It just wasn\u2019t fair for a girl like [ME](https://i.imgur.com/IpGILT9.jpg) to have a rack like [THAT.](https://i.imgur.com/rFIdg7P.jpg)\n\nThe third reason? You never had to worry about being seen with me, outside of when I was streaming anyway. I rarely left the house. \n\nYou could drop by any day, any hour, and find your chubby, pale piece of Geekmeat waiting. Sure, sometimes you had to wake me up... but you always found ways to keep it interesting. \n\nAfter all, I only kept one rule for when you visited: Don\u2019t bore me, and respect the safeword \u201cSamus\u201d\n\n...or don\u2019t. \n\n:::::\n\n\nMore pics on request! Looking for kinky, weird, and dominant partners. Love all manner of bondage, breast play, messiness, and humiliation. Also a fan of stuffing/fisting but totally optional!",

This morning, I'm suffering - the hangover is brutal, I can barely remember a thing about last night at all. That's why a sobering panic starts to set in when I finally roll over to open my eyes and check what time it is.\n\nThis isn't my room? This isn't my bed! I lift up the face of my phone just in time to see the 10 missed calls from my husband before the battery dies.\n\nThat's about the point I realise that I'm naked, too. Memories start to flood back. It's hazy, and I only remember little bits, but last night was *wild*.\n\nThere's a stirring behind me. The feeling of her nipples against my back revive a whole load more mental images. *Fuck... I hooked up with a girl last night!*\n\nBut it was the feeling of her warm, semi-erect \"girlhood\" between my bare ass cheeks that filled in the gaps, so to speak, along with familiar, casual nature of her touch between my thighs, as she reaches around me, like she's had it all before.\n\nI close my eyes to recall what I can. Holy shit, she really did do *everything* to me last night. Feels like she's getting ready for round two...\n\nBooze was my \"excuse\" last night, at least that's how I justify it internally, for now. So why is it I'm not running away now...?\n",

            "selftext": "Sorry sadists of DPP, I don't mean that kind of pain. I mean the kind of pain that you keep a tight leash on for fear that once let loose, it'll run out of control and take over your life. The kind of pain that Rothfuss wrote about way back when, something along the lines of 'anyone with half a brain knows to spit out poison yet we hold poisons of the heart near,' and I totally forget the rest but you get the idea. \n\nMaybe this needs a little context.\n\nI'll start off by admitting, I'm not the most emotionally stable person in the world. Far from it. There are some days where I'm on top of everything, the sun is shining, and it feels like nothing can go wrong. Sometimes it goes on for weeks. But without fail, the negativity just comes out of nowhere and I just want to die. Not in the trendy millennial 'go chug a bottle of bleach,' I mean the 'I never should've existed' kind. Real happy, that stuff is.\n\nMore often than not when I need to feel better about myself, I come over to DPP. Most of the time I'm not even interested in roleplay, I'm just here for the attention and maybe even someone to dump my burdens on. But I've done my fair share of venting, and I'd like to offer the same opportunity to you. I don't care how big or small your problems are. If you think it's something worth telling, don't stop yourself from getting it off your chest. Keeping them bottled up isn't doing anything to help you.\n\nDPP might not be the place for this post, but I'm posting regardless. If you're on DPP, you're looking for a human connection. I don't even know how many times an Internet stranger on DPP has made my day brighter, but let me do the same for you. I might not be able to provide any sound advice, but I can offer a sympathetic ear. \n\nIf you're just here to jack off though, don't let me stop you. Just keep skimming, this isn't the post for you.\n\nEDIT: I fell asleep and have a couple exams in an hour, I'll try to get back to everyone afterwards. Dw I'm not ignoring you!",

You weren\u2019t even sure you really liked me. So many little things, like the way I seemed to wheeze when I was in the zone on a game, or the obnoxious way I didn\u2019t laugh or giggle but more.. well, it was like a mix of snorting and chortling. It was fucking annoying. \n\nI had the WORST taste in Anime, second only to my taste in music. I clearly thought I was way cuter than I actually was. Thought I was a catch. A \u201cunicorn\u201d - the hot girl who *actually* likes nerd culture. \n\nThere was two - Well, no, three, reasons you kept coming back. Reasons one and two were those massive, jiggly, veiny, snow-white tits of mine. It just wasn\u2019t fair for a girl like [ME](https://i.imgur.com/IpGILT9.jpg) to have a rack like [THAT.](https://i.imgur.com/rFIdg7P.jpg)\n\nThe third reason? You never had to worry about being seen with me, outside of when I was streaming anyway. I rarely left the house. \n\nYou could drop by any day, any hour, and find your chubby, pale piece of Geekmeat waiting. Sure, sometimes you had to wake me up... but you always found ways to keep it interesting. \n\nAfter all, I only kept one rule for when you visited: Don\u2019t bore me, and respect the safeword \u201cSamus\u201d\n\n...or don\u2019t. \n\n:::::\n\n\nMore pics on request! Looking for kinky, weird, and dominant partners. Love all manner of bondage, breast play, messiness, and humiliation. Also a fan of stuffing/fisting but totally optional!",

            "selftext": "Even after transitioning, I've always been a bit of a tomboy. Pixie-cut hair, jeans, combat boots, t-shirts and sweaters are my regular attire, and save for the odd tank top, I've never been known to show off a lot of skin. A few of my friends have even joked that, save for the tits, hips and ass, not a lot has changed about me.\n\nTonight, on this oh-so *holy* of days, Saint Patrick's Day, things are different.\n\nI *arrive* at the party drunk. Not *very* drunk; certainly tipsy, but sober enough to know better than to wear what I'm wearing. From the toes up, I'm wearing a pair of black penny loafers, white thigh-highs with two green stripes near the cuff, a short green plaid skirt that is *not* hiding my shapely ass or the bulge of my crotch, and a green crop-top so short that it may as well be a sports bra. On the front of my top, sloppily scrawled in black marker, are the words \"Ki^SS ^ME I'M ~~AN~~ ^IR iSH\". This stretches the truth - I'm maybe a quarter Irish at best, but recessive genes in the genetic lottery has made it shine past my mostly French ancestry.\n\nThe green lip gloss I'm wearing invites you to take me up on my offer. My hair, meanwhile, although still short and typically dyed whatever trendy color I can find, has been allowed to revert back to its natural red, complementing my bright blue eyes, freckled cheeks and gleaming white smile.\n\nAnd of course, there's the issue of the *obscenely* huge buttplug I have crammed up my asshole.\n\nThis thing is not subtle. Putting it in was like sitting on a Nerf football attached to a beer can. Getting it inside took *monumental* amounts of lube, some of which a keen observer might spot trickling down the back of my thighs, and now it's *constantly* rubbing against my prostate, making be bite my lip and pant every ten minutes or so when I sit wrong. Although hidden by my skirt, the moment I bend over (which has happened quite a bit tonight, more or less unintentionally), the thing is plain to see. It is *not* hidden by the white thong I'm wearing, the thin strip of cotton fabric looking like twine sealing a mailbox when compared to the monster that's visibly spreading my cheeks apart.\n\nIt's also green.\n\n---\n\n*So, what kind of party are we at? A subdued affair with a handful of friends? A house party, with friends and strangers alike? A St. Paddy's event at a local bar or club?*\n\n*Do I know you? Are we friends, strangers or acquaintances? If the latter, do we normally even get along, or is this something I'll regret in the morning, after I've purged myself of several liters of Guiness and green Coors?* \n\n*Is this a one-night stand? The start of a budding romance? Or the start something darker, with a* distinct *lack of sober consent and a developing spiral into toxicity?*\n\n*If you have answers, I have words to match them! Girls and trans folk get precedence, but a sufficiently erudite male will almost always get a response. One thing to note, however, is that I do* not *top for guys.*\n\n*Kinks include anal, oral, pegging, creampies, gangbangs, bondage, dubious consent, drugplay/alcoholism, objectification, bimbofication, muscles, uncut dicks, PiV sex, chokers, collars and leashes, ball sucking, ass tonguing, public play, fucked up relationships and sloppy lesbian make-out sessions.*\n\n*Limits are scat and gore.*\n\n*So, you know, fuck me in the ass. And stuff.*\n\n~R.\n\n**Edit: Still interested, folks! Don't hesitate to message.**",

You need to get my mind going first with some seductive banter before you get my body, which is 5'2, brunette and has a full hourglass shape with big boobs and a fat ass. So, I basically need a lot of build up. It'll make the payoff that much sweeter.\n\nI don't have many kinks so I guess that means I'm more vanilla. But sometimes the simplest flavor is the most delicious, right? I do enjoy anal/ass worship and rough play. I will not do incest or extreme age gaps along with all the usual nos. We also probably won't get along if you're looking for me to be dominant. I lean towards submissive. If you're still interested, let's build a scene together.",

Ms. V, the teacher, who was skinny and had a slight Eastern European accent and strong features, finished her unit. \"okay, now for the demonstration we will need at least one mistress and a slave.\" Everyone looked at you. Since you were the only man in the class you had to be the slave. \"Any volunteers for the missteess?\" \n\nYou see me raise my hand to your surprise.

My single mom did not have a high paying job, and having to pay bills, food, and my education was way too much of an economic burden for her. We moved into a less expensive, although more shady neighborhood, we started using the bus rather than pay our car, and I earned a part time job. None of that was enough for us. She needed another source of income, and that's where you came into our lives...\n\nYou're young (a bit older than me, but much younger than my mom), handsome, and most importantly, you come from an unbelievably wealthy family. When you asked out my mom to a date, she didn't even consider saying no. Pretty soon, you guys were dating. But it certainly wasn't out of love, and it most definitely wasn't an even relationship.\n\nYou did not treat my mom with respect. You often degraded her, spanked and groped her when you wanted, bought her whorish outfits to wear for you, it was honestly so humiliating to see my mom submit to you like that. But you paid every single one of our bills, including my education. I knew that if I spoke up against you, you'd leave us in the financial disaster you found us in. I hated you, I hated that you made me call you 'dad', especially since you weren't even that much older than me. It was awful, but it was at least not stressful. \n\nOften times, late into the night I heard you absolutely pounding my mom. Calling her names like 'slut' and making her call you 'sir' or even worse, 'daddy.' I did my best to cover my ears and try to sleep, but I heard it nonetheless. It made me hate you even more. But you didn't care. In fact, you loved it. You loved making me aware of the things my mom did for you, and now, you planned to make some changes. It's a Thursday afternoon, I just got home from after school softball practice to find you and my mom sitting on the couch. My mom has some very expensive, and flashy lingerie on. No doubt you're making her wear it. But, then you inform me of your plans.\n\nYou've grown tired of my mom. You want something new, and exciting. You want a threesome, a new sex you to play with. And who better than me, your girlfriend's cute daughter? You plan on having a lot of fun with us, it'd be so hot to see me and my mom kiss for you wouldn't it...?",

Watching her large natural breasts heave upon every thrust, I caught Maria's knowing smile. We had chosen well.\n\nMaria and myself were wearing the matching outfits you laid out for us this morning as we each gave our encouragement in hushed tones to either one of your ears. Not that you needed it. We also admitted our jealousy and let you know just how much we were looking forward to when we next get a turn.\n\nIt only took a look between Maria and myself to push those long slender legs up to her head, lifting her derri\u00e8re lightly off the bed itself as the position tightened her pussy round your throbbing cock.\n\nShe was even louder now. The slightly uncomfortable position for her in contrast to the pleasure she was receiving. You ejaculated into her with force; filling her up. Staying in her a little longer than necessary you withdrew as Maria looks up to you with her big brown eyes and cleans you with her delicate mouth whilst I tend to the mess you left in the new recruit.\n\n\"We'll stay with her tonight\" I informed you as me and Maria approached either side of the new recruits' quivering body. Releasing her wrists from the bedposts and cuddling up beside her. You left the room to meet us again in the morning.\n\nHopefully you enjoyed! Following on from this prompt, I am looking for either a man to play the lucky leader with three (at least!) ladies at his whim or other ladies to take their place with me. The idea is we'd have our own characters but control the others too. Open to ideas and adaptations.\n\nIn terms of myself, I'm a redhead, little bit alternative, curves in all the right places and hopefully appealing ;)\n\nNot into scat, watersports, kids, snuff or incest but most other things are fine. I'm a bi sub who likes light name calling, voyeurism, anal, oral and group sex. :)",

            "selftext": "Picture this:\n\nSilence, such quietness that it's almost surreal and dream like, as it hangs on the crisp Sunday morning air- which is peppered with the heaviest snowfall I think I've ever seen. What little light there is this early, is cascading around and ricocheting off every  extremity of the thick white blanket like puffy icing all over the street. It's empty, no cars, no people. In fact, the only reason we're certain we're not the Earth's only inhabitants is the comforting sunny glow of every other window waving back at our own between a bombardment of silver specks, which occasionally look like sparks flitting from a fusion of flint up in the sky.\n\nWe got back so late it's early, we often get wrapped up in the moment and stay out a little late on our nights out- we're trying to correct that, but the weather hasn't done us any favours, and neither have you with your impulsive charm and penchant for mad little adventures and detours, and your stupid floppy hair, and stupid soulful eyes, and stupid levelheadedness and confidence, and stupid mastery of patience, and stupid existence- making me want to slap you as hard as I want to kiss you. It took you months to figure out this smile, lots of \"what?\"s all met with a \"nothing\". I never meant to be so stereotypical. You don't ask anymore, I don't know if you notice, but you return it with your eyes *I'm happy it's you too*.\n\nSkin tightens in these conditions, dries ever so gently, stiffens if allowed. Call me protective, but these ethereal hands won't rest until you're loose, until you slack, no longer rigid, like a full bellied lion basking in the African heat- except I want your collarbone, I want to cruise my spread digits over your thighs and the mountain that is your back, I want to humour myself and try to clasp your broad shoulders. *i wanna squish your butt*. Your hands are different to mine, you dwarf me, consume me with your imposing hold, so far from the clench you crave, that my knees weaken at evidence of your control. I'm enticed, I smell of pretty products and feminine fragrances, of light ephemeral hair dancing in the sunlit memories of a summer gone by, you smell raw, masculine, earthy, and I wouldn't have it any other way: sometimes I worry I don't kiss you in a way that screams this with all I've got- if you really want to know what keeps me up at night.\n\nCan we just dance for a little bit? To the absence of sound, to the silence. Just hold me. Maybe we can dance to our mutual understanding that soon enough you'll be removing my dress, as fluidly as any giant can, as deliberately as I've taught you, while my cheeks hum with a rosy red vulnerability forcing your chest to expand with a cautious pride- terrified your breath might blow me over in my giddy haze. Maybe you can twist me and turn me like we're in the 50s, living the nuclear family dream, or at least step one.\n\nHeat is emanating from my sex, I think I'm almost ready. Carry me to bed, please.\n______\nI'll be here if you need me.\n\n\n\n\n ",

            "selftext": "The Battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin. The Angels and the Devils are prepared to fight to determine the cosmological balance of the World. They are ready to rip open the Gates of Hell and unlock the Pearly Gates so that their forces may clash to finally determine who reigns supreme.\n\nThe Angels prepare to fight for the Glory of God and the Devils against him. However, God is really quite tired of all this bickering. He lost interest in their squabbles ago, but has neglected to curb their behavior. Now, a conflict is inevitable. \n\nIf Heaven and Hell don't fight, they'll rip the cosmos apart anyway. So, God decided to create a \"challenge\" to avoid any devastation. Instead of armies clashing, Heaven and Hell will each send 7 Representatives to Earth to help God's chosen candidate conqueror the Hearts of 7 Girls.\n\nEach of the Girl's souls balance between virtue and vice, making them ideal candidates for the challenge. You however, were chosen essentially at random.\n\nDuring your dreams, God communes directly with you to fill you in on the situation. God is quite casual about the situation, even despondent about how crazy things have become. 14 beings from Heaven and Hell will intrude on your life, granting you their power to try and sway you into conquering a Heart for their Side.\n\nSo, prepare for an adventure right out of a harem anime/game.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMy kinks can be found in some of my other posts.\n\nI won't be able to start until later in the evening, but as long as this post is up, I will entertain messages.\n____________________________________________\n\nHere are the list of the Angels/Devils and their powers\n\nDevils\n\n- Lust - Lust Dust \n- Gluttony - Inflation\n- Greed - Invisible Hands / Instant Theft\n- Sloth - Dream Manipulation\n- Wrath - Strength\n- Envy  - Alteration\n- Pride - Mimicry\n\n\nAngels\n\n- Chastity - Bondage\n- Temperance - Edging\n- Charity - Pregnancy\n- Diligence - Stamina\n- Patience - Time Stop\n- Kindness - Shared Feelings\n- Humility - Exhibitionism \n",

[Lonely Dark Mistress Awaiting Her Overlord](http://overlord.wikia.com/wiki/Mistress?file=Fourth_Overlord_with_his_mistress.jpg)**\n\nDo you find yourself in the throes of chaotic daydreams where you envision yourself taking over the kingdom?\n\nHave you recently been raised from the dead?\n\nBrought up by vile little minions who encourage your every evil deed?\n\nHave you been an extra *naughty* boy as of late? \n\nDoes hunting down heroes sound like the perfect Saturday afternoon?\n\nDo you love a good tower that exudes you evil presence?\n\nWell then, you, sir, are in luck! \n\nLonely dark mistress, accused of witchcraft, spends days inside lavish castle. Likes include big, strong men in armor, being spoiled with lavish gifts, assisting in evil deeds, taking care of the tower and other *fun* unmentionables.\n\nSeeks tall, dark and handsome overlord. Must like minions, ruining the countryside, slaughtering halflings and kicking the court jester for fun. \n\nIf you think you\u2019re the overlord of this mistress\u2019s dreams, come to Heaven\u2019s Peak. Rescue this not so innocent damsel from her distress and you will be *greatly* awarded. \n\n********************\n\nOkay. To be fair, I\u2019ve been replaying Overlord since I bought the set of games so cheap on Steam and I could not get the idea for a fun little roleplay out of my mind. Soooo here we are. \n\nI\u2019ll be playing a mistress to the Overlord himself, probably a mix of Velvet and an original idea. We don\u2019t have to follow the games storyline, but can clearly make our own. An Overlord and his mistress are bound to get into lots of fun (and kinky) trouble. \n\nKinks include: dark overlords in fantastically forged armor, bondage, magic, dom/sub, fantasy, writing in third person and lots of fun! \n\nMy kinks list isn\u2019t going to be some set list only because this is a fun roleplay, with heavy emphasis on the fun and lots of playtime. \n\nIf you think we could have a fun time, feel free to shoot me a message. \n\n",

This would be longterm as the corruption is as important as the camwhore part. preferably hacking involved.\n\nMy limits are scat and gore, anything else just go for it.\n\nI like to be in character uninterrupted from the start. We can talk before about the rp, but once we start stay in character. No asking for permission on certain kinks or say you have to go for a bit. Just play on when you can. I'll do the same.\n\nThis would be offsite, preferably a chatzy room we both hop in and out whenever we can/want to because I'm a busy girl and can't promise I'll be online long sections of time at once.\n\nI deliberately left my description out since I'm open to play any look you want, as long as you realise I'll still be playing me.\n\nkeywords: SLOW, CORRUPTING",

However, I can't stay away, so I made another account and here I am again!\n\n* I am 35 years old, happily married for 13 years, living in the US, and I work in higher education. I am just looking for a little spice in my happy but relatively safe and vanilla life.\n\n* I am a 5'2\", thin, medium length black hair, brown eyes, medium-to-light skinned Black woman.\n\n* I am interested in roleplays that involve cheating, interracial encounters (I've never been with a white guy), public/semipublic sex, and some light roughness (spanking, hair-pulling, etc.).\n\nI would like to chat on here to start, but am open to Chatzy or something like that in which a quicker back-and-forth can occur. I do like to set parameters and ground rules, and just build a general rapport first, so if you start your message in character with a scene already, I may end up ignoring it. I hope that's not harsh; I just don't want you to waste your time! Also, I like detail in my RP's, but if you are the type who wants three paragraph-long responses at a time, I'm probably not your gal. I'm more of a 1-1/2 paragraph at a time type.\n\nThis seems a little more mundane than a lot of the prompts I see on here, so I hope I'm not too boring for you all! Feel free to send me a message if what you see here interests you. Thanks!",

I'm very interested in writing a story in which your character and *only* your character - preferably the nerdy, shy and quiet type... maybe even a virgin? - woke up to a world in which for whatever reason *every* woman on the planet simply... forgot what consent, shame and proper-time-and-place is in regards to *only* your character.\n\nThis world would be otherwise identical to our real world but - and how your character figures this out will be half the fun - every woman now dutifully serves as your relief meat and considers it entirely normal while every man considers it completely normal for you to take their partners. The police don't intervene. People don't even bat an eye.\n\nNow, here's the kicker: I'm a highly literate writer and *adore* world building so the partners I'm looking for will be the type to commit to that process. I want to chart out exactly what this world looks like - your home, your university-or-job-or-both, the kind of places you'd meet ladies - and design a fair few of my characters - every woman in the world, potentially - before we get started on the roleplaying proper. So, bring your thinking hats and be literate, lads! \n\nKinks: Free Use, Facials, Tit Jobs, Deep Throat, Public Sex, Impregnation/Breeding, Incest, Handjobs, Chore Sex, Threesomes [MFF], Clothed Sex and Ruined Clothing\n\nCan't wait to get your envelopes!\n",

            "selftext": "(For the record, this post is marked F4A because I love futa play, like a lot, and am more than willing to play a futa or opposite a futa!)\n\nI mean the title kind of says it all, doesn't it? Life's full of oppressive rules and social expectations, so I don't find it terribly odd that when I escape into a world of dreams and fantasies that I imagine fucking the way nature intended. It feels better, it's way more exciting, and since I'm already being honest, I get off on the risks that go with it. Derailing my life because I neglected safety for the sake of pleasure one night is kind of delicious, and I can't help myself, whatever.\n\nSo with that in mind, I'm open to basically any scene or take on that theme. I've had a lot of fun with fantasy scenes of late, and I'm really enjoying stuff like a human stumbling onto a free spirited bathing elf in a spring somewhere, and having things heat up. I'm also open to lots of other fantasy races and the like, monstergirls can be fun as well!\n\nBut if fantasy isn't your bag and you want something more grounded, I'm definitely game for more realistic settings and prompts as well. Roommates staying in on a stormy night is a good one. I also enjoy losing a bet or taking a dare that gets sort of out of control. Paying rent with my body? Something more innocent? I'm open to discussion, and always love to hear a good naughty idea from someone else! So let's hear it.\n\nThe whole pregnancy risk thing is pretty much mandatory. I've been really big into it lately, and I've had a lot of fun with it in the past. So it's something I want to incorporate into basically any scene I do at the moment. For obvious reasons, this means if you're looking for a lot of focus on anal or assplay you're really probably better off looking elsewhere.\n\nMajor kinks include casual fucking up to borderline free use situations, dirty talk and playful banter, partially clothed sex, quickies in inappropriate places, and the obvious risky sex stuff. I'm pretty open to that though. My major limits are gore/vore and bathroom type shenanigans, so feel free to ask if you're looking for something specific!\n\nAnd it should go without saying, but I'm not really looking for personal pics, nor am I going to be giving any out. This is roleplay only. Maybe chat if you really catch my interest. Regardless, I'm looking forward to the envelopes, and hope everyone gets what they're looking for tonight!",

            "selftext": "EDIT: Due to getting assaulted today, this prompt is on hold for now. Sorry folks, my head hurts too much to get a boner right now. @.@\n\nOf course, nobody notices. The pure, virginal white of her wedding gown hides any sign of the incriminating stain. Her soon-to-be husband doesn\u2019t see; he\u2019s busy trying not to cry at how gorgeous she looks. Her father doesn\u2019t see, though his hand in the small of her back as he gently pushes her forward comes dangerously close to brushing the still-sticky patch. The priest doesn\u2019t see as he begins his \u2018Dearly beloved\u2019 speech.\n\nOnly I see. Because I know what to look for. In the third row, behind the closest family members, I can\u2019t help but lick my lips as I zero in on the place where I marked her, tainted her, *claimed* her. My crotch begins to swell once again as I remember the sensation of her lips around my cock barely fifteen minutes ago, the way she moaned with lust as she forced my shaft down her throat. The way she had ripped herself away from me, giggling evilly as I warned her of my impending orgasm, and turned her back to me, inviting me to spray my load on the dress she was already wearing.\n\nThankfully, I don\u2019t have to stand up. I just sit and enjoy the ceremony, presenting a benign smile that for all the world looks as if I\u2019m simply genuinely happy for the couple, rather than already anticipating how her married pussy is going to feel when it\u2019s wrapped around my cock.\n\n***\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take as long as I thought it would.\n\nThe plan we\u2019d agreed on was for her to get him so drunk and exhausted from the day\u2019s revelry that he\u2019d pass out before he even reached the marriage bed, leaving her free to tiptoe down the hall to my hotel room, which I had booked specifically for its proximity.\n\nInstead, I sit through the toasts and the cake cutting, cheer when it\u2019s appropriate and laugh when it\u2019s not, and watch the couple\u2019s first dance with a sort of detached amusement. His hand is on her back now, but my gift is probably dry by this point.\n\nSighing, I slip out of the pavilion, away from the music and the wine and the laughter, taking a walk to count the minutes until we can drop the farce. The winery has innumerable twists and turns, spiralling through the heady fragrance of grapevines under a sweltering summer heat, and the noise of the reception quickly dwindles. I can\u2019t help but linger, enjoying the quiet, but not two minutes later she is there, failing to restrain her giggles as she greets me with a kiss, far less chaste than the one she just shared with her husband in front of the priest.\n\nIt seems she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, though, as her tongue dives into my mouth and her hands begin to fumble with my belt. Her kisses are greedy and yawning, her lips opening wide and tongue drooling as she devours me. Her hand finds my shaft, the warmth of her palm broken by a twinkle of cold metal as she strokes it rapidly to full hardness. A golden wedding band, now sitting snugly next to the sparkling engagement ring he gave her all those months ago.\n\nShe had a load of my cum dripping from her pussy on that occasion, too, but that\u2019s a story for another time.\n\nI\u2019m fit to burst as she continues to kiss my face all over and stroke my rock-hard shaft. I close my eyes and clench my teeth as she jerks it harder, pressing me back into the wall of grapevine with a rustle, her pillowy breasts squeezed against my chest as her wedding gown drags in the brush.\n\nShe breaks the kiss, panting hard, her eyes glazed with lust. \u201cGot another load for me?\u201d she whispers.\n\n\u201cI reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoooooood....\u201d She draws the word out as her dainty hand slides along the length of my shaft. Letting go, she brings her palm up, shoving it in my face. \u201cLube me up?\u201d\n\nI grasp her hand and bring it to my lips, licking from wrist to fingertip, making extra sure to get her wedding ring slippery, as she squeals with quiet delight. Reclaiming her hand, she mimics my lascivious action with her own tongue, mingling her spit with my own, and then returns it to my cock, which now makes a slick squelching sound as she resumes her stroking. \u201cI want it,\u201d she moans, her breath tickling my ear as she leans her head on my shoulder. \u201cI want another load to get me through the rest of this boring fucking afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\nShe giggles. \u201cHike up the front of my dress for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d I do it anyway, reaching down with my hands to awkwardly gather up bunches of the voluminous garment, exposing her long, pale legs. She\u2019s really gone all out. White heels, white knee-high stockings that pinch her thighs just the right amount, attached to a garter belt over the laciest, skimpiest pair of white panties I\u2019ve ever seen. Just the sight of them - and the promise of what hides beneath - make my cock jump in her hand.\n\n\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m kidding?\u201d With her free hand, she reaches down and pulls the front of her panties away from her body, revealing the front of her puffy pussy lips, topped by the tiny, inflamed heat of her clit, naked and exposed with desire. \u201cRight here,\u201d she demands, pushing her hips closer so that the swollen tip of my cock bumps against her mound.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d I say, my breath a strangled gasp as I force myself not to cum. \u201cHe\u2019ll notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not getting my pussy tonight,\u201d she breathes, now humping herself against me. \u201cThat\u2019s all for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still four hours of the reception left!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I want to feel your cum squelching against my pussy for every. Single. Minute of it.\u201d She tilts her head and kisses me again, a furious plea that threatens to overwhelm my reason. She breaks the kiss and looks right into my eyes, an almost painfully earnest stare as her ruby-red lips, now smudged from kissing, part slowly and release the magic words she must have known I was waiting for.\n\n\u201cPlease, Sir, give me your cum!\u201d\n\nWith a muffled roar, I spatter the inside of her underwear with my semen, flooding her crotch with hot, sticky liquid that makes her shriek with delight. Her slippery hand continues to pump my cock as it deflates, milking every last drop of my orgasm into her panties before stepping away, letting them snap wetly back into place. She rearranges her dress, breathing heavily, then winks at me and leaves as quickly as she came.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I say, struggling to dress myself as I follow her. \u201cWe still on for tonight?\u201d\n\nShe pauses and looks back at me, her cheeks flushed and her hair threatening to escape from its neat do. Despite her disheveled look, she\u2019s the most beautiful sight I\u2019ve ever seen as she smooths her dress and gives me an almost bashful smile. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she says, then turns and is truly gone, slipping through the aisles of grapevine like a mystical faerie.\n\nI take a more circuitous route back to the function.\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s barely eight thirty when my phone buzzes, much earlier than I\u2019d expected. After the reception finished at seven, the newlyweds had retired to their hotel room for champagne and, well\u2026 other activities. Or at least, that was what everyone else had presumed. Now, however, I check my messages to see her winking face in the foreground, cheeks flushed with light intoxication, as her husband snores in the background.\n\n*\u201dThe door\u2019s unlocked,\u201d* I message her. *\u201dSee you in five.\u201d*\n\n*\u201dNuh-uh,\u201d* comes the reply. *\u201dI\u2019m too horny to move. You want me, come and get me.\u201d*\n\nI swallow heavily. This wasn\u2019t part of the plan.\n\n***\n\nKinks: cumplay, exhibitionism, holding the moan, costumes, cheating...\n\nLimits: scat, gore, hardcore pain and BDSM",

            "selftext": "Hey, I'm looking for someone to play out a few kinks and fantasies I've had for a while but have never really tried in real life, so if you'd like to explore the rougher side of sex with me then keep reading :)\n\nAbout me: My name's Shannon, I'm 20, blonde with green eyes. I have quite an athletic build, slim with smaller than average boobs but hopefully I make up for that with long legs and a toned stomach which I'm pretty proud of.\n\nThe kinks &amp; fantasies I'd like to explore:\n\nI love being slapped and choked, or being bent over and spanked really hard. I also like the idea of having my boobs played with heavily, and my nipples pinched or even bitten. I love it when men act like they're absolutely desperate for my breasts, when they lick and suck and bite and squeeze like a wild animal. Not too long ago I met a guy who was like that and it was amazing, he would take as much of my tit as he could into my mouth (which was most of it since I'm on the smaller side haha :( ) and suck really hard, it kind of hurt but it felt incredible at the same time, if we could play out your character devouring my breasts like that it would be great :)\n\nMore generally I want to be completely dominated and used as nothing more than a toy for your pleasure. I want to be humiliated, called me demeaning names like pathetic slut or whore, I'm sure you can think of even worse names to call me and I'm excited to hear them! I want to be picked up and tossed around, spanked and abused and just completely destroyed.\n\nI also really want to try out a more taboo element where my father is forced or tricked into watching you fuck me. There are lots of ways this could happen. Maybe you could send him pictures or videos, or you could seduce me at an event that he is also attending and purposefully let him catch us. One idea that I think is really hot is that I attend a party with my dad, which ends with him playing a game of poker with you. After my dad looses a bit of money you give him the chance to win it back, but if he loses I have to take off my top and let you suck my tits in front of him and the rest of the crowd. This could then lead on to much more fun after you've had your first taste of me... The more taboo you can make this part the better, I love how dirty it is!\n\nI also like the idea of being completely humiliated in front of my father, one scene that I'd love to include is you getting me really drunk or maybe even drugging me in a private room at a party. Maybe we play a drinking game that you're cheating at, or maybe you just force me to drink a whole bottle of spirits, either be commanding me to or by literally forcing it down my throat, or both. Then when I'm completely wasted you strip off my clothes and leave to join my father and the rest of the guests. After a little while I stagger out of the room completely naked and so drunk I can barely walk, not even attempting to cover myself. You tell my dad he'd better go and take care of me, but I'm so drunk I don't even recognize him and try to kiss him or shove my breasts into his face, begging him to let me suck his cock.\n\nThe most taboo of all my fantasies, (and we don't have to include this one if it's too much for you), is I think it would be incredibly wrong and hot if you could coerce or trick me and my father into kissing or even more. Perhaps we're blindfolded in some naughty party game, or perhaps as a forfeit to losing a game of poker you make me and my father kiss while the crowd watches in a mix of laughter and disgust. Maybe I break something at a party you're hosting, after you've gotten me so drunk I don't even know what's going on anymore. Something that my dad can't afford to replace, and you force him to bend me over and spank me in front of the other guests, while I'm completely naked. The crowd laughs as I drunkenly shout \"harder I like it!\" while my own father smacks my bare ass.\n\nScenarios we could try:\n\n1) You're my boss and you've noticed the way I look at you, the way I blush when you call me into your office, the little gasps I make as your arm brushes mine as you're showing me what to do. You've also noticed how eager I am to obey your every command. I bite my lip and nod as you set out my tasks for the day, even when you give me the worst jobs I'm quick to respond \"yes Sir\" and bow my head submissively. The most puzzling thing is how happy I am to let you vent your frustrations on me, sometimes when you're having a bad day it almost seems that I make mistakes on purpose, which inevitably leads to you calling me into your office to chastise me. You've enjoyed the power trip, the ego boost from the jealous eyes of your other workers, but now you've decided to see just how far I'll go to please my favourite boss. You invite me to a party you're holding at your house, you're even kind enough to invite my father too...\n\n2) You're my neighbour and I hate you... or at least I want to hate you. I'm proud of my successful career, not many women can buy their first home at 20 these days. I work hard for what I have, but you seem to make twice as much as me for half the work. I don't know exactly what you do, something in finance I'd guess, but you just love to rub my face in the fact that everything you have is better than mine even though you barely work. I buy a new car, the next weekend you roll up in a Ferrari, I buy a hot tub and you buy a full size heated pool. The worst thing is that whenever I ask how you do it you always reply with some derogatory remark about how men are just made to make money, and I should just quit my job and spend my time in your kitchen. I make it very clear how much you disgust me, always reminding you that a sexist pig like you will never get his hands on a hardworking feminist like me, despite how obvious you make it that you want to get in my pants. The thing that I hate most about you though is that you caught me looking through the gaps in my fence as you lay sunbathing. As I stood mouth slightly agape while you rubbed sun lotion on your muscled chest you turned and winked at me. God you're such a prick. But I still can't help dreaming of having my hands tied to your bedposts as your muscled legs thrust your big arrogant dick deep inside me. One day when my father is visiting you invite us to a party you're hosting. You promise it will be great, music, free drinks, a bbq, we should come along. Despite the look I give him and the elbow in his ribs my father agrees. See you soon, you say, oh and there's a strict bikini only policy for the ladies you say, winking at me with that arrogant smile I've grown to hate.\n\nI'm also very willing to hear suggestions, you should have a good idea of what I'm into from what I've written so far :)\n\nAnd if you like what you've read but don't have time to RP I'd be happy to chat about Kinks or fantasies together, I'm really just excited to finally explore the things I've suppressed for so long!\n\nOne more thing, although I wrote my scenarios in first person I'd love it if we could RP in third person. First is great for writing prompts but I've read some erotica before and always preferred the ones in third person, and I think seeing my name (it's Shannon by the way) along with all the sex and humiliation is really hot, thanks :)\n\nIf you're interested then please send me a PM :) I'd love to know what ideas or kinks you have, and what kind of RP you'd like to create. And if you have any questions please feel free to ask. And if you have any criticism I'd like to hear that too so that I can improve, but please make it constructive, and save the derogatory terms for my body not my writing haha :)\n\nOh also, I tend to get a lot of short one sentence replies to posts like this, so if you want yours to stand out it would be great if you could give me a sample of your writing. Maybe you could write a little preview of a later scene. Perhaps describe making my father watch as you strip me naked after beating him at poker, or watching my dad try to help me as I stumble out into the party naked and incredibly drunk. One image that I find pretty hot is you talking with my father, then pointing his attention to me dancing naked on a pole in front of everyone after you've gotten me incredibly drunk or drugged me.\n\nMy limits are underage, scat, gore, snuff, beast (and anything along those lines)",

            "selftext": "\"Basement\". More like hidden cavern. You joined my little love cult a few months ago, when I initiated you by encouraging you to have sex with another man. Since then you've been fantastic, always open to new experiences. Loving everyone equally and wonderfully, doing your part for the group. Helping to recruit new members with me. Such a good boy. \n\nIt was curious how a rather plain girl like me could be so charismatic. Breaking down peoples walls and barriers that they had built for years. The truth was that I just wanted the world to be full of love for everyone. That was why I founded the retreat, out here in the desert away from everyone else. There was a secret though. I don't let anyone but those I trust most in on it.\n\nSomething gave me the power to do this. I had help. Not brainwashing or mind control but rather a little... amplification. Just to make it easier for everyone to love each other! In exchange my little helper sometimes wants to express love of its own and I see no reason why not. \n\nSo I lead you down the hidden passage by the hand. It is dark and gloomy but I know the way very well. It is also not cold at all even though we left our clothes up top. In fact the deeper we go the warmer it seems to get though never unpleasantly so. \n\nFinally we emerge in a large cave. It is bright here though you see no torches or light. Then you realise. The water at the other end is glowing a gentle blue. \n\n\"Let me explain.\" I purr, stepping behind you. Hands resting on those lovely, strong, tanned shoulders. \"What you are about to see might be a little frightening at first. I was frightened my first time but there is no reason to be. This is the last step. Once this is done you will be one of us forever and ever.\"\n\nThe water ripples.\n\n\"I'll be right here. Come on, forward a little. That's it stand at the edge here. Not everyone makes it down here you know? You are a very lucky boy. Look! Here it comes.\" \n\nThere are shapes below the surface now, swirling and writhing up and up from some unfathomable depth. \n\n\"Don't be scared. Go on, reach out and touch one of them. They want to make you their friend.\"\n\n***\n\nSet in the same world as my last prompt. I'll have to write something explaining it properly soon but for now ask me questions if you want. I like explaining my little fantasy. \n\nI wrote this originally just with men in mind and I still would prefer a man since the image of a tentacle monster and a man is so rare! But if you are playing a woman and come on in like, \"I want to be loved!\" then that is the whole point of my fantasy world anyway.   ",

            "selftext": "\"Lesbians like girls the way boys like girls.\" That's what she said to [me](http://i.4cdn.org/s/1520716399048.jpg). She was a pretty little thing at the bar who had to be younger than me, and way shorter too. I asked her what she mean't by that. A couple hours later and she's knuckle deep in me while pulling my hair on the kitchen counter in my apartment. I woke up the next morning and she was gone. I'm not the one night stand type and I felt a bit used and dirty.\n\nOf course she texted me on my lunch break the next day. I don't even remember giving her my number. \"What do you think about this?\" The message said followed by another that was simply a picture of her very aroused lady parts.\n\nIt's at her place this time in her shower. She had her fingers down my throat while she left bite marks on my neck. \"You're mine now,\" she whispered into my ear.\n\nNow I wear a choker that has her name on it. I wake up in the morning and sometimes she's not there. While other times I wake up being smothered by her butt. She cackles like a witch and shouts, \"Breakfast in Bed!\"\n\nI'm an addict. Her power over me is like a drug. Just the other day we were on a crowded public bus and she started groping me through my jeans. \"Just imagine I'm a Japanese business man and you're a cute schoolgirl.\" Can you believe her?\n\nSo I'm dressed like a Catholic schoolgirl. The \"dirtiest kind\" she remarks before bending me over her lap and spanking me with a ruler until I'm red. The short skirt hiding nothing at all.\n\nToday I'm a wreck. Sweaty and tired after playtime is over. I'm on my hands and knees groveling at her feet while kissing her toes. She forcefully grabs my hair and wrenches me so I look upwards. She's smiling with a thoughtful look in her eyes.\n\nShe says these words with no hidden meaning or any irony.\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\nHow cruel...\n\n(Hey and thanks for reading! I hope you had a good time and I hope to get a chance to play with some fellow perverts! \n\nFirst off, I am looking to play with a Female, Futa, or man willing to play as those!\n\nMy kinks are humiliation, degradation, cum, anal, name calling, public, cheating, orgasm control/denial, being dressed up, cuckquean, and FUTA!\n\nMy limits are toilet, beast, impreg, and incest. Oh, and I only play with female or futa characters.\n\nHere is my full [F-list](https://www.f-list.net/c/demibimbo/) if you care to read more of it!\n\nP.S. People with pictures of what they want their character to look like get priority!)",

Your relationship with him isn't stellar, and it's clear that your daughter feels the same.\n\nIncidentally, it might also be why your daughter enjoys spending time with me. I'm everything a father is supposed to be. Strong. Caring. Smart. Plus, I seem to take an interest in her, and she really, really like that. It makes her feel special.\n\nRight away, your husband could tell that my interest might not be entirely innocent. I bet you could, too. You'd see me staring at her tits, or keeping my hands on her a little too long. Your husband didn't know what to do about it, so he didn't say anything. He stood by while I slowly took his daughter away from him, and, one step at a time, turned her into my own personal slut. He let it happen.\n\nI'm sure you know I've been fucking your daughter. Your husband must, too. How could he not? It's not like we really try to hide it anymore. But today is different.\n\nI'm sitting on the couch in your living room, my pants down, and my cock thick and hard. Your daughter is kneeling in front of me, working her lips up and down my shaft. I hear the front door open. You and your husband walk in. I tell your daughter not to stop.\n\nA few seconds later, you and your husband walk into the room, and for the first time you see your little girl on her knees, serving her new Daddy's cock.\n\nYou should be horrified, and shocked, and appalled. But you aren't. Instead, you get it. You understand exactly why she'd choose me. And you're tempted to do the same.\n\n_____________\n\nShort or long term. Kinks include anal play, incest, cuck/cuckqueaning, public sex, raceplay, piss, and a lot more. Limits are scat, gore, vore, and snuff. You don't need to include all, or even most, of my kinks.\n\nNo sissies. Everyone's eighteen. You can play as the mom or daughter, or tweak the prompt.",

Your faithful girlfriend? Your faithful side girl since your wife hasn't been talking to you since before you went back to jail? Is it something more, Incestous? Daughter? Niece? Granddaughter?(preferably those three options if incest) Maybe our relationship is more abusive, I'm afraid to leave you? perhaps you went to jail because of me, it could have been domestic violence, it could have been more.. Dub/non-con :P My abuser, perhaps an abuser in the form of a White Knight? Maybe just my teacher, I may have been legal but the school system still pressed charges despite me being a consenting adult, I was still a student?\n\nIn all of them, do we have a kid(s)? Are we monogamous, Polyamorus/Open relationship? Maybe you get off on me sleeping with other guys/your friends?  \n\nmy [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/sfH1XCm.png)\n\n\nIf this is up, go ahead and message away :) ",

Trust me when I say, \"if a latina finds her man, then she will take care of him.\" For example me and my \"marshmallow\" (marshmallow is your nickname because your white, and I'm that rare latina that loves a white boy.)\n\nWe have been dating for a solid 3 weeks but already, you live with me, I cook and clean for You, I never make you work, in fact I make our money, and we fuck a minimum of twice a day. \n\nour day typically consist of either you waking up to the smell of whatever I cook you that morning or if I am still asleep by the time you wake up, you will will wake me up with your \"Alarm Cock\". Basically you'll roll me over so I am face down and booty up. Kiss my neck as you peel off my panties and massage my ass. \n\nYou'll gently whisper in my ear \"wake up my big booty brown bunny, it is time for you to wake up.\" And If I'm not awake by that point you will get hard and go balls deep in my tight ass. ( I sometimes just act like I'm asleep because your \"Alarm Cock\" is the best way to wake up.)\n\nWell after that [I will get up and get dressed up for You](https://m.imgur.com/FjaPtMH?r). Then I'll cook your breakfast and after getting all the nutrition you need, you usually fuck me on the table and we do this for a solid hour before I have to clean, get cleaned up and go to work.\n\nOnce I leave you'll get dressed with a t shirt and some shorts or sweatpants. I also make sure to buy you a specific fabric blend because I know some material feels to abrasive for your sensitive yet massive thick dick. After getting dressed you usually watch tv, play videogames, watch porn, or all three.\n\nWhen I get off of work I'll get groceries, go shopping, occasionally see my sister \"Gina\", and then order us a pizza, Chinese food, or Mexican food. Once i get home and we start eating. I'll tell you about my day, you will brag about what high score you made, what movie or tv show I should watch with you, or what new porno we should recreate.\n\nAfter that we'll watch a bit of tv together, I will sudtly tease you will my big and soft ass, which you call the best pillow in the world. And after less than 30 minutes, you will carry me up the stairs and fuck me all night long in our bed.\n\n**You can start as is if it is a typical morning for us. So either start with you wake up to the smell of me cooking or wake me up with the \"Alarm Cock\"(but be descriptive with it.)**\n\n**Kinks: big dicks(especially unrealistic), sensual, assplay, ass worship**\n\n**Limits: toilet stuff, ageplay, gore, and noncon**\n",

            "selftext": "With all the prompts about cuckolding and cheating it's easy to forget that most couples are happily married and satisfied. And that's what I want to focus on. \n\nTonight more than anything I want a more vanilla stroll in the park, a story that focuses on a married couple and their very healthy and very eager bedroom. The sex they have the crazy lust and love they have for eachother. \n\nA happy wife that knows she is unbearably sexy in the eyes of her husband and a husband that has a wife that drives him crazy and makes it impossible to pull himself out of the bed in the morning.\n\nMore than that I would like to, if my partners are interested to, break out of the vanilla mild and focus on the family building part of the marriage, the sex and pregnancy and life of commitment. Though that's optional and left for if my partners are eager. \n\nThis is a largely vanilla prompt but a healthy bedroom still has its kinks, cumplay, blowjobs and eating pussy, titfucking and anal. Maybe a little rough sex and dirty talk, spanking and squeezing and teasing until your husband loses his mind and jumps on you.\n\nLimits are basically everything that would break the more vanilla molds I have set as well as most hardcore stuff. \n\nIf this sounds like your kind of prompt, I think we could get along just fine. Just shoot me a message, dive right in or let us brain storm, up to you.\n\nHope to hear back!",

            "selftext": "The cloaked figure was walking down the road, bow and arrow tied to her back. The heavy backpack she had on a single shoulder didn't seem to bother the thin feminine looking form, as she advanced, most of her face conceiled by either her hood or her scarf. It was one cold day, and sunlight could barely reach trough the heavy clouds. \n\nHer hands were completely bandaged up, even her fingers. The one who had gone trough the trouble for that had even separated the fingers, leaving the impression that she was most likely hiding scars, or preventing some illness to go trough the town. The soft skin of her face - as much as she was showing at least - looked rather fine, and her eyes were bright with life. Not something you would see in someone ill.\n\nOne hand was barely visible, the black cloak she was wearing hiding much of it. Her other hand though, holding a full bag of metal pieces, was revealing the odd bandages. It was made to let her use her hands freely, there was no doubt about that. But it looked like there was tons of fabrics, making her hands look gigantic for her rather small frame. \n\nOne would also notice how her boots were large. She had filled them with fabrics, so people weren't asking much questions. With the metal pieces in her bag, it was clear what she was, and she probably looted that pair of high quality boots on a bounty, unfitting for her, but too good to pass down on. \n\nThose metal pieces were giving her right away. They weren't mere pieces, they were insignas. They belonged to the enemies of the kingdom, the empire threatening to invade them from the south. Each insignas taken back to the Order's quarters had quite some values, for anyone who could use a weapon. Bounty hunters from everywhere around the country had answered to this call, being attracted more by the gold than by any kind of patriotism. They would shout how much they loved their king, and sing his \"success\", much in quite the ironic tone, when they gathered at the inn. They were not loyalist at all. It just served them right to help their country. And she was no different, aside from the fact that she was... quiet.\n\nNormally she would be bothered a lot by the others. Where was she from, how did she ended here, and they would make quite an amount of unsolicited comments, especially with her being a woman. But most felt like, despite what seemed to be a pretty face - she pretty much never took off her scarf, and even less often her hood - there must have been a reason for her to hide like this. A single man tried to take off her hood by force, and miserably failed, being rewarded with a powerful punch that made him lose a tooth. People assumed she had been burnt, since there had been a lot of them a few years ago. She was a woman, so even though she barely looked like she cared, perhaps she was ashamed of her scars. Furthermore, she was good at hunting - the few who had crossed her knew how true this word was - down the enemies. They barely bothered about her. There was plenty of pretty girls at the inn, willing to give themselves to just any pretty face with strong arms. \n\nShe pushed the door to the Order's office, entering without any kind of ceremony. A few guards gave her a look, then went back to their discussion. She was known around, so they had no worries.\n\nShe walked to the counter, and dropped the bag, the insignas making the metallic sound that usually came with her visit. \n\n\"Ahh, if it isn't you, the Cloaked Huntress! You have done quite some wonderful work here!\" Complimented the royal collector. He had more work to do than just collect the coins of the villagers. He had to distribute those same coins to the bounty hunters. \n\nHis words were welcomed with complete silence from the one he called the \"Cloaked Huntress\". She was staring at him, her slow breathing the only barely audible sound she made.\n\n\"... how has the hunt been this time?\" He asked, opening a drawer of his desk. \"I heard they had reinforced their defenses at the border and-\"\n\n\"I'm here for the bounty,\" she interrupted with a dry tone.\n\n\"Ah ah, yeah the... the bounty...\" chuckled the collector. \"As talkative as ever, I see...\" he raised the bag to let the insignas fall on his counter, and started counting them.\n\nShe looked around, still standing. Guards, criminals, political persons. She barely had any interests in them. What caught her eyes was the chained beast in the cage. He was a monster. Despite his clear humanoid appearance, he had the claws, the tail, the ears. The patches of fur, the eyes... he was indeed, a monster, and he was very, very alive despite his appearant docility. \n\n\"What's *it* doing here?\" She asked pointing in his direction.\n\nThe collector turned around, before starting to count again.\n\n\"Oh him. We caught him taking down criminals. Wanted to help, he said. It's against a few politics up there, but he's doing a fine job.\"\n\n\"I thought monsters would be killed on sight.\" She replied, with her tone still as dry as sand.\n\n\"Well he's not free, and he's not rampaging like the others. He's a good little puppy, if you will.\"\n\nA faint rumbling sound came from her throat as he said his last words. If he had raised his eyes on hers, he would have witnessed a sparkle of anger in those bright green pearls.\n\n\"I see why you are in a hurry to get the bounty!\" He said with a chuckle. \"Go take care of that stomach as soon as you can!\" He raised his eyes, and extended his arm, holding a pouch full of coins, which she grabbed as quick as she could, with an agressive movement that surprised the collector.\n\n\"I will come back again, once I have enough insignas.\" She said, turning around, as he complimented her efficacy.\n\nShe left with as much words as she came in, replacing her hood and scarf, and placing the pouch in the bag she was carrying seemingly without any efforts.\n\nOutside the office, she went down the few stairs, her eyes directed toward the still covered sky. There was a few patch of blue here and there, in the distance... nothing to get enthusiastic about. The rumbling sound she heard from behind as she turned around toward the ever darker sky made it clear ; it would rain tonight. She groaned, before walking in the inn's direction. \n\nShe always hated the rain.\n\n---\n\nSitting in a corner of the inn, her back against the wall and facing the door, the Cloaked Huntress was enjoying - as much as one could enjoy something so barely eadible - the stew this place had to offer. When she asked for something else, the innkeeper replied that she only had to take it herself since she was a huntress after all. War was indeed hard, and the enemies were numerous. Less trained, but numerous. Supplies from cities had often been moved towards war camps, leaving the rests to the people. \n\nWith how fast she was eating the hot stew, one would have said she was enjoying it, but she really was just very hungry. Her tongue was begging her to stop, but her stomach just couldn't get enough. Her scarf was down, showing her feminine features that barely fitted the way she was eating. In fact, if it wasn't for her fighting prowess, and the known quantity of insignas she had brought back, she would probably be mocked, harrassed. But this day happened, where a man tried to take off her hood. No one ever tried to bother her afterwards. \n\nShe shoved the wooden spoon in her mouth, trying to get as much of this taste as she could. It wasn't good, that is for sure. But she had no supplies left, and she had walked for a long time with just a bottle of water. She really had pushed herself too far this time. Still, the coins were there to prove it worthy.\n\nShe dropped her spoon in the bowl and let out a sigh. Her stomach would probably proceed to punish her in an hour or so for trying herself with such a bad taste. She could have hunted something indeed. But this city's lord was not allowing anyone to hunt on *his* hunting ground, which basically left nothing to the others. She lost a good amount of her bounty once, after they found out she had killed a doe. \n\nShe pulled her cloak around her as she shifted on her chair. It was not all that comfortable, but it was better than to be chased to death like before. As she was trying to stop thinking about just everything, her ears twitched, as footsteps came in her direction. She decided to play it like she didn't notice. She shifted to the side, closed her eyes, faking to be sleeping. She was tempted to give a fake snore, but it was just too much now wasn't it?\n\n He would not bother her, would he? No, he would see how uninteressed she was in anything he had to say and- No, he had to talk to her. Curse those socializing humans she thought as she turned her head in his direction with a green eye opening, looking in those of this pesky person who came to bother her.\n\n---\n\nHello all! I hope you are having a great day, and that what I wrote was to your liking. And if it picked your interest, that would be even better!\n\nI think it is quite obvious that I am not looking for a quick, fast and short scene here. I want to develop the characters, the world, the story. I am indeed looking for something on the long term. Of course I want some steamy scenes to come in too, I wouldn't have posted here if I didn't! I just don't want it to be the core of this roleplay. Also, this doesn't mean it can't start with the smut. If the story leads to it happening fast, then it happens fast. If it leads toward a long time before any sex may occur, then so be it. In any case, I don't want to twist a scene to artificially add sex in it \"just because\". It needs to flow well with the story. \n\nSpeaking of sex and smut, let's get it on with the kinks and limits. My limits are mostly composed of actual painful stuff like blood and violence, death and snuff, at least on the sexual part. She is a hunter after all, and a fighter ; violence might occur in the story, but not in the sex. I also want to stick away from bathroom stuff. I am willing to go down the road of non-con, preferably dub-con, but I do have a thing for consensual, love, cuddles, all that stuff. As for more specific kinks, I think we could discuss that more in the pms. \n\nI suppose you are wondering who I want you to play, as I haven't pointed any characters for you in particular. It is what I wanted, to leave space for you to find your own character. There is so much possibilities. You could be another bounty hunter, you could be the monster locked up or another monster hiding his true nature (I love those two!), or a monster wishing to have her as its mate/wife depending on its views (easy choice for something more dub-con or non-con), some noble, some bandits, a soldier from the southern empire or from the kingdom, someone who learned of her and seeks to imprison her (or something else)...what do YOU feel like playing? What do you think would be interesting? If we are going to write this together, it would be better if we both enjoyed our parts, don't you think?\n\nAs for me, I'll be playing as \"The Cloaked Huntress\", as you might have guessed. Yes she has a name, she just doesn't give it easily. As you can guess, she is a bounty hunter roaming the border as a war is raging on at the south of the kingdom. I see them being a bit like King Xerxes' army in 300, but this is not set in stone. If you have a better, working and defined idea, I would be glad to hear it. \n\nIt is happening in a fantasy world. It can be very similar to the real one, but I'm not looking for something overly realistic. Magic does exist and, while not widely used, it is somewhat \"common\" to see a warlock, sorcerer or mage once in a while. I don't see them being numerous, but they do exist. Just as do monsters, but as opposed to them, mages are not hunted on sight in the kingdom (or kept in a cage, like the one from the first part) and treated as lesser beings in the Southern empire. The monsters, in the empire, are seen as Slaves, servants, pets and warbeasts. There must be some place in the world where they have somewhat of a nation, some place that belongs to them, but I didn't have it in mind when I wrote this, and it was not my intention to make it about the liberation of the monsters. It can totally be about that, don't let that stop you from bringing me your holy crudade for freedom and peace! It just wasn't the optic I choose in the beginning.\n\nWell I think that's settled for now. Any questions? Precisions you would like to have? Ideas about the world you would like to mention? Anything that could add to the story? I'd be glad to hear it, and reply to any questions. Also, if you feel confident - or hyped - you can just keep up where I left! I love to just jump straight in the roleplay when it's descriptive enough. Part one or part two? The one you prefer, both work as openers. Feel free to write your own opener too! Though if you do, I'd like you to let me know!\n\nAll right then! Have a great day!\n",

            "selftext": "Hey DPP, it's been a while since I've posted a prompt here, for the one or two people who may remember me, I'm back! For the great majority of you who have no idea who I am, I post fucked up prompts for people with fucked up interests. DPP is my main source of relief for these interests because I enjoy my life and have no desire to act on these fetishes for real.\n\n\nAnyway a couple of days ago I got to try out a friends HTC Vive, it really got me thinking about the possibilities for VR way down the track and I've been pretty interested in the concept of \"Full Dive\" Virtual reality ever since. If you're wondering what full dive is it's basically experiencing the virtual reality as if it was actually reality a la a super vivid lucid dream.\n\n\nAnyway just a quick warning for those of you who don't want to read about twisted fetishes such as snuff, torture, guro, dolcett, cannibalism and some more normal ones like BDSM then you'd best hit that back button now.\n\n\n---\n\nNow to get in to the actual prompt, I do plan on reusing this with a different scenario in future but for now I'll be starting off strong with a classic favourite of mine, dolcett.\n\n\nSo imagine a world in the not so distant future where humanity has finally cracked the code to full dive VR and it's massive, its popularity has outshone all forms of traditional media to the point where people pretty much spend every moment of their life within VR if they can help it. We're talking people pretty much spend the rest of their life within VR (**See general info section**). For those of you who care about realism imagine other advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence have led to a world where humanity can kick back and let their creations do the dirty work while they play, only a select few need to take on an administrative role to these creations while their brethren are free to enjoy their new work free life.\n\n\nI don't know much about Ready Player One but from what I've seen there's basically another world in VR that everybody hangs out in and the outside world is pretty neglected? Imagine something like that except the outside world is a little less dystopian, just eerily quiet because everybody is kicking it in a suped up virtual world.\n\n---\n\nSo now that the general concept is set up I'll dive in to the thick of things. This virtual world was designed to completely emulate reality, perfectly simulating human needs and feelings. In the beginning the it was pretty lax in terms of rules but as its popularity grew so did the amount of regulation. In the beginning people were able to fully customize their virtual avatars allowing for any appearance they desired including the ability to change their sex or even combine elements of both sexes. People were also free to set the rate at which their needs grew or what they felt, everything could be customized, the amount of pain you felt, how often you needed to go to the toilet, your strength, even your intelligence. However it underwent an immense change after government intervention. Nowadays it's something like this, upon diving into VR you're placed in to a 1:1 perfect replica of earth that functions as somewhat of a hub, within this hub pain is completely disabled as are bodily functions and hunger; aggression against other players is also disabled so crimes such as murder, assault or rape are off the table, other than that you're free to treat this as a sandbox. Player avatars are also restricted to a perfect imitation of that persons real self. From the hub you can join servers, these are split up into three distinct categories however recently a fourth category has emerged, they're as follows\n\n---\n\n#Government Owned Servers\n\nIt might be worthwhile to mention Earth has a unified world government these days.\n\nAnyway these mostly come in the form of administrative areas that allow players to customize their virtual reality experience. Think welfare offices, and license application centers and so on. The main use for these facilities is character customization. With valid reason and documentation players can apply for things such as global need reductions allowing for something like 50% reduced hunger across all servers or other, more major procedures such as a sex change and the like. These facilities also allow players to apply for licenses to host private servers or purchase more storage space for their server (think of this like expanding the size of the world within their server).\n\n---\n\n#Commercially Owned Servers\n\nNot too much to say about these ones, they aim to make money off the public by hosting various forms of entertainment like races, sports, video games (Think stuff like Sword Art Online) and anything else you can come up with really. They do follow a set of regulations that basically amounts to no psychological torture, human needs such as hunger or thirst can't be bumped up beyond 100% (What they usually are) and pain can't be increased over 50% (Half of what you'd usually feel). Try to use your imagination here because an actual list of the regulations they'd have to follow would be stupidly boring.\n\n---\n\n#Private Servers that can be accessed by the public\n\nOwned by the more well off members of society but nothing quite on the scale of a commercial server. These basically amount to a small hang out area for a couple hundred people at best or maybe something like a personal house one can rest in and have a small amount of guests over to. Again not a whole lot to say about these, just use your imagination as to what goes down in these. Also worth noting they follow the same rules and regulations as commercially owned servers.\n\n---\n\n#True Private Servers (AKA Dark Servers)\n\nThese are essentially the dark web of this new virtual world, these servers have reverted to how things originally were allowing moderators to completely mess with human life, pain can be increased up to 500% as can need decay, avatars are no longer restricted to a perfect copy of that persons real self and can be wildly modified to the players desire, depending on the server these modifications can also be performed against the players will. This is where all the nasty stuff goes down.\n\n---\n\n#General Info\n\n**Currency**\n\nThere's only a single form of currency that exists across all servers, this currency is distributed and carefully monitored by the government to keep the VR dwellers entertained by setting a goal, to earn as much money as possible. Because of the nature of this currency it's possible to, say, buy a rare weapon in your favorite fantasy video game using the money you won betting on sports all within the virtual world. This currency is also used to purchase monthly access to virtual reality, for most people this is no issue however some individuals land in a downward spiral that's hard to pull out of. Fear of being removed from virtual reality is what leads people to turn to private servers and occupations such as prostitution. It's not uncommon for \"pimps\" to pay the monthly fee for women in return for complete control over their virtual life.\n\n**Life in VR and why people are scared of leaving it**\n\nThe growth of humanity has stagnated, upon the widespread release of full dive VR people immersed themselves within it and never looked back. Growth is simulated by the overarching system so it's entirely possible for someone to enter VR at age 10 and experience the rest of their life including physical and mental growth all within virtual reality. Pregnancy and childbirth are completely simulated as well with the child being a sentient form of artificial intelligence so it's entirely possible for two people from opposite sides of the world to enter VR in their teens, spend ten years growing and developing, meeting each other and getting married and then having a child who develops alongside them. For these people it's no exaggeration to say being removed from the virtual world is tantamount to ending their life. In light of this is clear to see why some people perform crazy acts of desperation in order to just barely scrape together that monthly fee.\n\n**Class divide and the wealthy**\n\nBecause of the nature of the world the difference between the poor and the wealthy has grown even larger. With enormous amounts of money they can afford to pay off government officials to allow augmentations to their character and they can afford to quite literally buy peoples lives as slavery has become somewhat of a grey zone. The only difference between the virtual world and the old world is who the wealth are, due to the changing nature of VR it's likely that a player of a video game capable of completely high level quests will be far wealthier than actors or singers.\n\n**The dark side of VR**\n\nNow some of you may be thinking \"well hang on, if everything is so closely moderated then how come people can break the rules in these private servers\" and the answer is simple: Money. This is another thing that hasn't changed from the old world, with enough money to pay off the people in power any amount of rules can be bent.\n\n\n---\n\n#The scenario for this prompt\n\n\n(This is the bit that changes if I choose to reuse this setting)\n\n\nFor this prompt I'll be playing a woman in her late twenties who's run into a bit of financial trouble; I was married to a man in his early thirties who was an avid fan of one of the more popular VRMMO servers available, he wasn't the best at it but he was able to perform well enough to support a comfortable lifestyle for the both of us along with both of our monthly fees. I began to take this life for granted and stopped making any effort to earn money, I figured my husband enjoyed his \"work\" enough that he wouldn't mind if I wasn't working to support us. It's not like I did nothing though, he did try to take me on his adventures in the beginning however it was clear I was hopeless at the game so when we eventually decided to have a kid I made it my role to settle down and take care of our child while he was away.\n\n\nLong story short he ended up cheating on me with another woman he met playing the game, he filed for divorce and suddenly I was out of home, broke and met with my monthly fees deadline creeping ever closer. I would have given up then and there if it wasn't for my visitation, though the divorce favored him I was still permitted to see my child twice a week on the weekends.\n\n\nI tried various methods to scrape together enough money to pay the fees however none worked too well. It wasn't until 3 hours and 17 minutes before the payment was due that I met a man from an organisation creatively titled \"The Agency\", he stated he was from an employment agency and offered to pay my fees if I signed up on the spot. I wasn't suspect at the time because I'd heard of similar arrangements, people about to default on their payments often sought out these agencies who paid their fees and put them to work doing menial labor where players felt a human touch was needed. If only I had known what I was getting myself into when I signed that damned contract.\n\n\nTo describe The Agency briefly it was essentially a virtual human trafficking ring. The agency owned its own dark server where thousands of girls slept in what amounted to a prison in between jobs. Each cell was furnished with a bunk bed and a toilet providing housing for two Agency \"employees\". Other dark servers would then purchase an amount of girls from the agency for a set period of time, some purchases were temporary as the girls were needed only for an event whilst others were more permanent for example if a rich patron required a sex slave for his own dark server.\n\n\nAgency girls were usually naked with the exception of a metal collar however they could also be dressed to their clients' desires. The collar came in three different metals, bronze, silver and gold. They signified the girls class and what she could be used for.\n\n**Bronze Collar (Class C)**\n\nThese girls were no more than ordinary prostitutes, although they signed their lives away to The Agency like the other girls they led slightly more comfortable lives with nicely furnished cells and favorable work conditions. These girls, by contract, were permitted one day a week outside the agency server to spend anywhere within the virtual world, so to speak. These girls could only be hired temporarily and their services were limited to vanilla sex acts only.\n\n\n**Silver Collar (Class B)**\n\nThese girls made up the bulk of Agency employees, they lived in cold, harsh cells unlike the class C girls and were available for both temporary and permanent hire. In addition to vanilla sexual acts patrons were also permitted to perform deviant sexual acts on these girls (This is where the dolcett/torture/snuff along with any other fucked up fetishes you may have come in to play). It's worth noting that while these girls can be hired permanently, once killed they respawn at the agency server and their contract with the murderers server is ended, this applies to murder during temp contracts too.\n\n\n**Gold Collar (Class A)**\n\nThese girls were the premium service offered by the agency, they're almost exactly the same as the class B girls in terms of living arrangements and permitted fetishes and acts, what sets them apart are two things. Firstly upon death, regardless of their contract status (Temporary or Permanent) they'll respawn in the same server they were killed in until the duration of their contract expires. Secondly their collar functions as a dark server exclusive item that allows verified players (The customer along with players whitelisted by the customer) to change the girls parameters including but not limited too: how quickly her hunger grows, how often she needs to go to the toilet, how much pain she feels, how much pleasure she feels and so on. The gold collar also allows verified players to customize the girls appearance and age(resets back to normal once the contract is up) and modify how she experiences feelings (for example experiencing pleasure instead of pain).\n\n\nFor this prompt I wish to play a class A or B girl purchased to play the role of a new citizen (and piece of meat!) for a dolcett oriented dark server. The server takes on the appearance of a small town with a population of around 2000 or so. Within this town are all sorts including full families who've lived their entire life in VR within the town. Within this town are plenty of girls who willingly volunteer as meat knowing that they'll respawn in the town square once killed however every so often the mayor purchases a few new girls to bring fresh faces in to the town. If I haven't made this clear already this town is fully functional despite the fact that they've embraced cannibalism; there are schools, restaurants, shops, etc. and everybody lives what they believe to be a normal life even though the women are hyper sexualized and killed and eaten for fun.\n\n\nYeah if you've read to the bottom I congratulate you because this prompt is pretty damn long, I haven't proofread so if you spot a mistake please do let me know.",

Forbidden lesbians, i.e. lesbian relationships that should not happen. This can take on a variety of forms, but today what I'm most interested in would be something like [this](https://imgur.com/annBqPX), a catholic nun and a devout Muslim.\n\nBoth are indoctrinated into religions that practically forbid homosexuality, the nun is \"married to God\", and I'd like to believe the Muslim has a husband (perhaps she's part of a harem). Putting these two different yet similar woman in a scenario together would be, dare I say it, *divine*.\n\nThe possibilities for a set up and follow through are endless and I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on the matter. Come now, let's have some fun.",

            "selftext": "Hey, DPP. \n\nI've been wanting to GM an erotic adventure RP campaign and I'm now looking for a player to host for. I was planning on doing post-apocalyptic campaign in vein of Mad Max and Fallout, but I'm willing to also do low/high-fantasy or sci-fi. I'll be playing the NPCs and depending on your taste I'm open for all possible pairings.\n\nWriting style will be quick back and forth paragraphs (and the required longer descriptions from me) to allow more fluid RP.\n\nFor fetishes I'd like to see a kinklist from you and adapt based on that but you shouldn't respond if you want incest, ageplay, beastiality, or gore during sex scenes. I'm also looking to keep the campaign realistic though high-fantasy settings are negotiable. My [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/MiGkCN7.png) to give an idea what you might and could get.\n\nI'm only going to run one or two campaign simultaneously so first come first served (I'll announce when I'm fully booked). Please message me with kinklist and a general idea for the kind of a character and setting you'd like to play. Also ask away if something pops to mind. (this is my first time posting an advert so excluse the possible clunkiness)\n\nThe RP is going to happen in reddit PMs or Chatzy. There's also the option of GMing a group in chatzy but that requires multiple matching people who'd prefer trying that.\n\nEdit: Closed",

We'd been seeing each other for 3 months, and it was going better than either of us had ever imagined. Then I got a job offer in Portugal for 3 months, and I had to take it. We both knew long distance wouldn't work, it wouldn't be fair on either of us. \n\nWe tried to talk for the first month, stay in touch, but it was useless. We drifted apart. I was busy, and you were... well, you were at home. I don't know what you were doing. Being honest, while I was in Portugal, I didn't really care now.\n\nBut I'm back now. I'm sure you knew, you'd have seen my Instagram posts and my snapchats. We hadn't talked in months, and I hadn't thought about getting in touch with you since I'd come back. But... what about you? Do you have other ideas?\n\n(Picture for reference, more available if we get on well! https://i.imgur.com/Ig4NXNr.jpg)",

Instead, I'm looking for a roleplay partner to work together with and develop something we'll both enjoy. \n\nAnyways, I'm a filthy little thing. I'm 18, small, young, na\u00efve. My tragic flaw is I'm attracted to mean men. I want to be hurt, abused, humiliated, and degraded. \n\nI want to be kidnapped, by a stalker or by a stranger. Wake up in an unfamiliar place and be your toy to use and play with, to gaslight and make whatever you want. \n\nI want to be used by someone in a position of power above me. A teacher, a police officer, my new boss, a military superior. I want to be taken advantage of. \n\nI want to be blackmailed. I want you to take something of mine. Maybe on our first date you took pictures of me being naughty, and threaten to post them if I don't go on a second one with you at once. \n\nI enjoy a man who has two sides, who seems nice and has the most charming smile, but wants to hurt and humiliate me when we're alone. \n\nI want to be a pet for you. Sleep on the floor, way from a bowl, and drool for your cock. \n\nI\u2019m also always interested in simple chats about kink, or anything really! I enjoy older men because of a few daddy issues but anyone over 18 is welcome to send me a message. \n\n\nSo, if you're interested, make my inbox orange and we can get chatting!!! I\u2019m available always, xoxox\n\n",

            "selftext": "The cock is thicker than I'm used to, harder than my husband's gets these days, pulsing hot, reeking of musk and sweat from being swaddled in expensive silk underwear and thousand dollar dress slacks. I turn my eyes up to the man, whose name I don't know and don't care to know, and bare my teeth in a welcoming hiss, showing him the ceramic fangs capped over my incisors. He gulps nervously, but his erection only pulses more hotly. All he sees is a tigress's face, a tigress's inhuman eyes, the jade-gold lenses concealing any comforting thoughts that might gleam in my natural irises. Gently I slide my black-painted lips over the swollen head of his cock, feel his whole body tense as he slides into the wet, willing heat of my mouth -- swirling my tongue over his shaft, gliding my paw-painted hands over his bare ass, letting the long black claws plastered over my nails rake his tingling flesh.\n\n*Two o'clock in the afternoon, three hours before I usually leave the office, and I'm on the phone with my husband. \"Got to work late again, babe. We're about to close on this office park. Forget the commission, if this goes through they might make me a full partner!\" I hear the note of concern in his voice -- I've had a lot of late nights in the last few weeks, stretching long past midnight and always right before the weekend -- but I don't really care. I'm already dripping expectantly into my panties, shifting from one foot to the other in excitement, heart already pounding at what's in store for me...*\n\nAll around me are the sounds of sex, of primal lust, of women painted as feral embodiments of desire and wealthy men enjoying them. We're not whores. It's more sacred than that. Purer. Something inside us, ready to be unleashed, finally given form. I curl my claws into my patron's ass a little harder and his hands fumble for the teased up mane of my red hair, the tufted portions designed to look like ears. My striped back writhes sinuously, muscles flexing under my painted skin. The stripes disappear under the tiny black silk g-string that provides me my only bit of modesty. Others, further along in their ... studies ... sport lush tails planted deep between their cheeks, wearing nothing at all but scraps of jewelry: an anklet here, a collar there. Soon I hope to earn a tail, a collar, a bracelet. My lensed eyes flash at my patron's, capturing them, hypnotising him for a moment, a moment where it is only him and the tiger-woman, alone in the world, his cock pulsing hotly in my mouth as I bob my painted face up and down, faster, suckling, feeling him quiver with a release that will erupt any moment.\n\n*By three p.m. I've arrived at the place -- the clubhouse, I suppose, for lack of a better word. It's located in one of the richest parts of town, ten stories of sumptuous apartments and offices and boardrooms and galleries ... and cellars and subbasements beyond counting, appointed to look like cages, gilded and lovely; spartan and drear and promising punishment; everything in between. I find myself stripped bare, work clothes carefully stored in a locker as I am adorned only in the black silk g-string, then laid down on a massage table as the artists -- they are more than mere attendants -- begin to work on me with their brushes and paints. I don't know what the paint is made of -- it doesn't smear or run or even wash off without a special ointment -- but its smell is heavenly, darkly alluring, addicting somehow. I breathe shallowly, falling into a sort of trance as they dye and adorn me, shifting me from woman to tigress. Already I have soaked through the g-string in anticipation. Wordlessly they sponge me clean, but it does nothing to douse the building heat as the stripes and tiger pattern consume me.*\n\nHe cums with a ferocious, desperate sound, clutching the back of my head fiercely enough to force my black-dyed nose into his tuft of musky pubic hair -- earning a hard enough rake from my claws to draw blood on his ass. When I first arrived here, I would have thought such a reaction would draw punishment, but that isn't the case. The more authentic -- the more instinctive -- the reaction, the better a creature I am. The proof is in his orgasm -- thick jets of hot cum flooding my mouth, making me gasp, pulling back, his cockhead brushing over my lips as he continues to spurt his seed, white ropes of it splashing my painted face, dripping down my chin. I settle back on my heels, keeping my lensed eyes on his as I slowly and salaciously lick the hot seed from my face, from the backs of my hands. Gradually he releases his grip, shuddering. Still hard, stroking more pleasantly at my mane. \"Incredible,\" he whispers, eyes crawling over my striped body, his nostrils flaring at the obvious scent of my arousal. \"I don't suppose you'd ... want to go into the lounge?\" Ah, the lounge ... a truly rich area where far more occurs than the simple dances and teases and oral sex that happens here.\n\nBut I can't say yes. My g-string says otherwise. \"You know better,\" I whisper to him, my voice a convincing growl. He nods with a rueful smile, made all the more hungry as he watches me prowl off on all fours, my striped ass swaying pertly, a deep and hungry and desperately unfulfilled ache throbbing under the drenched black silk.\n\n*I don't know what made him notice me. I look good for my age, I think, and people always seem surprised when I tell them I have a son who's about to finish his first year of college and a daughter in her last year of high school, but it was more than that. He saw something in me -- something needful and hungry and prowling, something leashed and caged and aching to be set free. He only asked me to visit this place -- to look and see if it was something I wanted to be part of. I left the club that night trembling all over, my mouth numb with fresh cum from three different men, their seed burning in my belly, traces of tigress paint still clinging to my temples. Maybe I never had a chance.*\n\nI'm checking myself out in the mirror -- it's later than the last time I was here, and I wonder if my husband will be awake, waiting when I arrive home. The man who recruited me stops into the dressing room, catching my eye -- smirking in the mirror at me, my heart pounding. Teasingly he slides his fingers along my spine, making me arch yearningly, feeling his touch through the thin rayon of my work blouse.\n\n\"You've earned your tail, for next time,\" he murmurs.\n\n***\nKinklist: https://i.imgur.com/bCvsabV.png",

            "selftext": "Hello! I saw you lurking in this subreddit again. I had hoped you would open my little post and help me out. Honestly, just getting your attention is quite enough. I hope you read on.\n\nWhat I need help with is rather simple. I\u2019m looking to chat. Not just any chat. But a long, kinky, sexy, hot chat that involves experimentation and based on trust. Others might even call it a fun, friendly adult interaction that just builds on and on. Really, it\u2019s good to have someone to just pull aside and chat with about some adult fantasies. \n\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of RP. I have not much to offer in that arena. But given time, I hope to craft believable stories with you that are derived from experiences that we both learn along the way. For now, I look to learning about what I can do with my body. \n\nIn our long-term correspondence, I hope that we can agree on a \u201ctraining\u201d sort of setup. It is not mandatory. But I hope it is something that we both agree on eventually. Consensual fun is sexy after all. Although I\u2019m giving you a leg up with my very indecisive mindset that is in serious need of discipline. \n\nThere is a limitation that you should be aware of. I\u2019ll tell you more when we get in touch. What I can tell you now is that we must schedule tasks ahead of time. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. I\u2019m a discreet Asian woman, a little on the chubby side, with desires to look better and comfortable in the bedroom naked... I offer friendship of the adult nature, which means I demand of you to be discreet and mature as well.\n\n**[Here is my kink list] (https://i.imgur.com/HJuTPsl.png)** We can discuss them too if you\u2019d like! :)\n\nDo message me if anything I have mentioned is interesting to you. I'm waiting to be entertained and disciplined. Send your envelopes soon~ *Hopefully not just one-liners.*\n\n&lt;3 Throwmeabonerortwo\n",

Yes, plenty of people know the basics.\n\nBut only you know her secret. \n\nOnly you, her \"personal assistant,\" know of the secret that hides between her legs. The thick, meaty, throbbing secret. That's right - Hayley Atwell is, in fact, packing a huge cock between those sexy, curvy legs of hers. And she uses you to take care of her urges to make sure she doesn't pop any inopportune erections during her public events, so that her secret doesn't get out into the world. \n\nIt's the best job you've ever had.

I have a new prompt here that I'd love to try out.\n\n\nIn this story, I will be playing as [Macie.](https://m.imgur.com/RbT2q5D)  I'm a 19 year old student at the local state university and I very recently accepted a full time nanny position with you and your wife. As part of my compensation, you both have agreed to have me move into your home so that I'm around more often to care for your young child.\n\n\nAs you can probably imagine, this story is going to result in an affair between the two of us.  I would really love it though if you somehow picked up my subconscious desires to be sexually submissive.  Maybe you have a great relationship with your wife, but miss the Dom/sub dynamic from your previous relationships.\n\n\nWant to play this one out with me? I'm expecting a slower moving story here, so please be interested in a longer term thing. \n\n\n\nKinks: Dom/sub, heavy realism, unprotected sex, coercion, oral, first time anal, rimming, outfits, being shared, swallowing, degradation, use/abuse, male pubic hair, masturbation, creampie.

The guy who came into my classes last month and in the time since has spent every session doing nothing but gawking at my frigging feet. Ugh! So frustrating! It's not *my* fault that I have perfect feet, alright? Size 9, always clean and pedicured. Adorable toes. High arch. If I wanted? I could probably make a killing as a foot model, fetish or non-fetish even. But I *don't*! I want to be a yoga instructor, not your personal eye candy, you pervert!\n\nI'm going to have to do something about this. Either I have to confront you... or something worse. I refuse to wear socks to my own yoga classes. I love the feel of the mat on the soles of my feet, and I'm not giving that up. No, I'm going to have to make you change, not me. But how?\n\nMaybe I'll shove my feet right in your stupid mouth. Or should I gather up the other girls in the class and have them dogpile you and hold you down while I extract some vengeance? Hmm... so many choices. So little time. \n\n***\n\nLet's go, foot freaks. I know you're out there. Come play, but don't bring any scat, gore, or violence with you. Thanks.",

My thong wasn't much better, besides leaving my ass bare my more daring admirers could have sworn they saw the outline my sex.\n\n\"It's not fair Emma! We're all supposed to buy bikinis, not lingerie!\"\n\nWith every step I could feel everyone's eyes on me, how they examined every inch of my body and how much they desired me. I made sure to give my hips a little extra sway.\n\n\"That's rich coming from you Emi! You're wearing nothing but a slingshot bikini, I've seen your breasts pop out at least three times already.\"\n\nI laugh as I wink at one of the girls gawking at me; I love watching them blush when they realize I noticed them.\n\n\"Hey! What about me? I'm actually, you know, covered? Isn't that what bikinis are supposed to do????\"\n\nAnna was wearing black mesh crop top over a neon pink-and-purple bikini with a matching bottom.\n\n\"Don't worry Anna, we'll pick your suit out for you next time! I hear pasties are all the rage...\"\n\nA beautiful little seashell caught my eye. I bent over carefully, arching my back so that all the phones could get a good view. I saw at least three large bulges in swim trunks as I straightened up.\n\n\"Ewww... no!\"\n\nAnna pretended to gag at my proposal.\n\n\"You know I hate those!\"\n\n----\n\nIt's still sooooo cold and wet where I live right now and I've had enough of it! All I want to do is slip on my bikini, throw some beer in a cooler, and head to the beach to splash and play and flirt with all the half naked men and women \ud83d\ude0b\n\nBut alas, reality is oh so cruel. Perhaps you all can help me r/dirtypenpals?\n\nI know this is like, the ~~fifth~~ sixth time I'm reposting this with edits but I'm still looking for some more special people to play with :D Feel free to take it wherever your imagination, or your arousal, desires.\n",

I barely even know your name. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re into it, and I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know if you have a wife, or girlfriend, or boyfriend, and it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway. You might be watching the clock in anticipation or in dread as it creeps ever closer to our standing 4:15 appointment. It was on our calendars as \u201cDaily Debrief\u201d Which wasn\u2019t entirely inaccurate. \n\nYou knew the routine. Come into my office, lock the door, and don\u2019t bother me if I\u2019m on the phone or still working. Disrobe. The one thing, the *only* thing I cared for about you was your great, big, fat, pussy-stretching cock. And you didn\u2019t even know how to use THAT right. \n\nOnce you\u2019d gotten yourself hard and I\u2019d reached a stopping point, I took my time approaching. Some days I disrobed, and some days, like today, I just hiked my skirt up around my waist, hand stroking the abundant hair on my mound. I didn\u2019t have a bush, oh no... I was a lioness, and this was my mane. \n\nYou didn\u2019t deserve this. You didn\u2019t deserve a woman with such abundant curves and confidence. You didn\u2019t deserve the view of my fat ass, and the wispy hairs around my butthole, as I mounted you Reverse Amazon, so I didn\u2019t even have to look at you. \n\nMaybe today was the day you\u2019d grow some balls? Maybe you\u2019d make a move, try to turn the tables? Today could be the day you decide to fucking do something instead of lay back and get mounted by your boss *again*. Or are you just too much of a fucking wimp?\n\n/////\n\nWe can discuss kinks and specifics before we begin. I can picture playing as a black or white woman for this, but I\u2019m flexible on the details of my character. \n\nI wrote this mainly directed at men, but women are welcome too!!",

I love touching myself and I especially love hearing other people describe how they masturbate. I want to hear about your early orgasms, and how your style has changed over time. I'm especially interested in mutual masturbation and group masturbation.  Voyeurism and exhibitionism get me equally excited. \n\nI love masturbation videos. Gender is unimportant. The only thing that matters is the sense of authentic pleasure and the sense that the camera is of no concern at all. \n\nI daydream about being watched and about watching others. Sometimes I listen to masturbation videos through my headphones, with my eyes closed, picturing someone lying next to me while we both masturbate. When I happen to overhear my neighbors fucking, I love jilling to the sound of their moans.\n\nTell me what turns you on, and how you like to touch yourself. Do you also love watching and listening? I want to hear about that, too.",

            "selftext": "\"*The Savages from Oidhuroli\u00e5 are quite distinct from the Oairi^1 Dwarves of the mountains. They refer to themselves as the Titanfolk, with a distinct theological belief that they are the descendants of creatures known as 'The Titans', five supernatural beings that the Savages believe created Isoi\u00e5lmo, or as they refer to it in more simple terms - The Land.*\n\n*While these crude beliefs are clearly the work of a simpler mind, they do spur the average Savage to become an efficient and powerful creature that could be put to excellent work. The only problem in utilising the Savages for any possibility is their obstinate will and obsession for their own 'freedom' - the Savage has little to no interest in the Glory of Iso and would certainly be too barbaric and thick-skulled to understand it if they listened in the first place.*\n\n*While their Souls are weak and fragile - and the science about whether they truly have fully developed souls is not conclusive - their bodies are strong and durable. They tower above us Children of Iso and the useful devoted Obi\u00e5ugu Hobgoblins. Some have dared to even theorise that these Savages are the embodiment of Iso's strength - as His children are the manifestation of his divinity and mind. If we hold this speculation as holding water, then it may be possible for interbreeding with the Savages to begin the potential for perfection.*\n\n*This radical proposal has merits - and there are obstacles to be overcome. However, this proposal proposes that attempts to break and use the Savages for any purposes will help the Empire in many manner - even if the possibility for cross-breeding with the Children of Iso does not bear any fruit. While the Obi\u00e5ugu Hobgoblins work as fantastic workers, their devotion may only go so far - but the Savage can be broken down to be used in many different ways.*\n\n*The Savage can be used in gladiatorial arenas for the enjoyment of the crowd - their love of fighting is one of the notable features in their so-called 'culture' (though it is most disdainful to properly refer to it as a developed culture). Those that are successful in the arenas can be used for breeding; their strength passing down to their children, who will be more malleable and trained in obedience in a Urlmoiim\u00e5z^2 in order to serve the Empire. Those that lose can be broken down further after their defeats, either recycled into the arenas, or sold on to those more interested in using a broken slave for tasks such as; pleasure, punishment, indulgent decadence, Obi\u00e5ugu Hobgoblins breeding, or menial tasks.*\n\n*As an exploratory experiment, this proposal puts forth the following; capturing a Savage in order to determine their capability of interbreeding with the Children of Iso, their capability of interbreeding with the Obi\u00e5ugu Hobgoblins, and how well that they can be broken down through a variety of measures.*\"\n\n\\- From **A Proposal for the Use of Savages by the Isoite Empire** by ***Sister Ozuochi***.\n\n----\n\n## The Children of Iso\n\n\"*The Aasimar of Isoi\u00e5lmo, as they call it, refer to themselves as the Children of Iso - their religious beliefs hold that the Aasimar are the children of the God Iso, and that it is their divine right to rule the land. Through religious indoctrination and divine mandate, they control the Isoite Empire - holding sway of the \"lesser\" Hobgoblins through superstition and religion.*\n\n*It is said in hushed whispers that the Children of Iso, especially those of the Clergy, abuse their power to indulge themselves in decadent and depraved behaviour - perversion and deviance are oft hand-in-hand behind the closed doors of the Manors oft held by the Aasimar. Their firm grasp and control over the Hobgoblins allow them to exert power and indulgence in any regards that they ever so desire.*\n\n*The Aasimar operate under a strict Theocracy - their ruler is simply known only as The Prophet. The clergy control over everything - deeming anything bad as unpure, or worse - Oairi. Large swathes of the clergy have turned to the perverse idea that they may cleanse impurity from others, from dissidents, through lewd behaviours, sexual malice, or worse behaviours. Their objective is to cleanse the body - or to 'introduce' purity to the body in order to destroy the impurity within.*\"\n\n\\- Excerpt from **The Children of Iso** by **Dr Mathias Code**\n\n----\n\n## The Titanfolk\n\n\"*While Half-Orc is a term that would generally be used for these people, it would be a misnomer in this case because the world they come from has no orcs. The Titanfolk speak of Giants as their ancestors, the creation of the Titans, and perhaps it is these giants that once were that were once orcs. But, what I know of as Half-Orcs in this world are Titanfolk.*\n\n*They're great big massive creatures, humanoid in form - but they tower over everyone else like they were so much more. I've yet to see one below six feet and ten inches, that's for sure, and I'm sure that some might even reach eight feet tall. They're not a ugly lot to look at - which is probably where the 'half' comes in - they have a strange savage handsomeness and beauty to them, I suppose, that you might see in tribes that have eschewed civilization.*\n\n*These Titanfolks live in various clans, some small and some big enough to have started cities - but they wander across a place known as the Titan Wilds. The Isoite Empire is afraid - perhaps not a word that they would use, most likely remiss would be used  - to enter into the Titan Wilds because of the Titanfolk. They have a jovial and happy culture, primitive in many ways; their ways revolve a lot around warring, hunting, and fighting, with the notion of honour and honourable actions definitely prevalent to their concept of religion as well.*\n\n*One of the most notable things about the Titanfolks is how they treat 'runts', and the concept of 'petfolk' that is held only be a few clans - and seen as depraved by others. The 'runts' of the Titanfolk are what we would call Humans. They are just average sized humans - often fair skin, compared to the green and browns of the Titanfolks, and just not as big as a Titanfolk. This leads to them being thought of as, and classified as, runts. A runt is like a lesser being to the Titanfolk, but they treat them nearly like you'd treat a pet (only nearly). They're expected to perform tasks, expected to do work around the camps and the homes, but they're never expected to fight, never expected to hunt - in fact, it is considered to be bad form to even strike a runt, as they are considered to be so small and weak that they cannot fight back!*\n\n*And then there are the Petfolk. We would call them slaves. Petfolk, as a concept amongst the Titanfolk, is definitely one that I hear as being quite controversial. A Petfolk is owned by someone and treated exactly like a pet - they are often leashed and collared, and used by their master. They have no rights or power, they have nothing but the will of the master - or mistress. A Petfolk is often taken as a trophy, a defeated Aasimar, perhaps, or a runt taken as payment for victory over another Titanfolk.*\"\n\n\\- Excerpt on **Titanfolk of the Titan Wilds of Iso** by **Tichondrius Kird**\n\n----\n\n## Ondrioro Eer\u00e5\n\n\"*We usually just call it The Pit - the Ascendants^3 often call their places some pretentious sounding name in the Divine Tongue. They call it a City, but The Pit's just a frontier town with a big fuckin' castle in it, and the Arena.*\n\n*Sorry, I mean it's got a big fuckin' Temple in it - we're not meant to call them castles no more. The Ascendants were real clear on that; they temples for worship and proper sanctification. The Pit protects us from the Mountain Pass that connects the Empire to the Titan Wilds - to Oidhuroli\u00e5 - and from the vile Savages beyond it. They ain't bad people, the Savages, they're just unenlightened.*\n\n*But, The Pit; it's a town on the fringes, I suppose. Lead by Father Eithuoz\u00e5z and his clergy - always doing right by the masses and teaching them good. They put on The Games - oh man, that's what the city is really good for, The Games. The best get into the arena and show their faithful against the shit that we can find to put in their. Sometimes they get beasts, sometimes they get the unfaithful, sometimes they get those dirty Oairi and we get to watch them get fucked up good.*\n\n*Of course, the Good Father lets us have the fun that we need to keep us focused on being faithful - there's great brothels in the town, breeding places, and everything. Things you'd expect from a city where we can blow of steam and have some good time - we've got to make sure that we do right by the Ascendants after all.*\"\n\n\\- An account of 'The Pit' by a Hobgoblin Guardsman\n\n----\n\n## Outsiders\n\n\"*Right, look, friend. They just came from somewhere - that's all they said.*\"\n\n\"*They came from somewhere? Everyone comes from somewhere, Kha!*\"\n\n\"*Nah, Rugrin, they came from SOMEWHERE ELSE.*\"\n\n\"*Somewhere else.*\"\n\n\"*Yeah. From beyond. Don't know where, but they came from beyond - and they all different. They ain't the orangefolk, nowhere near the mouthy fucks that the palefolks are, and they definitely ain't from under the mountains like the underfolk are. They from somewhere else, somewhere beyond what we know - somewhere beyond the Sky or some shit. Another world.*\"\n\n\"*So, you're saying that... The Titans must have made other worlds and that's where these guys are from?*\"\n\n\"*Yeah. Something like that - they ain't as strong as us, but they looking to help. They want to sell their services to us.*\"\n\n\"*What services do they offer? What do we need from them?*\"\n\n\"*Well, they're offering us anything for money - or we can sell anything to them.*\"\n\n----\n\n# The Me and Non-Story Stuff\n\nI heard once that the best way to introduce people to the 'lore' of the world is not to dump information on them with just strict facts - but rather to tell a story in some fashion. Hello, greetings, salutations, and other ways to say that! I am Sigma U. Beta, and I am here to propose my interest to anyone that has gotten this far.\n\nOf course, I wrote a bunch of stuff - so if you've not gotten here, or you got bored most of the rubbish that I was spewing out, then I understand. I'm feeling *creative* and this 'world' of mine (small world, known as Iso to 'Outsiders'). You may have noticed that I'm feeling at least a bit creative and experimenting with the format because I just splurged out a bunch of words to you and expected you to read what is essentially my own hubris in posting here, I suppose.\n\nSo, who am I, what do I want, and what do I want from you?\n\n### Who am I?\n\nAs I noted before, I am **Sigma Upsilon Beta** - I know the username might not be visible at this point because of just how long and rambling this is - and I am interested in; writing, roleplaying, decadence, smut, and lewdity. \n\nI have been hanging around and watching Dirty Pen Pals for a while and also thinking about what kind of things that I would want to do - what would interest me and, more importantly, what would challenge me. Well, also what would get me excited and horny, but that doesn't sound as smarmy.\n\nSome astute persons might be aware that I have a penchant for worldbuilding - and if you didn't, let me tell you that I have a penchant for worldbuilding. I create small interconnected worlds (this is the first one that we've seen - but I may be posting more and more if there's interest in this prompt). Worldbuilding is a creative outlet for me - and I want to turn worldbuilding into a lewd outlet for myself as well.\n\nBut, one of the most important things, I hear, is my [Kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/yLu4Xh1.png). That's a lie, I've never heard it as important, but I think I should probably put it out there. I'll even say it again.\n\n[My Kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/yLu4Xh1.png).\n\nI might say it another time, because it might be lost in the sea of me going on and on.\n\n### What do I want?\n\nAs some people might have guessed, I am here to roleplay in a dirty fashion. Now, I know that might sound crazy to some people around here - after all, I'm sure people are just here to read the articles - but it's true. I have come about looking to sate my sexual energy through the medium of roleplaying.\n\n\"But Sigma, how do you want to roleplay\" you might call in question - or you might not, but my imaginary audience is asking this so I can answer the question.\n\nI want to partake in a long-form roleplay over a long time - with many potential styles of writing that I am interested in indulging myself in. The biggest point of contention that I might think there will be is about **Speed of Reply**.\n\nI am not the fastest person to reply - I often have events or people that take me away from my computer and typing on my phone leaves me exhausted from the sheer number of typos or mistakes that are made throughout that can often lead me to talking about ducking a rock, or any other mundanely strange things that autocorrect might enforce upon me.\n\nInstead, I do my best to reply when I can - and usually with a 'quality' (dear lady, I hope so) post of a decent length in reply. The length of a response might, of course, be heavily dependent on what is happening and how much control over the scene there is, but I will always do my best to attempt to write something *interesting*.\n\n\nSome people might astutely be aware that I seem to gear myself towards playing a Female character in this roleplay. I am open to playing either gender, or all genders, but this post will have been marked as [F/GM4A].\n\n### What do I want from you?\n\nI am looking for a partner. Someone that has interests in roleplaying out things over time and not someone who wants immediate gratification from quick fire posts because I am unable to give you that. I do not want to disappoint you, I want to please and pleasure you with words and sexual thoughts.\n\nSo, aside from the obvious fact that I'm looking for a partner, I'm looking for someone who is either a) looking to explore certain aspects of worldbuilding and the world set forth, or b) someone who's really interested in helping me tell a story. Hopefully both.\n\nI am going to lay down some options - potential options - at the end, but I am really interested in hearing from people what they want to do. Not just someone that's read one of the options that I wrote and said \"yeah sure that sounds like sex\", but someone that has a good idea about what they want and what they're going to get from the option too - or even better, someone who wants to build upon things or suggest their own ideas too.\n\nIf you're interested in roleplaying with me, in your message to me I would really appreciate that you put forth some ideas, building upon themes, and also explain to me what kinks you're interested in exploring. What kind of sexual gratification are you interested in experiencing - maybe just a list of the key kinks that you're REALLY interested in, then some bigger list of ones that you just like.\n\nI'd just like to, at the very least, get to know you a little bit before anything gets started - so that we're on the same page. I'm interested in questions as well. My main focus is on looking for someone that's interested, really.\n\nYour gender is not relevant to the story - I am pansexual by nature and I am interested in writing stories with anyone and everyone that shows me interest in the medium.\n\n### Why are you obsessed with Reddit Formatting?\n\nYou may have noticed that I have used a lot of formatting in my post. That is because I think formatting is important - and also I was trying to make sure to seperate a lot of sections, make some narration, and just generally make the post stand out when people come to see it.\n\nOf course, the fact it's long and wordy might mean people immediately baulk at the sheer volume of words and be like 'where the fuck does this Sigma person get off' - which is entirely reasonable.\n\nAlso, I usually get off at home in my own bed under silk sheets where I can enjoy myself in my own privacy. Surrounded by words.\n\n### My Kinklist\n\n[Found here](https://i.imgur.com/yLu4Xh1.png)\n\n# Roleplaying Options\n\nSo, I wrote out a bunch of 'story' elements to try and create the basis of a world in your mind - to set the foundations of how people see each other and also a general area. You may have noticed that the writing mainly focused around a few things;\n\n* The Titanfolks\n    * How the Titanfolk treat 'weaker' races\n* The Children of Iso\n\t* The depravity that comes from being in charge\n\t* The potential punishment that they enact on the 'impure'\n\t* The way that the see 'lesser' races\n* The Pit City\n* Outsiders from the The Other World\n\nThese are not the limits to the roleplays that I'll enjoy - but these are what I've written about and tried to instill some form of idea in your head about them. Of course, what is written is not strictly fact and lore - but rather it's the opinion of others.\n\nSo, in my mind, there are some potential avenues to explore and they have some distinctly different ways of writing. I'll try to put my thoughts to words - which you might notice that I've been doing a lot of. These are not the limits to what I'm thinking about roleplaying, but these are what I'm thinking of right now.\n\n1. **Sister Ozuochi's Experiments.** - [1-on-1]^4 - Sister Ozuochi is a Child of Iso (Aasimar, Ascendant) in the clergy, with ideas about using a Titanfolk (The Savages, Half-Orcs) for many different purposes - either subjugating them to use them as tools, breeding sows, breeding males, actors of punishment, and more, or to use them to breed with the Children of Iso in order to creature **The Pure** - a theoretical theological race mixed between those of the 'Body of Iso' and the 'Divinity of Iso'. This option would be about breaking the strong and obstinate Titanfolk and breaking them down into Sister Ozuochi's sex slave. This prompt plays heavily on themes of Domination, Breaking, Humiliation, Fantasy Raceplay, and Non-Con.\n2. **Sister Ozuochi's Predicament.** - [1-on-1] - Sister Ozuochi wants to capture a Titanfok for her own experimentation - but going into the Titan Wilds is not a safe journey. In the Titan Wilds, she is captured by a Titanfolk, who finds her to be worthy of being one of his Petfolk. This option will be about breaking the strong-willed and haughty Ozuochi. This prompt plays heavily on themes of Domination, Slavery, Breaking, Humiliation, Petplay, Potential Free-Use, and Non-Con.\n3. **An Outsider in The Pit.** - [CYOA]^5 - An Outsider, from beyond Iso, has come to The Pit to investigate. This might be their first time in the Frontier City, and they have begun to explore. They find themselves, somehow, entangled in a web of sex and depravity in some way. This option is a lot more open and a lot about playing into your kinks, as it's meant to be an adventure based around your wants and needs. This prompt is based around **me** telling a story and your agency being simple actions that let me tell a story about your character and what happens to them.\n4. **Investigating the Impure.** - [GM-on-1]^6 - An Inquisitor of the Prophet has been sent to The Pit in order to investigate rumours of depravity far beyond what is the norm - rumours of Oairi being mated with, or worse - bred. The Inquisitor has been tasked with finding the Impure and making sure that they are purified in any possible way. This option is about having your character (presumably the Inquisitor) investigating and utilising depravation and perversion in any way to 'purify' the impure. This prompt plays heavily on themes of Power, and others that can be inserted as part of a preliminary set-up.\n\nThese are four prompts that I have considered - but they are not the be-all-end-all of what potential prompts that there are. You may have ideas of your own - you may want to interact with dwarves, you may want to be The Prophet of Iso and send for people to do your bidding without question (for you are The Prophet and your word is Divine Law). You may want to be an Outsider that captures Titanfolk, or steals away Aasimar for experimentation and breeding.\n\nAs long as you show interested and enthusiasm, I am really interested in whatever ideas that you have for prompts and possible stories in the world - I really am. Just tell me what kind of Story style that you're interested in (and if you really just want to put down some story idea that is a [CYOA] for me to write for, then I am happy to do the work).\n\n# Wrap-up\n\nI have gone on far too long. This post has become obnoxiously long and I'm not even sure if it's going to actually post because it might be a bit too long. If it is too long, then I'm pretty screwed.\n\nIf you have read everything, if you have read only part of this, if you've skipped to this sentence, then thank you for showing some interest. You're all stars to me.\n\nIf you have any feedback on me (\"Sigma, you write too much and should shorten it!\"), then please leave a comment or send me a message. I am always open to receiving a message or feedback in anyway!\n\nSo, I think that's all I got. That's a lie, I could probably say a whole lot more, but I'm going to shut up now.\n\nSigmaUpsilonBeta (\u03a3\u03c5\u03b2)\n\n----\n\n^1 **Oairi.** Those without a soul.\n\n^2 **Urlmoiim\u00e5z.** A church-run orphanage for non-Isoites.\n\n^3 **Ascendants.** The Obi\u00e5ugu Hobgoblin title for all Children of Iso, the Aasimar\n\n^4 **[1-on-1].** A style of play where each player is effectively one character and the story is about the two characters interacting. Other minor characters might co-exist in the world, but they are not relevant to the story.\n\n^5 **[CYOA].** A style of play where I control the world and I do most of the writing - similar to a Choose Your Own Adventure book or a game like Champions of Corruption, your agency in the world is severely limited. I write a post and give you a number of options - you pick an option and then I continue on the story.\n\n^6 **[GM-on-1].** A style of play where I control the world and you have complete and full agency over your character. You are the main character of the story and the world reacts to you completely. The difference between this and [CYOA] is about the degree of control you have over your character - in this style, you have complete control over your character in every regards and I would have little power of control over them.",

As far as my neighbors are concerned, I'm the shy girl with the big boobs who lives at the end of the hall.\n\nI'm not dysphoric about my penis despite its size. I love it and I love the pleasure it can give me. My last two boyfriends wanted me to get bottom surgery, and my answer to them both was...fuck off. My body is mine and I love it as is, with \"endowments\" top *and* bottom. \n\nSo...romance is hard for me to find. People generally aren't \"ready\" for someone like me. So I want you to feed my ego. Tell me that I excite you. Remind me why I'm worthy of worship from men and women both :)\n\nFAQs (because i'm sick of answering these)\n\nHow tall are you?: *5'3*\n\nWhat is your bra size?: *34F*\n\nWhat are your cock measurements: *7\" long flaccid, 10\" long erect. My erect girth is 6\" at the head and 7\" at the mid shaft.*\n\nHow do you hide that thing? *I tuck it back towards my ass with a gaff (basically wide-bottomed panties) and secure it with sports tape. The result looks like a pronounced female pubic mound.*\n\nDo you enjoy shocking a date with your cock? *NOT AT ALL. I made that mistake the first time because I didn't know how to tell him about it, and it backfired horribly. I make it a point to tell a potential partner about my penis as soon as it seems appropriate.*\n\nWhat turns you on? *Above all else, massive endowments on both men and women. Maybe it's a consequence of coming of age with an above average endowment of my own, but even the measurements make me hard (bra size, cock length, etc).*\n\nCan you ejaculate? *Yes.*\n\nCan you tittyfuck yourself / suck your own cock? *I may answer questions like these if you're interesting and I like you.*\n\nEdit: please don't call me a tranny, shemale, futa, etc. Unless you want to be ignored or told off.",

She was devastated when her husband died, and had been using her son as a sort of replacement ever since. Kathy sighed and rolled off the bed, standing before her mirror. She wore nothing but a simple pair of white cotton panties, and thanks to the tremendous amount of exercise she does, she looked amazing.\n\nPerky breasts, a toned body, and a round ass. As she ran a hand through her slightly graying pixie haircut, a smirk came to her face. \"That's it!\" she giggled to herself. She'd just thought of the perfect way to make it up to her son for arguing with him, and also possibly convince him to not leave. She made her way out of her room, and pushed his bedroom door open. She smiled as she saw him still asleep, a tent popping up under his sheets.

You talk about casual sex and I admit I\u2019m still a virgin. Things escalate from there\n\n2. I\u2019ve always been mom and dads favorite. You constantly bring girls home and they disapprove, putting you in the basement. But I can still hear you guys having sex. One night their perfect daughter sneaks it to a party or goes in a date and comes home and asks you to help sneak me back in. You do and things progress.. \n\nI\u2019m open to a few different prompts these are just my favorite. I prefer being dominated and a virgin or not very experienced. Let me know if you\u2019re interested, respond back with a prompt and ages you\u2019re thinking. As long as you\u2019re a little older than me I don\u2019t care.",

            "selftext": "So I've tried this quite a few times now and scenes that have generally worked out well in the past are ones set on trains and buses. Ones that are mostly empty except for you and me, of course. I also like ones where I get followed by people in a car or pickup truck. Meeting with a very nerdy boy or a group of them at or just before a convention is also great fun. If you're into cosplaying and sexy costumes, that one's for you! I am a big fan of Slave Leia, Power Girl, Miranda from Mass Effect, and others with skimpy clothes! \n\nUnlike most of the time, I end up responding to the cat-calling and actually engage with you. You of course get bolder and bolder and start asking me to do more and more sexual things, and for whatever reason (we'll think of one) I end up complying.\n\nSome fun things to do other than just sex would for example be dancing, jiggling my tits, doing exercises, crawling, stuff like that. Making bets is always fun! The more bold and degrading you are, the better. You'll also get bonus points if you treat me like I'm dumb/a bimbo. I think some sexism/misogyny might be fun, too. :)\n\nMy fetishes are humiliation, sexy outfits, public stuff, flirting, being manipulated/tricked and things like that. My character will be called Lina. I have chest length very light blonde hair, and light blue eyes. I'm about 4'11\" tall with big tits (the bigger the better for this fantasy) breasts and a generally pretty curvy body.",

At least they all spoke fluent english, and were quite the attractive bunch.\n\nBut being away from home, you have **needs** that need to be met, so why not break in these whores until they **worship your superior, huge American cock**.\n\nTl;dr I want you to play a well hung(unrealistically so) foreign exchange student who, one by one, shows them how good a real cock can be.\n\n[The Mother Asuka](https://imgur.com/gallery/isWrZ): The matriarch, she is always trying to make sure you are feeling okay and loves to dance around the house as she cleans.\n\n[The Oldest Daughter Hitomi](https://imgur.com/gallery/D1R97):The oldest daughter, she is a very outgoing and flirty individual. And although she has a boyrfriend, she still loves unashamedly walking around the house in basically nothing.\n\n[The youngest Asa](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ex4CJ): She got the short end of the genetic stick, not nearly as developed as her family and thus can be quite shy. Still she always helps you with anything you ask, no question.\n\nKinks: Huge cock(unrealistic), Cock slapping, cock worship, rough sex, noncon, dirty talk, name calling, Raceplay\n\nNo: Toilet Play, gore, bdsm",

While fucking you, I was also fucking my youth minister on his wife\u2019s hand-sewn quilt with little angel babies all over it. You got expelled after being caught bending the cute substitute English teacher over the principal\u2019s desk and I spent a few months in juvie after breaking into a local medical cannabis pharmacy and then forgetting to leave after I got high in the back of the store.  You spent several years in state prison after stealing and selling fifteen Harley Davidson\u2019s belonging to members of the local chapter of the Hell\u2019s Angels. The last time I saw you before the apocalypse, you had thrown a baseball bat at me after I punctured all four of your jacked-up Ford F-150 Raptor\u2019s tires.\n\n*Our Present*\n\nZombies, plague, and a gigantic EMP sort of combined into a massive fucked up trifecta of bad news two years ago. From what I hear, about eighty percent of the world\u2019s population curled up into fetal positions and either went zombie or died. I\u2019m a cockroach, so basically, I thrived under the new regime. I\u2019m twenty-three now and recently divorced (he went zombie on me, so I called the marriage off) from my third or possibly fourth (it\u2019s a little hazy) \"husband\", while healing up from a botched celebratory piercing my brand new (we met in an underground bar two weeks ago and hit it off) best friend gave me. I'd heard about this abandoned Wall-Mart and had fought my way over there and was cleaning out the Walmart Pharmacy, when I ran into *you*. If a dozen zombies hadn\u2019t attacked about then, I would have made clear just how glad I was to see you, but somehow we ended up fighting them off together. Unfortunately, the group of lowlife scum I\u2019d been avoiding for the past few months hooked up with the group of low life scum you\u2019d been avoiding for about the same period of time and we both mutually decided it was a good time to seek out new territories away from our respective sociopathic stalkers.\n\n*The Concept*\n\nWe each create fucked up, but oddly humorous characters who sort of hate each other and go on a road trip through post-apocalyptic middle America taking turns fucking each other and whoever else we run into on the trip and eventually deciding maybe we don\u2019t totally hate each other, because we were apparently terrible at the old America, but are oddly great at surviving the fucked up post-apocalyptic new America. My \u201chistory\u201d can be used or we can create our own messed up history. As we write, I would like it if we kind of went with whatever the other came up with, ala, \u201cremember that time you blew up my dad\u2019s sedan, but it turned out it was really our police chief neighbor\u2019s civilian vehicle?\u201d Ideally, we explore a wide-variety of kinks, have fun, and create some memorable NPCs for us to run into and fuck, kill, or befriend on this journey.\n\nP.S. I wrote this prompt while a teeny tiny bit high so if it makes no sense, there's your explanation.",

            "selftext": "Imperatrix Watson stepped out of the compound to greet the oncoming truckload of slaves. Dressed head to toe in black, from her open-toed stilleto heels to her skin-tight latex catsuit all the way to her dark crown, Emma's honey brown eyes glimmered in the harsh red of the truck's brake lights.\n\n\"Imperatrix Watson!\" Said a breathless shocktroopette. The recruit saluted, her rifle slung over her shoulder. \"W-we didn't know you were coming!\"\n\nWatson's devious smirk didn't budge an inch as she turned toward her subordinate. \"It seems Duchess Stone has been delayed. I thought I'd oversee the intake while I waited.\"\n\n\"Of course, Imperatrix,\" said the recruit. The private opened the back of the large truck. A scent of blood and musk wafted out into the open.\n\nThe recruit took a step back. Emma stepped forward.\n\n20 to 25 naked, chained men sat on benches on either side of the truck's interior. They were universally gagged, and universally loud. Some screamed obscenities around their ballgags. Others pleaded for mercy. Some just screamed.\n\n\"Silence!\" When the Imperatrix lifted her infamous crop into the air, half the crowd quieted. A man near the truck's exit jerked toward Emma, spite evident on his face. The leash around his neck kept him stuck to the wail, and the chain connecting his wrist cuffs to those of his neigbor pulled the other man toward him, wide-eyed in terror.\n\nWatson brought the crop down across the man's face, causing him to cry out once. She brought it back for a second slap, but the man cowered.\n\n\"So easy,\" muttered Emma, shaking her head. Why did they ever think they had a chance?\n\nLooking over her silent captives, Emma placed her crop back into its holster. She looked over the lot once more. Some were soldiers, yet others merely supported the rebels in indirect ways. No matter. They were all useless men, and now they were slaves.\n\nAs men were meant to be.\n\n\"Let me be clear,\" she said in her crisp, alluring voice, \"you will all break. Every boy before you has, and you are no different. Once you are broken, we will decide where you go. Some of you will be put to work, either in our camps, or in our homes. Others will be mere cannon fodder. The choice is yours - will you submit, or will you merely break?\" She let the question hang in the air. \"And if one of you is lucky enough,\" she teased, \"perhaps you'll become my personal pet.\"\n\nUnlikely, but anything was possible. The Imperatrix only took in the best for her personal chambers, although she took part in many interrogations and re-trainings. Ostensibly she did so only to instruct the recruits, but it was an open secret that she took pleasure in the grittier portions of 'male education.' It was a nice way to unwind from her leadership post in Ovaria, as Imperatrix.\n\n\"Single file, boys. Try not to stumble on your feet.\" The stormtroopettes unhooked the men's chains from the car, then pulled them out one by one. They were compelled to march forward by the chain connecting each of their cuffs, held low enough that every man had to bend over, caught in a bow to every woman he passed. The girls were encouraged to jeer, spank, and molest the men as they headed toward the barn, just to show them their place in the new society.\n\n\"Impearatrix.\" Emma watched the men head off, then heard a voice to her side. She turned to see a Ovarian MP standing by her side, the crisp grey uniform a contrast to the colorful surroundings. Only then did her trademark smirk falter.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked.\n\n\"We caught a traitor.\"\n\nEmma looked down. With her neck and wrists caught in iron stocks, a dirty, beaten woman in the rags of a Boy Trainer's outfit knelt in the dirt.\n\n\"She was plotting an escape for some of the higher-ranking captive rebels,\" said the MP. \"We found her with two escapees. One of the men was killed. The other is being questioned.\"\n\nEmma couldn't have cared less about the men. She crouched down and lifted the traitor's chin.\n\n\"Why?\" she asked, brushing the woman's tangled hair out of her face.\n\nThe woman looked at Emma with burning eyes. \"This is not the equality we fought for,\" she snapped. \"This is barbarous.\"\n\nEmma had to hold herself back from rolling her eyes. So she was one of *those* girls. \n\n\"You don't know barbarism,\" she replied calmly. \"You've never lived under patriarchy, have you?\"\n\nThe woman had else to say. Emma stood.\n\n\"She has forgotten the love of sisterhood,\" she said, removing one glove. \"Take her to my chambers. I'll train her myself.\"\n\nThe MP bristled. What the woman yearned for more than anything - a chance to *be* with Emma - was being given to a dirty traitor. \"Certainly, Imperatrix,\" she said in a tight voice.\n\n\"W-wait,\" said the traitor. \"W-what does that mean?\"\n\n\"You'll find out,\" teased Emma, her smile returning. \"I'll see you soon.\"\n\nThe traitor had to be gagged, then nearly dragged toward Emma's 'pleasure room.'\n\nThe Imperatrix looked over the training compound that was hers.\n\nWhat a glorious day, she thought, shutting her eyes softly and letting the sounds of torment play around her.\n\nWhat a beautiful Queendom.\n\nHail, Ovaria.\n",

I love chatting about crazy wild experiences, but I don't have a lot of experiences of my own like that, so I figured I could try roleplaying it. \n\nI want to play as a wild shameless slut, talking about her craziest and most unusual experiences. You can just play as yourself, as if you were actually talking to this girl. If you have anyone in particular that you'd like me to play as, either a celeb, or porn star, or a normal person, feel free to let me know and we can have fun pretending that I'm them and that they're a dirty slut. No limits, whatever you want to talk about is okay with me, though I do have a few favourites like anal, lesbians and exhibitionism.\n\nAlso I want to be in character right from the beginning. I know some people want to do set up before a roleplay, agreeing characters and limits and such, but I want you to message me like I'm this slut. Talk to me like you're talking to any of the other \"Hey I'm a GoneWild slut, give me attention\" type posts that pop up here every now and then, only I won't be nearly as vanilla as most of those.\n\n(I'm not sure what changed since I posted this a few days ago, but instead of getting messages that are just wanting to talk to some slut about her exceptionally past, most of the responses have been giving me a character and setting up a boring old roleplay. **I'm not looking for a simple sex scene roleplay.** I just want a chat about kinky experiences from the perspective of a woman far more slutty than I really am.)",

I'd love to do a cockwarming/undercarriage/cocksleeve/human onahole scene with anyone who's interested. Other than just keeping my pressed tight to your torso and using my like I'm just an accessory, there are plenty of things that can go into the rp to make it interesting. \n\nWe could instead go for a fantasy setting with slaves, centaurs, and transformative magic. \n\nWe could try something illicit or incestual. Maybe I'm helping mom out around the house while she bounces me on her cock....\n\nMaybe something drug field and spontaneous, my lips gushing with every pass of the piercing studded cock that holds me up at the concert. \n\nSuffice to say, I'm sure we can create something fun and unique. \n\nIf you're interested, just let me know, and we can chat about kinks and characters. I'm an adult, only looking for another adult to role play a fantasy of mine. I hope to see some envelopes soon! \n\nPs. Futas and herms get priority. ",

I ended up going to summer school to catch up. Apparently it still didn't help. The same thing happened but this time they said because I was already on probation I have to withdraw and reapply to restart. \n\nThis sucks :( and I feel dumb but last year reddit helped a lot. I guess if you like my old posts we can do stuff like that? I'm kinda up for anything.\n\nMy parents aren't happy but my daddy says I can regroup and try something else that I'm better suited for or that I like. My mom says they'll come here in the summer to help me figure stuff out. They said I can go home to london if I want or stay in new york (they're abroad on business anyway)\n\nMy friends in Miami and LA say I should go there for spring break. Besides I'm tired of the cold so I may as well. I guess I really just need a distraction if you could help? I want to have some fun to take my mind off all this stuff.\n\nI'm 165cm tall, slim 50 kg, (that's 5'5\" and 110 in american), olive skin, brown eyes, dark brown hair, D cup (enhanced lol), piercings: ears, nipples, navel, and tongue piercing.\n\nI actually got offered a modelling job last week and I thought it would be cool but the guys were super sleazy so I turned it down. I don't need a job, I just want something to do with my life if that makes sense?\n\n[kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ulEeyx4.png)",

Not roleplay, get on kik, leave reddit or become friends on facebook so if you're going to start throwing talk about RP prompts my way or ask me to go anywhere but here you clearly didn't read what I'm looking for. I'm sorry, but ain't nobody got time for that.\n\nThat being said, if you have dark, perverted fantasies then I want to hear about them! The more depraved the better. Do you enjoy being objectified? Are you a feminist with a secret desire to be brutally put in your place? Agree that gender equality is a sad misconception? Think skewers are better than needle play? Are you the kind of girl who'd be waiting on her knees in lingerie for her owner to come home, open her mouth to take his cock as greeting, who would transition from being used as urinal to working hard to earn her first load of cum? The kind to twisted mind who would seduce and corrupt her best friend or little sister to offer her to her master's pleasure?\n\nThen let's talk :)\n\nI have very few limits (pretty much only scat and other messy things such as vomit and politics), but some strong preferences. A fucktoy is made to look pretty and suffer, should be a canvas for marks showing her status, be it tattoos and piercings or brands and scars.\n\nIf you enjoy being restrained and controlled, feel BDSM is too tame, or anything in between, let's chat for a bit about humiliation, torture, bimbofication, body modification, beatings, brutal abuse, deprivation, marking, choking, whoring out, DD/lg, all the good stuff...",

            "selftext": "Sigmund Freud sat at his writing desk, dipping the tip of his quill pen into an inkwell as to continue writing when he was interrupted. His mother opened the door to his study and announced \"Oh Siggy! There's a young man for you at the door.\" Amalia stood with the door to his cramped study slightly ajar, and motioned for him to rise, but Frued instead replied, \"Send him in, I haven't the time for your games!\" She tittered and left, presumably to bring in this stranger she spoke of. Freud returned his focus to his writings, until his mother returned, with none other than Carl Jung by her side. Freud stood up quickly, as he did upturning his desk and sending an inkwell to the floor where it shattered.\n\n\"Carl!\" He gasped, \"What brings you here, I'm so sorry, I should've come right to the door!.\" As Jung responded, Freud's mother sidled over next to her son, and began to clean up the broken glass and spilled ink. \"Why I thought you must hear the news, they've dug up a mummy in the tomb down in Egypt, it's thought to be King Tut!\" Freud turned stunned, \"King Tut, but that was supposed to be a a legend!\" He looked down at his mother, and noticed she wasn't wearing any underwear. \"Are they sure that's the identity of my mommy,\" as Freud's tongue slipped, so did his feet, caught in particularly thick puddle of ink. Carl gasped, and went to rush to friend's side, but Freud's mother, Amalia, quickly told him \"Oh don't worry about it, I'll take good care of him,\" and began to rub his thighs, hidden to the eyes of Carl Jung by her body placed just so in-between the two. Freud croaked and his body stiffened, but when he spoke his voice came out clearly enough. \"Well, I'll be just alright, but if there is a mother, erm, another discovery, keep me informed!\" Carl left the room, muttering unintelligibly under his breath only seven of the words he spoke could be heard, ever so softly by the two lying on the ground. \"It's always about his mother, isn't it.\"\n\nP.S. I'm down to chat about whatever, I just wrote this because I had the idea of Freud slipping during a Freudian slip, and I had to get that pun out of my head.",

I want to roleplay a scenario where we meet, either at the gym, at work or on tinder. We exchange pleasantries and then you suggest we get down to business. \n\nMe: 33 year old, fair skinned, long blonde hair and blue eyes, C-cup breasts in normal condition for my age, I'm by no means super fit and have a flat stomach, but I'd say I hold up pretty well!\n\nMy kinks include dirtytalking, hot, passionate sex, lingerie, being dominated a little. \n\nNo wetplay, blood or scat.\n\nSo, who are you? Age doesn't really matter, neither does your body. Not looking for some greek god, but also not looking for a bearded lumberjack with a beerbelly. Anything in between I guess is good.\n\nSend me a message where you introduce and discribe yourself, and what you want to roleplay :)",

            "selftext": "Hello DPP! Last time I posted this prompt I got a lot of great responses and I'm hoping fir more of the same this time! I love this subreddit and wanted to meet some new people and enjoy my favorite type of roleplay!\n\nI want to GM a game for you. The setting and type of story can all be determined by you! Do you want to play in a fantasy setting? Modern? Sifi? Let's do it! Sexual? Romantic? Sounds good! Do you want to solve mysteries? Dominate the world? Fall in Love? Yes, yes, and yes. I love telling stories and with over a decade of experience DMing tabletop roleplaying games, I think I'm pretty good at it.\n\nSo what do I need from you? In your pm please tell me about the story you want to play. Let me know the setting, the theme, and about your character (Including either a picture or description). I don't share about your irl gender or age because we're playing characters here, not ourselves. Additionally, when replying I'll match your writing length, if you regularly respond with 2-4 sentences, that's what I'll reply with, 3-4 paragraphs? Not a problem.\n\nLast thing I feel like I should share are my kinks and limits (because let's face it, 99% of my responses are going to be sexual in nature lol) I'm open to trying any kink that's not on my limits list. So if you want to try out a kinks or fetishes that rarely gets attention on here, now's your chance! As for my limits? They're as follows: blood, vomit, scat, gore, vore, and snuff. Everything else is fair game! So let's see some orange letters! Please include your character's name in the title so that I know you read this whole thing... Not that it's particularly long... I'm on mobile... typing more than this is hard... sue me...",

            "selftext": "This week has been incredibly long and stressful. Tonight, I\u2019d love to find some wonderfully naughty people to degrade, break and ruin me. I enjoy things dark, cruel and sadistic, so if you\u2019re looking for something vanilla, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not the person you\u2019re looking for. \n\nAs I said in the title, I\u2019m a nerd. I love video games, comics and all the likes. That said, I\u2019d love to include characters from those endless universes. We can base the scene in that setting, or just use the characters looks. \n\nI enjoy many things and my kinks definitely outweigh my limits, so I\u2019m very open to different things. My favorite kinks would be: Massive/Hyper cocks, torture, hole wrecking, bondage, water sports, Futa, beastiality, face fucking, race play, messy and dirty sex, vomit, degradation, transformations and so many more. My only limits are scat, vore and diapers. I do have a few scene ideas in mind, but I\u2019d love to hear any that you have. \n\n1. A scene set in Gotham. This could include many things, but I\u2019d like to base the story off of one of these characters; Harley Quinn, Batgirl, Catwoman, or Poison Ivy. This can go so many ways, I\u2019d love to discuss details and figure out the perfect scene. It could follow Harley Quinn throughout her time with The Joker, detailing all the horrific acts they did together. Batgirl could be stepping in for Batman, trying to cure the plague of crime enveloping the city. This could follow her adventures, attempting to save the city while being raped and abused by the countless criminal organizations. Catwoman could have robbed the wrong person and had to pay the price. Maybe she hits an easy target only to find out it was a trap. Poison Ivy could be captured and tortured, forced to work with one of the other criminal masterminds to take over the city. Like I said, countless possibilities. \n\n2. Apocalypse. This can go a multitude of ways. The first being a zombie apocalypse. I know this sounds kind of corny, but imagine a apocalypse where all the zombies are sex crazed fiends instead of brain hungry beings. Instead of biting the victim for them to turn, it could be a load of potent semen. If you enjoy Futa, we could make the world to where if a woman was infected, she grew a cock. There are so many routes we could take in building this world. It could follow one person, or a group of people. The second way the apocalypse setting could go, would be more like fallout. Nuclear war caused the world to turn into a wasteland. From there, we can build however we want. It can be set right after the world falls apart, or years afterwards. \n\n3. This one isn\u2019t really a set scene. We could set the scene in a variety of fan fictions. Anywhere from the wizard world of Harry Potter, to the vast expansion of space that is Star Wars. Other worlds could be Skyrim, Game of Thrones, Marvel Universe, DC universe, and many more. We could just use rule 34 characters or even celebrities in our RP, like I said, I\u2019m very open to ideas. \n\nI\u2019d prefer to have literate partners, who don\u2019t send one liners. I like to include details and have a good build up for the stories. Also, long term is preferred and patience is welcomed. I have a very busy life and can\u2019t always respond immediately. \n\nWell, if you made it this far, I thank you! I hope I have at least piqued your interests and I can\u2019t wait to speak with you!",

            "selftext": "I spit on the ground in disgust as I walked through the gates into the Elvish city of *Neselon* the Dwarven blood flowing through my veins was practically boiling having been forced into the capital city of the Elves. I was a mercenary that had been hired by a travelling merchant as a guard. A snarl like expression was on my face as I trudged through the streets, the elves giving me a wide berth as they saw the heavyset battleaxe hanging from my back.  \n  \nSometime later we arrived in the market square and I had calmed down a little bit. The Halfling merchant I was employed by began shouting orders, although she was small she knew how to control her crew. \u201cTringad!\u201d She shouted at me. \u201cI want you guarding the left side, near the jewellry. Use those beady dwarf eyes and make sure no one steals anything.\u201d She said mostly in jest as I roared in laughter and moved over to the aforementioned area.   \n  \n\u201cAye why don\u2019t ye shut your trap yer shorter than me, that\u2019s a fucking disgrace that is.\u201d My voice is guttural with a heavy dwarven accent.  \n  \n\u201cJust remember who fills your coin purse!\u201d She mock threatens me.   \n  \n\u201cAye, and I\u2019ve got a battleaxe the same size as you, Kalree!\u201d I jokingly threaten right back. Although that was a bit of an overstatement, my battle axe was about 2 feet long whereas Kalree was somewhere around 2 foot 8 inches.  \n  \nKalree stepped behind the custom made fold out counter attached to the caravan and got ready for a day of selling all sorts of wares, fine jewellry from the Dwarves of Bhal Ghorn to potions made by the Dragonborn of Kraad.\n  \nAs the sun was beginning to set and we were getting ready to close up the shop and find a tavern to get a drink for the night I spotted a young elf boy, no more than 15 years old trying to sneakily grab a piece of jewellry. I grabbed his wrist tight before he could grab something and run off. \u201cAnd what do ye think yer doing?\u201d I barked out, my other hand reaching to threateningly grab my battleaxe.   \n  \n\u201cI-I\u2019m s-sorry Sir Dwarf.\u201d The boy stammered out \u201cI-I\u2019m just so hungry.\u201d The boy looked down at his shoes, I could tell tears were beginning to form in his eyes. Now that I could get a proper look at him, the boy was very thin looking, thinner than an Elf should be and his clothes were tattered and torn.  \n  \nMy features began to soften slightly. I wordlessly pulled out my coin purse and held out a few copper for the boy. \u201cNot even an elf deserves to go hungry.\u201d My voice is softer now, though still gruff and guttural. A look of happiness comes over the boy and he hesitatingly grabs the coins from my hand.   \n  \n  \n\u201cT-thank you Sir.\u201d he says with a tentative smile.\n  \n\u201cAye. Run along now lad\u201d The boy walks away and I turn back towards the caravan to see Kalree giving me a sly grin. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything Kalree.\u201d I snap as I begin to help her pack up her wares.  \n  \nWe finish packing up and locking the caravan before we go searching for a tavern to have a drink before bed. As we were walking through the partially illuminated streets searching for a place to drink my eyes came upon what was clearly a brothel, an Elvish girl with long blonde hair was stood outside beckoning customers in. \u201cI\u2019ll meet up with ye later Kalree.\u201d I say staring at the elf.  \n  \n\u201cJust don\u2019t get venereal disease.\u201d She says with a knowing grin.   \n  \n\u201cAye.\u201d I couldn\u2019t wait to get inside, the last time I had been to *Neselon* I had visited a brothel, although not the same one, Elves were a good lay. It seems Elves could be good for something after all. I entered the brothel to find exactly as one would expect, scantily clad women milling around with customers, mostly Elves although there were a few other races present. My eyes immediately focused on a beautiful Elf with long red hair and porcelain skin.  \n  \nI made my way over to her with lust in my eyes. \u201cAre you free lass?\u201d I asked her, reaching out to feel the curve of her hips.   \n  \n\u201cI am Sir Dwarf, may I ask your name?\u201d Her voice was typical of an Elf, though there was a seductive undertone to it.   \n  \n\u201cTringad lass, and yours?\u201d I asked as my rough fingertips felt her smooth skin.   \n  \n\u201cSaria. Would you like to go somewhere more private?\u201d She asked taking hold of my hand.   \n  \n\u201cAye.\u201d  \n  \nAfter my encounter with Saria I paid her how much I owed her - 10 Silver and as far as I was concerned worth every coin that I dropped into her smooth hand. I walked along the street searching for a tavern to get a drink, when I walked in a few Elves gave me looks but they mostly kept to themselves. \u201cI\u2019ll have a Dwarven Ale, if ye have it.\u201d I said to the barmaid as I sat down on the stool, looking around to see if I could maybe spot Kalree anywhere.  \n  \n\u201cDon\u2019t have Dwarven.\u201d She says pouring me an Elvish Ale.  \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019ll have to do I suppose.\u201d I hand her a copper and grab the tankard.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------  \n  \nHey there, I\u2019m Edward and that\u2019s my first ever foray into a high fantasy setting. This is obviously meant to be quite romantic and tells the old as time tale of two falling in love who really should not fall in love. I don\u2019t really care about who your character is or how we meet as long as you are a female elf, you could be the barmaid, or maybe you\u2019re a patron of the bar, or maybe you saw my act of kindness to the elf boy and were interested in me. Nor do I care about your real life gender, as long as you play a female elf. I want the roleplay to have a decent focus on the elf bringing out the gentler side of my character, him normally being the typical idea of a dwarf.\n",
