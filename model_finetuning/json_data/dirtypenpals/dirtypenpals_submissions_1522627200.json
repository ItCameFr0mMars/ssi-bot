            "selftext": "Astra\u2019s military has always been a rough environment, even for the most seasoned of warrior seeking for a steady regimen. \n\nViolent abuse, both for disciplinary action as well as mundane training, is the King\u2019s Battalion\u2019s worst kept secret. Humiliation and degradation can really break down a soldier\u2019s spirit, until it is like soft and wet clay, ready to be molded into a subordinate that throws themselves into battle as fodder, if need be.\n\nHazing runs rampant, too, especially for the new recruits, and the smaller ones. The ones who already can\u2019t fight back. It is sickening, but such is military life, is the standard response.\n\nMaybe it is\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve known very little but abuse for the first few months as part of the infantry. Not because I am weak or a snitch or\u2026 many other things. No, I just happened to be a *\u201dgirl\u201d* in a men\u2019s world.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many women in Astra\u2019s army, maybe two percent or so, and 99% of those couple of women aren\u2019t out in the field, like me, protecting the borders from whatever lurks in the Great Green or fend off warring empires. \n\nNaturally, I had to prove myself double at every corner. Be it mental or physical, my competence has always been in question. And when you have a larger bust or toned legs... oh, but *of course* \u201cthe boys can\u2019t control themselves\u201d, so a bit of sexual misconduct was *expected.* There weren\u2019t many days where I didn\u2019t have to try and cool my boiling blood. \n\nObstacle course? Of course *someone* would grab my ass accidentally. \n\nTraining under an orcan spell? Of course *I* was the first to be drenched in my white cotton attire, involuntarily becoming the sole wet t-shirt contestant for the men to gawk at. \n\nA position for squad commander opened up? Of course it went to a male soldier, the guys *just can't* concentrate with an attractive woman leading preperation.\n\nOne of the boys got a little drunk off-duty and rubbed their *throbbing* cock against my ass while I was cataloguing our inventory? Well, that\u2019s just how the guys are!\n\nBut I dug my way through. I carved my path. I *stayed*.\n\nWhen I look in the mirror, I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve become, as a person, as a soldier, and as a woman.\n\nI\u2019m strong-willed (and just straight up strong), confident, know how to protect myself and others. I\u2019m competent and loyal, and I take my responsibilities seriously, and fulfill them dutifully.\n\nAnd, yes, thanks to all the training, [I\u2019ve got some *bangin\u2019* thunder thighs, buns of steel, a pair of large, perky tits (thanks mom, I know I got those from you!), and abs carved by the finest artists in all of Astra.](https://i.imgur.com/9J6mAhZ.png) Okay, maybe that\u2019s a little too far... I\u2019m not quite as hulking as the Orcs\u2019 women, or even the more brutish of our men, but I\u2019m fit as the heavens, okay? \n\nAnd while I know that most of the men linger a little longer in the showers when I\u2019m there, and their rods grow stiff even after the most exhausting of units, and\u2026 And while I know most of the guys talk behind my back about how they\u2019d like to thrust into\u2026 \n\nUhm\u2026\n\nWhere was I?\n\n\u2026\n\nOh, yeah! Look, I know most of the guys strip me with their eyes. I\u2019m one of few girls around, and even fewer look like me - sorry to brag - and nobody ever taught these soldiers basic decency. But I *know* they respect my ability nonetheless. When shit hits the fan out in the fight, they come to me for help. They consult with me, and plan with me, and our commander utilizes my full potential.\n\nI can\u2019t beat the way men have been raised for centuries, I can\u2019t beat biology, and I can\u2019t beat the military\u2019s systematic abuse. But I *can* triumph in spite of it.\n\nOr at least\u2026 I could, once\n\nYesterday, there was an incident.\n\nYou see, the men went out drinking, and when they returned, I was on guard. And they *wanted* me to play along.\n\n\u201cHey, sugartits,\u201d one of them yelled at me from across the yard. I could feel my cheeks flush red, not with shame or flattery, but with anger at his words.\n\nBut still, I kept composure and stayed where I am. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always so tense, Alexandria, why don\u2019t you relax sometimes?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I bet you could use a good fucking to mellow out.\u201d\n\nAnd they laughed. \n\nI just remained silent, taking deep breaths.\n\nOne of the men grabbed his crotch, and I could see the outline of a sizable shaft press through the fabric of his trousers.\n\n\u201cI bet a tough girl\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cUptight slut,\u201d one of his friends chimed in.\n\n\u201c... like you\u2019s a total freak in bed. What you like, Alex? You into being tied up?\u201d\n\nNow my face flushed with anger *and* shame. It\u2019s none of their business, and submission in bed does *not* make me weak. \n\n\u201cLeave me alone.\u201d\n\nI mouthed the words with deflated lungs, my hands balling into fists. \n\nMuch to my chagrin, I could feel that my worked up state caused my breathing to shift into extremes. Shallow, rapid little huffs, and then deep inhales followed by heavy sighs.The latter of which made my chest rise and fall, and strain a little too much against the unreasonably tight uniform I\u2019d always been assigned.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, just let us get a peek at those and\u2026\u201d\n\nI could feel it. A hungry, predatory stare that soon became physical; unkind fingers digging into the sole softness my body was offering.\n\n*He was grabbing my tits.*\n\nIt took only a second for me to grip his wrist, and twist, a pathetic cracking sound crepitating beneath his skin, followed by the sound of a genuine cry of pain. \n\nHis friends backed off with angry surprise, looking at his clearly dislocated bones, and my glowing face. I\u2019ve always had a nice, clear complexion, neither pale nor tan, but now my freckles were disappearing in the deep red that spread across the bridge of my nose and cheeks, my golden eyes flickering between them, like a cornered animal scanning for escape, and well-groomed, curved brown brows furrow in anger and\u2026 a sense of\u2026. \n\n*intimidation.*\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking asshole, Capper, you know that?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t really know what I was saying or doing in the moment. I just reached and grabbed the bulge he teased me with before, and closed my fingers as firmly around his cock as I could, trying to hurt him, *really* hurt him, just *crush* his stupid organ so he'd never do this again.\n\nMy body was hovering above his, in what *felt* predatory, but I know now *looked* a whole lot more\u2026 \n\n*...sexual.*\n\n\u201cWhat is going on here, Soldier?\u201d\n\nThe cold voice of our Senior Chief echoed across the earthen yard, and I felt a shiver run down my spine.\n\nHis sigh was so *dismissive* and airy, like he couldn\u2019t take what he saw seriously, and it made me absolutely dread the words that\u2019d exit his mouth.\n\n\u201cThis is the fourth alteration of\u2026 *this* nature this month, Soldier.\u201d\n\nIt was true. We had returned from an eight-weeks excursion, and prostitution had been penalized for soldiers just recently. Naturally, sexual frustration was at an all-time high within our rows, and I was the almost sole recipient of these primal urges, leading to more conflict with improper undertones than I cared for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s time for your correction, Soldier. Tomorrow, after sunrise in the Front Field. Understood?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\n\nAnd so I headed towards the bunks, the echoes of jeers and taunts splitting the darkness of the night. I didn\u2019t even undress, I just slid under my sheets and buried my face in the pillow, until I passed out in a haze of embarrassment, disappointment, and anger.\n\nI\u2019m awake now, but I\u2019m still irritated; irritated at the men, irritated at the unfairness of me being punished, irritated at not knowing what my punishment even is, and irritated at my reflection looking back at me, disheveled. \n\nMy large eyes blink back at me from the mirror, a small mouth with plump lips smouldering like a heartbroken teenage girl, and a scrunched up button-nose flaring its nostrils in anger. My foxy mane, a deep brown with glowing streaks of red, is tousled and unkempt, fine strings of red glowing in the faint light, unfitting of an exemplary soldier such as myself.\n\nI do what I can to fix myself, but prioritize punctuality over presentability in what can\u2019t be described as anything but a judgement call. I strip my creased shirt and throw it under my blankets without much care, and *rip* a clean top from my drawers, spilling the other shirts in the process. I adjust my wrinkled bra straps in the process, until they neatly rest against my flesh, flat and proper.\n\nWhen I step out into the Front Field, I feel the chilliness of the morning taunt me in my light attire, making me regret trading away my messy but cozy shirt. \n\nThe climate is nothing compared to the white-hot heat flushing my face when I lay my eyes on the dozen rows of soldiers lined up, their gazes drilling holes into me. The Chief emerges from the front row, a grim expression glueing his brows into a chronic glare.\n\n\u201cSoldier, there have been more than weekly occurrences of sexual violence in our base, you at the center of each of them. I understand the struggle of a minority female soldier\u201d - No, you fucking *don\u2019t.\u201d - \u201cbut it is not acceptable to violate a soldier\u2019s body in the way you\u2019ve done last night. So, I\u2019ve conferred the duty of determining a suitable punishment for you to your victim\u2019s father, the Grand Chief.\u201d\n\nMy insides freeze solid. I can *feel* my stomach coil into knots, icy clumps sinking to the bottom of my torso like an anvil. \n\n\u201cS-Sir?\u201d\n\nI can see his grin in the back row, even from here; his teeth seem canine, how they peek through his curled lips, all along the side of his face, like a maniac. *Of course* the guy who thought he could just grab me was the entitled brat of the Grand Chief. *Of fucking course*.\n\n\u201cSoldier, your punishment is this.\u201d\n\nHe gestures with grandeur towards a most peculiar contraption. A sort of two-wheeler, largely bare-bones and simplistic, but locked into place. Instead of the saddle, a phallic shape is mounted, glistening wet in the velvety pink light of the rising sun.\n\nI swallow audibly, and shuffle, little backwards steps greedily shoveling distance between myself and that\u2026 *thing*.\n\n\u201cSir, with all due respect, this is\u2026 I can\u2019t, please\u2026\u201d\n\nI *beg*. I never begged before. Not in years. Not since I\u2019ve been here.\n\nI feel small. My trained body and steeled resolve are suddenly and *dauntingly* worthless, and a sense of repressed paternal chastization stabs my sides in the most disarming manner imaginable.\n\n\u201c*Please*, Sir.\u201d\n\nI can hear snickers and hushes in the crowd, fingers pointing at me without any shame, as long as the Chief\u2019s back is turned to them.\n\n*Cowards.*\n\n\u201cSoldier, there is clearly some sort of sexual aggression in your mind. There\u2019s no use giving you a cold shower here, or a day in the hole. You know how we work here.\u201d\n\nHis voice cold, yet seething. My heart is *racing*, pounding so bad I can feel my blood rush through my temples and behind my ears, furthering the sense of drowning that has crept into my mind. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t lying.\n\nWhen a soldier was caught stealing, they had burned his hands in a bonfire.\n\nWhen a soldier was giving up a unit and his broke down, they\u2019d hang him up and beat him until he never dared to let himself collapse again.\n\nWhen a soldier was refusing orders, they whipped him in the rain, naked, until he was compliant.\n\nSo, now, when they judge a soldier to have an issue with sexual aggression, they make her ride it out in front of everyone\u2026\n\n*What?*\n\n\u201cPlease, Sir, lock me into the hole for a week. Two weeks! No food, no nothing but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cStrip, and on the seat, Soldier,\u201d he barrages over my protests, a bark with cutting disdain for talking back.\n\nI can feel the heat that had risen into my face creep a little higher, and melt into salty droplets, little wet streaks gliding down my high, proud cheeks. \n\nMy hands don\u2019t feel like mine. I can feel them slip the tank top off of me, in the same way the guys do their own, the fingers grabbing at the seam in the back of neck hole, and pulling it off in a forward pull, exposing my plain, black bra.\n\nNext, the pants. I\u2019m shaking so bad, the rolled up bottom legs are like tripwire. \n\nThe feel of cold air and scorching vulnerability cake in a thin film of sweat and terror on my exposed body, but my hands continue to move on their volition. \n\nMaybe my body knows that, if I didn\u2019t cooperate, they\u2019d simply do it themselves, with additional punishments piling up. Or maybe my brain\u2019s just too paralyzed to route impulses into autonomous movement, instead simply *obeying*.\n\nI pull off the tight fabric, and feel my breasts fall into place, heavy and unbearably in sight. I can hear commotion in the rows. My pink peaks are hardened, not out of arousal, but courtesy of the cold morning air, but they don't are about the why.\n\nMy lips are quivering, and I taste salt as my tears glide against my slightly opened mouth, but my commands are not fulfilled yet. \n\nMercilessly, my hands snake downwards, two thumbs resting underneath the seam of my panties; they\u2019re nothing to write home about: Plain, black, practical, a little bit of flesh revealed - hip cleavage is what they call it - not for seduction, but simply as a result of my built curves.\n\nMy own fingers betray me as I feel myself tug at the stretchy band, and eventually pull down. I\u2019ve always been shaven bare, and I know most of the men knew already. The showers are shared, after all, the low number of infantry women not warranting separate sanitation.\n\nStill, this is different. I\u2019ve felt them stare before, in the shower, or when I change in the bunks. But this is peeling layer after layer for their viewing pleasure. This is offering. \n\n*Presenting*. \n\nGiving them my body.\n\nMy arms are by my side, stiff and unmoving, hands balled into shaking fists. My head is hanging low and my eyes are glued to the floor.\n\n\u201cIn your place, Soldier.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, in your place slut!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no reaction from the Chief towards the heckler, and suddenly the whole ordeal feels even less legitimate, like he\u2019s approving of his men feasting on my involuntarily debauchery.\n\nOne leg awkwardly lifts over the metal frame, the device\u2019s stored coldness radiating against my thighs, spawning a plethora of goosebumps. My entrance is only an inch above the artificial cock, and I can feel my legs toe-in, desiring themselves to close off any access to my sex, as if to initiate a last-ditch effort to protect my shame.\n\n\u201cMount it, and cycle till you\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t happening.\n\nIt can\u2019t be.\n\n*Oh, dear Lords!*\n\nIt\u2019s so demeaning. My teeth are biting down into the soft flesh just below my bottom lips, and my brows furrow into a wave of weakness, as I slide down on the lubed up toy. \n\nI feel invaded and whored out.\n\nMy eyes threaten to close against my effort to remain stone-faced, ultimately turning my features into an erotic struggle that likely entices the men rather than discourage them.\n\n\u201cCycle!\u201d \n\nI hear the Chief\u2019s voice through a liquid barricade, the blood rushing through my head now almost deafening.\n\nMy legs slowly move, one knee bending, while the other straightens out. One foot pushing down, while the others lifts.\n\nIt *moves*.\n\n*I* make it move.\n\nIt is *fucking* me.\n\n*I\u2019m fucking myself*.\n\nFor *them*.\n\nMy chest is rising and falling notably, supple flesh shaking whorishly. My heavy-lidded eyes are coated in an opaque blindfold made of closing lashes and tears, as I pant like a bitch in heat, the long shaft sliding in and out of my cunt rapidly.\n\nI\u2019m *wet*.\n\nI can feel it run down my thighs, and the shame of knowing they can see it burns up my insides. \n\nI *hate* the heat with which my cunt is clenching again and again.\n\nMy fingers wrap tightly around the handlebars, as I remain mounted on the disciplinary prick. I can feel my hips buck and roll, pushing out my ass, and I see spectres of their fingers pointing at me, wolf whistles sounding somewhere in the distance. \n\nThe worst part is how my body revels in the attention. In the degradation. In the exposure.\n\nMy brain short-circuits\n\nShame, anger, and lust melt with self-loathing. \n\n*Am I nothing but a useless slut after all?* *Where is my self-respect?* *Am I nothing but a little needy cunt?*\n\nI feel my vision fade completely for a moment, like a frame cut out. \n\nMy back is straightening, then arching, then arching further, *even further*, arching into a perfect curve, my ample hips like a continuation of the device\u2019s handles; so very *grabable*. \n\nMy shoulders have shifted backwards, hands lifted off the bars now, and my arms in that reptilian mid-air position.\n\nMy breasts perk up, their buds undeniably at attention. I can feel my hands shoot up, cupping my breast in primal instinct, shielding them from *their* view; then I feel my fingers *knead* the flesh.\n\n*I need this.*\n\nMy legs twitch.\n\nM exposed midriff is tensing tightly, and in perfect synchronicity with my servile whines and whimpers, enough to pronounce my abs until they cast gentle shadows against my sweat-coated, glistening skin\n\nI cease to cycle, the built momentum continuing to thrust the cock into my gushing slit.\n\n\nI *cum*.\n\n*Keep cumming\u2026*\n\n*Fuck\u2026*\n\n*Mmmh!*\n\nFinally, the waves subside, my body limp and defeated. \n\nDefiled by a machine.\n\nPlundered.\n\nExploited.\n\nRaped.\n\nI can hear muted whispers and gasps of the men. I can almost feel the throbbing within their underpants. Blood pumping. \n\n*More* pumping.\n\nMaybe I should just\u2026 accept that I\u2019ll never be one of the boys\u2026 \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just\u2026 one *for* the boys\u2026\n\n---\n\nSo yes, I hope you liked it. I know it\u2019s quite long! I\u2019d like to pick it up where this ends. The conflict between being so publically humiliated and yearning to be a strong, respected adventurer. Maybe we could play out the following few days within the military camp. I could leave and venture on my own, only to fall prey to vicious orcs, seductive elves, or malevolent sorcerers? Maybe I relent and instead work in the fantastical brothels of Astra? There\u2019s a lot of choices. Message me with ideas, and such. I do feel this is obvious but to avoid confusion: I'm not looking to play Brigitte or anything like that, I just thought she'd be a good reference for an admittedly difficult to describe properly (for me, anyways) physique.\n\nI\u2019d like to play in Google Docs for keeping it organized and easy to read.\n\nMy limits are pee, poop, human x human raceplay, underage characters, and non-anthropomorphic-ish animals.\n\nI like anything BDSM (slaps, spanks, choking, leashes, restraints, rope etc.), pet play, cum play, praise, \u201cgood girls\u201d, Daddy, free use, tentacles, and mind control. \n\nLooking forward to your messages!\n",

            "selftext": "I have never admitted it to anyone, but I always flirted just a little bit when *he* was around. \n\nWhen I was invited to the Christmas party, I chose a skirt that was just a tiny little bit shorter than appropriate. When we went to the beach, I made sure to wear a bikini that made *me* feel uncomfortable every time I felt eyes on my body that weren't his. When I was listening to her, during brunch, raving about their romantic weekend trip for her birthday, I spaced out and put myself into her place.\n\nI felt so bad.\n\nShe is *my sister*. And even if she wasn\u2019t my own flesh and blood, I\u2019m not *that* kind of girl. I don\u2019t want to be a home wrecker, or make anyone cheat. Hell, I\u2019ve been there myself, and it feels worse than I can put into words. And yet, here I am, imagining him with me, not her. He makes me think these things. He\u2019s all I can think about these days. Everything about him drives me wild.\n\nHe\u2019s so hot; his body is making me want to get on all fours and just *present* myself to him like a bitch in heat. Me! Out of all people, the goody two shoes, the barely 18 years old, the responsible student, the button up shirt with a buttoned top button-sorta me. \n\nIt's not like it matters, right? He's out of my league.\n\nI\u2019m not bad looking by any means. In fact, I\u2019d say I\u2019m fairly hot, if you\u2019re into my kinda looks. I\u2019m pale. Crimson curls that reach just below my shoulders. I\u2019m not all that busty - genetics be damned - wearing a generous c-cup. But I\u2019ve got wide hips, and a firm behind that defies the clich\u00e9 of white girls; especially for being a lot whiter than just white. I know some T&amp;A is more appealing than eyes, romance and its lies be damned, but I\u2019ve got some pretty green eyes and a button nose to be proud of. Sue me, I like my face. \n\nBut despite all the confidence\u2026 I feel like an ugly duckling when I vie for him. \n\nTall and lanky, yet buff and *hard*. He works out, and you can see it. He\u2019s got these broad shoulders that flow out of a thick neck, and into a wide chest, that is just a little dented and oval enough to avoid being *too* round. I just want to wrap my arms around him, like a princess fluttering her eyes at her savior in shining armor. \n\nWhen he rolls up his sleeves, I can\u2019t help but hone in on the fine golden shine of the hair on his forearms. Then, my hands snake up towards my throat, imagining the vein on the back of his hand twitching just a bit as he closes his fingers around my neck, choking me like a cheap whore. \n\nHis abs seem to be grating, glistening with sweat, and I just want to run my fingers along the furrows in his skin, tracing the outline of his definition, until I trail off to his Adonis belt. Did you know that\u2019s what it\u2019s called, Adonis belt? I didn\u2019t before I saw him shirtless. I was so caught up, letting my eyes follow the triangular pathway to where his shaft strained against his tight pair of jeans. I *craved* seeing more of that. His body is so perfect, it made me *look up words*, for Christ\u2019s sake\u2026 \n\nHe\u2019s riding the line of rugged and beautiful so effortlessly that I feel inadequate when I\u2019m around him, yet I\u2019m grateful I don\u2019t have to compete with him. \n\nYou know when pissed girls claim they\u2019re done with men? Yeah, after seeing him, they\u2019d change their tone real quick. I used to have this determination that I\u2019d be a confident and sexually liberated woman. I wanted to try pegging, and have a partner who\u2019d never pull my hair or anything like that. \n\nNow? \n\nI just want him to *take* me. I want every woman in the world to look at me and *know* he is *fucking* me *hard* every single night. That I\u2019m *his* woman. \n\nI'm a spoiled girl. I always get what I want. Though not quite how I\u2019d like it to be.\n\nThey caught me.\n\nI was listening. I spent the day at my sister\u2019s apartment, and then I just\u2026 I heard them. She was *screaming*. Just\u2026 screaming. His grunts were short and visceral, and I could\u2019ve sworn I felt his damp breath on my face. I felt like I could smell his cum glazing her lips. \n\nHer muffled moans of enjoyment, like she was being treated to a delicacy. And his satisfied, almost praising moans. \n\nI couldn\u2019t help myself. \n\nHe always liked summer dresses, I knew that much. Naturally, I wore them for the entirety of my stay. I reveled in his approving looks, but cursed the damn things for being a little too easy to snake my hand downward, and rub against the thin fabric of my panties. \n\nAnd then the door clicked open, and he stood there, wrapped in a towel to hide his privates, the rest of his exposed body coated in a damp sheen, beads of sweat descending over hardened muscles. \n\nTime froze when I noticed that he saw *them.* \n\nThose *awfully* girly, pink-and-white-striped panties. \n\nHe saw *them*, and *more*. \n\nMy hands tugging at the seam, a darkened stain of wetness where I had pressed down before. \n\nHe saw *me.*\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\nHis voice was so cold I felt goosebumps crawl across my thighs, and for the first time, they weren\u2019t the result of infatuation. \n\nI started to stammer pathetically as he closed the door behind him, my hands sliding out of my underwear, fingers wet in shame\u2026 and more.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s your sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re eloped.\u201d\n\n\u201c*I know.*\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re desperate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nA single brow shot upwards as he leered down on me, his gaze hard and powerful, like a predator framing its prey in the most appetizing angle. \n\n\u201cYes, *what*?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2026 Sir?\u201d I replied, genuinely unsure. The fact this wasn\u2019t some cute spiel pumped up my already excessive heart rate.\n\n\u201cNo. Say what *she* says.\u201d\n\nMy heart sunk, and was caught by the net of frozen innards inside of my tummy. Finally, I opened my mouth, my eyes suddenly fixed on the ground around his feet, unable to meet his.\n\n\u201cYes, Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d\n\nAnd so I did. My pale face met his. My irises were quivering, I knew it. I could feel my freckles disappear in the deep pink that my cheeks flushed with. \n\n\u201cSay it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Daddy.\u201d\n\nSomething in his face moved this time, almost like it softened up. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re cuter when you say it.\u201d\n\nMy heart stopped beating for what seemed like a minute, then positively *pounded* in my chest. \n\n\u201cThank you, Daddy,\u201d I replied, barely able to contain myself at his praise.\n\n\u201cCome.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a question. It wasn\u2019t even an order. Orders can be refused. It was a statement. The truth.\n\nHe opened the door to their bedroom, while I staggered up with quivering legs. My hands clasped around the rolled up edges of my dress, and balled into fists, my knuckles turning an *even brighter* shade of white. \n\nI didn\u2019t dare to look at her, until I could see her body move on the bed in the corner of my eye. I glanced up and\u2026 she was naked, still. \n\nShe didn\u2019t take after our mum as much me, with her blonde hair and brown eyes. Of course, the one thing she inherited was her bust. I couldn\u2019t remember if I knew how pink her nipples were, and if I hadn\u2019t been petrified, I might\u2019ve found humor in sharing that with her, despite the plethora of differences.\n\n\u201cKneel.\u201d\n\nI flinched, and was ready to get down, until I realized that he didn\u2019t speak to me. He spoke to her. And she followed without hesitation. When she kneeled down in front of the bed, in front of *him*, I could see it in her eyes. She knew what would happen, and she had no intentions of protesting it. I wondered if she was weak, until I knew I\u2019d be the same. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still dressed, little girl.\u201d\n\nAgain, the warmth in my face flared up, painting me a juvenile pink. \n\n\u201cEverything off,\u201d he ordered, and I followed suit.\n\nIt *hurt* stripping naked in front of her. I could feel her eyes glued to the little tuft of red above my cunt, and I could feel her gaze run down in tandem with the drop of wetness on my leg. \n\nI\u2019m *pathetic*.\n\nBut I *need* this.\n\n\u201cOpen.\u201d\n\nShe did. Her jaw almost unhinged in eagerness, as he peeled off the towel of his body. \n\nHe was *hard*. And smooth, veinless, yet somehow retaining that intimidating masculinity. And I saw it slide between her lips. She wrapped herself around him without hesitation. And I watched it. \n\nIn.\n\nAnd out.\n\nHis hands the size of bear paws rested on her head, covering her ears. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t want her to suck him off. He didn\u2019t want her to deepthroat, or degrade herself. He wanted to *fuck* her face. \n\nHis dick slid and out, invading her mouth. It almost felt like watching him use a toy for his relief. \n\nHe was using her. \n\nAnd she *loved* it. \n\nAnd I envied her. \n\nHe was not brutal. He didn\u2019t make her gag, or sped up until it resembled fetish porn. He just split her lips apart and pleasured himself, sensually. *Languidly.*\n\nWith a wet *pop*, he removed himself from her. I could see tiny tears in her eyes, and the blush creeping more intensely into her tanned face. \n\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d\n\nAnd then he turned to me.\n\n\u201cYou want it, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2026?\u201d he growled.\n\n\u201cYes, Daddy!\u201d\n\nI yelled it so hastily my voice cracked for more reasons than begging my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 to take me. In front of her. Both of us naked.\n\n\u201cYou want her to see it?\u201d\n\nI paused, my eyes flickering over, meeting hers, as a shiver shot down my spine.\n\n\u201cYes, Daddy.\u201d\n\nThe ensuing silence hurt. Physically hurt. \n\n\u201cGood. Good girl.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026 \n\nI found out I am okay with sharing after all.\n",

            "selftext": "When the water main broke at the dorm, my college best friend invited me to come stay at her house in town for a few weeks. It's a nice big house, and she's got a whole huge bedroom with a queen size bed and an ensuite bathroom to herself, a pretty fancy set up, which I guess explained why she decided to stay living at home instead of moving into the dorms at our college. When I asked about it, she laughed. \n\n\"My dad likes to entertain,\" she says. \"And some of his guests can get pretty loud. Hell, my dad can get loud himself, so I put my foot down and we remodeled after my parents got divorced.\"\n\n\"Guests?\"\n\n\"Dates, I guess? He has a lot of dates, and they all end up back here. I mean, have you seen him?\"\n\nOf course I had seen him: built like a brick wall, with perpetual five o'clock shadow. He clearly works out: I wanted to run my fingernails along the veins in his muscular forearms, but there's also something a little feral about him, a little wild, that makes it hard to stop looking at him, and easy to imagine he's getting his dick wet exactly how he wants, as much as he wants.\n\nThat night, I went downstairs to get a glass of water, and I heard something. At first I thought it must be a movie, and I peeked into the den, but the TV was off, and then I heard a high-pitched squeal, followed by a fleshy slapping noise, which it took me way too long to interpret. Then a deep, rhythmic grunting with every stroke. And finally, a woman's voice: \"Please, daddy, please.\" I froze, right in the middle of the kitchen, and felt myself go hot all over.\n\nOf course I completely forgot about the water, and fled all the way back to my friend's bedroom where she was peacefully sleeping. I slipped back under the covers, and realized with a shiver of frustration that I couldn't masturbate, so I just slid my hand inside my panties and pressed the base of my palm against my clit. I kept hearing it in my mind, a high, desperate voice: *Please, daddy, please*.\n\nWhen I heard the front door open in the morning, I crept to the window, just in time to watch her dad's date leave: a sweet-looking blonde with massive tits very nearly spilling out of her black cocktail dress. She looked dazed, fucked out. He squeezed her ass one last time, his big hands practically enveloping her buttocks, fingers pulling them apart like he was about to sink his dick into her again. Then he kissed her goodbye and put her into an Uber.\n\nI got obsessed with watching them, after that, the string of women leaving in the morning: blondes, brunettes, redheads, beautiful voluptuous black women, and once, memorably, two latinas who couldn't stop giggling and whispering as they left. They looked, to a woman, satiated and grateful, bruised and cum-stained, stumbling down the front steps like they could barely walk. \n\nI kept thinking about what he must be doing to them. I've had plenty of boyfriends; boyfriends are easy, when you look the way I do: 5'2\" with long silky black hair, high, firm, huge tits with thick nipples that can't be hidden under t-shirts, a tiny waist, and an ass that jiggles every time I move. But they've all been boys my own age: sweet and loving and eager. Watching these women leave made me wonder about older men. Bigger men. *Daddies.*\n\nSo then I really started paying attention to him: the way his eyes lingered on my tits at the breakfast table after his daughter got up to get ready. The way his thin sweatpants cling to a cock that must be as thick as a soda can. I could barely restrain myself from rubbing up against it so I could see just how long it is. I started maybe dressing for him, a little, not being so careful to put a bra on before I came downstairs in the morning. He noticed; I know he noticed. He looked down my shirt every chance he got, and I gave him plenty of chances. \n\nLast week I came home tipsy, tipsy enough that I thought listening at his door was a good idea. I heard some woman collapse back against the bed, still panting, and I didn't realize until it was too late that the sound of his feet on the floor meant he was about to open the bedroom door I was blatantly, drunkenly eavesdropping at. I caught a glimpse of spread legs, glistening, a trail of cum leaking out between them, and then he was right there in my face, chest gleaming with sweat.\n\nAll I really remember is the feeling of being spun around and pressed up against the hall closet door, and him biting the back of my neck, predatory and sharp, like I was a bitch he was holding in place so he could get his dick inside me. For a second, I thought that was it, that he was going to fuck me right there, standing up, with his dick still wet from another woman. But then he pulled back, and I could see the white of his teeth as he grinned, even in the dim light.\n\nI was trembling. \"Come and see me when you're sober, if you want it, little girl,\" he said. \n\nMy friend told me at breakfast this morning she's spending the weekend with her boyfriend. Her dad didn't even look up from his tablet. \n\n\"We'll be fine,\" he says. \"We can order in, right, Lexie? Watch a movie.\"\n\nShe went out to warm up the car, and when I leaned over to grab my bag he reached out and skimmed his hand up my ribcage, brushing the side of my breast. \n\n\"If you're here when I get home from work tonight, you little tease,\" he said, \"I'm going to hold you down and spank you, and then stuff you full of my cock.\"\n\n\"What?\" I said, faintly, but I didn't move, and his hand moved higher, palming my breast, rubbing in circles.\n\n\"I'm going to slap these big titties, baby,\" he said, flicking my nipple, \"and finger you during every meal all weekend long. The only time you're going to get off my dick is when I make you crawl on the floor and beg.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" I said, but I didn't move away. \n\nHe gave my breast a rough squeeze, and I gasped. He laughed, and said \"You don't have to worry about whether or not you can, because I'm going to make you take it.\"\n\nI had to hide in the bathroom during my first lecture this morning and shove two of my own fingers inside myself, bite my wrist to keep from screaming just to calm down enough to go to class.\n\nI'm about to open the door to the house. He's already home, I see his car in the driveway. \n\nWhat happens next?\n\n________\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nYes please: reluctance, dirty talk, daddy kink, big dicks, size kink, rough sex, hair pulling, kissing, biting, prone/doggy style, begging, breast play, lots of cum, breeding talk, light bondage, spanking, face fucking. Maybe dubcon, maybe gangbang if we take this far enough &amp; daddy invites a friend or two over.\n\nNo thank you: blood, bathroom play, ageplay under 18, incest, animals, feet, etc. \n\nIf you're a girl and/or want to play the girl's side of this instead of the daddy's side, I could definitely see writing from the other end of the RP too, so just please specify that when you write me.\n\nIf your kink seems like it would fit but it's not on this list, feel free to ask. It's rare that I can do immediate responses, so if you're into big, meaty multi-paragraph replies every other day or so, we might be a good match. I only write on Reddit. \n\nIf you really want to tickle my fancy, maybe write a bit from the daddy's perspective of the same events in my prompt, or what happens next to give me the flavor of what you like in a roleplay?  Looking forward to hearing from you!",

Back in the day, it was just about annoying a few farmers, swiping some muttony eats, but now. \n\n*Now.*\n\nWe've got *you.* Chrome-plated, white-walled, high-octane *sex*, those flirty little dice hanging from your rearview mirror sealing the deal. \n\nAnd the deal? The deal is *sex.* Raw. *Untamed.* The mythos of the skies, of majesty and power, of rock-solid hoards and piles of knights tossed aside, meeting the romance of the road. Feel my claws, taste the charcoal on my breath, feel my flames lick that luscious gloss-coated paint of yours and the flick of my tail curling around to bring you to me. \n\nWe all know you're used to being ridden, so just stay right there on your chocks and embrace the *sin.* However you want it, baby - tailpipe, trunk, a creamy sulfur finish across the salacious swell of your leather seats - it's *yours.*\n\nLet me wrap my wings around you.\n\nLet me caress you with my tail and talons. \n\nLet me push every inch of mythical *meat* into you, while we take the midnight highway to a turbocharged climax.\n\nYou and me, baby. We were meant to be - if you listen, far off, you can hear them, cheering for us, like a race where *you* finish first. Come on, and let's ride the *lightning*. Wings and wheels, thunder and chrome and a good, throaty *purr*.\n\nBecause *tonight,* my luscious love, we're going to make the myths come *true.*\n",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m cute.\n\nThat\u2019s a bold statement, I know, but I feel it is apt nonetheless. It may sound like confidence, it may sound like I have my nose up high, but the reason I\u2019m clarifying myself \u201ccute\u201d is one of insufficiency.\n\nI\u2019m *not* a voluptuous redhead, oozing sensuality. \n\nI\u2019m *not* a busty blonde that you can fantasize as your personal barbie.\n\nI\u2019m *not* a tan or bronze-skinned beauty with a tropical smile.\n\nI\u2019m *not* the innocent pastel student who you like to imagine with a gag and collar.\n\nI\u2019m *not* the slutty scene chick, either.\n\nI\u2019m just me. \n\nJust *\u201ccute\u201d*. \n\nI\u2019ve got brown hair that reaches down to my hips. I go to the salon regularly and take care of it, but it\u2019s neither absurdly voluminous nor poorly maintained. I keep it in a plain ponytail. I\u2019ve got a light tan; a healthy colour that suggests I like the beach, but not enough to look like a leather purse when I turn 40. I\u2019ve got perky tits, and a bubble butt, and I\u2019ve had enough experience with guys - and a girl, wow, so wild - not to mind my body parts being described with words such as \u201ctits\u201d or \u201cbubble butt\u201d. I\u2019ve also got a little bit of definition on my tummy, but, truthfully, it is owed more to my lanky 5\u20198\u201d physique than athletic endeavours.\nThat all sounds good and dandy, but I\u2019m struggling with body image issues nonetheless, just like every other poor bastard out there. I\u2019ve got huge doe-eyes, an ordinary brown, but large and gleaming enough to be worthy of a Disney princess. Truth be told, they\u2019re my best feature, and likely the sole reason I got hired at this place over the other random college girl that applied.\n\nI mean look at the other girls. \n\nThey\u2019re all the same. \n\nThe same as as me. \n\nThey\u2019re \u201ccute\u201d. Maybe even \u201csexy\u201d. \n\nThey\u2019re all wearing yoga pants, just like me, and they\u2019re very personable and sweet to the customers, puffing out their chests so the name tags on their little apron is easily read, so the customer can take their coffee and say \u201cThank you, uh\u2026 Haley.\u201d \n\nAnd then we feel like there\u2019s a connection, and it\u2019s an oh so human moment.\n\nLovely.\n\nExcept you\u2019re not human, I don\u2019t think. \n\nYes, I\u2019ve watched you on campus. Always clad in designer clothes from head to toe. Hair always styled perfectly. The model physique of yours showing through the skin tight v-necks. You\u2019re not bulging with muscles, no\u2026 You\u2019re a lean triangle, your body a chiseled trap to lure my gaze right towards the center of your crotch, where even the most sturdy of vintage jeans strain and bulge.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about your cock. \n\nYes, I am. \n\nYou know I am, you just want me to admit it.\n\nAnyways\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re not normal. And neither are the girls you\u2019ve got on your side at all times.\n\nThey\u2019re not normal students. \n\nThey\u2019re cheerleaders, and presidents, and scholarship geniuses, and\u2026 \n\nInstagram sluts. Uh, I mean models. And some of them were *real* models. The kind of model that jets across two continents and gets a line of cocaine sniffed off her tits by a perverted agent.\n\nAnd they\u2019re all wearing flowing dresses with slits that show of their thighs in a way that\u2019s entirely inappropriate for a scholastic overachiever. Their hair is flowing, and silky, and a little curly in just the right way to fit into an Herbal Essence commercial. \n\nYou have a different one each night. Sometimes two. They all lilt in that infantile way that means their panties are soaked already. Twirling strands of hair on their fingers. Touch your shoulders, and arms, and legs, and chest. Giggle a lot. \n\nAnd then\u2026\n\n*Spread their legs for you*.\n\nAnd you like it, too, you scumbag, don\u2019t you? You *love* how women shrink into nothing but appealing little playthings for you, unable to listen to their brain over the wailing of their screaming cunts. \n\nYou *love* glistening in the dawn-like light of their hotel suites and dorm rooms after you filled them up with your seed. \n\nAlternatively, the cold light of a club bathroom is good too; its lack of sex-appeal is made up for by the way perfect bodies arch when you push them into the wall of the bathroom stalls, your hand authoritatively yanking their hair until they look back at you, like the flexible little sluts they are.\n\nAnd beyond everything else, you *get off* on the fact that they all know. \n\nI know. \n\n*Everyone* knows.\n\nThey can see the cum dripping of your cock from your last fling, and they still happily open their mouths for you. \n\nI really want to hate them. \n\nIt\u2019s why I give them this distant smile, that is polite but reeks of scorn, when I write their names wrong on purpose, before handing them their cup and hoping they\u2019ll burn their stupid perfect tits with it in their little Porsche.\n\nBut you know what?\n\nI would do it, too.\n\nIf you told me to slide out of my pants and spread my pussy wide open *for you*, I would. Right here, even. And I\u2019d hope you\u2019ll think of fucking me when you move onto the next girl.\n\nSad, isn\u2019t it?\n\nWell, now I\u2019m just confused. \n\nWhy are you *here*, and not in one of your artisan caf\u00e9s? \n\nWhy don\u2019t have you have a girl with you? \n\nWhy don\u2019t you make me hate you, you stupid jerk? \n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s yours, Sir, that\u2019ll be 6, 79$. Anything else I can do for you today?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re studying at Spring\u2019s, too, right?\u201d\n\n*Of course* you\u2019ll strike up a chat and ignore my question. Why wouldn\u2019t you.\n\n\u201cYep, just trying to get *some* pocket change whenever I can,\u201d I giggle like the socially responsible person I am. \n\n\u201cScholarship, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not like my family could afford this sort of school without it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re smart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do try.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd have character.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all get one eventually.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cUhm, thanks?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like it even more when girls like you lose it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, just go ditzy and flirty. Like her, there.\u201d\n\nYou stick out your thumb from your fist, and unabashedly point at the blonde girl sitting by the window, slurping on her latte. Her boobs are fake, is what I first notice. Hair dyed blonde. Over-tanned.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know boys your age liked Barbie dolls.\u201d\n\nYou smile without showing teeth, sizing me up. I can tell what you\u2019re doing but don\u2019t know how to stop it. Or if I even want it to stop.\n\n\u201cNo, not the bimbo-look. I just mean\u2026 Submit. To me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cUhm, thank you, but I gotta get back to work, and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you should go in the back and touch yourself for me.\u201d\n\nI freeze, and quietly inhale your cologne as your face hovers before mine, close enough so your whisper would be crystal clear, if only to me alone. \n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t cum. I\u2019ll wait. Go.\u201d\n\nI blink in slow motion. My hands are wrapped around *your* coffee, my body in need of an anchor point, something to hold onto. \n\nI feel like a puppet lead by strings, as my arms, never dropping the 90\u00b0 bend, set down your order, and I slowly back off, disappearing in the back room.\n\nMy heart is *pounding* and I could have sworn I felt the fabric of my apron move due to it\u2019s ferocious beating.\n\nWith stiff legs, I cross the hallway, and hover before the the sign announcing the Women\u2019s restroom. My head moves in a little back and forth nod, and my glance trickles downwards, as I push the door open, and hastily claim an empty stall, pulling the door in its lock with entirely too much force.\n\nThe ceilings is starting to move, bulbous, and concavely threatening to crash into my stall. I feel the film of cold sweat cake on my forehead, as I spread my legs apart far enough so that both feets are aligned with the little space below the stalls.\n\nI tug at the seam of my leggings, feeling the string of my thong burrowed into my flesh, the fabric slightly damp in the warm weather. And my hand sneaks beyond the little cover in the front, and I find myself\u2026\n\nSo. Fucking. *Wet*.\n\nI can't think about anything but you barging in the room, and grabbing my boring old ponytail. Really bury and anchor your hands in my hair, like an animal that must be disciplined. \n\nI think about your body, pushing mine into the plywood, my cheek squishing my eye close.\n\nI can feel you fidget with your belt, the sound of your fly unzipping almost as good as the thrust itself. \n\nThe heat radiates of your enlarged tip, each throb scorching my expectant slit, and...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nYou did wait, just like you said.\n\nIt felt like two hours or four seconds, but I was gone for only a few minutes. \n\nI want to tell you to wipe that knowing smirk off your face, but I can\u2019t speak.\n\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d\n\nIf I wasn\u2019t flushed red before, I am now, my lips curling into a coy smile, while my face is suddenly glued to the registry, my glance too brittle to keep up with yours.\n\n\u201cYour shift ends when?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive.\u201d\n\nYou hesitate for a moment, looking thoughtful. I can see your jaw grinding a little, as if you\u2019re lost in calculations. \n\n\u201cYou know where I live?\u201d\n\nOf course, everyone knew. Your family owned that new luxury frat for the rich boys.\n\nI nod, silently.\n\n\u201cI got a few friends over, but I want you to ignore them. Just tell them you\u2019re there for me.\u201d\n\nI let out a peep high enough to be audible only for the lone canine in the parking space behind the shop.\n\n\u201cA-and then,\u201d I ask sheepishly, one of my hands wrapping around the opposite side\u2019s arm, sliding up and down, rubbing, creating some sort of comfortable warmth in this desolate, terrifying nightmare of a conversation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell them you\u2019re today\u2019s girl. Then you\u2019ll take off your shirt, and your pants, and your shoes, and you\u2019ll wait in front of my bed room.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and,\u201d you start, completely silencing the budding protest, \u201cyou\u2019ll call me \u2018Sir\u2019 tonight, don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay?\u201d\n\nI hate how your parrot me.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026 Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a smile please.\u201d\n\nI blink. A whirlwind of tingles trickling from my scalp downwards.\n\n\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d I reply with a brilliant smile.\n\n\u201cGood girl. You\u2019ll be fun. Put this on when you\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nYou hand me a little etui, of some sort, and leave.\n\nAnd then the day ends. \n\nAnd I leave.\n\nAnd I head towards your place without getting a change of clothes or showering. \n\nMy knock is answered by a guy who doesn\u2019t look as smart as a mule, but who is cocooned in the finest silk shirt money can be, his hair so awfully precisely cut, I fear it is connected to his nervous system. \n\n\u201cIs\u2026 he home?\u201d\n\nAnd suddenly a light seems to go off behind his eyes, and the caveman-like slowness disappears.\n\n\u201cOh, you must be the coffee shop girl. Yeah, come in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s messy, but not dirty inside the house. It\u2019s evident that a bunch of guys in their beginner 20s is living here, and none of them has a penchant for housekeeping, but it\u2019s equally evident a maid is cleaning up daily. \n\nIf that is all she does\u2026\n\nI excuse myself after having acquired directions to the bathroom, and view myself in the mirror. Make up is still in place. In spite of my shift I\u2019m looking fairly fresh and presentable. \n\nI sigh, deep and intense enough to leave a bit of mist on the mirror. \n\nAnd then I *strip* my shirt, and see the little black braw I put on in this morning.\n\nAnd then I *strip* my leggings, and I\u2019m too afraid to touch the fabric to check whether the little bit of glistening on my thong is conjured exclusively by the headlights, or the result of fluid. \n\nAnd then I fish the little case out of my purse, and open it. It\u2019s inside is covered in grey satin. A thin black piece of cloth is inside. \n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a choker, thicker than the ones I\u2019d wear, but velvety-smooth. It\u2019s plain and black, but somehow *feels* like it cost a fortune.\n\nWhen the door opens I step out, ready to pose for Playboy, scantily clad in murdered out underwear.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure my ribcage is gonna drill through my skin, because I\u2019m sucking in my stomach like I\u2019m trapped in a vacuum. \n\n*Knock knock knock*\n\nI bite my lips, a pearly-white teeth showing. \n\nAt least that\u2019s a part of my body that can compete with your usual girls.\n\nNo response. But I hear someone come up to the door, talking to at least two other voices in the same room, and suddenly I feel dreadful and exposed at the thought of being seen by others in this state.\n\nAnd then, you open the door.",

Okay?  \n\nI know you like to spend time with me and dote on me, but I am a grown woman. Sure, I like to feel small and meek. Yes, I like men who lead and are assertive, even *Dominant*. I may like it when you man handle my petite frame and abuse my sweet demeanor without inhibition. And maybe I enjoy it when you cuff me or tie me down or use my hair to hold me in place while you hate fuck me like a personal fuck toy.  \n\nI know I\u2019m cute and make all the right faces when you invade my body and nearly destroy my assets. And yes, you *may* be the biggest I\u2019ve ever taken. Okay, you *are* the biggest I\u2019ve ever had. I never knew a man could weld such a girthy endowment possible of destroying a girl of only 5'3\". And okay, I'm guilty. I don\u2019t pretend to hate it when you spank me. So sue me! I fucking love the feel of your thick skinned, ass grabbing hand leaving the sting of tender love and abuse on my supple cheeks. And when you take those big, rough hands and spread my cheeks while I ride your cock drives me *nuts*!    \n\nAnd I *might* wear revealing shirts to show off my perky B-cup tits. And you may of seen me in one too many short skirts that, when I bend over, gives you a good view of my buxom bottom and thick man eating thighs. I *know* you love hearing my cute, innocent giggle; especially when you\u2019re pile driving my cute teen pussy like the next WWE Champion. Situating me in lewd positions so you can stretch me out and give me a big ol\u2019 creampie *just* to see it ooze out of me while I whimper and moan for you so needily in my vulnerability.  \n\nI\u2019m not going to lie. You being tall, and possessing some very broad shoulders and a wide barrelling chest covered in a dusting of hair are prime examples of daddy-esque qualities. And I tend to lean toward the more sweet and contrite in contrast your authoritative example but I hardly find that a negative.  \n\nI love how carnal you get when you stuff my face full of cock. And I know you love how bright and starry-eyed I get when I get to worship all 7 inches with my tongue like a good little girl. But I\u2019ve a weakness for men who get excited to be lovey dovey and cuddly on a lazy Sunday morning nary a stitch in sight.  \n\n**Now**, to make my point. I must inform you I\u2019m quite fond of the idea of you sweeping me off my tiny feet and *not* breaking my bed today. I like the thought of your moist lips exploring my body, leaving tiny wet trails that turn into goosebumps. The idea you can take my breath away with a gentle and tender fondling is very tempting. I quite like the idea of losing myself in your loving, caring nature.  \n\nSo, with all that being said I must say I like who we are as individuals and all the naughty, delicious things we do to each other\u2026 **But** I don\u2019t have daddy issues and I\u2019m **not** Daddy\u2019s little girl  \n\n-----  \n\n*DISCLAIMER*: *All persons in this prompt are 18+*  \n\nI love a good rough romp now and again, but I want to be showered in a little TLC before we make a ruckus. Is that too much to ask? *Cue the doe eyes look*  \n\n**Kinks**: Simple, passionate sex between two functioning adults with lots of kinky bits  \n\n**Limits**: Daddies",

That's great!\n\nAnd then something unexpected happened. Some of my posts were F4A, and although I wasn't really looking for women, I wound up talking to a few women and I really enjoyed it. \n\nI like talking to other women who are my age. Sharing our day-to-day lives. Commiserating with each other about the things that are frustrating. Reminding each other about the things that are good in our lives. \n\nI like talking to younger wives and moms. Remembering the days when I first got married and had kids. Remembering how hard it seemed at the time, and remembering how life offered so many options. \n\nI like talking to girls who are much younger and single. Hearing about what dating is like now! Admiring the girls at that age who already have their shit together and smiling at my screen at the ones who are still trying to figure it out. \n\nAnd I like talking to all of them about the things that make our cunts wet. So there's that. \n",

            "selftext": "The room felt quieter than ever. The moans and screams that had been colliding between these walls had vanished, leaving behind a little girl in the most peaceful sleep. She was curled up under the fluffy white blanket of your bed. The sheets hugging her bare curves perfectly. You made a mess between her thighs, but that didn\u2019t matter to her anymore. You sat at your desk, working late into the night, but she was too distracting. You couldn\u2019t help, but admire the quiet creature from afar. Her pouty mouth would sometimes curl into a small smirk and that made you wonder what she was dreaming about. She would also sometimes turn around and let out these small whimpers before falling back into a deep sleep. She was addictive without even trying. Everything about her seemed effortless and that made your blood boil. You wanted more of her. You wanted to show her what she did to you. You weren\u2019t satisfied quite yet and the view of her naked skin peeking from the sheets every so often was driving you crazy. \n\nYou carefully approached the bed. As you got closer, you could see her breasts falling slowly with every breath she took. You couldn\u2019t dare to wake her up, but you needed her. You needed her insides, those perfect holes that knew you so well. You carefully peeled off the sheets and blanket from her, revealing two hard nipples and shivers all over her pale skin. You brushed your thumb against her faded pink bottom lip, taking in every detail of her while she was in her most vulnerable state. Her other set of lips was still red and swollen from the fun you had with her earlier, but wasn't any less tempting. Your fingers made their way to her slit and without any surprise, she was still wet. A delightful mixture of her juices and yours. She was still exploring dreamland while you explored her small pussy some more. You were now rock hard and you couldn\u2019t wait much longer. You had to use and abuse her how she deserved it for being so intoxicating. \n\nWithout any second thought, you nestled your hard cock between her wet lips. She felt tighter than ever and you were afraid you pushing further would finally wake up her. Your craving for her small pussy gripped around your whole length had made you too selfish to care anymore. You struggled to shove your whole cock inside of her, but soon enough you were buried inside her little cunt completely. You watched her pretty face as you started thrusting against her slowly. All of sudden, you watched her gasp as she realized what was happening. She tried to reach you with her hands to push you off, but you made sure to hold her down. It was too easy. She was still very drowsy, but her whimpers were slowly turning into moans.  \n\n\"Daddy\u2026\" You heard her try to say through the sleep sticking to her voice.\n\n\"Shh sleep tight little girl\u2026\" As you whispered those words, you filled her up with your warm load. She fell right back asleep, now a filthy little girl full of your seed. \n\n_____\n\nAll characters are 18+ in this story. ",

It's a convenient location, less than ten minutes' ride up from my apartment.\n\nThe Undercity is an open secret on the surface, officially non-existent and never discussed in mixed company. It's a policy of *omerta* that keeps the world turning nicely. Most people never visit, which is smart: there's different laws down here, the kind that only the particularly devious or disreputable can tolerate. Theft is punished on the spot, sometimes terminally. Murder is legal so long as you have a good reason for it, such as career advancement or reprisal. And it's also a *very* convenient tax haven. Half the businesses topside are just fronts for Undercity corporations. Cops only come down here for information, and even then know to bring a padded wallet and a loaded gun.\n\nThat said, as dangerous as the Undercity might be, it's far from chaotic. Take *Noctis* for example: thudding bass, flashing strobes, fancy drinks. It's a classy establishment. The last time someone made trouble here, they were found scattered between eight different complexes. Not that anyone cared.\n\nI sit in a corner booth, red eyes gleaming in the pitch black. Someone with a keen sense of night vision might be able to differentiate the dark grey of my skin from my black silk dress, or spy the gleam of my ivory hair or the silver chains that hold it all together.

I've recently taken a liking to rimming centaurs, so keeping mouthwash handy is more or less a necessity. Even earlier today, at the office, I'd rewarded a particularly daring superior with an unusually lengthy oral session. So, needless to say, the absinthe is a refreshing change of pace.\n\nMy ears twitch as I hear a set of footsteps traipsing towards me, and a smile spreads across my face.\n\nSeems like the fun isn't over yet.\n\n---\n\n*In the wake of what seems to be a wave of urban fantasy prompts, I present to you my modernized counterpart to DnD's Underdark: the Undercity.

There is D&amp;D. \n\n\nFor those of you more into sci-fi themes there is Modern/Future D20. \n\nAnd for those of you whom like more horror elements there is always Call of Cthulhu. \n\nAll of which can have erotic, lewd, perverse scenarios, situations and elements thrown into the mix.

            "selftext": "Chad Thundercock (of the Southwestern North Dakota Thundercock Sioux) was an abysmal penpal. He not only rarely managed to put together a whole paragraph at a time, but when he did it inevitably consisted of multiple run-on sentences without a jot of punctuation.\n\nThe vast majority of his posting history consisted of crude comments and one-hundred and forty seven consecutive repostings of the same prompt -- the infamous \"[M4FFF] Hey Bby Jump On This!!!!\" post that for some reason seemed to hit the top of the \"Hot\" page every time it was trotted out.\n\nBy now, practically every female on the subreddit had tried out and been ghosted by Chad's unique version of correspondence, which truthfully mostly consisted of text speak abbreviations and unsolicited pictures of his eponymous appendage. But, *Oh My God!* what an appendage it was!\n\nNow, as anyone knows, women are all secretly in search of that fictional penis of such massive girth and length that our panties spontaneously combust, and almost every male tries to claim inches far above the world average. But Chad's cock was the Real Deal, and he had no hesitation in sending out photos to prove it.\n\nThere were photos of his cock pounding spikes into railroad ties. A picture showing it dwarfing a whole six-pack of soda cans, and then crushing them flat and tossing them over Chad's shoulder. One showed his massive tallywhacker bench pressing 230 pounds. Another showed a bucket of his cum filled to the three-quart line.\n\nA lot of girls scoffed and claimed it was PhotoShop manipulation, until Chad would link to the video of his penis pounding a concrete slab into rubble, simply by him aiming it down and twerking. There were reports of stallions committing suicide after witnessing Chad empty his bladder. If Chad could have written a coherent sentence, he could have dashed off the entire Gettysburg Address in the snow.\n\nIt was one fucking impressive cock.\n\nToo bad it couldn't write worth shit.\n\n***********\n\nNever let it be said I can't meet a [challenge...](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8a9t5w/mod_open_forum/dwx0vqb/)",

What do you find attractive in a woman wearing them?

            "selftext": "I didn\u2019t have the greatest relationship with my parents when I grew up. I lived with my mom, in a small house, in a poor neighborhood straining at the seams with seniors and loud Europeans  - judging by the names, presumably those of the eastern variety -  whose daily cabbage dishes were \u201caromatic\u201d enough to sneak across the fence and into my room every afternoon. \n\nPerhaps I should\u2019ve told my mom that was the reason I always came home late, to avoid the cabbage smell.\n\nMy dad wasn\u2019t around. Like, ever. I thought he was dead until I was 14, and even then I only found out about him because his sister, my aunt, looked up my name on Facebook, and extended her hand if I ever feel curious to meet \u201ctheir side of the family\u201d. \n\nAs you can imagine, that whole thing blew up, and my already poor maternal relationship went down the gutter.\n\nI became the role model of all kids rebellious. The blueprint of a misfit, if you will.\n\nI cut my hair short - queue my mom wailing: \u201cWhat in the *HELL* did you do to your hair, Emily? Your long hair\u2026 it was so pretty and long\u2026\u201d - and dyed it an awful, vaguely aquatic blue, that turned a moldy green/yellow mixture at the roots. If I had to put it in a textbook, I\u2019d call my hairstyle a \u201cbiologically hazardous scene-Pixie cut\u201d.\n\nI also got a few piercings that no reputable studio would have greenlit; a little white orb in my tongue (I now shudder at the milky opaqueness being a little *too* sperm-like for being in the mouth of a then 15-years old), a septum ring, and a plain silver ring in the right side of my lip. \n\nI also had some pictures on my Facebook, poorly lit and grainy, with me, a fierce gaze and thick racoonish eyeliner, sitting in a cute, princessy-pink bra. My mom made me take them down, but I was so proud; I even contoured my boobs so they\u2019d look bigger and I\u2019d look sluttier. \n\nI smoked pot behind the gym.\n\nAh, and of course, I sort of had daddy issues, given the whole \u201cHe\u2019s not dead?!\u201d thing, followed by the \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he want me?\u201d thing.\n\nGod, I was *so* fucking cool.\n\nNaturally, I liked bad boys, if only for the fact I knew they\u2019d drive my mom up the wall, and of course, \u201conce his band makes it big\u201d I could move in with him, and it\u2019d be *so chill*, and we\u2019d just hang out and skate and fuck; you know, what any virgin would say.\n\nSo, the funny thing is, he *did* drive my mom up the wall. And so did *I*. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t like it one bit.\n\nYou see, I\u2019d invite him over every Wednesday, because that\u2019s when my mom would be out of the house until about eight P.M., because her bus only came about once an hour, and her shift ended precisely so that she\u2019d always miss the one that would arrive around seven, so there was always an extra hour of waiting. Naturally, Wednesdays were my favorites.\n\nWe\u2019d make out, and smoke, and cuddle, and listen to music, and bitch about our dumb parents. In retrospective, he probably walked home looking like a squeezed tube of glue, with blue balls the size of Atlas' globe, but it didn\u2019t really occur to me that he\u2019d want to have sex.\n\nOr maybe it did, but I was just a dash afraid of it.\n\nKeyword *was*.\n\nSo, Corey and I went back to my place, after I had *relentlessly* worked him up during school. I was clingy and touchy-grabby all day, slinging my hands around him, sliding into his arm, kissing along his ridiculously sharp jawline, and maybe I even wiggled my skinny-jeans-clad behind into his lap a few times, when we lazed around under the tree during recess. \n\nI was a teenager, and hormonal, and I had selected today to be *the* day. Sue me.\n\nBut so he could *barely* keep his hands off me, and I remember that I felt a pang of cold fear when I noticed that our neighbor, Miss Waite, had watched him snake his hands up under my tank top, getting a handful of my tits, the straps of my bra coiling a little, slowly gliding off my shoulder.\n\nThen I decided that, given the fact I was - and, in fact, still am - awfully self-conscious about the fact I barely fill out a b-cup, and his hungry fingers digging into my pale flesh with such a white-hot lust made me feel so\u2026 *wanted*, I didn\u2019t give a fuck.\n\nAnd fuck her judgemental stare, the old hag. She would look the same if Corey hadn\u2019t been there, anyways. I know she *hates* the Godspeed You! print. Yes, I was one of those \u201cFuck you, but I\u2019m socially conscious\u201d sort of girls. I\u2019m still socially conscious, by the way, just with less middle fingers involved.\n\n*Please don\u2019t tell my mom though.*\n\nBut so I feel my cheeks flush with heat, and his cheap cologne is overwhelming my senses, and I can\u2019t stop biting at his lip, and begging him to push his tongue between my lips, and I can feel his hot breath on my cheek and on my wet lips, where the breath is even warmer, and we basically *crash* through the front door and the mosquito grid. \n\nThe eardrum-tearing sound of wooden chair legs being pushed across the parquet flooring didn\u2019t stop us from *really* making out, and he sort of carried me up the stairs, and pushed me into the railing, the hardness of the structure not giving into his force, but made me hyper-aware of how much he just *wanted* to grab me and shove me and *fuck* me.\n\nIt planted little glimpses in my head, stills of him pushing my head into the bed, *nailing* me into the wooden frame, and a little, awfully turned-on moan came out of my chronically-opened mouth. \n\nI can remember that I felt like I could hear the blood rushing behind my ears, my heart positively *pounding* in my chest. \n\nI remember that my head sort of *fell* back, my neck exposed, and his mouth on my skin in that animalistic \u201cYou-showed-me-your vulnerable-spot-now-I-own-you\u201d sort of way.\n\nI remember my fingers nestled into his hair, the other hand around his waist, pulling his hard body against my significantly softer frame, or maybe the other way around.\n\nWrapped up in each other, we stumbled upstairs, and fell through the door, and I found my body sort of jiggle ever so gently as he threw me on my bed, the Dance Gavin Dance poster on my ceiling smirking down at me, as I felt him follow after me; first one hand, then the other, both palms advancing towards me, then his knees, and then he crawled above me. \n\nI remember that I looked up at him and felt like I really *did* love him, more than just a teenager\u2019s sexual urges, or a crush, or making mom mad - I *wanted* him to love me so much it hurt. So, naturally, I give him what he wants. \n\nFor the first time. \n\nHis brown eyes scanned my body with a hungry glint. His auburn undercut, short at the sides and back, but lengthy and thick and frazzled at the top, dangled down, and made his face look slimmer, almost predatory. With his stubble, he resembled the rugged hunter stalking dangerous prey, though, rather than that lecherous sort of avian looking for an easy score. The way his lips seemed to pout just a bit, then being pulled back\u2026\n\nIt made me feel pretty, and like *his*, yet strong and *good* at the same time. \n\nHe quickly reached over his head, peeling off his shirt in one smooth pull, and my hands instantly touched and grabbed at his chest. He was no gym rat, but he had that wiry sort of body, scrappy and *hard*. The skin on his stomach was pale compared to his face and arms, pale enough for his abs to cast a gentle shadow into their own outline. \n\nI remember I bit my lips, and willed myself to stare up, eyes open, when he tugged at my jeans, and slowly slid them down. They burned against my legs as he stripped them off of me, but I didn\u2019t look down. I didn\u2019t want to.\n\nI remember that I flinched just a bit when I felt the seam of them slide across my panties, and I know that he must\u2019ve noticed \u2018cause he hesitated for a second, before he finished what he started. \n\nAnd then I felt his mouth on mine again, and I winced into him when his hand grabbed my cunt, and I do mean *grabbed*, like he *owned* me. \n\nSuddenly he *did* own me.\n\nThis time, my hands gripped into the sheets instead of holding onto his bulbous, rotating shoulders, and a surge of dread settled in. I wasn\u2019t ready. I know now, but not then. \n\nInstead of stopping or squeezing out a noise of discomfort, I just watched his muscles seething and working under his creamy skin. \n\nI watched him undo his belt. \n\nI watched him push down his jeans, not all the way, like he did mine, but just around the ankles. I remember that I felt like he already set himself up to leave right after, and quickly I knew what it feels like to feel *cheap*.\n\nAll the good and warm tingles of just moments before had disappeared, and I felt cold sweat pool in the small of my back.\n\nAnd then he fished his cock out of his briefs; thick, and *long*, and a little pale, too, with a twitching vein along the side, that pumped and pumped; blood of course, but it made me think of something else.\n\nMaybe it was just his lean physique, or the way his crotch seemed almost concave, but his cock was *big*. \n\nIntimidatingly big. \n\nIt was just this, like, white, swollen rod of throbbing flesh, lively and *hard* and somehow it made me feel like it just *hated* me, and wanted to *punish* me, or maybe not me in particular, but *women*. \n\nI know it sounds silly, but in that moment, his cock felt like a raging misogynist, like it was on a mission to make me feel like absolute garbage, and violate me.\n\nAnd then I felt it push inside, and just split me.\n\nI screamed a muted noise, and my throat felt like it\u2019d burst whenever the sound returned to my pants and cries.\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut, feeling tears, warm and salty, drizzle down my cheek.\n\nI could feel my teeth carving themselves into the skin below my bottom lip, as I bit down.\n\nI heard him grunt, and tense up, his body starting to move as one tight, compact weight, rather than smooth muscles grinding into me with delay and rhythm, and I felt distant warmth spread between my legs, just barely noticeable, until it overflowed, and ran down my skin, chilly against the room\u2019s air. \n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I saw his sweat-drenched body arched above me, like he had oiled himself up. It made his pale midsection *glow*.\n\nAnd then I saw her in the doorframe, almost an entire 60 minutes too early, her mouth wide open. \n\nAnd then she scurried off, into her room.\n\nHe left. Like I thought he would.\n\nThen she made dinner and called me down.\n\nWe didn\u2019t speak for the entire evening.\n\nOr the next day, other than \u201cBe back at 8\u201d.\n\nAnd the day after.\n\nI still haven\u2019t talked to her about that day, even years later. I\u2019m not sure if I even want to, anymore. I was so embarrassed. At the same, I wanted her to support me. I didn\u2019t know what to do then, and I don\u2019t know now.\n\nI think the whole day planted something inside of me though.\n\nThe sort of spark that fuels intercontinental journeys.\n\nValidation and degradation are powerful emotions, and I just\u2026 I just *crave* them both, often at the same time.\n\nMaybe this is why I went to this gig, with a has-been band and cheap beer, and a whole crowd of guys about three to five years younger than me. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but when you\u2019re 24, a 19 years old is like\u2026 *Way* younger, you know? \n\nIt hurts to admit, but I want them to want me all the same.\n\nI\u2019ve been eyeing that one guy in the back. I unbuttoned my oversized flannel shirt, so he could look at my cleavage, and hopefully chat me up. I know I should just walk up to him and flirt. But I can\u2019t.\n\nI want *him* to conquer *me*. \n\nI want him to crawl on top of me and make me feel overwhelmed once again.\n\nI want him to pump his cum in me and leave.\n\nAnd then I want to feel like shit again, so I have a reason to repeat it.\n\n\u2026\n\nFuck, sex is weird, isn\u2019t it?\n",

            "selftext": "Alright, before you click away, bare with me. This...prompt will be rather short, and very niche. Anyway, onto the juicy stuff. Those of you that have played any fallout game know about deathclaws. Hell, even people that haven't know about them. How damn brutal they can be. So, I'll get right to the point. I want to play out some deathclaw rape. With me/my character being on the receiving end. Big parts of this would be rough, rough sex, monster cock, possible breeding (yes I know it doesn't work that way. I'll figure it out), and mindbreaking. Plus whatever else I can't remember at the moment. Anyway, I'm gonna leave this short, cause there's not much to it. When you do message me, put your favorite color in the subject line so I know you read this far. If you don't, you won't get a response. Interesting starters will get a response first. Edit: last time I did this, it was in a CYOA format. Had a lot of fun. Just a suggestion for anyone that likes that kind of stuff.",

            "selftext": "I know I don\u2019t need to remind you, but I hope you know just how much I need you.  \n\nDate night is my absolute favorite because I know what it entails. My attire is often one of comfort, but underneath I like sporting something a little wilder because I happen to like stripping down and teasing you with a view.  \n\nMy nubile body adorned in a different outfit each time; often donning an array of colorful patterns and skimpy fabrics, all of which that hug my soft curves.  \n\nThis time my modest 34B cup breasts accentuated by a bright tropical blue bra. The lace peek-a-boo see through, allowing you the faintest glimpse of my pert nipples; protruding through the soft fabric in their stiffness. My hips seemingly wide in a thong that hikes up due to its high cut style, matching in color and in fabric. The triangle hugging my soft mound, a wet spot beginning to form. The fabric entirely eaten up by my supple posterior. \u00a0\n\nJust imagine, it\u2019s all for you. \u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re **mine**. I know we discussed this, but I don\u2019t think you realize how serious *I* *am*. You think it\u2019s cute how possessive I can be, but I can\u2019t help myself. I have this inclination to protect what we have, it\u2019s special. My jealousy is entirely justifiable, I assure you. It\u2019s *not* unhealthy how much I adore you. \u00a0\n\nI can\u2019t put what we have into words. Instead, I fantasize about day in and day out, but I promise my performance at work hasn\u2019t suffered for it. You\u2019re *always* on my mind. The things you do to me makes my heart race. You drive me wild, the effects you have on me lasting days after our night together. \u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not a true submissive, but it amazes me how *obedient* I am. When you ask nicely to just have me I\u2019m unable to decline. All you have to do is say, \u201ccome here\u201d and I\u2019m on all fours like a bitch in heat. So ready I\u2019m already wet, so eager I\u2019m willing to do anything, so excited that goosebumps ripple along my unblemished skin. \u00a0\n\nI know you like them young. I *am* young and excitable; maybe even *impressionable*. You said you felt like you were out of my league, but I\u2019m yours as long as you want me. Only you pull at my heart strings, I\u2019ll forever be your biggest fan. In no way are we superior to one another, we are equals. I want everyone to know that I\u2019m *your* woman, though.\n\nThe hair pulling, the spanking, the ruining of my pussy and of my ass. The slight gape, the running mascara. It\u2019s *your* doing. *You* spoil me and give me *everything* I want as deep as I want, so it\u2019s only natural you receive the same in return. \u00a0\n\nThe soft *guck, guck, guck*s are **yours**. The way you invade my mouth and nearly unhinge my jaw every time you thrust in is **yours**. The weight of your hardened prick sitting on my tongue, filling every inch of open space in my wet orifice is **yours**.\u00a0When you just mouth fuck me, pleasure yourself or deep throat me and give me a hot facial... well, that\u2019s **yours**, too. \n\nIt\u2019s never rushed or unscrupulous. It might be hard and fast, but it\u2019s always full of love and enjoyment. The languid, leisure pace is our favorite. It gives us a chance to explore one another. *Thoroughly*. \u00a0\n\nThe way I moan needily, the vulnerability heard in my whimpers, the breathless gasps. The way you make my toes curl and my back arch, and my fists squeezed so tight my knuckles turn white. All these simple motions are for *you*. I was never a screamer, but its been known for you to make me cry out in absolute bliss. \u00a0\n\nEvery grunt, groan and gasp is mine. The way your muscles tense and the way your veins bulge, every shot of cum is for me. Your eyes dilated from the dopamine, riding the high that which is your orgasm; your complete satisfaction is mine to claim. \u00a0\n\nAfter our copulation I love how you look. Your hair messy, your grin goofy, your nude body coated in a thin sheen; beads of sweat dotting your lean body and handsome face. Your heart rate excessive, thrumming loudly through your powerful chest. By the time you\u2019re done, my body is ruined for all other men and I don\u2019t mind one bit. \u00a0\n\nLike I said, I\u2019m **yours** and you\u2019re **mine**...  \n\n-----  \n\n*This is no Fifty Shades of Grey shit. What I feel and what I want, I'm very aware of how unhealthy it may be*.",

We've been in a dead bedroom situation for a while now and I find the fantasy worlds I've created for myself to be my only outlet for expressing my sexuality. \n\nI've found that I have loved exploring the following themes: \n\n- Sharing facts and stories with boys 18-21 about sex\n- Talking with other women about sex\n- Mother/son relationships\n\nMy favorite chat partners have made me push my boundaries and cross lines on those themes that have made me wet 24x7. \n\nIf you want to help me explore and you meet any of the above criteria, drop me a line.

            "selftext": "I've been reading up about daddy issues and, um...yeah. My dad left us when I was two, so I don't really remember him, and my mom never had a serious relationship after that. From what I've heard, a lot of girls without a good father figure live their lives seeking approval from older men however they can get it.\n\nThat probably explains why I dress the way I do and why I'm not really into guys my own age. I like making guys happy, even (or especially) when they're being selfish. I like it when they gently (or mostly gently) put me in my place when I've been acting inappropriately. And I have a hard time saying no when an older guy tells me to spread my legs for him.\n\nAll of this is probably why I love playing prompts about a teenage girl (18+) and an authority figure, like the principal or a teacher or coach. It can also work with an intern or new secretary and her boss or anything like that. All of this is even better if the man is unavailable (i.e. married), since I tend to lose interest when someone actually shows real affection (I'm hoping to get over this part).\n\nDon't I sound like fun?\n\nIf you think so, drop me a line! Tell me generally what your character looks like, whether you want my character to look like [her](https://imgur.com/MMCpUve), [her](https://imgur.com/Iy97HMy), [her](https://imgur.com/vEdnAIW), [her](https://imgur.com/eTnj5qh) or something else, and most importantly what your relationship to me is (principal, boss, etc.). You will not be my dad or my stepdad or uncle. I might have daddy issues, but actual incest is a huge turnoff. (Other turnoffs are non-con, bathroom stuff, bondage, pain, and animals.)\n\nYou know what turns me on though? Spanking, cheating, dirty talk, light name calling, light rough stuff, facials, creampies, bodyshots, being shared (maybe even for money), risky sex, corruption, filming/photography, slutty clothing, and ageplay (obviously).\n\nIt's Monday morning, so it might be kind of slow on here, but if I get a few responses it might take me a little while to respond. But I will respond, even if it's just to say that I found someone else to play with. I love creative replies that really build the backstory or play off my kinks.",

            "selftext": "Me and Maria had pulled the new recruits' legs apart like a wishbone as you fucked her missionary; freshly stripped as her blonde hair splayed upon the pillow and her shoulders. Watching her large natural breasts heave upon every thrust, I caught Maria's knowing smile. We had chosen well.\n\nMaria and myself were wearing the matching outfits you laid out for us this morning as we each gave our encouragement in hushed tones to either one of your ears. Not that you needed it. We also admitted our jealousy and let you know just how much we were looking forward to when we next get a turn.\n\nIt only took a look between Maria and myself to push those long slender legs up to her head, lifting her derri\u00e8re lightly off the bed itself as the position tightened her pussy round your throbbing cock.\n\nShe was even louder now. The slightly uncomfortable position for her in contrast to the pleasure she was receiving. You ejaculated into her with force; filling her up. Staying in her a little longer than necessary you withdrew as Maria looks up to you with her big brown eyes and cleans you with her delicate mouth whilst I tend to the mess you left in the new recruit.\n\n\"We'll stay with her tonight\" I informed you as me and Maria approached either side of the new recruits' quivering body. Releasing her wrists from the bedposts and cuddling up beside her. You left the room to meet us again in the morning.\n\nHopefully you enjoyed! Following on from this prompt, I am looking for either a man to play the lucky leader with three (at least!) ladies at his whim or other ladies to take their place with me. The idea is we'd have our own characters but control the others too. Open to ideas and adaptations.\n\nIn terms of myself, I'm a redhead, little bit alternative, curves in all the right places and hopefully appealing ;)\n\nNot into scat, watersports, kids, snuff or incest but most other things are fine. I'm a bi sub who likes light name calling, voyeurism, anal, oral and group sex. :)",

            "selftext": "I've been in a particular mood for this roleplay for a few nights now.  It's not very specific, so there's lots of wiggle room, but I can't help but fantasize about these two characters lately. I'm open to ideas on the scenario itself, but I'm going to list a few basic ideas.\n\nKinks: reluctant eagerness, rough sex, degradation, bondage, exposing outfits, forced uniform, bestiality*, body writing/marking, being 'hunted', proper proportions\n\nLimits: non-con, scat, vomit, blood, cheesy romance, overly large insertions/bulging\n\n*****\n\nScenario 1:\n\nIt's a Friday night and The Tower is empty, all the other members of the team don't like to stay at home. That is except for Raven, and recently she's had some company. It started off as a mere curiosity, though developed into a weekly 'game' for Raven and Beast Boy. Beast Boy's hunting drive from his animal forms sometimes needed to be relieved by play. Without practicing the hunt and other animal behaviors it can begin to influence his behavior. The game starts when the lights in the tower are shut down without warning, and then the Hunt begins.\n\n*****\n\nScenario 2:\n\nThe team broke up months ago, each of the members splitting off for different destinations. Many went to join the more centralized Justice League which had shut down the Teen Titans, but Beast Boy and Raven decided to use this as an opportunity to get out of crime fighting. More of a slice of life/romance scenario, though it can also simply be kinky casual sex between the two.\n\n*****\n\nScenario 3:\n\nThrough the actions of a villain either Raven or Beast Boy is unable to control their own actions. Perhaps Beast Boy lets out some primal desire on Raven, or perhaps Raven becomes far more flirty and teasing to provoke Beast Boy. Only scenario that might start off as slightly dub-con, depending on the version.\n\n*****\n\nIf you're interested in any of these ideas or have one of your own, I'd love to hear them.",

            "selftext": "I stood there frozen in complete shock as I stared at it. I had never seen anything like it. My mouth was wide open and my eyes were practically popping out of my head. I felt saliva pooling in my mouth and I was pretty sure I was close to drooling over it. I knew that I should have looked away from it or told you to put away but I just couldn't... I didn't want to... There was something about it that just drew my eyes to it. Of course it was long... It was more than twice the size of my boyfriends/husbands... It was as thick as my arm too! But it wasn't just that... It was the fact that it just looked so perfectly formed and smooth. I bet it would taste delicious too... I shake my head and manage to look up at your face for a moment.\n\n\"I cant...\" I mutter under my breath knowing how wrong it would be to give into you.\n\n*****\n\nHey DPP! I'm looking to do a roleplay where you discover that you have an irresistible cock that no one can stay away from. However before we get to all that we need to decide who will be your first victim and the circumstances it occurs under. I'm thinking that it will be an accidental reveal the first time around as you discover the effects that it has on women. The more creative the reveal the better in my mind as a towel slipping off can only be fun so many times!\n\nAs for who I am there are plenty of options to choose from. I could be a family member, a step relative, a teacher, a neighbour or even a complete stranger. Whatever you come up with I will play as her for you as long as you either provide a description of what you want her to look like or a picture! \n\nMy main kinks are huge cocks, lots of cum and a heavy oral focus. I just love giving blowjobs and seeing how the man reacts to my tongue! In terms of limits I am just not a fan of any toilet stuff so if that could be avoided that would be great. Be sure to send me your kinks and limits so I can get an idea of what you are into. I am willing to give anything a go! I'm open to celebrity and rule 34 too if you want to integrate that somehow!\n\nThanks for reading and be sure to message me with the details I have asked for as I will most likely ignore you otherwise! Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "First of all, let me say that elves are *not* lewd. They're not; it's just a simple and shameful falsehood, no doubt spread by the orc lobby to besmirch the reputation of a wonderful species with a rich and fascinating culture. There's not a hint of anything even *slightly* lewd about them, I promise you. \n\nGranted, many elves might happen to be very fond of showing affection physically - and that's wholesome. Thoroughly wholesome; who among us hasn't greeted a friend with a warm hug, a friendly handshake, a long and wide-eyed sloppy throating, or a pat on the back? Just because a few fine people *who happen to be elvish* I've met might prefer one of those over the other doesn't, y'know, mean anything. Although Lyssa, if you're reading this, my legs still twitch a little when I think of you never needing to come up for air, thank you very much. And Clariel, that time when I walked in on you naked with your butt in the air, mumbling something about humans - that was just as lovely too; please don't think I'm knocking you for it.\n\nAnd, sure, many times elves may want to get physically intimate, in special ways, with people they care about! It's not like it's a *tradition* or anything. Everyone shows intimacy from time to time! If someone, say, like a certain cerulean-haired lass I *may* have met, wants to show it by getting railed over every available piece of furniture and has a different toy stuffed up her butt every time I turn around, that's just her thing, y'know? Maybe some people, on an entirely individual level, may enjoy holding hands and getting patted on the head after a long and succulent session of lazy Sunday-morning cock worship (Samriel), or going for long walks and longer fucks on the beach (Cynwen...) or have a thing for celebrating human holidays in alarmingly cute ways. Like, completely hypothetically, wearing cute little bunny ears over her pointed ones, and padding around with nary a stitch inside using those suspiciously butt-plug-like eggs to good effect. \n\nBut that's purely individual and says nothing about elves. So, let's set the record straight, here: \n\nElves are *not at all lewd*, in any way, and anyone who says otherwise is *slanderous.* I'm very sorry if I may have given *anyone* the impression that those are my thoughts.\n\nI'd also like to take this opportunity to say that I am in no way looking for cute elven girls to go on a fantasy romp with. No way. None. That's not a thing I'd *ever* do. \n\nThank you for listening. ",

            "selftext": "So... You probably rolled your eyes or scoffed at the mention of my name, right? *Jubilee*. The first thought into your mind was either 'useless', 'annoying', or 'fourth of July'. I'm not wrong, am I? Listen, listen... You don't get to *pick* your mutant powers, pal. You're just *born that way* because honestly, who would pick *fireworks* as their power? \n\nSure, I could make myself sound cooler and call it by it's technical name like Jean and Storm do. Energy Plasmoids! Lumikinetic explosive light blasts! Sounds pretty badass, I know... But then you're gonna end up busting a gut when you see I'm pretty much a walking fireworks show. I can blind the bad guys momentarily! I can... make cash by throwing colorful sparkles in the air to entertain others. Maybe start a fire? Yeah, nothing too impressive at the moment, but I'm still a member of the X-men, so fuck you. At least I got powers.\n\nIt does suck a bit, being the one mutant girl who may just have the lamest power in the school... But! I make up for it with my *dazzling* personality and... Well, I *hate* to brag, but I got a pretty bangin' bod if I do say so myself. I'm sure I would have gotten picked on by the jerks around school if it wasn't for how cute I am. That, and they'd have to deal with a *huge jacked man* if Wolverine found out that someone had choice words for his favorite X-student. \n\nGod, speaking of Logan... he's been such a father figure to me, which makes me feel all sorts of gross for even saying this, but it doesn't help that he's like... a complete *Daddy*. Yeah, I used that word. Is there any other way to describe him? Gruff, muscled and that voice? Swoon worthy. He's so protective over me, always offering to train me and ensure I'm well taken care of that that I'd *love* to return the favor in a way. Yet, I can't even train with him for that damn long because I'm *pretty fucking sure* he'd be able to pick up the scent of some excited slut. How awkward would that be? I'm mortified just thinking about it.\n\nIf that isn't cruel enough, I'm surrounded by a bunch of studs. As the youngest official member of the X-men, they all just... sort of look at me like a little sister, and it's getting annoying! Competing for attention when it comes to Rogue, Jean, Ororo, Kitty... It can be trouble considering I'm just the 'cute' one. It's. Torture. I've tried to be a bit more feminine. My hair is getting longer, but it's usually kept in pigtails. I changed that stupid, long fucking yellow raincoat into a shorter one so... Well.... My butt isn't covered up. Don't judge me too harshly! The other girls are rocking uniforms that hug at them, the least I could do is show off my bubbly rear in tiny denim shorts. And of course, the pink glasses are there to stay. It's iconic, after all. Anyhow! Back to the team. \n\nHere are all these hunks on the team, running around in skin tight costumes that leave next to nothing to the imagination. I'm pretty sure Gambit has caught me counting his abs through that shirt-thingy more than enough times. I swear to god if I hear him refer to me as 'mon amie' or 'mon cheri' again, I'll fucking jump his bones then and there. He has to know what that does to a young woman! As far as I'm concerned, he's asking for trouble. *That. Accent.* And I know.. It's terrible, but like... C'mon! Him and Rogue can't even have *that* much fun together... If anything, I'd be like... A totally good friend by sucking on her boyfriend's cock!  She certainly can't do anything except... Jerk him off with her gloves on. Logically, it would keep him from finding *fun* elsewhere if I took it upon myself to take care of his needs, right? Yeah, totally makes sense. Besides, you can *totally* tell he's *cajun* a thick cock in those tights. Yeah? *Yeah?* I'll be here all week.\n\nThen there's the likes of Cyclops... Mr. Uptight himself. He might be a bit of a jerk with how commanding he is and all, but look at him! Plus, we both see the world through reddish... pink... glasses? That counts for something. But honestly... There's just... *men* everywhere. From the team, to other students in my classes that it's tough to actually focus. And the Brotherhood, too. It's only natural for me to wonder if Quicksilver is a minute man or not! There's a literal big hunk of man roaming the halls, too. Colossus... What I wouldn't give to climb that man like a tree. I can totally keep going if you want.\n\nBut when I'm not helping the X-men, or stuck sitting inside of a classroom blowing bubble gum, or smashing the high scores in the mall's arcade... All I really do is fantasize about what I could be doing with these super studs. Actually, well, fuck... I actually think about those things all while doing the things I listed above. Fuck me. Thoughts of being pinned right up against a pinball machine with one of my classmates pumping away at my backside would be heaven. Hell, being a mallrat, I even know where the least popular spots would be, and how to avoid every camera in *any* store. We could have all the fun in the world in a semi-public place with maximum thrill. It's only natural that I'm this pent up with how busy my schedule can be. Classes. X-men mission. Danger room session. Classes. Necessary gaming. I just... don't get what I need! So here I am, forced to think of all these filthy scenarios with all these studs around. Is it really that tough to find a man who'll drill my backside hard enough that I can take Professor X's chair for a spin? They'll also pretty much get their own fucking private firework show, all while they get to pound my thick ass. I think it's a win/win.\n\nYeah. I need it *that bad*. I know what you're thinking. Do you really, Jubilee? Do you really need to be a slut *that bad*?\n\nWell, let me answer your question with a question. \n\n[*Does a mall babe eat chili fries?*](https://youtu.be/inuWR2wlLXA?t=2s)\n\n---\n\nI don't think this idea is good enough without [me linking this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAkL2-vh2Sk)\n\nI've been craving an X-men roleplay as of late, and I thought 'hey, you know who's ultra fucking lame? Jubilation fucking Lee', and thus, the prompt was born. I want to play Jubilee with a thick, round ass that gets pounded by a stud. Plenty of choices. Wolverine, Gambit, Cyclops, Quicksilver, Colossus, McAvoy's Professor X from the past because he's hot as fuck. I'm open to ideas! As long as they aren't along the lines of Beast, Nightcrawler or yeah. Human lookin' fellas, please! Also open to other Marvel characters. Go wild. I *may* let you use an OC opposite of her. Whether it's a student/teacher/brotherhood member - but no civilians. Looking to play with a stud opposite of a bubbly, cute Jubilee with a bangin' backside.\n\nAs for kinks \u2013 I'm looking for an ass-man. Someone who loves rimming, fingering, and fucking a thick backside. If you're not interested in rimming/anal, I'm sorry to say that we won't be able to write together. Those are two kinks I can't go without. My other kinks would be \u2013 Dirty talk, rough sex, semi-public sex (holdthemoan), DP, creampies, face-fucking and face-sitting. I also love the contrast of a curvy gal opposite of an athletic/muscular man. Limits would be things along the lines of \u2013 feet, fisting, bathroom play, submissive partners, *vampires* and animals.\n\nSend me over your kinks/limits, who you would like to play and how you want the scene to go!\n\nAlso!

That's great!\n\nAnd then something unexpected happened. Some of my posts were F4A, and although I wasn't really looking for women, I wound up talking to a few women and I really enjoyed it. \n\nI like talking to other women who are my age. Sharing our day-to-day lives. Commiserating with each other about the things that are frustrating. Reminding each other about the things that are good in our lives. \n\nI like talking to younger wives and moms. Remembering the days when I first got married and had kids. Remembering how hard it seemed at the time, and remembering how life offered so many options. \n\nI like talking to girls who are much younger and single. Hearing about what dating is like now! Admiring the girls at that age who already have their shit together and smiling at my screen at the ones who are still trying to figure it out. \n\nAnd I like talking to all of them about the things that make our cunts wet.

Your irritation that I would have said anything like that manifests itself with a quick, hard slap across my face, knocking me to the floor.\n\n\n\"Oh she did? Good - totally. We wouldn't miss it for the world!\" you reply, feigning interest. You take a seat down on our couch, and click your fingers, beckoning me to get back on my knees. I obediently come towards you and take your balls into my mouth, sucking on them, exactly the way you like me to.\n\n\n'Great! Don't get me anything too expensive! I know what you're like. I only want you spoiling my daughter, understand?'\n\n\n\"Oh I can't promise that...\" you reply, getting even more bored with the conversation. You raise your legs into the air, and with your free hand grab a fist full of my hair, pushing my face down, my mouth pressed into your asshole.\n\n\n'Good, she's my princess! I better hear from her that you're treating her like one!' I can hear through the phone my Dad chuckling, he's joking, but he isn't really. My tongue starts to work your asshole quickly. I know what happens when I don't seem eager enough to play with it... I don't want that tonight...\n\n\n\"Don't worry, I treat her exactly how she deserves to be treated, you know that.\" You reassure him down the phone, your balls pressing on my face, your free hand pressing my nostrils up, making it look like I have a pig snout.\n\n\n'I know you do, you're good for her! I always knew it. I better get off. Is she there? Let me say goodnight to my princess before I go.'\n\n\nYou roll your eyes again, and release me, putting the phone by my head as I gasp for air, struggling to hide the sound of it.\n\n\n\"Hi Daddy...\" I choke out... you watch me exchange a few words with him, my face wet, smeared with my own spit. You can hear his last words\n\n\n'And make sure you look after that boy! He's good for you, do whatever it takes to make him happy princess you don't want to lose that one!'\n\n\n\"I...I will Daddy, you know me...\" I look up at you, your eyes piercing into me, bored of how long this is taking.\n\n\n'Okay, goodnight princess.'\n\n\n\"Goodnight Daddy...\" and your thumb quickly ends the call.\n",

I should have known better.\n\nSomehow, I ended up passed out in the men's bathroom. Some people would find it a hilarious sight, really. You walk into the bathroom and there I am, bent over the sink and unconscious. My dress was struggling to keep my ass hidden, and there was nobody around.\n\nSo, if you were to walk in, why don't you tell me what would happen if you saw me in such a state? Would you wake me up?

            "selftext": "Congratulations! You have just obtained your very own Gomorrah Technologies model 227 gynoid, sexbot class! We here at Gomorrah take pride in the customization of our robots, and invite you to select your preferences for your model 227.\n\n**BREASTS:**\n\nOur gynoid breasts are the best in the industry, designed to be soft, squishy and very lifelike.

We have created our gynoids with this in mind, and present the only customizable mouth in the industry.\n\n- C1: The cute, thin lipped mouth.\n- C2 (default): Lush, succulent lips.\n- C3: Overinflated, puffy lips. Apparent DSLs.\n- C4: Silent and lubed vagina-like hole. A pussy-face\n- C5: Puffy wet ring, an overly collagen enhanced fuck hole.\n- C6: Custom, advanced users only.\n\n**PUSSY:**\n\nThe pussy, is where all the action happens. You can do all sorts of things with a vagina, and we at Gomorrah promise to deliver a unique experience.\n\n- D0: No pussy.

To enable this, simply add a \"Y\" and \"Z\" in your customization preset. Penises come in whatever shape you desire, but if no shape is specified, it will be a normal human shape.\n\n- Y0 (default): No penis\n- Y1: A cute tiny penis, 2-3 inches long.\n- Y2: An average penis, 6-8 inches long.\n- Y3: Huge thick horse penis, 14 inches long.\n- Y4: A fuckable penis; stretchy urethra that can take any size cock. 24-36 inches long.\n- Y5: Custom, advanced users only.\n\n**BALLS:**\n\n- Z0 (default): No balls.\n- Z1: Tiny, almost non apparent balls, &lt;1 inch in diameter\n- Z2: Average sized balls, 2 inches in diameter.\n- Z3: Oversized balls, 4 inches in diameter.\n- Z4: Massive, overactive balls, 10-11 inches in diameter.\n- Z5: Custom, advanced users only.\n\n**ANUS:**\n\nThe anus is a somewhat taboo hole, and although Gomorrah's gynoids would have no need for one due to the fact that they do not excrete waste, (though may be commanded to do so), that does not stop us from allowing you to customize your experience with your gynoid's ass.\n\n- E0: No anus\n- E1: A tight, almost unfuckable hole without using plenty of lubricant.\n- E2: A loose, muscular anus.\n- E3 (default): A round, puffy anus somewhat resembling a glazed donut.\n- E4: A massive anus, exposed from the ass at all times, forming a humongous puffy ring.\n- E5: Custom, advanced users only.\n\n**ASS:**\n\nThe ass is one of the other fine features to grab your attention, or anyone's for that matter.  Gomorrah's asses are also top notch, ranging from flat and tiny to muscular to jiggly booties.  And here at Gomorrah, we're always happy to help you get more cushion for the pushin'\n\n- F0: No ass\n- F1: A flat, tiny ass.\n- F2 (default): A cute, curvy caboose.\n- F3: A round large muscular ass.\n- F4: A huge, jiggling shelf-like bubble butt.\n- F5: Custom, advanced users only.\n\n**OTHER OPTIONS:**\n\n- The physical appearance of your gynoid can take many forms, up to and including: Human, elf, demoness, and cow, cat, bunny or other anthro forms, as well as any forms you may specify. Apparent age is also a customizable option.\n- Other customizable options include: Hair color, hair length, personality, voice style/pitch, initial outfit/uniform (if that plays into her personality), limbs (present or not).\n- When your gynoid arrives, you will be prompted to designate a **name**, as well as **primary personality traits**. These options are incredibly open-ended, which is why you are prompted after you receive your gynoid, to give you full control over the process.\n\nWe hope your new Gomorrah Technologies gynoid model 227 sexbot brings you pleasure, and companionship.\ufeff",

            "selftext": "Let\u2019s talk about Lucy Ballman for a second. I absolutely loathe her. She was an early bloomer. Like, she was THE early bloomer. By the end of eighth grade, she was a 32F cup. She was by far the bustiest girl in school and probably the bustiest in the high school too. How do I know her bra size? Because she told everyone. Every day in the locker room, she run around topless and show off how big she was getting. She\u2019d drape her bra on our gym lockers so we\u2019d have to see how big it was. She\u2019d complain about how her clothes never fit and point out how our small chests must\u2019ve made shopping so much easier. It was the worst kind of pandering and patronizing nonsense.\n\nShe did have an amazing chest. I was super jealous since I was completely flat. But, as high school started, I had a growth spurt. Then another. Then another. By the end of my freshman year, I was up to a D cup. When sophomore year started, I was the same size as her - an F cup. I absolutely relished it. Tank tops became my daily wardrobe choice. I followed the Balllman playbook and let my bra size circulate around the school.\n\nAnd I kept going. I ended up settling at a J cup. 30J. I was skinnier than her and I had bigger tits. I loved it. She tried being a slut, but I got all of the attention. I was clearly the top girl at school. I stole two different boyfriends from her just to prove I could.\n\nDid any of you end up outgrowing the obnoxious girl with the giant tits? Gentlemen, did you have friends that this happened to? Or did you maybe have your way with the bustiest girl in school?\n\nHappy to role play something along these lines as well!",

            "selftext": "My name's Rachel. If you've ever been in the library, you've probably seen me. I'm that girl with the bushy brown hair who's always hunched over a pile of thick textbooks, scrunching my nose at a pad or two of graph paper covered in equations. I probably didn't stick in your mind for more than a minute though. I'm not particularly eye catching, especially when I get bundled for cozy all-nighter in the chilly library.\n\nWell, except for my hips. Wide-set and perfect for child-bearing, they're an almost ridiculous level of venusian curve that still somehow flows with the rest of my body like they were meant to be. My hips... and that whole... hip... butt... thigh... area.\n\nBy boobs too, I guess. You might not notice them under my habitually half-zipped hoodie, but there's not a day that goes by where I'm not reminded of the big heavy milkbags I carry on my chest every day. They're less huge though than... full, I guess. Round and heavy but still with the perky firmness of youth.\n\nSo... yeah, hips and boobs. I guess there's more that meets the eye than I thought. But that image of a tall, fertile girl only hints at what's truly special about me. You see, I'm... um... okay, I can't recall the exact string of complicated medical words. But the gist of it is: I'm hyper-fertile.\n\nI get fucked, and I will have a happy, healthy baby. Doesn't matter if the guy doing the deed's got every genetic disease known to man. Something about my womb just scrubs that all away and knits together the image of health. Usually in closer to seven months than nine, too. You'd be surprised how many people'll pay through the nose for a surrogate like that.\n\nAnd good thing, too. If I couldn't rent out my womb to pay for grad school, I'd probably... I dunno, be sucking dicks at a truck stop or something. Fat lotta good my parents have done me.\n\nAnyway, that's me. The brunette studying in the corner with a barely-visible bump hinting at the life growing inside her.\n\nhey, dpp, let's give this a try! I'm looking for a partner to play opposite Rachel (especially another girl, but a new boyfriend is also welcome), and perhaps other characters who she interacts with in a story as sweet as it is sexual. Maybe a client she carries for, but I'd have to be a good pitch since I'm not really feeling that.",

Ripping things apart and bathing in the blood. Much better than DOOM 3, which I remember watching a friend play, and sorta playing a bit of. Any DOOM game that makes you feel weak isn't a good DOOM game. Anyway, putting that aside. I have... A strange desire. A mighty strange desire.\n\nBarons of Hell, we all know them. Big, horned, hoofy bois packing lots of muscle and Argent Energy; the Royal guards and Generals of the ruler of Hell. Tall as... Hell, and tossing our argent energy fires to wreck you up.\n\nThe deal of the matter is; I like the idea of a big strong, submissive guy, especially ones in a position of power or strength. I ALSO quite love monsters. So... I mean, why not consentually cuckold a big hoofy boi? Maybe a Baron has a concubine in the form of a Summoner demon, or a Succubus if we're going a bit astray from canon. Being so high up on the food chain, I'm sure it's not hard for either of them to pick out lesser demons to bone her to appease his ever so secret, shameful taboo kink. Why would they ever speak up about it, as well? He could rip them apart with a flick of his claws.\n\nThat's the premise of my odd idea, and I do hope you feel the desire to entertain my absurd fantasy. Thank you!",

[Single](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/185697785603948544/431499542236495873/jojos-1000x600.png). Currently in a century long blood feud with my [adopted brother](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/185697785603948544/431495491755311124/jojo5.png)'s descendants. (It's a bizarre story.)\n\nWhat I like in women: [Ladies who are named after now totally irrelevant 80s singers](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/185697785603948544/431496500238090240/latest.png), flamboyant outfits, and near suicidal loyalty towards me.\n\nWhat I dislike: Ancient Tibetan breathing techniques that let people pull insane bullshit out of their ass, enemy\u300cSTAND\u300dusers, anyone with a remote connection to the Joestar family.\n\nSince I have arisen from my coffin, I have amassed quite the rogue's gallery of miscreants. However, it's become a... \"sausage party\". Don't get me wrong- they're all loyal henchmen that carry out my will, but vampires have libidos, man! If YOU were stuck in a coffin in the bottom of the sea for a hundred years you'd be in the same boat as I am. (Metaphorically. I murdered the sailors that dragged me into their dinky little ship.)\n\nI digress, I will be accepting suitors into my castle in Cairo (Don't worry, you won't miss it) so just knock three times and I'll know you're there.\n\nSo long as this is still up, I'm still accepting applicants!\n",

            "selftext": "Hey! Just as the title reads, I'm looking to find an older person to chat with!\n\nFirst a bit about me: I'm 22, just graduated University, Korean with dark hair that barely goes past my shoulders. I'm about 5'3 and wear glasses as well. I'd say I'm average or normal looking, or even boring, with a fairly shy personality.\n\nI'm looking to change it up tonight! I'm normally interested in long-term RP but I feel like something short and dirty (or long and dirty if you enjoy it enough). \n\n**What I like:**\n\n* Older men with no real maximum age in sight! If you're older than me, that's a huge plus for me. \n\n* Confidence! \n\n* Men who are a bit geeky or know their way around some video games. I play some PC games so if you do too then that's a huge plus! (Admittedly I'm not very good but I still like to talk about them :3)\n\n* Politeness. Trust me, I love absolutely degrading myself and a lot of rough ideas but if you can't be friendly or respectful outside of those moments then I'm not interested.\n\n**Kinks**\n\n* I'm very submissive and enjoy pet-play, collars and serving. If we write a story... part of the story will involve you giving me a nose ring and maybe a butt plug.\n\n* I have a very strong oral fetish, swallowing is great! Spit and watersports are extra great! I also like a lot of ass play.\n\n* **Breeding!** I like the idea of raceplay a little bit, but not too much. Knowing if you're White, Black, etc, would be a good thing! \n\n\nI also like the idea of men sending me reference pictures and gifs of the kinds of things they would like to do with me. I normally just stick with words because I enjoy reading and writing my fun but tonight is different! \n\nThanks for reading my post! ",

            "selftext": "It has been a long, cold winter. Now the air stirs with the promise of storms and growing warmth. Snow still falls occasionally, but then melts away. My father and older brother have set off for the capital. Leaving me at home, acting Lady of Rosehill. And everything has been going well under my watch. The farmers are beginning to till their soil and those who are old enough to fight are away in the capital, preparing to fight for the King's wars.\n\nBut now...the warning horns are blasting.\n\nI jump out of my bed and run to my bedroom window. Looking down at my father's village. The guards that have been left behind are either the old or the extremely young. And it doesn't take long for the invading army to smash through our gates. I watch in shock as fighting breaks out in the streets below and then I run.\n\nI run down the hall of my manor. I need to send a bird for help and then I need to hide myself. I\u2019m scribbling a note of the attack to send out. This would be the first attack this far in the borders and it was anything but expected. Someone needed to know! And then the door to the aviary crashes open.\n\nIn the doorway are two soldiers that I don\u2019t recognize. I run to the window and send the raven. Then, before I can run, a large hand grabs my long auburn braid and yanks me back into waiting, strong arms. I kick and scream as the man drags me down the stairs of my home, to the town square. My nightgown rips from my constant kicking. And then I\u2019m tossed on the wooden boards of a platform.\n\nI groan and look up, meeting the eyes of the invading army\u2019s captain. I stand up and wrap my arms protectively around myself. The peasants are all here. And then I turn to face you. I take a small step forward, although I clearly don\u2019t want to. My satin nightgown has one long rip up the side, where it blows around my leg in a very indecent way. The bottom hem is covered in mud. My red hair is still mostly in my long braid, but there are plenty of loose strands.\n\n-------------------\n\nSo, do you make me your conquered sex slave or do you give me to an upcoming officer for marriage. Maybe forcibly marry me for a claim on your newly conquered territory? Do you use me in front of my own people or sell me into slavery like one of the peasant girls? Maybe you fall in love with my beauty and slowly try to win my heart? Maybe your the wife of a the Captain and want to take out your boredom or anger on your new servant? So many possibilities.\n\nKinks: I am up for pretty much everything. Some of my favorites are dubcon/noncon, rough sex, impreg., BDSM, being forced to submit,DD/lg, (you) breaking my spirit, bondage, being used, petplay, slave play. But also I like romance, undressing, first time, cuddling. Either way you want to go, I will enjoy it! Full List: https://i.imgur.com/ocT625Z.png\nSpecial Note: Super love being the hostage, so...you will get extra attention if you find some way to do that.\n\nLimits: The only ones I really won\u2019t do are scat, vomit, and gore.\nI prefer to write in the first person. Also, I am looking for long-term and maybe some help world-building (I tend to be more reactive as a writer).\n\nI am 5\u20193 with a slender build. I have waist-length auburn waves and blue eyes. I have C-cups and wide hips. In this play I\u2019m the only daughter of a well-landed Duke. And you and your army are the invading enemy. Also, I prefer long-term roleplays. Lucy",

            "selftext": "Premature ejaculation was considered to be the ultimate humiliation by some people. The act of literally cumming under sexual pressure.\n\nSo people have asked me, \"Lydia, why would you open a cafe dedicated to making people suffer that humiliation?\" Well, I knew that those boys didn't want to admit it. They actually loved cumming in their pants, feeling the burning blush rise up. Girls felt powerful seeing tears rise up as their date stained their drawers, and who was I to deny them this opportunity?\n\nSo I designed a cafe built around one single challenge. You order a meal along with one or several hostesses. If you manage to make it through your entire meal without blowing your load it would be free. However if the hostesses got to you first, you had to drop some major tips. So be prepared to burn some cash while your here.\n\nOn our digital menus we have girls ranging from new adults to aged Milfs. All ready and willing to make sure someone at your table cums buckets before leaving. We even have challenges for people to participate in, like ordering our Halloween Dessert! The meal is entirely made out of candy and sweets but you have costumed girls waiting on you in character, begging for your creamy filling.\n\nThen of course we have the female demographic to think about. Orgasms count, however we have to take special precautions. Making them take a pill that makes their pussy just as sensitive as a cock. We know that even girls like to be embarrassed too.\n\nSo as the owner of this establishment, let me welcome you to my Pre-Ejaculation Cafe. Gaining entry and membership is easy, just list off your kinks, limits, and a description of yourself if you want to reserve seating. \n\n*Warning, this cafe does not take one line replies. We only agree to see those who show effort in wanting to come here.*\n",

            "selftext": "Valentina has [the perfect body](https://i.imgur.com/Gt8inn4.jpg). That's just a fact, and as far as she's concerned, that makes her the Queen of the beach. Her glossy black hair flows down her graceful neck, her boobs are high and perky on her chest despite the lack of support from her skimpy bikini, her waist narrows down to a slim hourglass before swelling out again to sensual hips and the most perfect heart-shaped ass you've ever imagined. Like, you didn't think it was possible for a booty to be so round and smooth. Her toned legs trace down to delicate toes that play in the sand.\n\nShe's selected her bathing suit carefully. She had to: if you're planning to spend every single day of summer at the beach, then you're going to get some epic tanlines, so they had better be lines that you want. Her top is a skimpy pullover affair, with no annoying strings or knots, although her bouncing breasts still threaten to spill out most of the time. Her bottoms are a slim thong that disappears between the cheeks of her ass, revealing the entire form of her deadliest weapon. A cute little heart cutout exposes even more skin, and leaves a delicate tanline that, if you were to see it in its entirety, says \"Lucky You\" *far* more effectively than any tattoo.\n\nThe beach is big and busy, like Venice Beach, but still small enough that regulars know each other, and the Queen can always find who she's looking for. And Val intends to make sure that everybody knows that she rules it all. Regulars and newcomers, locals and tourists: she's the Queen of the beach. She doesn't demand much: kicking someone out of her favorite spot in the shade, or getting a guy to buy her lunch with a hand on the knee, or even just having someone take over the nuisance of applying sun lotion several times a day. Really, the important part is just that they *know* who's boss.\n\nShe enforces her rule with an iron fist of sexual intimidation and bribery. A body like hers is terrifying, in its own way; girls know they can't compete and get out of her way, or guys are struck dumb by her form and become meekly compliant. Being denounced by someone as hot as her is utterly and totally humiliating. Or on the other hand, she offers the carrot instead of the stick and teases her subjects with tantalizing glimpses or flirtatious touches. Having a shy boy rub lotion all over her can basically reduce him to a servant.\n\nTo cement it all, she picks a citizen of her kingdom to have sex with;\n\nEvery.\n\nSingle.\n\nDay.\n\nShe's earned the right, and it tells everyone *exactly* who the boss is. It proves that she has first dibs on every hot guy, utter control over every stuttering boy, and total superiority over every girl. And honestly; what else is her perfect body *for* if not for passion, for steamy pleasure for her and awestruck incredulity for them.\n\nSometimes she'll choose a hot guy, with a stunning bod, and all the confidence, skill, and experience needed to give her the hot and hard fuck she craves, and prove that she can have *anyone* to boot. Or other times she'll choose the shy virgin, whose enthusiasm usually makes up for their lack of experience, and if not...well, she knows how to get what she wants from them. Fucking the timid ones also gives the rest of them hope, that her flirting isn't just empty promises, that getting on her good side actually pays off for you. And sometimes, if she's in the mood or someone just pisses her off, she'll even go for some forced lesbianism, making a girl eat her perfect pussy until she cums, showing the superiority of her perfect body.\n\nWhoever she chooses, she knows that the rest of them can only watch in envy as she leads them away, hoping that tomorrow will be their day, that they can please their Queen and reap their reward. And in the meantime, she rules over them all.\n\nIt's good to be the Queen.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nBefore I go any further, I should warn you: I was really more excited to write this prompt than actually play the RP. I'm a little short on time these days, but if you read this and felt like you just *have* to play it, send me an idea for your character and what you want to happen, and if you impress me, I might take you up on it. Probably short term, but we'll see.\n\nIt's finally getting warm again, and I can't wait to get to the beach! I saw the reference photo and *had* to make this prompt.\n\nObviously from the prompt, guys, girls, and futas are welcome! You can be a guy that Val has fucked several times just because she enjoys it, or an unsuspecting newcomer not knowing what he's in for. She can rock your world or totally humiliate you if you're into that. Or Val may have finally bit off more than she can chew in the form of an uncompromising alpha male. You can be a girl chafing under the heel of Val's rule, but unable to compete with her, or a new rival for queen, someone hot enough to challenge even her. The beach has a long list of characters, you can really pick whichever you like!\n\nThe most obvious kinks are there in the prompt: Superiority, casual sex, social [but not necessarily sexual (but not necessarily *not* sexual)] domination, forced lesbianism, **body worship**, manipulation, etc. I have a much longer list of other kinks that can be brought into play if they pertain to your idea. I'm happy to try almost anything that's not in my limits. Just ask!\n\nLimits are bathroom stuff, intense pain or torture, snuff.",

            "selftext": "Please please please read the full prompt! I've had a number of people message me not really understanding what I'm looking for, so to save both of us some time I'd really really appreciate if you read the prompt it at least the explanation part after the setup part. Being the best message is way better than being the first message! Okay, on with the fun stuff. \n\n---\n\nIt was a day like any other. I was making my way through the mall, heading to pick up Kleenex, or a phone charger, or something stupid \u2013 I can\u2019t remember anymore. Suddenly I passed by a store that made me stop dead in my tracks. I don\u2019t know what it was that caught my eye \u2013 from the outside it didn\u2019t look much different from a standard women\u2019s clothing store, and there wasn\u2019t anything in the window that made me want to go inside. Yet for some reason I was drawn in. \n\nWhen I first stepped in I felt a strange shiver come over my body. I picked through the racks, looking over tops, dresses, and jeans, nothing catching my eye. Then I rounded a corner, and there they were: a normal-looking pair of panties, resting on a shelf by themselves. They didn\u2019t even seem like they\u2019d fit, and definitely weren\u2019t something I\u2019d normally wear. But when I picked them up, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to put them back down. After deliberating for a few moments, I took them to the counter and bought them. The salesperson looked me dead in the eye as they rang me up, but didn\u2019t say a word. \n\nEver since I brought them home I\u2019ve been wearing them every day. They\u2019re so comfy, and they make me feel so good. I never want to take them off\u2026\n\n---\n\nHi everyone. So today I had an idea for a roleplay about a magical pair of panties that have a powerful effect on the wearer. The effect starts as mental, but may later spread to physical as well \u2013 they can also affect the world around me. Rather than playing with just one pair of panties, **my preference is that we pick a few different pairs of panties (we can always add more later) and use the different effects they have on me to play with different transformation dynamics.**\n\n**I'm looking for a GM/storyteller** \u2013 a person who leads me through the story of my changes and what happens to me, in a kind of CYOA sort of fashion. We can discuss what the panties might be and how they could affect me. Obviously this story would be told collaboratively - I don't expect you to do all the work while I enjoy myself! Here are a couple of examples I came up with of panties that could I could wear:\n\n\n**The Red Satin**\n\nThese make me become older. Maybe I wake up next to a husband I don\u2019t recognize. Maybe I\u2019m a college girl who suddenly has to deal with PTA meetings. Maybe I lust after a guy who *used to be* my own age, but is actually a MILF hunter. \n\nSuggested kinks: Size change, breast/ass expansion, MILF, maybe mommying \n\n**The Pink G-String**\n\nThese turn me into a stereotypical airheaded, slutty bimbo. Maybe I find that I suddenly can\u2019t stop masturbating, and need something to help curb my sex drive. Maybe I have difficulty passing tests now, and need to find some other way to get my grades up. Maybe my old clothes suddenly don\u2019t fit my new T&amp;A, and end up looking like crop tops.\n\nSuggested kinks: Body changing, bimboification, sluttiness, lingerie/sexy outfits\n\n**The Black Pantyhose**\n\nThese give me a lust for authority figures. Maybe I'm overcome with the urge to flash my boss at the water cooler. Maybe I give a cop head to get out of a speeding ticket. Maybe they even make me wet for an older family member.\n\nSuggested kinks: Dom/sub, flashing, exhibitionism, humiliation/degradation\n\nLimits (for all): Violence/gore, animals\n\nThese are just ideas and suggestions: if you have an idea for a different pair of panties or some kinks you want to include with my suggestions, just ask me and we can talk about it! Women, strong writers, and other interesting people are the best! If you have ideas for different panties I also would love if you included pictures. I think I\u2019ve bored everyone enough so I\u2019ll leave it here \u2013 hope to be seeing some orange envelopes soon!\n\nBy the way, if you happen to see this and think you're 'too late', give it a shot! You'd be surprised at how few replies this prompt gets, especially longer than one sentence.",

            "selftext": "Look, I have everything I want in life. \n\nEven if my grandfather hadn't left me 3.6 million dollars, I still made investments with my own money that netted me an additional 1.5 million.\n\nI have a master's degree from a prestigious school. So what if they accepted me because my family is famous. My 4.0 sure as shit wasn't purchased.\n\nYes, I was blessed with genetics, blonde hair and blue eyes and a thick ass. My breasts were perky, cleavage wonderful, even without a bra my DD cup needed little support. My waist was tiny, even before I became a gym rat, working out 6 days a week.\n\nMy house? Bought when I was 22 because I worked 40 hours a week the day I turned 14. I saved and saved. I even learned how to do electrical work, drywalling, basic carpentry, because that's a great way to save money. Oh and how could I forget, the whole basement was soundproofed.\n\nI have a boyfriend, he's loving and sweet and great in bed. I care too much about his love and his smile and his mother to get from him what I crave day to day.\n\n**Because, let's face it, you can't *torture* someone you actually care about.**\n\nYou can't bind their balls individually and so tight you *swear* this time they will burst.\n\nYou can't place 40 clothespins on each tit and slap them off with a riding crop and a few hours later *simply eat dinner* with that same person.\n\nAnd you *definitely* can't inflate a buttplug to it's max capacity after administering an enema, forcing stomach pains and tears all night to anybody you share a bed with.\n\nThere's no possible way I could ever kidnap someone and hold them against their will, as sexy and perverted and *psychotic* as that sounds. \n\nBut, I could keep the details of our arrangement vague, and draw up in the contract that I abide by no safeword, you're never free to leave on your own volition, and I bare no legal responsibility should something going awry.\n\nSo, won't you be my torture buddy?\n\n(If you are interested in my prompt, please fire away with a reply in scene and let's get started, boys and girls all welcome!)",

            "selftext": "You knew right from the start of our conversation. You knew right at the beginning that you shouldn't be talking to me. Something about me just gave off that kind of vibe - every time I opened my mouth to speak, you could feel an odd sensation in the pit of your stomach. By now you probably realized that sensation was your instincts telling you to run far away. Unfortunately for you, now was too late.\n\nI had a crazy glint to my eyes now as I moved slowly and purposefully, stripping out of that small green dress you had wanted so desperately to see my take off. Like you had imagined at the bar (or was it like I had told you? it was so hard to remember now), there was nothing underneath but the figure you had salivated over. Even now, you could feel your cock begin to stir, overcome by the sight of my shapely breasts and curving hips. Despite the visual buffet in front of you, it's my eyes that really hold your attention. That look in them was well beyond lust.\n\nYou could probably tell I was crazy at the bar. It was almost like I reeked of it. It wasn't the \"I only hang out with guys,\" drama-driven type of crazy. It was the \"I'll burn your house down if you wrong me,\" type. Yet that pure, open sexuality was what drew you in. A few drinks, half an hour, and one whispered promise of the best night of your life was all it took to override your crazy defenses and get you to take me back to your place. You had probably imagined that I would be the one in handcuffs, letting you have your way with me all night long.\n\nIt's funny how that works sometimes, isn't it?\n\nYou had already given up on fighting against your restraints. Some chicks, you decided, enjoyed being in control like this, and you were sure you could make it fun for you, too. Once I let you free, I'd let you do whatever you wanted to me. But now, as I climbed atop the bed, standing over you with a wolfish grin, you weren't so sure.\n\nI lowered myself slowly, wanting to see the look in your eyes as I took your hard cock inside my waiting sex. I was going to enjoy every second of this. When I finally had you fully inside, I leaned over your body, letting my face just drift past yours so I could whisper in your ear.\n\n\"If you ruin this for me and cum first, I'll ruin your fucking life.\"\n\nIt was going to be a long night.",

Why wouldn't I want to be one?!\n\nOf course, there's the whole bit about preying on men (or women) and killing them during sex, but we can take or leave that part. I've seen modern takes on the lore that say that succubi feed off of the sexual energy itself, rather than stealing their souls. Of course, I'm more than happy to sensually take your life if that's what would catch your eye. I could easily play the succubus as anything from a superior bitch to a playful lover, or anything in between, so tell me what's on your mind. I'm more than happy to come up with a prompt together on this.\n\n[The obligatory kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/pJxUALd.png)",

With the towel that she had picked up on her way out, she patted her face and neck to remove the perspiration that she had produced from the effort of the job and with a little more care, worked the towel up her lightly bronzed legs before she patted her neck again. The break would be short, but like everyone else there, the breaks were welcome. She sipped from the bottle of water and pulled her cell phone out of a pocket and sighed as she tapped away.\n\nHi Lover, Work going into overtime with the deadline. Gonna be late for dinner, 8:00 ok, or reschedule?\n\nHugs and deep kisses,\nRye\n\nShe hated to spoil yet another dinner, she wanted to see Liam and feel his arms about her tonight. They hadn\u2019t had nearly enough time and the job was almost always the cause. Still, he was the steadiest boyfriend that she had ever had and he was dear to her in so many ways. After 4 months together, she was the happiest that she had ever been aside from the fact that work held her by the short and curliest, she would happily spend every evening cuddled up on the couch and watch some silly movie, or have him read to her in his rich voice.\n\n\u201cOk Everyone, break\u2019s over!\u201d The director said and Riley Reid sighed and rose from her director\u2019s chair and slipped the robe off of her naked form and padded back out onto the set. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d she asked as she accepted the old woman that stepped up and sprayed water over her bare skin so that the splices would look right.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s resume where we left off, a few seconds of pretape to get a good splice. That ok Riley?\u201d\n\nThe Petite woman shrugged, her brunette locks moving enticingly with the motion, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter to me, but how about we don\u2019t try to punch my stomach, ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure Babe, no problem.\u201d\n\nRiley Reid slipped back up onto the ruffled bed and waited for the camera\u2019s to get the right angle again, a young woman slipped up behind her with a bottle of baby oil\u2026 it didn\u2019t show as much, and started pushing two fingers into Riley\u2019s ass, \u201cHey, not so rough, ok? I have a date tonight and I would like to be able to sit down.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry Riley.\u201d The girl squeaked and was more gentle as she lubricated the starlet\u2019s backdoor and slowly worked another finger in. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, where Hugo?\u201d she looked around, \u201cAh, there you are.\u201d A soft slap on her ass and she felt his cock slip into her ass with little effort. \u201cAhhhh\u2026 damn you\u2019re big Baby.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd\u2026. Action!\u201d\n\nRiley hoped that she would never have to tell Liam what she really did for work and that he would keep on believing that she was an actress for commercial and bit parts in on location shoots.\n\n--------\n\nLooking to explore a relationship like this. A very in love couple in their first few months together but one of them has a secret, she's a porn star and the infamous Riley Reid.\n\nI'm open to play either gender\n\nI'd like this to be a long term and developed rp that and a fair amount of plot and smut as well.\n\nWould also want to write this up on Google docs and use a messenger such as kik or Google hangouts to chat and set things up on.\n\nIf interested, send me a detailed interesting message where you see things going and perhaps a description of her partner and lets brainstorm.",

            "selftext": "We met back in springtime. You'd been coming home from work when you saw me on the sidewalk, and I immediately got the feeling you didn't usually spare people like me a second glance, but for some reason I was an exception. Our eyes met, we smiled, and when you read the \"will draw for food\" sign you actually stopped. My only customer in two hours.\n\nI sketched you for maybe fifteen minutes. We shot the shit as I worked, talking about the weather, the city, the festival on the edge of town. I hadn't expected you to know anything about reggae. You hadn't expected me to like classic rock as much as you do. It's amazing how sometimes it only takes a few minutes to click with someone. \n\nWhen I handed over the completed sketch, I can tell you were shocked. You hid yourself well, which wasn't to say that your suit was poorly fitted or your square glasses unattractive, but you weren't trying to sell yourself to anyone. My sketch didn't catch any of that. On the paper, the light caught your eyes and the hint of a dimple in that half-smile of yours. It was like I saw a different version of yourself than the stern countenance you presented to the world every day. \n\nYou held out a fifty in one hand. Then you smiled, coy, and said that if I was serious about needing a warm meal and a bed for the night, you could provide that instead. No questions asked, no pressure. Normally I wouldn't believe a question like that, but, well, sometimes a girl has to take a risk.\n\nI slept in your guest room that first night. Took a shower that left me smelling like your masculine soap. Made you tacos so hot we were both sweating a little, but so tasty that didn't stop us. We stayed up so late chatting that first night- well, I was chatting. You listened, mostly. You're a listener. You listened to my stories about my Navajo grandfather who taught me basically everything, how I'd hated high school and dropped out at 16 to pursue my art, how my spirit animal was a coyote even though I wasn't 100% sure I believed in that kind of thing...\n\nWe're completely different people. You talked about your work a little. Your parents and your normal childhood a bit. A few words about how you'd thought about going into music before deciding to pursue a more stable lifestyle. I could tell within a few minutes of talking to you that you'd probably never smoked a joint, much the less sold them out of your hip pockets at a concert to try and break even on a half-pound.\n\nBut somehow, being very different people didn't matter. The two decade age gap didn't matter. We spent that second night in your bed, and even though I left the next morning for the festival, I was back as soon as it ended. Then gone again. But back again within a month. And so on throughout the summer. Every two or three weeks I'd give you a call and say I was passing through town, never for more than a night or two. I'd always leave clean, fed, rested, and happy, but I always left before you were quite ready to see me go. I warned you, more than once, that you were too smart to get attached to a girl like me.\n\nBut I could tell you were, in your own way. I could tell that I reminded you of someone you had once known, or at least something you had once been, but you didn't bring it up so I didn't ask. This nice house was clearly bought with a family in mind, but you lived here alone. For a while, I assumed; the decor lacked a feminine touch. You brought up once or twice, gently, how you had more than enough space, and there was plenty of market for artists in this city. I didn't change the subject because you were wrong about it, I changed the subject because you're wrong about *me*. \n\nI'm a mess of good tattoos and bad booze, fashion that straddled the line between boho and hobo, hair that started almost black at my scalp and ended golden blonde at my hips, perky B-cup breasts tipped with silver rings, a taut belly but a jiggly ass, wrists always covered in those cheap hemp and bead bracelets so the scars didn't show. On the good days I'm just a manic pixie dream girl. On the bad days, well, I'm just plain manic. I've got a lot of demons to conquer, ones that I never want you to see, much the less deal with. It's better for the both of us that you only see me at my best.\n\nOr at least that was my theory up until this morning. But sometimes I change my mind... and sometimes other people change it for me. This was one of the latter. A storm was blowing in and my van, the van with my guitar and my sketchbooks, the van with my entire *life* in it, was god knows where with the asshole who'd given me all the whiskey I could drink, an underwhelming fuck, and now a hangover and no means of transportation besides my own two feet.\n\nIt had taken me six hours to hitchhike here and another half of hour of walking to get to your doorstep, but now that I was here I couldn't bring myself to knock. I felt so guilty just dumping myself on you, but I didn't know where else to go. I didn't need a place to sleep -there are some advantages, I guess, to being short and cute- I just needed someone to kiss my forehead and tell me that I could pick myself up from this and be okay again, and that was much harder to find than a cot to sleep on. \n\nStill, I almost walked away again. I always called first, just showing up like this was rude. You might have other company over. Hell, what if you were married after all? A thousand thoughts rushed through my mind and I must have stood there at the door for five minutes just deliberating in my head before I heard your footsteps and the locks clicking open.\n***\nMy character: Lilakai Boone, 19ish, artist/musician/hippie, 5'2 with long ombre hair and tanned skin. Tattoos, piercings, scars, light drug use, \"free spirit\" sort of girl. Flexible on all of these points.\n\nYour character: 35-50ish, responsible career man. Ideally 6'+ with dark hair, stubble, and pale eyes, but not necessary. Bonus points for traditional \"upstanding member of the community\" jobs: cop, military, doctor, lawyer, fireman, teacher, etc.\n\nBasically looking for a romance between two unlikely partners; a healthy relationship preferred but I could be convinced to take it in a darker direction. Elements of D/s, especially discipline, forced orgasms, and anal are the kinks I'm especially looking to include. I would love mild DD/lg or Master/kitten dynamics but don't want to go for full on age or pet -play. \n\nNo: kids, seniors, animals, blood, scat/pee, brainwashing/drugging/hypnosis, misogyny, death/injury, or lack of plot &amp; foreplay.",

            "selftext": "Hello everybody! So, I have some confessions. I love big muscular women, and I love non human, non standard women. Women like [this](https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23/521732-warrior-orcs-fantasy_art-sword.jpg). So, I've got some prompts centered around what this beauty could do!\n\n*  It all started out so simply. Molly Piper, a 23 year old psychology student, found a book in the library, an old and dusty thing the size of a textbook. She took it back to her room, more bored than anything else, and started trying to sound out the weird words within. There was a flash of light and then she appeared in the center of Molly's room. Molly tried to escape, but it didn't end well for her as she learned that the Orc woman had a much more powerful spear than the one in her hands between her legs, and that she was more than ready to use it on the girls of the Academy.\n\n* Etda Sharpflesh, General of the 5th Legion of the Grand Orc Empire, was not expecting to fall through a magical portal to another realm. That being said, finding herself in a realm with [beauties](https://i.imgur.com/iSPUQ9h.jpg) such [as](https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SmeXvXHBeXwDtt-O4Y5XWwHaLI&amp;pid=Api) [these](https://i.redditmedia.com/oATys1Ev_0zxJHyOEM2Hl8qqbZ5kxGx6fGIcaaTuxwE.jpg?w=512&amp;s=2aa0cfec0e8c453e6dd7f711fd8f27ed) was not a bad fate. She could easily rebuild a harem here.\n\nThose are my two specific prompts, but I'm open to more. Dropping our powerful Orc Queen in any Rule 34 setting, particularly Overwatch, Borderlands, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or Lord of the Rings would be fun too. Some kinks I'd really love to work in are non con, futa, addictive cum, muscle/sweat worship, slavery, and raceplay. PM me if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "Most people my age wouldn't list 'freighter pilot' very high on their list of ideal jobs. It's a solitary, dangerous lifestyle with not much to keep you company except the hum of the engines and a navigational AI, if you could afford it. Their tubs were easy pickings for pirates and raiders, and there have been countless times the ships just flat out vanish without a trace.\n\nBut that's what I loved about it.\n\nThat sense of danger and exploration that had been lost once humanity joined up with the whole of the galactic community a century ago. Nothing seemed to have that risk when diseases were a rarity and lives went on for decades longer than before. I just wanted to feel that edge that life used to have, and that meant rolling the dice with my life whenever I wanted a paycheck.\n\nMy old tug, the Baby Blues, was a hunk of metal with an engine taped onto it I got cheap off some seller right out of navigation school. I can't say it was a pretty ship, but she'd grown on me; the old girl can take a hit and keep on ticking like nothing else I've seen. Plus with a few (less than legal) modifications to the engines and computers, she'd outpace some of the best freighters out on the market.\n\nI'd made a bit of a name for myself in the 2 years since I started this job. Whether I'm just hauling cargo or being a shuttle, I deliver everything to everyone, and vice versa. Unfortunately, that also means the ungainly profile of Baby Blues is always on the top of the list of ships pirates and their ilk look out for.\n\nAnd that's how I'm in my current predicament.\n\nI've fended off raids before; with a mix of speed, some clever piloting, and a few defense cannons hidden around Baby Blues hull, I've gotten out of a lot of trouble. Not so much this time it seems.\n\nThere had to have been about a dozen or so ships that swarmed me out while I was making the final calculations for a faster-than-light jump to my destination. Like I said, my old lug could take a hit, but she's not lasting long in a fight. Thankfully, I have a big red panic button on my pilot's console, something I rigged up to randomly plot a course to be anywhere but where I currently am. Seeing as how I was moments away from being atomized, boarded, or worse, I hit that thing.\n\nWith a flash of light and a LOT of whiplash, Baby Blues was catapulted light years away from the attacking pirates. That was the good news. The bad news was that the old girl's luck had finally run out; right before I fled, the pirates did enough damage to sever the connections between the FTL engine and the navigation system.\n\nWhich meant I was basically stranded in space.\n\nThe sinking feeling I got in my stomach was like no other; it was a total feeling of helplessness, that this was it. I was quick to slap myself out of it though. After all, I had a cryopod installed for just this purpose. Those things were built for old colony ships, before FTL engines were a thing. As long as they had a trickle of power they could keep a person alive forever. In theory, anyway.\n\nSetting up a course for the nearest occupied system (which was still light years away), triggered the SOS beacon before I booted up the old cryopod. While there were plenty of unsavory people out in space, I know there's just as many good ones. With any luck they'd find me first.\n\nI grab a soda from the fridge in my small living area as I pass by, figuring I'll need a little something to pick me up when I wake up (whenever that will be). The pod is bulky, with a clear window looking inside. Punching in some commands on the board, step back as the door opens with a loud hiss. Taking a deep breath, I step inside and settle in. The door closes, and the darkness comes to take me.\n\nWell, here's to a long sleep... I think to myself as I slip away. And there [I was, frozen, adrift in space...](https://imgur.com/a/Jdgve)\n\n--------------------\n\nAnd that's where you come in. How much time has passed?\n\nA day? A century? A millennia?\n\nWho are you?\n\nPirates? Aliens? Scientists?\n\nPretty open ended here, so be creative! You don't need to start out right away, but shoot me an idea of what you had in mind. Hope to hear from you!",

I've been quite proud of my skills, how I could make my boyfriend cum in no time, either with my hands, my mouth or fucking him silly... Any boy I've slept with in fact. Some were rougher, a bit more dominat. And I liked it. I liked being the slightly subbier girl in bed, while I kept doing what I wanted, and making them do what I wanted, in all other aspects of my life. What can I say, I've always been quite spoiled by men.\n\nAll my previous relationships were like that, and I thought that was normal... but I didn't knew what an Alpha was.\n\nAnd now here I lie, a puddle of your jizz, coating my face as I pant, sweaty on the floor. My clothes are scattered over your place, and this is the fourth time this week. I always promise myself I won't be coming back to you, to that way you have to make me feel desired and ignored at the same time. To that way you have to let me know that, if it's not me, you'd be screwing any other slut you want, so I should be thankful.\n\nI raise slightly, you are on the shower after leaving me, spent, exhausted and with my jaw sore, again, for the fourth time this week. My boyfriend is at home, and I won't be cleaning the load you spurted in my cunt until tomorrow morning, just because you told me not to... Fuck. If I had just only learned before what an alpha meant.\n\nHi, I am Mel, and I'd like to try out this new prompt that came to my mind, so I am looking for someone who is willing to play a Mid/Long term involving cheating, rough sex, submission, and basically any other kink the Alpha wants because... well.. I can't say no.\n\nI'd like to add being shared (group sex) as it is my main kink, but if it's not your thing, that can be fine for this specific scene.\n\nHit me up, and let's see how we adjust together. Bonus points (I hate that expressio, by the way) if you're an older Alpha and want to have +15 years age difference for me, or you're a BBC'ed alpha, no matter your age.\n\nWant to explore this one with me?",

I want to be treated like a slut.  And I have some fantasies I\u2019d like to play out on here and IRL.  Basically, I\u2019d like to use these fantasies as a springboard to similar activities IRL. \n\nFirst, a bit about me.  I\u2019m an active person who loves to go out for runs and some hikes.  Love swimming too.  Im described as \u201ccute\u201d more than anything else.  I\u2019m short, thin, and have brown hair and eyes.  I\u2019m have Indian and half good ol\u2019 white.   I\u2019m in a relationship. And I\u2019m really looking for some fun.  \n\nBut on to the scenarios:\n\nI\u2019d love to be blackmailed.  One that I\u2019ve seen is playing out a blackmail scenario entirely as if we are online to begin.  So you PM me and we begin the game.  We expand that into you telling me to do things IRL and I do them and report back.  \n\nAnother is just some straight up public dares.  You give me public tasks to do and I give you full written posts of how they went.\n\nOr how about some RP.   You catch me in a precarious position at work and make me do things based on the evidence you gather.  My RP character does tasks that you force on her.  Maybe I start doing similar tasks IRL.\n\nLast one is family fun.  My bro catches me doing something naughty and uses that to get me to do what he wants.  I become his reluctant sex slave.  We\u2019d have to give thought on working this one in.  \n\nI\u2019m also very open to your own ideas.  \n\nI\u2019m into dares, being used, humiliation, being degraded, pee, dressing sexy in public, sexual public embarrassment, social engineering, raceplay, body writing, giving control up.  I\u2019m not into scat, gore, impregnating.  \n\nNo matter the scenario I\u2019d love you to treat me rough.  Treat me how I deserve to be treated.  \n\n:)",

            "selftext": "Hey DDP!!!   First prompt here.  I have a few hours to play while my bf gambles his dick off. Also up for a discrete intermittent long term play if things work out that way.\n\nI'm Madison, a natural redhead that loves being put in my place, especially by a powerful black man.  Whether you want to  break me in or have me already broken, I like spanking, slapping, choking, being leashed, worshiping cock, and your cum. So, here's the role:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/sMuDXqD\n\nI've just completing my nursing degree, and dedicated a year of my life doing missionary work in Togo. The first month has been an incredible experience. My supervisor Dr. Allen is a great mentor who truely cares about the people of Togo.\n\nOf course, it was my first experience being a minority. Most of my colleagues are African girls with a high school diploma. They have been fascinated by my red hair and pale skin.  Some were not shy about touching it.  Even in the local market, heads turn seeing someone so different. Kids sometimes pinch me, as if making some new discovery. Once or twice, one yelled Shaneti Moto and laughed, which confused me, but they were quickly scolded by their mothers.\n\nMy third month there a man in warrior attire that stared at me as though I were prey. With one hand he held his loin cloth, as if waiting to unsheathe his massive African snake.  With his other hand, he pointed downward and sternly said, \"Kneel, Shaneti Moto.\" For a brief moment, I felt my knees buckle in his presence, but I turned away pretending to be offended, dismissing him as a fool.\n\nI told a Dr. Allen a G-version of my encounter, who discounted it as nothing until I asked, \"What's Shaneti Moto?\"  The teenage nurses giggled. Dr. Allen eventually broke the awkward silence that followed.\n\n\"Shaneti Moto means Fire Devil. Togo has been a poor nation for it's entire recorded history. But they have a legend that the local Kaybe tribe was once the wealthiest in Africa. However, they were ruined by a pale-skinned, fire-headed tribe with from the sea.  Vikings might be an explaination. Regardless, the Kaybe tribe believes the Shaneti Moto put a curse on the nation that can be undone by forcing a female from the 'Fire Devils' to submit to their leader--the god-king.\"\n\nHe looked up from his glasses. \" I imagine your beautiful red hair resembles the supposed fire-headed people of the sea. But the educated people here know all superstitious non-sense. And the Kaybe tribe doesn't have any real power in the city.  You have nothing to worry about.\"\n\nA week later I found out he could never be so wrong.  The Kaybe tribe had full control of the government and military. And one day a somber Dr. Allen held an official letterhead head.\n\n\"Madison, I have bad news... you have a new responsibility.... and a new outfit you need to wear.\" Again, the nurses giggled.  Dr. Allen didn't scolded them or, strangly, even seem upset.... \n\nIf interested.. Tell me the news and my new my white-slave outfit ;)",

Besides the 10 Cockmandments, recited and *drilled* in at dawn \u2014 or whenever morning glory rises and needs some spit shining \u2014 that's about it. After all, with cock rammed down the throat so far that stomachs feel like bulging out even before the torrent of cum fills it up, what else is there to life? \n\nI'm sure that's the thought running through my head when we first met, out on that door step with such dizzying excitement between my slickened legs. Ugh, I just couldn't wait to get started...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCock in the morning, if lips aren't sealed around it there's going to be a lack of air for at least the next 20 minutes while throats are pounded purple. Then a lovely little pink cushion follows, provided the cage is unlocked. Trust me, it's needed... for the knees. So yes, kneeded. (I'm hilarious when horny.)\n\nThat cushion is, of course, only if being yanked by the hair into the shower to serve as a fucktoy and human \u2014 really, human? Let's be honest, that title was long lost \u2014 isn't first. Then, and only then is it down, knees first, onto the cushion with a mouth wide open and throat ready to receive, right beneath the jutted out sink. The idea behind it is to really get that glow going whilst tidying up and looking good.\n\nBreakfast is next, delicious delicious protein each and every morning. Fresh and rich, basically what is lived on. The work for it, by now, is a little harder. But that never stopped anybody. Sucking, licking, and if allowed, even a little teasing to get those beads of precum rolling. Smeared on the face with a couple slaps if time is running short, one can't dilly dally too much when working their best to make sure pleasure is had whilst consuming a meal. Besides, without a little motivation with a couple slaps, what sense of time and urgency would ever be had when the meal is about to finish and... well, at least for the one under the table, a little warning is warranted. Otherwise disappointment ensues. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou get the idea of my schedule? A little vague, a little all over the place I'm sure, so let me make it clear because trust me, excitement is the reason why half these words before I've done a re-run have little red lines underneath (thank cock for spellcheck. Cock, because it's going to be worshipped like a god. The only cockdamned god in the house)\n\nCock is life. There is no sensation that compares to the expansion of the throat as meat is rammed down at a nearly break-neck pace. Pleasure, from having holes \u2014 that's all one is at this point \u2014 being repeated worn away and stretched to their limit, I can only pray for more each day. And trust me, that prayer isn't just some metaphorical wordplay. (Lips and tongue ready!) I simply adore the way that bodies bend and minds break when it comes to cock. And yes, the multiple and plural there does indeed mean what it implies. Multiple minds and bodies, broken on a single, magnificent, glorious godlick (or is it like?) cock. Men, women, none can stand \u2014 because their either kneeling, lying or bent over like common fuckpets \u2014 before it. \n\nBut, if that doesn't paint a picture, then how about this?\n\n***\n\nI woke up with a grin, for once it was not the rattling of the cage that had stirred me from my slumber. Not that the situation made me any less horny, the blood rushing down between my legs and nipples stiffening at the thought of the morning debauchery to indulge in. I hardly contained a moan, reach a hand down between my legs to give a quick press. And said hand to my fingers, for an equally quick taste. I could see why you loved it between my legs.\n\nThe bedsheets went flying \u2014 perhaps a flair for the dramatic \u2014 as I sprung up.\n\n\"Wakey wakey cockslave, it's time to open up!\"\n\nOh, I suppose it is a little ambiguous. Here, let me make it clear.\n\nThe cage rattled and whacked open against the wall. I reached in and yanked you out by the hair, strips of light rushing by before a knee pushed against your chin and **my massive member** skid across your lips.\n\n\"Or have you forgotten your duties already?\" \n\nLooks like you got a rough day ahead.\n",

Some kinks I\u2019d most like to explore are, whippings, bindings, forced sex with men, forced sex with women, power play, blackmail. None of these are a must but please let me know if something is a hard limit. I\u2019m not looking for total submission, I prefer reluctant submission. \n\nMy ideal partner will have few or no limits. ",

            "selftext": "The underwear had been a gift on Valentines Day. I don't know where they'd come from, but they soon proved to be one of my favourite toys in our toybox.\n\nConsider vibrating panties. They're great; they give someone else the ability to tease you in public, get you all riled up and unable to do anything about it, and the ability to make you cum without anyone else knowing. \n\nBut they're a little limited. They can only vibrate, only give you focused stimulation, and the controls are limited; how strong a vibration, and when do they occur. \n\nThe panties are different. When I wear them, he - or whoever he gives control to, because he's done that in the past - has complete access to my nethers. Just like with the vibrating panties, they can tease me, make me cum, but they can also fuck me, fill me with a cock while I'm walking around in public, fuck deep into my pussy and, occasionally, leave a load in me, while I'm powerless to do anything about it. \n\nYou see why I like them? \n\n***\n\nHi there! I'm Annie. \n\nI read a story ages ago about a similar concept: someone was cursed, and whenever they sat or laid down, they felt a mouth or a cock on them. It drove them crazy, being teased all the time, feeling a phantom cock that they couldn't do anything about. And the idea was so hot to me. \n\nBeing fucked, in public, where nobody would be any the wiser? Or having someone go down on you while you're standing in line at a coffee shop? Or feeling a new load get deposited inside you while you're sitting in a lecture, failing to stay focused? Count me in! \n\nI'd love to hear about how you'd tease me, and what kind of stimulating I'd receive from you. Also, while the title mentions Daddy, I'm happy for any gender to play! \n\nKinks: cumplay, public sex, orgasm denial, teasing, exhibitionism, big dicks, D/s. \n\nLimits: toilet, feet, incest.",

            "selftext": "(I'm suffering from a pretty serious oral fixation right now. Soooooooo here's the attempt to rectify the situation...xD) \n\nWhen you'd first taken me, I'd refused to suck your cock.\n\nI mean, I'd refused to do a lot of things, at first. After all, you'd kidnapped me from my Starbucks run, brought me to your apartment, and kept me tightly bound and gagged unless I was eating or drinking or, you had hoped, sucking your cock.\n\nBut I wouldn't suck your cock. \n\nOver the past two years or so you'd morphed me into a much more malleaable pet. There were no longer any escape attempts; I'd tried, and failed, on multiple occasions, and been punished soundly for it. You'd brought me back to heel with manipulatively kind words, stroking my pussy and my breasts and my lips around the gag, whispering about how *good* you could make me feel, if only I'd just submit.\n\nThe first time I'd orgasmed at your hands had been six months in exactly. You'd wanted to celebrate our anniversary, you said, wasn't I glad? I'd glared at you over the gag, not knowing, not then, just how precious orgasms could be.\n\nYou don't let me cum very often, but I'm never not horny, not anymore. Little egg vibrators on low taped to my clit, porn playing with me bound up and watching, fucking machines on slow, your own beautiful rough tongue lapping for hours and hours along my sodden lips only to pat me gently and walk away, these have been the hallmarks of our so-called 'relationship' together...\n\n...and still I refuse to suck your cock.\n\nAs ever, your approach to solving this problem has been gentle, but unyieldingly firm. (Like your cock.) You had brought in a Sybian, tied my ankles to my thighs so I couldn't lift myself off of it, and then took out a clever harness-type device. It bound me to your cock; you'd put in the ring gag (I'd learned not to fight you when you bound me; it hadn't ended well in the past) and tied the straps around your waist, so I was stuck with your cock in my mouth, helpless to get off of it.\n\nAnd then you let me *cum*.\n\nI hadn't expected that. I thought the Sybian would turn off when I got close, like usual, but it didn't, I came with your cock in my mouth.\n\nAnd then again the next day.\n\nAnd the next.\n\nAnd the next.\n\nAnd for two months you let me cum *every single day*, but only with your cock in my mouth, only tied to you. And then you stopped teasing me altogether. Every day you bound me tightly and turned on porn and left me there for hours, and wouldn't let me cum, and told me, that if I wanted to cum again, all I had to do was say, \"Master, please may I suck your cock?\" And the next time I had to really suck it, had to go for it, not just kneel there, but pleasure you as you pleasured me.\n\nI held out a long time, but three months is a long time to go without orgasm when there's nothing else to do but watch other people have them. It's dinnertime. I'm bound kneeling, as per usual, my ankles tied to my thighs, my arms in an armbinder behind me. There's a leash attached to my collar, tied to the table leg; I'm naked, of course, my nipples hard with need and lust. \n\nYou're naked from the waist down, making sure I'm positioned so I can see your cock. I can always see your cock. And I can't help but realize that I'm fucking drooling at the sight of it, licking over my lips, shifting from side to side in lustful agony, remembering how it tastes, how it feels in my mouth...And I'm squirming, and staring at it, and it looks like orgasms and cumming and the memory of the Sybian and I can't fucking take this anymore.\n\n\"Master...please may I suck your cock?\" I ask, cheeks flaming, looking down at the floor.\n\n--------------\n\n(Please message me with your age and jump right into the roleplay. I am looking for a gentle, patronizing, firm dom. I do not like to be hit or degraded, just led gently but with no room for debate or questioning or discussion. &lt;3 And do NOT message me with incest. Thanks!!) ",

            "selftext": "\n\nYou weren't quite sure why you'd decided to buy that old disc player at the Antique Store. For one, the thing was covered in dust and probably hadn't been used in- what? Ten years? Fifteen, maybe? Did they even have discs to play back then?\n\nBut you had to think, with a price tag like five dollars who wouldn't purchase something to use their movie collection on? I mean, that is why you bought it- you're a huge fan of movies. You've got a bunch of posters on your wall, and an entire shelf of your favorites in your home. But the disc player that came with your TV recently broke, and you'd seen the listing online that this place was selling one for cheap. But it looked a little different than you'd imagined.\n\nIt looked older than the picture had portrayed, and there was no discernable company of origin, just a lot of weird symbols carved into the front. The attendant at the Antique Store seemed a little too eager to get rid of it, but whatever, it was a steal, wasn't it?\n\nYou brought it home and promptly set up the device, eager to watch some movies. But what you didn't know was that this player had a strange ability- anyone who viewed a movie on it was transported into the movie. But not only that, the movies they were sucked into were highly-eroticized versions of their normal selves. Sex was everywhere, if not overtaking and altering most of the main plot of the film. The person who had entered the movie took the place of the central protagonist, but was transported from scene to scene. Only by going through the movie and finishing it could one escape the movie, though they would by that point have had sex a ludicrous amount of times...\n\nWhich movie will you watch and unknowingly enter?\n\n(Note: these movie genres are loosely based off of various films, but they're just parodies, so don't expect the true characters, actors, dialogue, etc. from the selections, they're purely jokes on genre source material. Each \"scene\" is like a snippet of the movie I've come up with, and upon completing a \"scene,\" the person is moved in to the next one with little to no context. You'll have to figure it out as you go along! )\n\n**Spy Movie:**\n*You'd think being an internationally famous super-spy would be some kind of a contradiction.*\n\nScene 1: Meet with the Contact at the Casino.\n\nScene 2: Fight off the Henchmen at the Yacht.\n\nScene 3: Confront the Evil Mastermind at the top of the Volcano.\n\n**Science-Fiction Movie:**\n*The kind of movie nerds love to hate. Or, at least, pretend to.*\n\nScene 1: Find the Android with the Battle Plans.\n\nScene 2: Meet with the General of the Humanity Resistance.\n\nScene 3: Defeat the Alien Invaders.\n\n**Horror Movie:**\n*Occasionally written so badly that you just have to side with the crazies and the killers sometimes.*\n\nScene 1: Escape the Maniac's game.\n\nScene 2: Defeat the Maniac.\n\nScene 3: Find and Defeat the Book of Evil Spirits.\n\n**Buddy-Cop Movie:**\n*Be prepared to get away with so much more than a police officer could actually accomplish. People forgive it as long as you get the bad guy in the end, usually.*\n\nScene 1: Meet your new Partner.\n\nScene 2: Find out from the Gang Member where the big stash is.\n\nScene 3: Defeat and Subdue the Gang Leader.\n\n**Comedy Movie:**\n*The kind of story that usually glorifies bad behavior as long as it elicits a chuckle. Adam Sandler not included.*\n\nScene 1: Realize you're about to get married, and break up with your other girlfriend.\n\nScene 2: Travel cross-country to make it to your wedding on time while staying (mostly) faithful.\n\nScene 3: Arrive just in time to get married.\n\n**War Movie:**\n*A heartfelt and true-to-life movie of soldiers who fight through hell and back. Didn't actually happen, even if the prologue says 'based on true events.'*\n\nScene 1: Say goodbye to your Spouse.\n\nScene 2: Hide from the Enemy.\n\nScene 3: Defeat the Enemy General and win the war.\n\n**Superhero Movie:**\n*Focus-tested and fun for the whole family. Won't win any Oscars, but there are good looking celebrities in tight suits, so it's gonna be popular.*\n\nScene 1: Meet your new Superhero squadmates.\n\nScene 2: Go through intense Superhero Training.\n\nScene 3: Defeat the Big Bad  Villain.\n\n\n**Adventure Movie:**\n*A danger-filled, triumphant story based on totally misunderstanding or exaggerating exotic cultures. But there's treasure too!*\n\nScene 1: Meet the other members of your archeological team.\n\nScene 2: Fight off the Rival Military Explorers and get to the Temple.\n\nScene 3: Use the Relic of the Jungle on the Tribe Leader and Escape.\n\n\n\n**Fantasy Movie:**\n*A high-fantasy world of magic, knights, and conveniently beautiful locations in New Zealand.*\n\nScene 1: Convince the bartender at the Tavern to give you a room for the night.\n\nScene 2: Resist the Enchanted Sprites' teasing \n\nScene 3: Defeat the Evil Magician at the top of The Tower of Darkness.\n\n\n\n(As a note, we can discuss any kind of kinks or otherwise beforehand. If you've read this far, please put the title as whatever movie you'd like to play inside and we can talk about it from there! I would also greatly appreciate it if you provide your preferred gender and sexuality, so I can make the scenes even better for you. I'm willing to play with anybody, so first come first serve!)\n\n",

Marry for money. Assets appreciate over time.\"  \nSo she hadn't gone clubbing, or hit up tinder. She'd signed up for 'Seeking Arrangements'. For their first meeting, she picked out a pretty summer dress, the light cotton fabric hanging from her slender, toned frame. She let her fluffy brunette hair hang free around her face, framing cute young features. High heels gave her a much needed height boost, her ample breasts juddering as she walked.  \nHe hadn't gone to nearly as much trouble. Why would he? He had what she wanted, and he knew it...  \n\n2. She didn't know anyone at the party. Her husband had been an embarrassment all night, right up to the point he passed out on the couch. When they started passing a bowl around she didn't quite get what was happening, especially after they fished her husband's keys out of his comatose pockets to add to the collection....  \n\n3.

Torn black jeans clung to her slender legs, a white singlet top barely lighter than her pale skin cupping b-cup breasts. \"Add this one word to your profile to double your wages.\" The word?

            "selftext": "You were an aspiring relic hunter, tracking down one of your very first leads on an artifact that would be able to set you up for life. The fact that you had even gotten a lead like this was enough to get to excited, but the possibility that it might even be real had you fantasizing of untold riches and what you would do with them. So you went dungeon diving, chasing after myth, and fighting off whatever got in your way. You were good, but it was a challenge. Whatever was in here, someone clearly wanted guarded.\n\nWhen you finally reached the room said to contain your holy grail, it wasn't obvious at first that there was anything to find. You knew better than that. The best way to hide something was in plain sight. You found the false wall, defeated the skeletal mage guarding the treasure in the back, as grabbed the locked box - a sizeable one, at that. Something big was in there. You got out of the dungeon with the box as fast as you could, taking it back to the tavern and locking the door to your room.\n\nInside, you pried the box open and stuck your hand inside, intending to study your treasure. There was nothing solid in it, but your hand hit an odd resistance. It was warm, a little wet, and gave under your pressure. Too late, you realized what you were feeling. As you tried to pull your hand away, you felt a pinprick on your finger. A drop of blood entered the material, and you cursed as your hand left the box.\n\nA moment later, your suspicions were confirmed as the material inside the box started to boil and take shape. It rose slowly out of the box in a dull blue color, forming into the upper half of a beautiful, voluptuous woman. Your breath stopped as it took on a near perfect human shape - smoldering eyes accenting a gently lined face, 'hair' flowing down the length of its body, and two breasts the size of your head sitting on a small frame.\n\nIt was a living slime. Designed by crazed magi to be the perfect servants, slimes were expensive and searched for even in the highest circles of society. They were loyal, malleable, took any order given to them and performed it with glee, and legendary sexual companions. An unbonded slime was worth enough money for several lifetimes.\n\nThere was only one problem though. When you had stuck your hand in the box, it had bonded with you. The only way to sever that bond was death. Your death.\n\nIt looks like you had a slime.",

I have been sat there while he wanks it on the sofas, I have come home to find him fucking girl all over the place. \n\nIt is his place and he owns it, plus I pay a tiny amount of rent so I put up with it.

Hair was pulled back into a tight braid. She was looking into a frame... a mirror. \n\nBut on the other side of the Mirror, her reflection was bare, nude, Oiled and shining. Her hair was in a messy ponytail, her neck locked in a rigid black collar, her makeup smudged and running - another kudos to the production team. \n\nThe two reflections were connected by a red cord, connecting between rings in each of their noses. The crowd erupted into soft applause at the display. \n\nWhat a marvelous way to showcase. What rare goods. Really... Twins!",

I hope everyone is having a wonderful morning\u2014I've found myself with more than a bit of free-time this Saturday and figured I'd be able to curb my boredom with DPP. Some of my correspondences from before have either fell short, disappeared, or been deleted? Though I do have some faithful ones remaining.\n\nAnyways, I'm seeking a roleplay. Something that will give me a bit of an outlet for my fantasies. I'm looking for something long-term, descriptive and well-written\u2014in which I mean: good grammar and more than a few simple sentences. I'm looking to get filthy, come make me choke on your cock.\n\nI have a thing for older and married men\u2014though a charming, handsome, well-spoken and educated man my age always has its appeal.\n\nA few of my kinks include: anal, assplay, ageplay, creampie, cumplay, impregnation, risk of impregnation, throat-fucking, violence, gangbang, choking, spanking, hair-pulling, corruption, coercion, gagging, praise, public sex, clothed sex, rough sex, oral, cock worship, incest, cheating and even more ;-)\n\nMy only hard limits are scat and gore\u2014I'm open to anything else!\n\nI'm willing use other means of messages such as kik or WhatsApp as well.\n\nSend your prompts! Or perhaps you've already written something out? Don't be shy.\n\nMaybe you're the pastor at my church\u2014over the years you've watched me blossom from a innocent, wide-eyed child who faithfully attended service into a rebellious young woman who'd rather do anything but spend a Sunday at the church. Perhaps I come to confession and you decide to take advantage? Or maybe my parents have asked you to help guide me but your desires clash with morals...\n\nOr perhaps your my professor\u2014I caught your eye the first day I entered your classroom, one of the few students who seems enthusiastic about listening to your lectures and the only student's name you've bothered to remember this term. You enjoy speaking with me after classes\u2014someone who actually engages you and even seems to flirt with you. You know you shouldn't make a move, what with the age difference and the fact you've been married for over 12 years now...\n\nOr maybe you're lonely and you've finally decided to give in to Tinder\u2014all the guys at work can't seem to start singing the app's praises. You've been divorced five years now and have decided getting back there is a good idea\u2014when you find my profile, you're immediately intrigued...\n\nMaybe you're my boyfriend's father and when you meet me you begin to have fantasies about being with me, you wonder if you imagine the fleeting glances filled with longing, the way I seem to \"accidentally\" brush against you whenever we're in close proximity. You are attracted to not only my body, but my personality, my intellect, and the fact that I'm so young. You can't help but want to possess me for your own...\n\nOr perhaps we meet out at a party, maybe I'm not sober and you notice me checking you out. You debate with yourself, being older\u2014supposedly supervising your daughter's welcoming home party from finishing her first year of college, you shouldn't be debating taking advantage of a drunk college girl with your with sleeping just up the stairs..\n\nThose are just a few ideas, I have more. Send me your replies, your thoughts, your stories... Anything! Don't make [me](http://m.imgur.com/SZqM3g0) wait too long (';",

            "selftext": "\"Oh well. Must have run off.\"\n\nThose were my mother's last words, right before the shaft of an arrow sprouted from her neck. Papa always said that that was \"hardly the first shaft in her throat,\" whatever that means. He only stayed around a few years after that. Apparently, the line at Whiterun's general store is *really* long, because he said he was just getting lockpicks.\n\nEither way, I'm nearing an age where I don't really have a place in Riften's orphanage anymore, so I suppose I should set off on my own, try to make a name for myself. I mean, aside from Sophie, which is... w-well, my name. Oh, uh, I'm Sophie, by the way! As you can see, I'm quite small, only about 4'11 in Imperial Measurements. Papa always told me not to use those, because he was a Stormcloak, but oh well.\n\nOh, you want me to describe myself...? Th-that's a bit weird, I mean, you're standing right in front of me. Oh, geez, are you blind? That would be *awful*. B-but okay... I have dirty-blonde hair past my shoulders, as well as full, pouty lips, and a cute button nose. I've got pretty wide hips, and my eyes are an opalescent ice-blue. My skin is sorta pale, especially for a cute lil' Breton like me!\n\nSo, I don't suppose you know what kind of adventures I could get up to?\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nHey DPP! Sorry for the length, it ended up being more awkward than I was prepared for. Hope it makes you laugh!\n\nAnyway, if it isn't obvious, I'm in the mood for a Skyrim-themed RP tonight! I was playing it in VR, and I realized just how many beautiful, amazing places it's wilderness holds. So many good cliffsides where I'll have an amazing view while you fuck my body like a toy.\n\nI left the topic very broad, because I love to build prompts with my partners one-on-one. So if you have an idea, however vague, feel free to message me! Or if you don't have an idea, feel free to message me! I've got plenty! \n\nI will be playing myself, the cutie I described above. You could be another human, or orc, or Khajiit, or Troll, or Dragon, or anything that suits your fancy!\n\nI prefer long-term, story-based RPs. My ideal RP is about 60/40 story/sex. Instead of listing out kinks I like, I'm gonna recommend you look over my [kinklist.](https://i.imgur.com/lLnDIWS.png) If it isn't obvious, I'm a sub. I can also do romance, but there unfortunately isn't a dominant bone in my body, 'cept hopefully yours.\n\nMy only limits, and I really do mean my *only* limits, are scat, vomit, farting, and sexual gore. Gore for the purpose of a story is highly encouraged! I also don't rim, but I don't mind getting rimmed if that's your thing! Absolutely *any* other fetish you can come up with is on the table, but I reserve the right to veto stuff, of course!\n\nI look forward to seeing those little orange envelopes!",

You had comic books, video games, and Dungeons and Dragons when every other kid had footballs, bikes and magazines. You attended conventions, cosplayed, and did all sorts of nerdy stuff.\n\n Of course, nowadays, geeky is popular!\n\nYou knew that going in to these huge comic conventions. All the girls wearing those costumes; quite the place to pick them up, huh?\n\nAt some point, though, you realized you could pretty much have any girl at these conventions. You decided you'd even make a game out of it, to see how many geeky girls you could fuck, raw. You made it your mission to impregnate every girl cosplaying at the convention.\n\nSuperheroes, Anime characters, Video Game characters; nobody was safe from your cock and your baby batter. So get fucking! Time is running out, and you've got a challenge to beat...\n\nHey DPP! I'd like to play a bunch of small scenes of you fucking cute girls in all sorts of displays at a Comic Convention. The catch? You've gotta creampie and impregnate each one! Seduce them, rape them, or do whatever you can to get into their pants. You can choose what they're wearing and how they look, too! \n\nOld? Young? White? Black? Hispanic? Asian? Teen? Milf? Futa? You decide!\n\n(Note: I'm totally fine playing with or opposite to a Futa/trans/dickgirl!)",

Well, aside from the fact that you're a human, dating an [anthro](https://static1.e621.net/data/5c/ca/5cca7e48c8401f58ba06ffa1f5f51e7a.jpg). Aside from that little interspecies quirk, we seem like the usual pair. You're taller than I am, and a little (or a lot, depending on who you ask) more masculine. I border on petite at 5'5\", work in a floral shop, and possess a much more gentle, all-around \"smoother\" physique. There's really no doubt in anyone's mind which of us is the top and which is the bottom. If our different body types and personalities didn't give it away, the way that you hold me, hug me from behind, and occasionally take a furtive glance at my ass certainly makes it clear.\n\nBut the true nature of our bedroom conduct is *far* from what anyone could expect. Out of all of our friends, only one or two know what really goes on behind closed doors. In fact, the only one that I know for sure is fully aware of the *predicament* you're in is Jacob, and he only knows because of what he saw. He showed up out our place one night a few months ago, *way* too drunk to drive, and pleaded with us to let him just stay the night so he wouldn't have to walk all the way across town. As good a friend as he is to both of us, we of course let him stay. It was just a few hours later that, in his drunken search for the bathroom, he stumbled into our bedroom closet, where he found our collection of leashes, collars, toys... everything. So he knows for sure... Especially since the collars were all clearly sized to fit *you.*\n\nTo put it simply, even though *I'm* the canine of the house, and despite the fact that *you're* the big, handsome, manly top, *you're my puppy.*\n\nIt's a relaxing, quiet Saturday afternoon today. I've been roaming the house, engaging in my beloved pass-time of tidying up, watering the plants, and so on. You're sitting on the couch, catching up on your YouTube subscriptions. You don't even notice when I vanish for half an hour. You don't think twice when you hear me quietly padding back into the room, casually coming to stand behind you. You only finally realize what's going on when, with a *click!* I snap my favorite collar around your neck, the soft fabric snug around your throat, and the little, pink, heart-shaped name tag dangling and tinkling like a tiny bell.\n\nYou feel my muzzle just beside your head as I lean down, my whiskers tickling at your ear. In a loving, playful, yet ever so slightly mischievous tone, I whisper to you. \"Hey there, puppy. Wanna play?\"\n\n---\n\nHey there, puppy! :D Thanks for reading!\n\nSo allow me to summarize. I'll be playing as Alex, your anthro canine boyfriend. You'll be playing as my human partner. You're clearly the top in our relationship, and I'm the bottom, but there's a lot more going on in terms of our sexual dynamics. Specifically, despite the fact that I'm generally more \"submissive\" in a public setting, I'm definitely the dom when it comes to sex. To be even more specific, we get into pet play, with me as your master and you as my pet \"puppy.\"\n\nNow, even though I'm the dominant partner, I'd be playing as a relatively gentle dom. I give my puppy lots of pets, scritches, and treats for being such a good boy. Aside from that gentle, loving approach to the dom/sub dynamic, I'm happy to play out the pet play aspect to various lengths, depending on what you're interested in. This could range anywhere from you still being allowed to walk on two feet and speak, to being forced to be on all fours and prohibited from making any sounds that a dog wouldn't (barking, growling, yelping, whimpering, etc.).\n\nKinks: anthro, interspecies, dom/sub, loving dom, dominant bottom and submissive top, pet play, praise for good behavior, oral (giving and receiving), rimming (though this isn't necessary at all), hands-free orgasm, impressive endowment (for your character), moderately excessive cum\n\nLimits: blood, bathroom, vomit, etc. (If you're curious, just ask!)\n\nIf you're interested, send me a PM! Tell me a bit about your character, the kinks and limits you'd like to include, any ideas you have, and any questions you'd like answered. I hope that at least a few of you good boys are interested in burying your bone in my backyard. &lt;3",

Who, without care or caution, it seems, have wandered in to your little tavern by the crossroads, plunked down a sack of coin and, for some reason, what seems like a dragon's tongue, and have made themselves thoroughly at home. Sure, they keep whispering and nodding over at you, and you can catch the lady of the pair making those distinct, curvy lines in the air with both hands that seem uncomfortably like your own silhouette. And the gentleman seems to be nodding now, and, *oh no,* now they're both looking in your direction.\n\nGranted, you've found the odd orc wandering in, looking to make advances, before a quick frying pan to the side of the head sorted that out. And then there's the occasional drunken lout who - *oh gods, they're walking up to the bar* - wants to toss in a copper to have your top off, but these two. *Well.* It's scandalous; here's no way a proper elf lass like yourself would ever -\n\n\"Wanna sleep with us?\"\n\nOne of the knights grins, tossing you a shameless grin, violet eyes sparkling with unwholesome glee under a shock of helmet-tangled black hair. She's leaning halfway over the bar, just *leering* at you, and - and she just *said* that! *That!* \n\n\"*Please* do excuse my companion, she gets that way when she sees a cute one,\" the other slides in smoothly, cocking his head at you and flashing a smile, his sword strapped roguishly across his hip. \"I *am* in full agreement though, even if she *is* a beast with no notion of restraint or civility.\"\n\nThe first huffs indignantly, leaning in with a conspiratorial gleam in her eye. \"Don't listen to *him*,\" she purrs. \"C'mon - close up the bar, we've got plenty for a room, and let's just *f-*\"\n\n\"*Fill* the night with amusements and charm,\" the second knight finishes with a grin, brown eyes twinkling with much the same enthusiasm. \"A win for everyone, really - you *are* cute, and *quite* our type, so, if you might wish to set aside your busyness for the night...\"\n\nThere's no stopping them now. Somehow they're *both* leaning over the bar, now, and you can feel the tips of your ears flush bright pink as thoughts swirl through your mind. Maybe, if you were to flip the sign on the door over, and you could just see if they were friendly, you could -\n\n\"*Fuck*,\" the lady insists, and the gentleman, too, nods his assent, as they both take you by the hand. \n\n*Oh, gods.*       \n\n---\n\nI have a single, very specific scene in mind here, in which a cute elven barmaid gets a good, old-fashioned fuck from two charming, banter-loving knights who very much enjoy being quite unchivalrous from time to time. Suggestions and adjustments are welcome, and I'm always looking to play! \n\n[DPP Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/5smcxm/m4f_snuggles_and_sex_or_just_snuggles_or_just_sex/) ",

We can play where it's a surprise, maybe it's well known to you, this is all up for discussion. A part of my weird kink is I want your character to be much larger in height and weight, but much more realistic downstairs (for the guys, obviously). A little confusing, but we like what we like, right?\n\nSo my kinks include: all of the above, panties/lingerie, anal, cumplay (I cum a lot), cock worship (mine), and medium-rough sex.

            "selftext": "Hi there, I'm here to bring two RP topics for you: breeding and transformation. They can be separate, but mixing them together is even better. However, I'll explain them separately.\n\nGirls and then couples get a bit of priority since I don't many chances to RP with them, but I will respond to pretty much everyone that sends an decent message. Please send a more the just one sentence.\n\nAlso if this doesn't appeal to you, I have a few other prompts in my post history that I'd be up for playing too.\n\n*****\n\n**Breeding**\n\nI'm a very small girl, and the idea of being swollen up with a big belly turns me on for some reason. It just feels like what my body was meant to do. Maybe it's the finality of it; there are huge consequences to getting knocked up, which is part of what makes it so hot to me. A couple of other things that could make it more exciting: You could knock me up against my will, but of course I'd actually be loving it. Also, you could be of another race (I'm Asian) and make a beautiful mixed baby. I could have twins or more, making my belly stretch to a comical size on my little frame. We could do some play involving lactation induced from the pregnancy. Lastly, I could be kept for repeated breeding, constantly pregnant, a breeding slave; that's what turns me on most.\n\n*****\n\n**Transformation**\n\nFirst thing, I don't want any futa transformation. That said, pretty much everything else is on the table. You can transform me any way you want. The more realistic path would be through normal body mods like tattoos or piercings, making me work out a lot to get super toned and fit, hair cut/style/color. You could even go to extremes grounded in reality. Extreme surgical modifications are definitely on the table; In the most extreme case, maybe you'd even have all my limbs amputated, turning me into a human body pillow. But if you want to go out of the realm of natural possibility, that's fine too. Use magic or crazy sci-fi to change and shape me into your wildest imagination and your heart's desire. I want to become the picture of your perfect girl.\n\n*****\n\nOne last thing, please put your name in addition to the title of your message so I can keep messages straight and also so I know you're a diligent reader.\n\nP.S. - Check out /r/Maso_Miranda for other prompts",

            "selftext": "We've all read a few fairy tales in our times, yes?\n\nOne of the more common tropes one finds in folklore, fables and fairy tales - cross culturally... it's almost ubiquitous in human storytelling, it seems - is what I've taken to calling, for the sake of articulating my slightly abstract kinks, the \"Prince Charming Dynamic.\" \n\nY'all know this dynamic well: beautiful, young maiden - often a princess - finds herself in trouble. Trapped up a tower, imprisoned by a dragon, cursed to sleep until true love's first kiss and so on. Prince Charming saves her and the two get married and live happily ever after. It's cute and romantic... but also predictable. Did you ever notice that Prince Charming *always* gets the girl? Why do you think that is? More pressingly, what is the [implication](https://media.giphy.com/media/IwYkkg4L7tX1K/giphy.gif) of the fact Prince Charming always gets the girl? \n\nOne needs to remember that fairy tales are the product of the societies in which they were written, *ancient* societies that - at least in the European and Middle Eastern context, I can't speak to Africa or Asia with much authority - had codified, *legal* standards of \"duty copulation.\" A married woman literally COULDN'T, per the terms of a marriage contract, refuse consent to her husband. Marital rape didn't exist. Wives were *obligated* to give their bodies to their men in exchange for his seeing to her material needs. The reason the Prince always gets the Princess in the end? Why, that man risked his life to save her... she was duty bound to give herself to him. \n\n... and - whore for degradation and submission that I am - I find that *sexy*. \n\nSo, what I'm looking for is the transplanting of that Prince Charming Dynamic into modern times and - again, it's me, lovable Lisa - for a partner who wants to crank it up to eleven and go a bit slapstick with it. I'd like for you to play a high school senior - Princes came of age, were permitted to take the throne, at fifteen... really warps your perception of Disney movies to know the princesses were likely about fourteen-ish, amirite? - who, rather than being Mr. Charming is Mr. Asshole-Alpha. High school bully type. A big, strong, arrogant asshole who saves my character from a variety of dangerous situations - I've a few ideas we can discuss - and rather than claiming her hand in marriage in the aftermath like a *good* man would he... well... claims her body and smashes box ;P\n\nSo, I'm looking for a long term penpal - someone willing to claim breeding rights over many, many women he rescues from various situations - whose capable of playing our thuggish Anti-Hero with a high level of literacy. Check out my backlog of prompts and you'll find quite a lot of IC ones to give you an idea of what I mean by literate *and* an introduction to my writing. As a last request: I adore talking about character dynamics so please be willing to have long conversations about the nuances of D/s stuff OOC :)\n\nOutlined below you'll find two sets of kinks: first will be the ones that I'd like included in the story and second are some I'd MAYBE like included in the story for the right partner or circumstances. If you'd like to include this second set you'll need to discuss them with me first so we can make them work. Please include those kinks from the second group in the title of your DM when you message me if interested.\n\nSo, that's it! I look forward to playing with you and seeing your envelopes, boys! Tell me all about how you picturex\n\nKinks: Alpha Males, assholeish men, sizequeening, breeding, dirty talk, rough sex, cock worship, facial/titjobs/cumshots EVERYWHERE, big loads, multiple loads, D/s, anal, slutty outfits, adultery/cuckoldry, degradation, public sex/hold-the-moan\n\nMAYBE Kinks: \"She's dressed like a slut so she deserves it\" dub-con, raceplay",

I usually like writing more in-depth and creative prompts and post them here in hopes of finding someone. But today I just don't really have a specific or super original idea. I just really like tentacles. I'd be down for a simple \"Oh no, a tentacle monster\" roleplay, and I'd also be down for something more in-depth, unusual, and/or long-term. \n\nMaybe you're my slightly monster-ish boyfriend? Or you're my normal boyfriend and the magic tentacle pet you bought for our funtimes is a little more than you thought you could handle? Maybe I'm a slime-girl and you're an eldritch entity, and you want nothing more than to rest your garish and phallic limbs inside my cool, malleable body? It's honestly your choice. I'm open to any prompts that involve tentacles. So stuff me and my inbox with your tentacles and tentacle-focused ideas. Thanks!\n\nI guess actual limits wouldn't hurt since I already added proper OOC information. Pee, poop, actual, thorough animals, and children. Open to almost anything else.",

I didn't know what we were doing was called sex, I didn\"t even know that its something you're not supposed to do with your siblings.\n\nThis is just a basic premise for the RP I'm looking for. Basically I want to play a dumb, innocent and naiive younger sister that you usefor whatever you want.\n\nKinks: Huge cock, anal, throatfucking, spanking, dirty talk.\n\nSo, won't you play with me big brother?",

Well, it really says 'linic' but you can still see the outline of the first C, so you get the meaning. \n\nYou're still not sure why you were sent here to receive your specialist exam, but, whatever, it was an actual doctor who made the recommendation, so you step forward and try the handle, expecting it to be locked. Instead it turns easily in your hand, what appears to be a very heavy door swinging open with ease, showing you a sign, roughly painted on the wall indicating you go to the right for the waiting room. \n\nYou shrug, following the signs advice and push open the next door, walking into what may as well be another world. A thick, plush carpet cushions your footsteps, the walls lined with padded red leather, with very comfortable looking chairs pushed up against them. \n\nBefore you, a large wooden desk with a computer screen and a small brass bell that reads 'ring for assistance'. \n\nSince you made it all this way, you ring the bell, and a few moments later, a door swings open silently, and out I step, head to toe in a skin tight red latex catsuit, a white fishnet bodystocking over the top, 10\" white stiletto heels and a white underbust corset around my waist, a red cross over the center of it. A mask surrounds my face, leaving only my eyes and mouth open, thick red lips pouting out, eyes heavily made up, my body slim and toned, with a pair of 32H clearly fake breasts sitting just above my corset, a perfect 36\" ass straining the rear of the catsuit.\n\n\"Hi, can I help you?\" \n\n----------\n\nSorry for the long lead up, just had this on my mind for a few days. Looking for either men or women, a latex fetish is mandatory obviously. I enjoy medical style play, nothing too involved (as in I don't have any interest in picking up a scalpel and cutting you open, but changes made via pills or practically magical machines are ok) very much enjoy some anal probing and examination, and things of that nature. Mainly looking to play Domme, but if you can make a convincing case to dominate me, I'll be happy to do that as well. \n\n",

            "selftext": "I'm not a proud man.\n\nI mean, I used to be one. I had a decent career lined up - Software Engineering, the kind of thing I could use to lord over my friends until I fucking croaked. And *god*, did I love feeling better than everyone around me.\n\nUntil, of course, the *Accident.* The *Accident* meaning, of course, me getting shitfaced drunk and breaking my arm on the bottom step of a night club staircase.\n\nI'm not a guy who's used to pain. Never broke a bone before that day. Never got beat up by the bigger kids at school. Never got spanked by my parents - although some of my former friends might have suggested that I could have used it. So snapping the ulna in my right arm was something beyond what I could handle.\n\nI didn't hesitate for a second when I was told my insurance would cover oxycodone and *god*, did I love it. It not only stopped the arm pain, but it made my usual cocktail of hard liquor and molly feel like my 6 A.M. coffee. So, needless to say, I might have pretended that my arm pain lasted a touch longer than it actually did.\n\nWhen my supply ran out, well, that's when shit started getting out of hand. I already had a molly supplier, and he had some contacts who could hook me up. Except this time my insurance *definitely* wouldn't cover it.\n\nI'll give you the abridged version. After all, you've heard this story before: small doses stop working, medium doses stop working, big doses barely scratch the surface, arm starts hurting again (psychosomatic, I know, fuck you), selling off assets to keep the supply running, moving into shittier and shittier apartments to keep rent to a minimum, losing my job because of inconsistent work...\n\nSo, one night, after a meal of the cheapest ramen money could buy, I finally hit rock bottom: researching Urban Dictionnary entries to figure out the best code to indicate on Craigslist that I'd like to sell my ass for money.\n\nI've always known I had the body to pull it off: short, slim, pale, smooth, nice ass. You know, the whole shebang for making gross fags drool. That said, I never went ahead of it because, y'know, I don't like cock. Well, I'd reached the point where even *that* wasn't an insurmountable barrier.\n\nI don't think you realize this, but being a straight Craigslist whore *sucks.* Cum tastes god awful. Getting fucked is a nightmare. And hearing these loser fucks *grunting* is beyond disgusting.\n\nBut still, so long as I could keep more or less consistently high, I was fine. At least, until one night, with a particularly rough jackass... After which I found I couldn't get hard anymore.\n\n\"Prostate damage,\" the doctor said. Permanent. Irreversible. Say bye-bye to unassisted erections.\n\nTurns out even *that* was an optimistic assessment. I tried everything: viagra, cock rings, every bit of snake oil under the sun. I can't get hard anymore. Which meant I could only cum one way.\n\nI haven't been on a date with a girl in two years. Instead, when the blue balls get so bad I can't take it anymore, I post up another ad. I've started vetting guys by cock size. I need something big and long to get off. It's a fucking addiction - I'm probably the first straight size queen in the world. But holy shit, when I actually *can* cum... It's a god damn godsend.\n\nLife's only got rougher since then. I barely even do drugs anymore - can't afford it, not if I want to eat. Sometimes I don't even bother with ads - I just wear a pair of fuck-me shorts and find a street corner. Sometimes guys take it personal when I can't get hard; I've even gotten a couple smacks because of it...\n\nAll right, I get it. You asked me how I got started, not my entire life story. I know what you're here for, so go ahead: fucking mount me. I need it as bad as you do. Don't go easy on me...\n\n---\n\n*This was more of a free-form story, probably not my best prose, but I like to think I nailed the character (as you soon will be, I hope).*\n\n*Kinks include rough sex, crossdressing, sizeplay, muscular partners, fat partners, large penetrations, prostate play, sweat, anal, barebacking/stealthing, forced feminization, breathplay, humiliation and abuse.*\n\n*Let me know if you're interested!*",

            "selftext": "**WARNING: This is a prompt for snuff (murder) roleplay.** I don't wish to upset anybody. Please be aware that just reading this prompt could be disturbing for you.\n\nHi! I have a couple of different possibilities for a roleplay where your character snuffs my character. But I want it to be consensual or dubiously consensual, and I want your character to be affectionate with my character. My character (**age 20+**) does not necessarily want to die, but she will, at a minimum, agree that your character has the right to kill her. Your character is not a violent psycho, but an even-tempered, good-natured (if a bit selfish) man or woman who just happens to want to kill someone for fun. Both of us will treat this as normal.\n\nOne possibility is that we could live in a world, or a smaller community, where it's normal for everyone (although the victims feel differently once it's their turn). You might convince me to go to an exclusive snuffing party with you. Once there, I have second thoughts, but it would be so *gauche* to back out now. We could do some fun worldbuilding here and maybe snuff some other girls as well.\n\nA more intimate possibility could be in the context of a long-term relationship. My character is your character's friend, sister, roommate, girlfriend, or similar. There is affection on both sides, but something comes up. Maybe we need some cash and decide to make a snuff film. Maybe we're just kind of bored? We will both agree that snuffing me makes sense. We could do some sexual scenes first before we build up to it, or we could do it as a one-shot.\n\nGiven the extreme nature of this roleplay, I would want to talk things out in detail beforehand and frequently check in with each other out of character during the scene(s). Please be friendly! Ladies welcome.\n\nLikes: Sibling incest, affection, being used selfishly, facefuck, gagging, choking, reluctance, degradation, exhibitionism, being recorded, name-calling, praise and compliments, rough anal/painal, watersports (receiving). See my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/2MMvqgu.png).\n\n**Limits**: Underage, animals, scat, pregnancy. Knives. Cannibalism. Fights/contests. Anger (from your character.) Violence that we haven't talked about beforehand. Weird sci-fi/magic stuff. Celebrities. Daddy/daughter isn't the right choice for this roleplay.\n\nPlease consider, before messaging me, whether this roleplay would be too disturbing for you. I do not take myself too seriously, I am out to have fun, and I would feel terrible if I upset any of you.",

            "selftext": "Hello there all you lovely, perverted people of DPP!\n\nRecently I have had this terribly strong urge, to be forced down and used by a strong bull. To slowly have all my views and morals thrown out the window so that I can be given the pleasure of having his superior cock forced into my tight little holes.\n\nAlthough, I should say that I am not looking for a play where we just jump straight into things without any story or build-up. There will be a lot of time and effort spent to flesh out the story that we have created. This is because I am a person that takes great pleasure out of these parts when it comes to roleplaying. So please be sure that you are of the same mind before thinking of responding to me, because you will most likely not have a good time if you don't enjoy these elements as well.\n\nNow, if I have still gotten any of you hooked, I should probably start to explain what kind of scenes I am looking to do. And to be completely open, I am very open and flexible in this regard. Although I should probably mention that I will most likely be putting priority into the responses that seem to have more weird, creative and out-there ideas for the kind of scene and setting that they want to do. So any and all settings are open to being used in this; like fantasy, sci-fi, pirates, wasteland, superheroes, alternate universes, etc, etc...\n\nThe same can honestly be said about the kinks that will be included. I do have a kinklist made for any of you that are curious. But please, do note that nothing on this list is a must for me. So do feel free to ask me about any set of kinks that you want to include or exclude.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ykH5uxP.png\n\nI think that is all for now.\n\nThank you all for taking the time to read my silly little message, and I hope you all have a good day now! :D",

My vision swims in a muddied outline like I\u2019m submerged in cotton candy. \n\nI\u2019m on all fours. \n\nYour friends take turns. One after the other. They make me feel so good. \n\nSee how much I love you. \n\nDrooling, sweaty puddle on the pillow as you grind my insides away.  You make sure to crush the artery in my neck and not my wind pipe. So as to make me pass out in the easiest way possible. I have to wear scarves to cover up the bruises. \n\nThe camera gets real close as they pull my legs up into the air. Everything freshly fucked and put on display. \u201cThe last video got a million views,\u201d you say. \n\nI\u2019m all yours and you know this. Every fetish that you need. Fuck my cute, soft feet. Collars and chains go around my neck. Piss in my pussy. Cum where you want. I got nipple piercings just for you. A few tattoos just for me. Anal? Make it double. Gangbang? Make it a quadruple. \n\nThe truth is I\u2019m sick, not you. I like it. I really do. \n\nI just wanna be your dog and make my love true. \n",

Thanks.\n\n***\n\nOur neighborhood has always been deeply conservative. It's a little cul-de-sac deep in the heartland and let's just say there were a *lot* of red hats back in November of 2016 going around. Me? I've always taken joy in being outside the box. I'm a pretty drop of blue in a sea of red here in the neighborhood. Always have been; always will be. And there's *nothing* you can do about that.\n\nI annoy the rest of you at every chance I get. I blast indie rock music or hip-hop to drown out your country crap. I invite my gay girlfriends over and proudly display them on my front porch as we laugh and talk loudly deep into the night. I wear my \"I'm with her!\" T-shirt as often as possible, yes, even after the election was stolen from us. When I heard there was a local party being thrown on inauguration day last year, I had no qualms about showing up with some liberal friends outside the house and vocally protesting it with chants and sign. I'm a real pain in the ass, and honestly? I get off on it. :)\n\nBut an executive order just went though. President Trump, in order to bring 'harmony and unity' to America has taken to assigning local 'Enforcers' to each neighborhood. Now, obviously these Enforcers don't have the authority to make proper arrests or be armed or even physically mark anyone. But what they *can* do is humiliate. Detain. Control. They can put people on their knees or in old fashioned pillories or in bit gags. They can handcuff a nuisance and cage them till they deem them 'calm and orderly'. And some Enforcers, I'm sure, are even going to take it upon themselves to dole out a little... 'sexual' torture. Off the books, of course.\n\nOur neighborhood just got assigned an Enforcer. It's you.\n\nA feeling of deep dread coils in my stomach. This can't be real. I peak out my blinds and see the homecoming party as you arrive back from the nearest federal building with your 'control' equipment. I swallow into a dry throat. I grip the hem of my shirt and twist it in clenched, white-knuckled, fists. You're not going to do anything to *me*... are you?\n\n***\n\n* Kinks: Being punished, controlled, frustrated, and humiliated for being a brat and/or nuisance. Torture me. Restrain me. Silence me. Tickle me. Really, do whatever you want. *You're* the Enforcer. I'm just a civilian. The power is in your hands. Except...\n\n* Limits: Don't shit on me, okay? Or pee. Or bruise me and break bones or something. And I won't do ageplay. Otherwise? Nothing else is off the table. \n\n* Picture: As usual, I'll provide a picture for reference of my character. You can do the same or not, I really don't care. How about... someone like [Selena](https://i.redd.it/z4ge0c75ujq01.jpg) here? Good? Good. Then come and degrade me and punish me for my liberal annoyances. ",

I'm even friends with her already, and, well, I know when I think of her like *that*, it's not in some weirdly distant position...\"\n\nIt takes a moment, I can tell, brows knitting together as the blush rises, and the leather seat creaks as she shifts in place.\n\n\"Me?\" she stammers, and my grin only gets *wider*. \n\n---\n\nThis one's really simple, and I'm really flexible on this because I'm *dying* to do a cute orc-with-human love story that doesn't fall into the usual cliches. I'm a shameless pervert who wants to do rough stuff with a blushing, surprisingly submissive orc lass, and then cuddle her to sleep while holding hands. The porn angle is just to make that sound a little less depraved at first, naturally. \n\n[DPP Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/5smcxm/m4f_snuggles_and_sex_or_just_snuggles_or_just_sex/)",

            "selftext": "The year is 2072, and sex has become remarkably casual since the development of 100% effective birth control and the curing of all STDs. This birth control comes in the form of a new medication for men, casually referred to as \"The Juice\" has been created that dramatically increases the amount of semen a man produces, but also causes discomfort if not relieved regularly.\n\nBecause of the side effects of The Juice, marriage is typically only done for procreation. To do so, however, men must stop taking \u201cThe Juice.\u201d The resulting drop in testosterone and other hormones causes the husband to exhibit lower sex drives, reduced semen production, and permanently smaller reproductive organs. Because husbands off of \u201cThe Juice\u201d have a reduced sex drive while other men need to have very frequent sex, it isn\u2019t uncommon for wives to be used to relieve their husband\u2019s friends, coworkers, and even strangers. There is no taboo around cheating and it is engaged in frequently. As a result, most people refer to married women as \u201ccum dumpsters\u201d for the valuable service they provide to the community.\n\nHowever, there are men break the laws who never take The Juice. These men are called \u201cBreeders\u201d and keep this a secret. Many married men fear the Breeders but others discount them as an urban myth.\n\nScenario: I am a young wife with a husband off of The Juice and trying to conceive. We are hosting a dinner party with my husband\u2019s coworkers, all of which are men on the Juice (or maybe some Breeders). You can either play as my husband, one of the other people I will fuck, or perhaps write in third-person or alternate roles. This can involve: cuckolding, cum play, pregnancy, race play, impregnation, bimbofication, and pretty much any other kink you want. Let\u2019s chat!",
