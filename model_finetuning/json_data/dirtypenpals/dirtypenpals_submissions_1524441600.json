            "selftext": "\"What? You've never seen LOTR?\" I ask my dad.\n\n\"Well,\" his head rocks back and forth. \"You know, I just never got around to it. I just don't go rent dvds so much anymore.\"\n\nI groan. \"Dad! You don't have to rent shit anymore. Come onnnn. Why don't we watch it tonight?\"\n\nMy dad shrugs, \"I guess we could.\"\n\nYou push back your finished plate of food. \"Sounds good to me, haven't seen the first in ages.\"\n\n\"So it's settled! Awesome,\" I say as I clear the table.\n\nIt was the usual weekend with my dad and my bf. We paid him a visit every second weekend or so. After Mom left, I knew he didn't want to admit it, but he was lonely.\n\nNot soon after, the movie was set and we three were settled into the couches. Dad had his big single Lazyboy, and we had the cuddle couch. I tossed a blanket over us and we snuggled up as the movie begun.\n\nNow, I was wearing a light dress, and it wasn't unusual for us to do some light fondling while movie watching, so you had no problem with me grabbing your soft penis and massaging it a little.\n\nI knew you wouldn't make a peep. Not in front of my dad, you wouldn't. No, I knew you would keep it zipped as I stroked you nice and slow, up and down, pushing down around the base of your cock with my hand so that it really  got hard and stiff. You were locked on the movie, but I knew you wanted to shout. \n\nWe were laying down sideways on the couch. Your lips were right behind my ear and your member was rested up against my butt as I squeezed it to keep it hard. \n\n*Not without a condom, or you gotta be on BC,* you had told me time and time again.\n\n*But I hate it like that baby! It's no fun! You know how much I like risks! The thought of you putting a living thing inside me make me crazy, baby.*\n\nBut a no was a no, and you had said it, over and over, so now, laying with you on the couch, I pushed your penis past my panties and right up inside my cunt, which was doing the same thing a dog does when you cook sausages in front of it; drooling.\n\n\"Becs!\" You hissed.\n\n\"Shh!\" I bit back, but as we looked at each other you saw my mouth slowly open as I sunk back onto your erection.\n\nIt's inside me now. I'm fertile. I'm unprotected. And you've got two bulging balls waiting to pump me so full of your sticky stuff that it could make my future daughter pregnant.\n\nBut we watch the movie. We watch and I grind. Not hump, no, we have to make the distinction, what I am doing is rolling my hips, like a belly dancer, only with a piece of thick cock so far up inside me it makes me want to scream.\n\nI lift up my top leg and my hand reaches all the way down to your balls. I close my thighs and grab your nuts, rubbing and pulling on them. I bend my neck to look at you and you are clenching, praying to whatever god still counts that you don't bust.\n\nBut it's too much. My fucking pussy is sucking your dick and my hand is conjuring up your cum. Your grab my hips and blow your load. \n\nI look at you in shock as you try not to shout or moan. It seriously feels like there is a hose in my body depositing goop at an alarming rate inside me, and all you or I can do is hold on and let you impregnate me.\n\nIt's seeping out of my pussy and you huff and breath heavy.\n\nJust then, Frodo and the others hide from the dark rider beneath the tree roots and dad turns around.\n\n\"Fucking awesome,\" he says with a smile.\n\n\"Told ya,\" I giggle, my face flushing red as my dad looked at me, not knowing I've just been so rawly inseminated; his darling daughter, fucked and filled, bucked and bred, mounted and mated...\n\nYour penis rests inside me, and I don't get up or move.\n\nI look at you, so close, and whisper: \"You just put another person inside me, sweetie.\"",

            "selftext": "Some Sundays, when the sky is grey- which is very often where I live, I'll slip into an oversized jumper, and nestle down into my soft sofa. My intention is to read, I'm even wearing my cute glasses with the large circular lenses you love, but as the last remnants of winter air tickle my exposed hands, all I can think about is the silence; the absence of you; the wicked space between wall and ear which is usually so easily filled with a heartbeat or a joke. I miss you. I miss you and I feel incomplete without your touch.\n\nWhat I'd give to climb across your chest, or to search for solace in your eyes; to tell your neck all my secrets; to lust after the leaps in your excited breath; to have you hold my hair away from our kisses. Because when I picture desire, you come to mind, the captain of my battered ship, the strong, callused, hand at the wheel, who makes my cells scream \"make love to me\" whenever you so much as raise an eyebrow and pull that familiar smirk.\n\nI'm not wet because I want to be; it's not my choice to be shifting aimlessly on this sofa, with my knees up to my chest. The book has been put down in defeat, and tiny droplets of rain are beginning to sputter from the sky, pattering on my window, a dainty soundtrack for a wondering hand. In my head we're playfully wrestling, your touches ranging from the lightest whisper to the most sadistic of clamps, I am voluntarily at your mercy, as I latch on to every quiver in your voice; the sharpness of your stubble; the firmness of your arse. I welcome you without hesitation to my mouth, it's slow and methodical, loving eye contact and an eagerness to please. I'm on the brink of tears, obsessed with the head, the shaft, the balls, the entire package. It's beautiful because it's yours. If only you were here to make this a reality, so I could engage in this exercise of tenderness and have you cum on my smiling face- something you know I'd never do for anyone else.\n\nI want to dance for you like a slave girl under a spell, high on your musk, nervously falling from grace. I want to ambush you with my barely covered body fresh from the shower. I want you to know that the shifting of your weight accompanied with a content grumble that I hear while making breakfast, is enough to draw me back to bed and let the eggs burn. I want you to know I tell my friends about how wonderful you are, to the point of annoying them. I want this cunt to be our cunt, your cunt, your pussy, yours, and I want to tell you to fuck your pussy when you're on top of me. I want to wrap my limbs around you, and have you carry me around all day like I'm a baby sloth. I want you to cum inside me and the potential consequences of that too. I want to call you at night just to hear you tell me it's too late to talk and that I'm an idiot. I want to force you to wear a suit everyday even for when we're lounging around the house. I want you to choke me. I want every second of my day to be filled with your laughter. I want to interrupt you at the least appropriate times. I want to throw my panties at you like you're a rockstar. But most of all right now, I just want you to be here with me.\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "It had been the same way every year for the last 15. Since we were 5, on Easter, me, you and our friend Jade, had gone upstairs in your house for a movie while our parents all drank down below. \n\nWell we were older now. But the tradition kept on. Our parents joked about how cuddly we were together. We had gone to school together, and even though we had gone to college and were each in a relationship now, here we were again on Easter, watching the Lion King again, cuddling under the same purple blanket again.\n\nWe knew it was naughty. But we didn't care. It was a tradition. \n\nYou were between me and Jade, and you had your arms around us as our heads rested against your chest.\n\nNow that we were all 22, that purple blanket didn't cover us so well. Me and Jade both had our feet tucked up, and our knees over your lap, but our asses poked out of the blanket, and with our Easter dresses on, our thighs were smoldering in your view.\n\nThe Lion King ended. And the tv faded out. Below, our shouting parents laughed on, and we looked at each other. I didn't want to leave, to go back downstairs to the shouting and drinking, no, I liked it up here with you two. \n\nI leaned over and pecked Jade on the cheek. She gave one back. Then we kissed over you lap, and I grabbed your thigh hard as we made out. Then we slowly turned to look up at you, still kissing a little as we did so.\n\n\"Ryan,\" Jade said. \"Your penis is hard.\"\n\nAll of us went red with embarrassment. You didn't even know what to say. But just below our heads, in your pants, was a hard cock, and we all knew why.\n\nYou didn't speak, and you stayed silent as Jade took out your penis in front of me. Gently, we both kissed it. It was so goddamned hard, like achingly hard, and kept like throbbing once every few seconds as we kissed it. \n\nJade gestured me to get on your lap, and I did, kissing your neck and feeling your cock under my skirt, pushing against my soft panties; all the remained between your cum and my womb. Jade slunk off the couch, and went between your knees.\n\nOur parents riled on from below. \n\nI could feel Jade's head under my ass, taking your cock in her mouth as she began to suck and gag and spit and jerk.\n\nI could see you trying not to cum. Your face was tight, and I pulled your chin to make you look me in the eyes. \n\nI kissed you tightly on the lips. \"Just cum, Ryan, don't hold back.\" \n\nI saw you close your eyes. \"I'm gonna,\" you moaned.\n\nI felt Jade hook my panties with her finger. It was all in the heat of the moment, but I moaned aloud when Jade pushed your cock into my pussy. \n\n\"Nooo!\" We both yelled.\n\nBut Jade had done it, and was pressing my ass down ontop of you as you began to fill me with sperm.\n\nI grabbed your shoulders, and Jade shot up and pressed her whole body against my back, pushing me more into you and hugging us both.\n\nShe was right beside our faces when she talked.\n\n\"Lets start a family together,\" she said, \"the three of us.\"",

            "selftext": "*Virginia*\n\nIt's a curious name, really. Virginal. Virtuous. The perfect name for the perfectly good girl that my parents always wanted, in poofy skirts and blonde pig tails and a slightly vapid smile that denotes a lack of any real substance beyond it. Well, Mom and Dad, I'm sorry to disappoint you. You may have given me a chaste name, but the urge to get fucked up the ass, that's all me. Or, hell, maybe I got it from one of you. Is butt-sluttery hereditary? Is the love of having my tight anus stretched out by a thick cock hard-coded in my genes? Or is it something I've learned, a cultural trait conferred to me via too much MTV and too many raunchy comic books? Maybe the whole of society is simply one big, brain-washing machine to turn ostensibly good girls into cock-craving anal whores? Maybe Big Brother is watching me masturbate with a rubber cock between my cheeks and my tongue lolling from my mouth like a deranged girl from some third-rate hentai clip.\n\nMaybe. But whatever the case, I keep my predilections under wraps. Working as a kindergarten teacher, I'm not in the habit of sharing my personal or private life, beyond the occasional mention of my cat at home or how much I like to read. Gotta keep the kids at arm's length, you know? Otherwise, they'll want to know everything, as if they own you. I guess they do, in a sense; they certainly own most of my time and attention, even when I'm not at work. Preparing lessons in the alphabet and in counting, making paper cut outs of animals or writing words on cards for their memory games. There's always something, some task to prepare or chore to do to clean up after the little monsters. Crayons lodged in impossible places, clumsy scribbles of some innocently obscene word in a low place where they think I won't see. I can't tell you how many times I've had to clean 'fart' off the walls, but I suppose that comes with the territory. Better that than dealing with moody, hormonal teenagers and their insipid gossip and bullshit. At least with a group of kindergartners, you know that the idiocy they spew is because they don't know any better, and not because they read a few pages of the Communist Handbook and got inspired to change the world, one sour, moody pop-punk song at a time.\n\nBut I digress. Working with children all day, it's easy to get distracted by a random train of thought, and I confess that I sometimes feel a bit stir-crazy after tending to the little spawnlings for five days in a row. You can only do so many songs about clapping and counting syllables before your head starts to go a bit loopy, you know? Which is where you come in. Tall, clean-cut and handsome, with kind eyes and a warm smile-- the most recent addition to the school, brought in to teach the fifth-graders math and science... how could I not fall for you? And how could I not rejoice when the infatuation was reciprocated? A smile here, a coy, surreptitious kiss there, always hidden and obscured from the rest of the teaching staff for fear of being found out. The administration takes a hard stance against fraternization with your co-workers; *nothing but trouble*, they call it. Of course, the rest of the teachers know; they've seen the way we smile at each other, the way our hands brush briefly against one another when we stand in line for the coffee machine. Soft, sweet gestures, so tiny and insignificant as to barely matter, and yet so numerous that no one paying attention could miss them. Well, so far so good, I suppose. The other teachers may know, but all they see is a sweet, youthful romance, a cautious courtship between two modest and good-natured people who dance around the issue, too nervous to fully take the plunge but definitely admiring one another's radiance.\n\nIf only they knew what we do during recess. If only they had the slightest idea...\n\nYour arms round my waist as you push me up against the wall, your lips pressing greedily against mine as our tongues swirl and grind in a lewd tango, spilling soft moans and panting gasps into the crisp air of the storage room. One hand slipping under my skirt, pulling it up, baring skin and a pair of tiny, black panties, so narrow as to barely even be there. Fingers clasping a firm cheek, squeezing, moulding, digits eagerly pressing into the canyon of my ass, seizing, taking. The sensation of your firm bulge against my fingers, pressing against your jeans and fighting to get out as I pinch the zipper and pull it, dragging it down one tooth after the other until the thick, firm shaft is practically bursting through the button of your trousers. My fingers deftly popping it and pulling your pants down around your thighs, and the weight of your warm cock slapping against my stomach. \"Suck it,\" you demand, lips quivering against my own, and I nod and obey, and slink down onto my knees, one hand grasping my hair to guide my warm, hungry mouth.\n\nAnd the taste of you, salt and musky and rich on my tongue as you push forward, deep, solid strokes of your hips pushing deeper and deeper between my lips. The thrumming pulse through the shaft, throbbing in sync with your heart beat, and my tongue dragging obediently along your potent cum-vein, worshipping the length and girth of your sex as you buck against my throat, forcing a muffled gag out of me and coating your tip in thick, viscous drool. A grunt from above; approval. You like it, don't you? You like taking the good little Kindergarten teacher down on her knees so you can fuck her throat. You love exposing that part of me, the part that no one else sees. The slut. The addled, cum-loving addict. The good girl gone bad. What a cliche. And yet.. here I am, living the fantasy of being your personal cock-sucker. Of slurping and gagging and drooling over your cock, or shivering with pleasure as you grip my hair more firmly and call me a *good girl*.\n\nGood girl. The irony is not lost on me.\n\nYou give me no time to savor you, though; no time to reap the spoils of my labor. Up, up and around until my face is pressed against the off-white wall, and your hands are grabbing at my ass, lifting the skirt and spreading my cheeks to reveal the thick, flared base of the plug filling my ass. A whole day of teaching with that thing inside me has made me positively besides myself with lust. Now, as your fingers reach around it and tug, teasingly at first and then more firmly, I can't contain my first, mindless moan. The sensation of opening, of spreading around the hard, bulbuous body of the toy, my asshole gaping and winking as it pops out with a muted *schlorp*, and then your fingers pulling my cheeks apart, spreading me open for your spit-slick cock, and the firm, slow push into me, assisted by whatever lube was left over from the plug. Your warm breath on my neck as you lean in, still thrusting ever-so-carefully into me, not because you fear that it will hurt me, but because you want me to savor every thick, mouth-watering inch of you. Because you want me to moan and tremble, because you want the good girl in front of you to remember the depths of her own depravity, how much she loves it when a strong, firm man takes violates her anal chastity. Hah. Been a long time since there was anything chaste about my asshole. Still, you get what you want. I moan. With every inch of warm cock-meat pushing into me, I moan, every breath a slight whimper of lust-addled need, breathy and high-pitched. You grin, nose pushed against my right ear. Your hand seizes my hip. And with one last, rough push, you spear yourself to the hilt inside me, and slam me up against the wall, making me whimper and gasp with pleasure.\n\n\"Good girl,\" you murmur, and your lips caress the crook of my neck where the sweater meets skin. \"Now give me that ass, slut. Beg me to fuck you.\"\n\n\"Please,\" I gasp in response, the only thing I can think to say. \"Fuck me!\"\n\nYou oblige me, of course; no sense in beng balls deep in a girl's asshole if you don't intend to capitalize on it. A slow drag out of me, keeping me pinned against the wall, and then a hard push, making your balls slap against my cheeks. Your soft groan of pleasure in my ear, the tense flexing of your muscles as you lay more of your strength into me, holding me tight and using my hole for your selfish pleasure. Slow thrusts growing faster, harder, and my lust overflowing and trickling down my inner thighs as you fuck me hard. It is a necessity, and one that I relish; in the brief span of recess, there is no time for gentle lovemaking, no time for slow and deep. You use me, hammering your hips into my round ass with selfish glee, and I meet your thrusts with bucking movements of my own, delighting in my role as an anal fuck-toy. My breasts press pointedly against the wall, and my breath comes out in short, squeaking gasps of pleasure, and then your grunts grow deeper, more profound, and your hips lose all restraint as you slam roughly into me with all your might, your thick cock sliding past the ring of my abused hole another dozen times until my cheeks are burning red and tingling with the force of impact.\n\nYou cradle my ass, the large plug held in two fingers and pressing firmly against my skin as you fuck me, and then your grunts turn into moans, and you push forward with all your might, squishing me between your warm body and the cool wall. Pumping, throbbing movements erupt inside me, and I whimper with joy as your heat spreads into me, a thick and rich explosion of cum delivered as deep inside my ass as you can manage. You grunt. You gasp. You squeeze my cheeks until it hurts, lost entirely in your rapturous orgasm.\n\nUntil at last you pull out, and I feel the slick shape of the plug pressing between my cheeks, sliding in and sealing your warm cum inside my ass. A soft grin, a pat on the ass-- and then you're gone, jeans zipped up and the faint whiff of fresh sweat around you. Left behind, I shiver and groan with restrained pleasure, but then I, too, tug my clothes back in order and exit the store room, leaving behind nothing but the smell of sex and a small puddle of female arousal on the spot where my cunt had leaked its immodest pleasure. I flatten my hair and adopt my usual, shy smile. Recess is almost over, and the kids will need me to read them their daily story. Or maybe we'll do a rhythm game; who can name their favorite animal and clap out the syllables of its name for the class?\n\nIt's not always like that. No two romps are ever identical. But a few things are constant. It's always at work. It's always a secret. And it's always - *always* - my ass bearing the brunt of your lust. My name is Victoria. I teach kindergarten kids how to count and spell. I wear modest skirts and conservative sweaters. My classroom is immaculate, and my pupils adore me. And I am a hungry, pleading, unapologetic butt-slut for you.\n\n\n---\n\n[Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/6z8f8c/f4a_cranky_irascible_and_occasionally_playful_the/)\n\n[Subreddit of my writing](/r/anamazingferret)\n\nOn the back of advice given to me by one of the wisest people on this subreddit, allow me this brief disclaimer: I am only looking for one partner for this, and as such, if I do not respond to you, it is likely because I am already in talks with another person.

You are developing a wet spot, on your pants, at the peak of your little tent there. Here, let me just give it a quick brush with this sanitary cloth and then we'll\n\nOh.\n\nOh my.\n\nDid you just orgasm? Don't try to conceal it, I know the signs quite well. Quickening of breath, flushing in the face and along the chest and arms, dilated pupils... you just ejaculated inside your pants. Oh no, don't be embarrassed, that's perfectly normal. At least, for men [who are around me.](https://78.media.tumblr.com/a18ec042ad5e9ec47df220684a2f09b1/tumblr_osmlc8MRam1wt7ek9o1_500.png) There's nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nJust stay here, in my lap, nice and comfortable. Warm and safe in your mistress' arms. That's wha you want, isn't it? A mistress? Someone to control you and guide you and teach you how to be a proper slave? That's why you came here, to see me; because you want me to do that for you. You want me to enslave you.\n\nI must warn you, though I am far gentler than Lena or Amelie or Sombra, I am still capable of roughness. You must be ready for such things as Femdom, Ageplay, Begging, Praise, Raceplay, BDSM, Teasing, Edging, Body Worship, Vocal Worship, Foot Worship, Boot Worship, Anal, Pegging, Humiliation, Ass Worship, Rimming, Watersports, , Small Penis Humiliation (though my words will be gentle, they will still be embarrassing in public), Consensual Submission, MD/LB, Sissification, and even Feminization. \n\nAre you read for such things? Yes? You want this? \n\nThen tell me so. \n\nI'm waiting...",

            "selftext": "When I was 19 and lived in my family home, I started seeing this guy from down the road who was living in his family home too. We'd grown up together, and would often joke about the fact that we'd been together forever and 'just not known it'. He was the only person in my life at that time who could make me double over in laughter; who could lift me out of any depression I may've been in, and replace it with a warm fuzziness; I'd hear him play piano and be torn between wanting to stay as stationary as a petrified mouse as to not interrupt, and wanting to sneak into that room and toy at him mercilessly like a kitten. We were lame, really really lame, he'd put on a stupid voice and chase me around the kitchen saying things like \"lookin good babe, you mind if I eat you real quick? You mind though? You mind though? Do you mind though?\" Every time he attempted to fire a scrunched up piece of paper at the bin, but had it ricochet off the wall instead, I'd leap out of the woodwork with a bunch of generic coach putdowns going from 0 to 100 in no time at all. He made me feel all weak with this sulking, and boy did he sulk over silly stuff, if he couldn't play a song on guitar after the third try, he'd walk over to the corner with it and get all serious, furrowing his brow and muttering \"this time, this time\". I'd watch from a far with glee, voyeuristic in my enjoyment of his whole being.\n\nOur sex was equally full of giggles, attention to detail, everything really. I'd become hyper aware of how sexy the upwards inflection of his eyebrows were; how his chest locked itself in place to help him thrust harder; how he walked the fine line between wanting to hurt me and the total opposite, as I fizzed and crackled on the wave of every touch he forced upon me- every grab, clamp, stroke, whisper. He'd often dance his fingers over my back in frivolous and directionless patterns, silently appreciating every square inch of my skin- I thought I'd met a mythical protector like a guardian angel, but he was just a boy who longed to love me, which was all the more exquisite.\n\nHis rugged skin would soak up the summer sunlight perfectly, flexing violently as he groaned, almost frightened of his own power, as he'd manage to say \"I'm gonna cum\": I knew it, I could feel it- see it. His broad chest was broader than ever, his cock harder than imaginable and raring to pulse. I could've cried every single time. It was beautiful. It was beautiful and I took it all.\n\nThe afternoon in question I was running my hands through his dirty blonde hair as I would any other time, stopping to plant the tiniest pecks on his head- smitten, when he began wrestling and wriggling his way out of my hold which instantly gave way, then he was on his knees, that cheeky smile rendering me weak all over: it told me what I was feeling already; it's playtime. But today there was something different in the air, almost untraceable yet definitely there. I was weaker than usual, I had less control of my breath, I was arching my back out of desire and lust, I was post verbal before we even began, my cheeks were flushed within seconds, I just kept mumbling nonsense, my legs flailed around aimlessly, I'm told I was dribbling; I felt lighter than air, the blood rushing to my entire lower half the only thing keeping me from floating away; before he'd even laid a hand on me I began experiencing the mildest of contractions, teasing me, making me a little crazy, I knew I was wet enough; lightly cupping my breasts almost gave me a heart attack; my bottom lip was falling away from my face.\n\nI heard myself say \"just go in... do it\" which was completely out there, and he knew this full well- I usually need a little work before penetration, and not just need it, but yearn for it. Not today though, it seemed.\n\nHe pushed my legs back as far as they'd go, and laid the length of his cock against me. I'd never felt so hollow, so self aware, so vulnerable, so close to having a full scale mental breakdown, as he started talking \"you want me inside, don't you?\" he seemed almost concerned, suppressing a small laugh. As pathetic as it sounds, all I could muster was a series of tiny nods, my eyes widening and ripping through his. After a few seconds I managed an \"uh huh\" which haunts me to this day.\n\nWhen he sank himself into me world peace was achieved, I somehow managed to find nirvana, while contemplating whether I'd wake up in hospital in a few hours. He slammed into me, again and again and again, over and over, each time filling the room with a sloshing sound which only served to drive us both further insane. He buried himself in my neck, devouring me, and not long after this, the shaking started:\n\nHeat emanated from my head first, as I began to feel my legs quake ever so slightly. I was beginning to feel disorientated, as warm buzzes hissed over me in thick waves, all of which felt like a hit of the most beautiful drug in existence. Flush after flush of wetness drenched his beautiful cock, it didn't seem to want to stop and neither did he, pounding away something fierce now. He apparently asked me if I wanted to change positions, but not only did this not register with me at all, but I tried to follow his lead and move, only to discover I couldn't. This would explain why I remember him pulling out, and me letting out the most frail \"noooooooo\" in history, while throwing both hands straight to my cunt out of desperation. He started fucking me again, thank goodness, and all I could do was wrap my limbs around him to the best of my ability.\n\nThose little shakes began to very quickly give way to constant tremors, enough to shake the bed, once he said \"I'm going to cum\". Exactly what happened next is a little hazy, I remember the shaking going from 3 to 9, I remember him letting out a \"fucking hell, babe\", I remember screaming, *screaming*, I remember my abs contorting with all their might, I remember soaking him ever so lightly in my sex, I remember being curled up on my side shivering gently, and batting his hand away when he tried to touch my sensitive body which was firing off every nerve at once, I remember his soft shocked laughter, and batting his hand away again when he tried to play with my hair.\n\nA few minutes later, I turned to him, my eyelids almost closed, a big goofy smile on my face, all I wanted to do was to cuddle him, kiss him, nuzzle his nose, and fall asleep with him- and I did just that.\n____________\n\nJust thought I'd share this, maybe you fancy talking about it or something fun you've experienced :)\n\n ",

            "selftext": "Unfortunately, this isn't the first account that I have brought to DPP, but in total I have been part of this community for about a year. During that time, I have experienced the most drastic advance in my openness to sexual exploration to ever occur in my life. Period. Here are a couple things that have changed for me and I look forward to hearing other people's take on the benefits of being able to explore on DPP.\n\n1.  If you asked me a year ago what I thought of penises, I'd tell you that I like mine thank you very much, but keep me as far away as possible from anyone else's. I've definitely developed a newfound appreciation for penises, giving blowjobs, and even occasionally being on the receiving end of anal. My mind was so closed off to these possibilities, but having the room to experiment really encouraged me to explore.\n\n2. I really had no idea what BDSM entailed. I just had the gun shop scene from Pulp Fiction etched into my mind along with some very poor quality porn that I happened to stumble upon. The combination of the two still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth (and no it's not the fulfilling kind either). It was really cool to go through a kink list for the first time, get bombarded with terms, and get to work putting names to tendencies I always had but wasn't able to isolate and analyze due to lack of understanding. I not only realized I have very powerful urges to be dominant, I realized what specific types of domination are exciting to me. I challenged myself to understand what I want out of sexual experiences in detail, and so far I have succeeded in finding answers.\n\n3. Most importantly, writing on here forced me to have a stronger voice when stating my sexual preferences and desires before reaching a suitable compromise. That's a tough skill for me to practice in the real world and getting very comfortable with speaking my desires completely changed the game in terms of having the confidence to vocalize what I want. It's definitely a necessary skill on here when starting an exchange with a new writing partner and repeated exposure to that 'negotiation' bit of written exchanges really helped. Being more assertive has made roleplay a lot more fascinating and fulfilling as I'm not hesitant to speak my mind in a productive manner. I think that's a really important 'real world' skill and I'm glad I got a chance to practice it.\n\nSo there you have it - those are my biggest takeaways so far and I'm still learning new things every day. Just thankful I found this place at the end of the day. Curious to hear from other people with experiences of self-discovery and thoughts on exploration in general.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! So nice to meet you. Welcome to the world of Pok\u00e9mon! My name is Anna Whitebeam, but everyone affectionately calls me the \"Pok\u00e9mon Professor\"! This world is inhabited far and wide by creatures we call \"Pocket Monsters\", or Pok\u00e9mon for short. Some people have them as pets, others use them for battling. Me? I research and study Pok\u00e9mon and their behavior. Despite our best efforts, we still know so little about the friends we share our lives and homes with. Where do they come from? Why do they listen to us, and understand our commands? Researchers like myself dedicate their lives to finding out answers to questions you may never have considered while battling and trading with your friends.\n\nProfessors tend to specialize in certain fields. For instance, the famed Professor Rowan from the Sinnoh region specializes in researching how and why Pok\u00e9mon evolve into different forms. Professor Kukui, from the sunny Alolan islands, has a specialty in the moves Pok\u00e9mon use in battle. He certainly has a knack for getting hit by them, too!\n\nMy own specialty is Pok\u00e9mon sexuality. It's the height of mystery when it comes to these creatures: barely anyone has seen a pair of Pok\u00e9mon breed, yet their eggs can be found all over. Furthermore, it's been shown that Pok\u00e9mon can breed with all kinds of species, not just their own. Even my own research has turned up remarkably little, almost as if the Pok\u00e9mon realize they are being watched.\n\nBut! No longer will my research be stopped. I've spent a year perfecting what I call the \"Attract Spray\". It works similarly to the common \"Repel\" sprays, but with an opposite effect. Although trainers would be wise not to use this spray on themselves. The pheromones I managed to reproduce *do* attract Pok\u00e9mon, but it drives them wild, hormonal, and ready to... well, you can fill in the blanks.\n\nToday, I'm finally ready to give my Attract Spray its' first official test run. You and I will go out into the fields, and I will test the spray's effectiveness on myself. Since I will be... occupied, I require your assistance to take notes. Of course, this research is completely scientific and professional. After all, what human on earth would want to be ravaged by a large, monstrous creature filled with unstoppable lust, armed with cocks unlike any known by man, potentially capable of pounding and orgasms out of your wildest dreams...? \n\nCertainly not me. *Definitely* not me. But it must be done. For... Science.\n\nNow then, may I ask... Are you a boy, or a girl?\n\n***\n\nHeya, thanks for reading! I'm looking for a roleplay partner who's into Pok\u00e9mon, and enjoys playing (or narrating) as a huge monster ravaging a human woman. This is a Pok\u00e9philia *only* prompt! I love the games more than the anime, so the closer our Pok\u00e9mon can get to actual monsters, the better.\n\nWe can do this in a multitude of ways! While I would enjoy someone who just plays as a Pok\u00e9mon of our choosing, I would really enjoy someone who joins me on my research trip(s). You would observe and narrate the highly ~~sexual~~ scientific events happening right in front of you as your favorite Professor gets her brain fucked out. You can play as a fellow researcher, my loyal assistant, or (even better) a newbie Pok\u00e9mon Trainer who records everything we do in their brand new Pok\u00e9dex. I'm open to playing with boys and girls on this: so long as I end up lustfully pounded by whatever Pok\u00e9mon we find! Of course, if you want to be a test subject, male or female, we can eventually switch it up.\n\nKinks: large cocks and insertions, crazy cocks (knots, barbs, etc!), anal, oral, double penetration, double anal/vaginal, extreme cum, clothed sex and cute outfits\n\nLimits: Blood/gore, scat, watersports, ageplay (all characters 18+)\n\nI'd like to play with someone equally literate and descriptive. I enjoy playing in first-person, and I typically send 2-3 paragraphs with each response. There is a *slight* catch: I'm a very slow responder. In fact, I'm about to nod off to bed, so take your time responding to me as I won't be getting back to you for at least 8 hours. However, I will always do my best to send you a message a day, and inform you whenever I'm late. Pok\u00e9mon fans in for the long haul are most appreciated!\n\nIf you've come this far and are not turned off yet: great! Send me a message and let's talk our roleplay over a bit to make things as smooth as possible. What's your favorite Pok\u00e9mon? What will you play as? Which region do you like, and which games are your favorite? We have a long period of fun ahead of us, so let's get to know each other.\n\nHope to hear from you boys and girls! Gotta fuck 'em all~",

No control over women, uncontrollably horny girls or sluts free for use.\n\nI just want to feel desired by the opposite gender. We could meet anywhere or have been friends for decades. I don't want a specific attitude, just how you would treat someone you desire. \n\nA loving relationship would feel nice, but a one night-stand does the trick too.\n\nYou might have guessed it, but I'm not the most popular guy around. I'm funny and I do have a bunch of friends, I'm not some recluse, but that doesn't mean I feel like girls actually *want* me, if that makes sense.\n\nI can give you a description of myself if you're interested.

My mouth is watering at the thought of having a nice, hard cock fill it up nicely. I just need to feel its smooth skin moving between my full, soft lips. And I need to look up at you and see that look of pure pleasure on your face.\n\nI want you to sit back, relax, and let me suck your dick down for you. I want to make everything better for you, to make you feel special. I want you to close your eyes as my lips are squeezing around your hard cock. I want you to pull my hair, push my head down gently and moan my name so loud the entire neighborhood knows I'm sucking your dick. I want to pleasure you with my mouth all night long until you're all nice and relaxed... at which point you can fall asleep with your cock or your balls in my mouth.\n\nFeel free to take advantage of me. Because you know I'll just keep sucking your dick no matter what you do. You can call me names, talk me down, tell me I'm the dirtiest cock sucking slut you've ever known. Maybe some other girls would get offended, think of getting up and leaving. Not me. In fact, I'll keep sucking you off faster and deeper. No matter what, I'll stay on my knees, longing for nothing more than your pleasure. And your moans of pleasure, especially the ones calling my name, will only have me even more excited to please you.\n\nBonus: a little something for you to better imagine my lips wrapped around your nice, hard cock. Or thick, warm strands of your cum covering my face. \\&lt;3\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/fAr6mOb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/fAr6mOb.jpg)",

            "selftext": "Oh that summer heat, those sandy feet, that beachy bum, and that yellow sun.\n\nIt was the annual. Camping with your mates out by beach Brindy; a secluded little spot that was a hand-me-down from your parents time. We had to cut through some harsh bush to get here, but it was the tits. No one around in the little bay. We could settle the tents, stoke up a fire, and enjoy the waveless beach for a week, while our car's paint peeled back under the rays.\n\nThis year we were more. We were seven; four girls, and three guys, but midway through, John and Hugh got pulled back, by an emergency, and their girlfriends went with them.\n\nSo it was just us. Me, you, and Amber. We had said 'fuck em' to our deserters and with our small tent left, we allowed you to stay in it, providing you didn't get cheeky.\n\nThe smell of sea salt stained the taste of the beer just right. They went down easy, and soon, what had started as drying on the towels with our heads in the shade of the tent had ended with two slightly tipsy girls in bikinis laying next to you as the sun set.\n\nIt started with some kisses, and soooo many giggles. Pecks and squeezes, laughter, and one split beer was all it took to get your swim trunks off. That cock was laying up against your body and our hands just went to it like a magnet. Offffh, Amber was just all over you! But I was too... \n\nSoon the laughter had died though. Now it had been replaced with more serious, more lustful embracing as you went between kissing me and Amber while we pulled on your cock. Amber found herself on top of you, and there was not one thing stopping any of us from putting it inside her. She moaned and threw her hair back as she began going up and down on you. I had your attention though, and we made out while she rode you.\n\nYou did me doggy-style on the towel and you gave it to me nice and hard. I was surprised how long you lasted, and you said you wanted to finish on our bodies. I laid next to Amber as you fucked her with her legs spread. I asked if I could jerk you off on her and you smiled and agreed, so I went behind you as you fucked her. \n\nWhen you were almost there, and when you climaxed, you pulled out and I jerked your dick as it spat rope after rope up her body.\n\nYou were utterly done, but so fucking sated. And then I ran my tongue up her stomach, licking up the salt and the semen as you both gawked at me.\n\nI got on top of her and begun making out, and all you could do was watch in complete triumph as our pussies stared back at you on that beautiful Brindy beach.",

            "selftext": "Seriously, my bank account is l-o-v-i-n-g having a roommate.  Even better, you don't leave dishes to \"soak\" (seriously, guys?) indefinitely, you don't leave wet towels on the floor, and your room is clean and your bed is made, and you keep to yourself.  You've had friends over *maybe* twice and both times they've been gone by 10 pm.  Perfect.\n\nWe like each other well enough, I think.  We exchange pleasantries and have even commiserated about the plight of capitalism taking us out of our more creative pursuits.  I often spend my weekends writing, attempting to change up the scenery to get my creative juices flowing, which leaves you an eligible bachelor in an empty apartment for most Saturday afternoons.\n\nI like our routine.  I like routine in general.  So, when I forgot my favorite mug, I knew it would throw off my whole day, and I drove the ten minutes back to the apartment to get it.  I popped into the kitchen and grabbed it off the drying rack (you washed this, didn't you?  Perfect.) and went back to the door.  I was stopped by a voice ringing out from your bedroom.\n\nI thought at first you were talking to me, so I stepped quickly to the hall, but I was made clearly aware that you were not, in fact, talking to me.\n\n\"Take it, take it all the way down.  Yes, just like that.  Oh my god, you feel so fucking good.\"  \n\nMy stomach dropped three floors and I blanched, realizing you were with someone, and your bedroom door was slightly open.  I kept meaning to call maintenance for you about that door that wouldn't latch, but I forgot...\n\nI was going to take my leave and never ever discuss this again, when I heard something familiar.\n\n\"Oh god, Alex, your mouth is amazing.\"  \n\nNow my face was red and my heart pounding.  That's *my* name.  I was frozen.  I came to my senses quickly enough, and realized that it's not *that* uncommon of a name.\n\n\"I've wanted this for so long, baby.  Seeing you walking around this apartment has made me crazy.\"\n\nWell...\n\nI admit at first I was somewhat appalled.  You weren't unattractive by any means.  I just never considered it.  We were roommates, end of story.  But I kept listening, creeping to the door, peeking in.  You had a fleshlight - a mouth it seemed.  Your cock slid in and out of it, your brief pauses between telling me how good I felt being filled by the sounds of the toy sucking you.\n\nYour head lolled back and I could tell you were close.\n\n\"You want it on your face, babe?  Good - here it comes.\"  \n\n+++\n\nI watched you for weeks.  It was hot.  Not just watching you cum, but hearing you, seeing you use me to make yourself feel good, being the object of someone's fantasy.  It was amazing, and I'd masturbate furiously to the thought when I was alone in my bedroom - the door that latched always closed.\n\nThis routine went on until one Saturday, by some divine intervention, you turned your head, and our eyes met, your cock buried deep in the toy - deep in *me.*\n\n---------\n\nWhat do we do about this?\n\nKinks:  being vocal about how much you like fucking me, watching men masturbate\n\nLimits:  degrading names and paying rent late ",

            "selftext": "While you dig through your wallet, I check my phone. I don't wanna be late for a lecture class I have scheduled in half an hour. But I don't think I will be.\n\nYou hand me your money like I'm your dealer, and I snicker quietly to myself at the thought.\n\nAs I stuff your cash into the back pocket of the jeans that hug my ass nearly too tightly for the wad of bills to fit, I wonder if this whole arrangement counts as findom.\n\nI glance up at you, smirk and rolling my eyes as you try so hard not to give away your nervousness while undo your belt and shuck your trousers and underwear down around your thighs. You glance over my shoulder as if you expect someone to be coming down the other end of the alley behind the food services building. I don't share your curiosity. Nobody ever comes back here, not at this time of the day.\n\nYou're slightly more impressive than my other customers of the past few days. A little thicker, just a touch lengthier. As it flops free, I glance up at with a smirk and a raised eyebrow. Your cheeks flush and I snicker again. You're almost cute, in a pitiful sort of way.\n\n\"Oh. Good for you.\" I chuckle to myself. My kind words wrapped in my dismissive tone seems to be doing something for you, as your softie begins it's normally scheduled growth spurt.\n\nI crack my knuckles, readying myself for the task at hand.\n\n\"Hands behind your back. Move them, and we're done.\" I instruct sternly, as though I'd actually like you to try and disobey so as to give me an excuse to leave. Which isn't entirely wrong. As I speak, I lift a paw to my X-Men t-shirt and slip it under the v-neck collar. From the t-shirt and the bra under it, I pull a pale, creamy udder centered by a rosy, puffy nipple.\n\nI've been told that my tits look like Arabelle Raphael's, which is quite the compliment in my opinion.\n\nI giggle softly as you comply with my order, though your eyes are drawn to my bare, exposed breast in a way that almost makes me believe you might produce a third hand to grope me with.\n\nI pull the same hand up to my face as I part my lips and loll my tongue forward like a Spring-Breaker posing for a drunken beach photo. I drag my pale palm over my slobbery tongue, wetting it as though in preparation to deliver a particularly well-earned spanking. And I am delivering a sort of spanking, though it's the sort associated with primates as opposed to bare bottoms.\n\nI glance back up at you as I reach below and wrap my drool-lubricated hand around your growing hard-on. You're looking away. I supposed it's natural for some people to feel shame over paying for it, or even *it* in general. It isn't in my nature to feel shame, so I just smile and watch you chew your lip as I give you a gentle squeeze.\n\nMy bared breast jiggles like a plate of Jell-O in an earthquake as I begin to stroke in my usual fashion; vertical pumps marked by corkscrew motions of the wrist, with grip-strength varying at different points along the shaft. I call the technique the Cockscrew. And as I stroke here, standing beside you, your grunts and groans begin to bubble up to the surface like heated air from a pot of water on a stovetop.\n\n\"You can moan if your want, but keep it down.\" I advise keenly, smirking to myself. I like the moans. It gives me something to think about later in the shower, and it reminds me that I'm just as killer at this as I think I am. The chatty customers are the really annoying ones.\n\nI'm trading flesh, not conversation.\n\nI keep stroking you for what seems like hours. It's probably only more like 10 or 15 minutes. It's not totally abnormal, the nervous usually take longer to finish. I pick up speed at various points, switching hands here and there when I begin to cramp up with additional palm-licking required. I get meager tastes of your precum, and it's not awful.\n\nSomebody likes fruit, I see.\n\n\"Tell me when your close.\" I warn, trying to keep the impatience out of my voice. Me getting bitchy won't help your finish. I mean, probably not. Not as jumpy as you are, at least.\n\nAnd speak of the devil.\n\nIt isn't two minutes after you've been told that you're muttering about your orgasm being right around the corner. Your voice is almost pained. At this point, I almost feel sorry for you. But such is this line of work.\n\n*\"I-I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna cum.\"*\n\n&gt; \"It's $30 for a full one, $20 for a ruined one. Seeing the goods is extra, touching is a non-negotiable negative. Anything besides the hands costs triple-digits.\" I explain the menu to you, sounding a bit like a mathematics teacher explaining sort of transitive algebraic equation. I cross my arms as you look a bit flustered and pull your wallet out. You glance between the two of us a few times before I roll my eyes. \"Hurry up. Cash only.\"\n\nI stroke for a half-second longer, making sure to tip your over the edge sufficiently before slipping my hand free of your in a final, much stronger upward stroke off of your dick. For a few seconds, all is quiet and still. Including my boob.\n\nThen the grunts resume as your less-than-stimulated cock begins to spurt like a fountain in an excruciatingly near-pleasureless,  humiliating orgasm. Your warm goo of ivory spits from your piss-slit like people out of a burning building and splatters on the pavement below. You shoot three or fours ropes before being reduced to a gentle dribble.\n\nAnd I quietly laugh at you all the while, because it's funny. The way your face twists up in a hilarious mix of deprived anger and orgasmic bliss. The way I took all of your pleasure away with hardly an effort at all. And the way you're not doing a damn thing about it.\n\nI supposed it wasn't a total loss that you only had $25 instead of $35.\n\nStepping up onto my tiptoes, I plant a small, gentle peck against your check as you pant softly and slowly regain your composure. I reach down again and press down against your freshly-milked boner with a single index finger before slipping it away and leaving your dick to bounce and bob a few times while I coo devilishly up at you.\n\n\"Better than nothing, big guy. Right?\"\n\nI chuckle again and turn from you, stepping big up the alley as you let out a tiny, near-silent whimper. Poor you. I turn back over my shoulder at you without stopping and give you a final reminder.\n\n\"Whoever sent you to me can give you my number. Bring more money next time, unless you enjoy limping away like a bitch.\"\n\nI giggle yet again, and disappear from the mouth of the alley back into the real world. Checking my phone once more, I smile slyly to myself.\n\nLooks like I'm going to make it to your lecture.",

            "selftext": "I lived the majority of my life sheltered from the rest of the world. Around other people like myself. You know, pointy ears and all? And not those tall, super thin graceful looking elves, either. If you were picturing those classy, overly formal elves with their heads always tilted back so they're looking down at you with a sneer? You're picturing the wrong kind. None of those kinds around my part. I'm the other kind! (Not a halfling or a gnome, don't say something so insensitive!) We're short. Like, *short, short*. Of course, I'm cursed to just fall *slightly* beneath five feet. Psh, I've heard humans mumbling about women turning them down for being unable to reach six feet? *Please*. You don't have to be helped \u2013 no, sorry, *lifted* up into a carriage, do you? Didn't think so.\n\nAnyhow! When I ventured out of the forest to see the world and explore, I quickly came to find that human men absolutely adored how small I was. They were always beaming at the sight of me. A few teasing remarks with big grins before they took in the view of my curves. Now, being a short girl certainly has it's perks when it comes to the body. Curves just look *that* much better. Full, plush backside that looks so juicy and grope-worthy. Thick thighs that look so inviting, and then that impressive bust? It drives these human men crazy. Then they often take in how much they tower over me which naturally leads to the idea of how *easily* they could lift me and do what they like. And then, it goes without really saying \u2013 the ears are always a cute touch. That, and it makes it easier for a gal to save some coins. Travelling is quite efficient when exploring the world considering these men are paying for my food and drink! A nice bonus.\n\nBut, there's more than the looks that get them going. The same goes for me. The scent of human men? It drives me crazy. I get worked up, especially if we're engaged in... lewd activities. The scent of the man's musk, that heavy cock and that seed? For an elf? It's *thrilling*. You could say... I'm addicted. But it seems to work the same way with humans! I can't recall the number of times a human has told me I'm the sweetest scent they've ever inhaled, or the most delicious taste they've experienced when they're lapping me up. That simply leads me to believe that humans and elves are meant to be together!\n\nAfter my first experience, I can't seem to get enough. I nearly want to climb any human man I come across like the ancient tree in the forest in my homeland! I know it's slutty, but... I really can't help myself. You have to understand I've been surrounded by males that are often my height. These human men get so *damn* tall that it's drool worthy. Matter of fact, I happened to enter the same carriage as this human man, going for the same destination... and fuck, he was just too handsome! In the privacy of the carriage, I couldn't simply let our paths end once one of us stepped out at our destination. So, I did the rational thing a good elf would do. I went onto my knees, pretending to peek my head out the curtain to take in the view of the country side. It just happened that my little dress didn't entirely cover my backside... and not a single thing was worn underneath. I wasn't able to see what the man's reaction was, but the sound of him coughing up his water was sign enough that he noticed. I suspected that he stared, being polite and not saying a thing to embarrass me... But then I reached back, rolling the dress right over my hips to expose that fat, bubbly backside to him with a little wiggle in place. \n\nFast forward, and I have a thick, human cock jackhammering into my backside with his hands holding my hips so tight to feel my plush curves as he used my tiny pucker. Thankfully, the bumpy ride and the sound of shifting supplies kept from the coachman from hearing the sound of those hips smacking into my plump butt. It was even worse when he pulled the carriage aside in a tiny town to pick up a requested supply. The risk of having anyone seeing or hearing us was why, especially when my new human friend was insistent that we don't stop! Not that I would have stopped considering I can't get enough of thick, human cock. It certainly didn't help that I was like a damn squeak toy with such loud, high pitched whimpers from the pleasures but that's all solvable with a hand over my mouth... Mostly. \n\nThe high of that entire tryst only keeps me fired up for more, and more.\n\nWhether it's riding the face of the bard who sang the most precious song while strumming his lyre in a tavern, or choking on the meaty cock of the town's weaver so he'll kindly tailor me new (free) clothes... I can't see myself stopping, I'm addicted to these human men and they're always so happy to indulge in my filthy needs. Not only do I get to go from town to town, explore these magnificent cities and meet new people... I get to experience some very much needed fucks I've been deprived of all my life. I wonder who I'll come across in my adventures today.\n\n---\n\nMe - small, thicc elf girl. You - tall, strong human man. Big height difference. Plenty of lewd, rough sex and butt stuffing. You can play who you like! Whether it's the man in the carriage if you want to write that scene with me, or the bard, weaver, etc. Open to ideas! It's a ridiculous fantasy world so we can get as silly as you like. My only request is you be a human. \n\nMy kinks - I just need a rough guy who's obsessed with ass. That's not too much to ask, is it? I love dirty talk, rough sex, anal, rimjobs, interracial, semi-public sex (holdthemoan sort of stuff), DP, face-fucking and creampies. The biggest kinks I need are being rimmed and anal. If those don't apply to you, I sadly won't be interested in writing at all. I also don't like my character written for at all, especially dialogue. If it's a small action to keep the story going forward, that's a-okay but full on actions/feelings/dialogues is a big no!\n\nAlso, feel free to check out my [profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/710ni7/f4m_whoryukens_profile/) with all my past ideas. If there\u2019s something else that catches your eye, I might be up for it!",

            "selftext": "The depraved sounds of flesh slapping against flesh filling the dimly lit gloomy stone room.\n\n\"God, FUUUUCK!\" the blonde crowned girl screamed out in primal lust, \"SHOVE that big fat Koopa meat into me!!\"\n\nShe was totally naked, her pink dress and frilly panties in a heap by the bed beside her, her body glistening with sweat in the torchlight. It was pressed into a large extravagant bed by the monster atop her. Easily *several* times her weight and over 2 feet taller than her, the yellow-skinned spiky-green-shelled menace crushed her into the bed. The King Koopa himself had his koopa cock, easily over 12 inches long and thicker than the arm of the girl he is plowing, forced inside her tight little cunt. Thick veins ran along the shaft, with bumps and ridges that made it the optimal tool for fucking and pleasing a woman. And here she was, begging for more of this monster's cock.\n\nHe let out a ground-shaking laugh, typical for a villain of his caliber. And why shouldn't he laugh? Here was his prize, the object of his obsession, after so many years. Here she was, in his bed, stuffed full of his cock, begging to be fucked. They had been at it for hours. The bed was drenched in their combined fluids. Her translucent watery girlcum and juices, his thick syrupy chunky sperm. Every time he thrust back inside her, more of his old jizz was forced out of her and jetted out around his cock and onto the bed. There was simply no room inside of her for it with his gargantuan bumpy cock.\n\nSurely that stupid red-hatted menace would show up any minute to ruin their good time, as *always*, Bowser thought to himself. Peach was doing one of her classic, \"Help help Mario, I've been kidnapped!\" shticks. It'd been going on for years now. He was seriously starting to wonder when the little guy would catch on. Whether he did or not, Bowser didn't really care.\n\nBut sure enough, speak of the Devil, a Koopa Troopa marched through the door.\n\n\"Your Majesty! Your Majesty! He's here!\"\n\nPeach let out a groan of despair at hearing this, and Bowser rolled his eyes. He sat up off of her, inch after inch of his textured giant cock sliding out of her greedy pussy. It seemed like it didn't want to let him go, the insides of her pussy gripping him tightly as he pulled out. If he wasn't careful, he'd give her a prolapse again...\n\n**SCHLORP**\n\nOut pops the enormous Koopa Cockhead with a satisfyingly lewd and wet sound. He admires her gaping hole for a minute before slapping her hard on the ass with a large clawed hand.\n\n\"Get up. Get dressed. He'll be here soon.\"\n\nShe groaned in protest and lay for another minute, then resigned herself to her fate and crawled out of bed to her pile of clothes. She began dressing until finally, she looked like Princess Peach again. Although with messy hair and covered in sweat. She could also feel gravity doing its work on the gooey Koopa cum inside her womb, slowly pulling it down into her pussy then no-doubt into her panties after awhile. But she was used to it. She loved being with Mario while practically oozing Bowser's seed out of her holes.\n\nThe same old song and dance. Bowser would be \"defeated\", Peach would be \"saved, and Mario would be the \"Hero\". \n\nBut Mario never knew the truth...\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nHey there fellow nerds! So I've been wanting to write this for awhile and just wanted to hash it out. Sooo I'm not *totally* sure of how I want to write this. But I really love the idea of Bowser fucking Peach and cuckolding Mario! Whether Mario knows, finds out, etc, is all up in the air for me. As is Peach's consent. In this bit she's obviously addicted to that big Koopa cock, but maybe you'd like to start at the beginning, where she's forced to take it, then realizes how much she loves it? Mind-broken by that huge thick Koopa dick!\n\nOr if you're not into NTR, maybe we don't involve Mario at all and it's just Bowser and Peach. Or maybe you want to play *only* Mario and play out how he thinks and feels watching Peach get fucking demolished by Bowser's huge dong. Who knows! I'm very amenable to almost anything. Anyway I hope you liked reading it and I'll post my kinks in the comments as I usually do!",

I am open to try most kinks. But my limits are under 18, scat, gore, and incest. Open to most settings as well; home, hottub, pool, shopping, jogging trail, parking lot, shopping, car, etc. \n\nFinally, I don't expect or require multiple paragraphs.. they actually might be overwhelming at first. Just get your point across and make it sexy. And my friend mightymilf warned me that I might get flooded with responses (her words, not my arrogance) so please include any gif if you can. If it isn't an overwhelming evening, they will simply be enjoyed.. but if it is, they will get first consideration. \n\nThank you",

Let me know what you prefer role wise. Either way, I want to be sent back home with the taste of your sweaty nuts on my lips and tongue. It seemed like I was sweet and innocent when you originally met me, but the truth is I'm just another slut with a loose pussy who's quick to get on her knees. Really, I'm beneath being a slut, most sluts wouldn't lick your nuts after a long day or a workout... \n\nKinks: Daddy issues, sucking cock, worshiping your nuts, being a cumslut, bareback sex, anal, seduction, flirting, submission, humiliation, cheating, having sex for money, and being treated like a total slut. I also like to play somewhat realistic, at least as much as we can be on here for it to work. \n\n(Note: If you're into the money thing, I am not 'down' on finances at all in this play. I will be interested because I'm greedy and a whore, not because I need money badly. I've also gotten fucked for money in real life before, so if you're curious about that, feel free.)",

We need to go into hibernation for months to cultivate our little babies inside us. Well, the eggs of our little babies, anyway. And it certainly looks like I've done quite the job!\n\nEven though right now I'm not much more than an amorphous violet blob sitting beneath the surface of the water, I can feel the center of me\u00a0loaded\u00a0with a clump of tightly-packed eggs. Each is a little more that two inches across and a shade darker in color than me. I start to count them, and nearly explode with joy.\n\nTwo dozens eggs! That's a big new personal record for me. My previous record was only 10. Clearly all those fluids I took in before hibernation paid off with how many eggs I had floating around inside me.\n\nI slowly started to pull myself together into my preferred shape as I drifted towards the shoreline. A bulbous extension refined into delicate arms and fingers. The forward-most part of me wrapped in on itself, creating a facsimile of flowing hair and cute, feminine features. The rest of me took the shape of a body, and with so much left over, there was a lot to distribute! Huge, pillowy breasts took shape on my assumed chest, pert nipples jutting forward. A large, voluptuous ass formed and was soon followed by an equally thick pair of legs. Most Goo Girl's didn't bother with legs, but I liked them. It was a nice way to give a good first impression to most land-dwellers; two legs was a lot better than a cute girl with a blob for a lower half!\n\nI take a few steps out of the water and nearly fall over; I had barely even noticed my eggs! How unmotherly of me. Right below my chest, my belly jutted out in front of me, my clutch of eggs contained within. With a small coo, I let my hands drift through my belly, holding and caressing my babies in a way only a Goo Girl could. Right! Need to find these guys a home.\n\nWith a little huff, I move some of my mass right between my legs. A single, smooth tube extends out from me, pulsing and throbbing. I gingerly grab it, giving it a few tugs. Sure enough, I see a single egg drift down towards my new phallus, lining up at it's base all ready to go.\n\nI giggle as I move the little one back with its siblings. \"Not yet, you.\" With a little shake, my shaft disappears back into my body as well. \"First, we have to find you babies a warm body!\"\n\n-----------\n\nSo, are you that warm body? Say hi and find out!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Word had spread, from town to town by traveling bards who sang the tale of the most beautiful sight that the old, new, and every god in between had blessed the lands with. Some played ballads of heart break, knowing there wasn't anything greater that they would ever experience again, while the others played the most jovial tune they could create to bring awareness to the uneducated masses. The religious folk were angry, calling for followers to remain vigilant and focus with their prayers, begging them not to anger the gods who would be forgotten if not worshiped daily. Yet, the word that this would be the most promising image that any man would see? How could they turn down the chance?\n\nPeople would come to Anzen to see all on their own. Despite the surrounding area being a grueling and harsh desert, they fought through their struggles to see what they were promised. They would be led through the streets, doing what they could to walk through the shade of the structures around them to avoid the harsh, burning gaze of the sun they've felt for far too long. Once they arrived? The thirst for water had been quenched, forgetting about their fatigue or how they spent nearly all their coin to arrive at this destination. It had been life changing and invigorating at the same time. A tavern...? What inside a tavern could be so magnificent? Once *you* arrived, you understood.\n\nYour eyes widened at the sight before you. Was this an illusion of some sort? It must have been conjured up by the most powerful wizard known to man. Sorcery was the only explanation that made the view possible. Never in your life, had you *ever* laid your eyes on such a heavenly vision that had left you utterly speechless. One glance and you knew not a single moment for the rest of your days would overcome this. \n\nNot the day you held your precious children and grandchildren. Not *even* the day you see your future wife in her wedding gown, spun with glimmering gold threads made from the finest tailor in Phomina! Nothing. You could try and search your mind for a memory, perhaps even try to imagine something you have always wished to experience, and it *still* wouldn't be better than this. A personal harem? A group of women worshiping you wouldn't measure up to the sight before you. All the pleasure several whores could muster up for you wouldn't entice you in comparison. \n\nYou wouldn't have been surprised if the land's most dedicated artists had arrived solely to paint a portrait of delicious perfection, or attempting to recreate such an image with a sculpture to forever capture and immortalize the breathtaking beauty.\n\nAn elf. You hadn't seen one in all your years of living considering their population had dwindled down with the majority of them casting themselves away into heavily forested areas. For a mere moment, you may have doubted that this was an authentic elf before you. Why was she not incredibly tall with the slimmest figure? But the twitch of those pointed ears reassured you that this wasn't some cruel illusion. A full bodied, petite elf that commanded all of your attention was before you and put on display.\n\nYou were fixated as those hands started to move, dragging those fingernails against her own flesh, from the bottom of those full, round cheeks teasingly. Her fingertips were pressing into the plushness, giving you an idea of how it was softer than the freshest dough brought to the most decorated bakers. Your mouth watered as she slowly tugged her thick cheeks upwards only to let go, allowing the thickness to fall back into place with such an enticing, hypnotizing jiggle of the flesh. There were gasps filling the room, others just as drawn in by the view as you were. \n\nHer head turned, glancing back over her shoulder with the most adorable nibble at the corner of her bottom, plush lip. She was a vision of innocence despite her teasing moments ago. And then just like that, her large eyes meet yours with a soft whine from her lips. You aren't sure where to look. Torn, between the choice of that gorgeous face or that thick rump that had you so enamored with the woman.\n\nHer hands were sliding over the thick, bubbly backside while lightly squeezing once again, letting her fingertips sink into her flesh. With her spread fingers, she applied pressure solely so you could see the plushness spilling out between her small fingers. It looked so incredibly soft and smooth to the touch that you found yourself hungry for more. You'd do with a simple kiss at that rear... Maybe one bite? No, no, definitely a long lick over it... You couldn't settle on a choice if you were given the offer. These were the moments that true scholars argued over. What *would* you do if you had one action allotted to you?\n\nJust as you thought you settled on a choice, the temptress only got more lewd. With her hand spread, she scooped up those round cheeks, and slowly but surely *tugged*. With her cheeks pried apart, she held herself all so every man would get to see the most gorgeous sight known to mankind. That pink, puckered rosebud that had your jaw dropped. As if the view wasn't enticing enough, you could see that tiny pucker simply winking for attention, greedily begging for a tongue, finger or something *much* thicker. She held herself open as long as she could, although the soft, bubbly cheeks were spilling from her grip, threatening to block the view of the tease's most prized possession. She did let go momentarily, letting her backside bounce right back into place only to slap her hands against her skin. Repeatedly, smack after smack rang out with her small handprints eventually starting to form in a shade of red against that perfect skin. You knew it would look even better had it been *your* handprints developing on her rear.\n\nHer back had the perfect arch in it which resulted in that thick rump being pressed outwards, nearly hanging off the edge of the decorated golden bar stool she was seated upon. As if the sight hadn't been tempting enough, circling around her would show how those plush thighs flared out against the stool and that's when you realized *just* how short she is. Such a petite, curvy elf with a figure you could easily lift to your heart's content.\n\n\u201cIs it not magnificent? Have you ever laid eyes upon such a beauty?\u201d An older gentleman dressed in the finest cloth spoke out to all the spectators. \u201cFor shame... To think you must return to your wives or whores after seeing... *her*. And that is all you've done! *Seen* her. Imagine her scent, the *taste*! You haven't even heard her voice yet! I tell you, all the aches in my body had vanished the moment her melodious voice spoke my name.\u201d As he motioned over the elf, a man nearly bolted from his position for a desperate touch of the young woman. The elf didn't budge from her spot, not even an ounce of worry in her eyes as a burly guard had easily intercepted and carried the belligerent man from the establishment. \u201cThe last man who had the audacity to touch her without permission had his hands... Well, it's safe to say he wouldn't ever lay a hand on her again.\u201d A chuckle left the strange man's lips as a warning. \u201cLet us focus on more impor-.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much for the elf harlot?!\u201d A voice yelled from the group.\n\nA gasp from the man in charge who's eyes went wide before growling out a response. \u201cBite your blasphemous *tongue*. You are graced by the presence of the *last* elf in all the land, and this is how you speak? Out with him.\u201d With a snap of his fingers, he was motioning for the men to drag the disrespectful man out. \u201cBesides, you would not be able to afford even a moment of her time with one glace at your clothing.\u201d A shake of his head before he cleared his throat to return to a more kind tone. \n\nIt had you wondering... Could this *truly* be the last elf? Wouldn't there be more precautions around her? Why would she be offering herself up like this? But those thoughts were drowned out by your need to touch, kiss and grope over that perfect body. You did momentarily pry your eyes away from that body, downwards to the floor and that's when you noticed the *absurd* amount of coins spilled at the base of the stool. \n\n\u201cWould any of you fine men be interested in being more... formally being introduced to this beauty?\u201d He asked with a devilish grin and a lift of his brow. The response was... obvious. Loud, boisterous cheers from the men eager to be acquainted with the maiden? Goddess? before them. \u201cAll you need... Is to pay *fifty* gold coins! The mere price of fifty for the experience that will follow you into your next life!\u201d The salesman exclaimed, although he wasn't finished there. \u201cAnd she *might* allow you to touch, and more!\u201d\n\n*Might*. That explains the amount of coins beneath her, and how she looked utterly untouched and pristine. It sounded like it was all a ploy, a set-up... A *scam*. It had to be! It was the logical explanation, but can you really argue logic while this tease is spreading her bubbly, luscious cheeks to be displaying the most gorgeous sight you've seen?! Before the men could retort with anger or call that it was all a lie aloud, the man spoke his final bit.\n\n\u201cO-Or! *OR*!\u201d His strained voice toppled over the others as he caught their attention again. \u201cOur lovely maiden can select the human of her choice... A-A demonstration of sorts... Give one lucky man a experience that would leave him the most cheery and fulfilled soul enlightened by the kindness of this elf. If you believe you are a worthy choice for our angelic elf, please... Feel free to make your plea to her. One at a time... *andforthreegoldcoinsonly.*\u201d\n\nFor the first time, the elf girl's ever so innocent expression nearly broke out into a smile and giggle, but she turned her head away in hopes of keeping her composure, or having anyone notice. Clearly, she was in on this in some way, yet it didn't stop men from lining up for a chance to convince her.\n\n---\n\nOof, I hope that made sense. Hopefully you read through that mess in it's entirety so I can hit you with this tldr. Elf on stool in tavern. Gorgeous and showing off that booty. It's amazing. Gold coins scattered at her feet. What was made to sound like the most fulfilling vision in the land is a scam. Elf girl is surely in on it, taking a cut of the profits with salesman. \n\nIt's pretty open ended for a reason, too! Do you convince her? Does she pick you? But! You don't even have to play the man I had chosen in the story. Maybe you're a god angered that you're being ignored... Literally, for a piece of ass and decide to see what's so special. Maybe a prince who's wondering why this elf tease is gaining so much popularity and being treated like royalty? I'm flexible! Nothing is set in stone. Does she get taken in a public space, right there for everyone to see? Do you take her to a private room? Choice is yours. I even left her looks pretty open because again, super flexible! The only things I need set in stone are; she's short/curvy, your character is tall and rugged.\n\nMy kinks - I just need a rough guy who's obsessed with ass. That's not too much to ask, is it? I love dirty talk, rough sex, anal, rimjobs, semi-public sex (holdthemoan sort of stuff), DP, face-fucking and creampies. The biggest kinks I need are being rimmed and anal. If those don't apply to you, I sadly won't be interested in writing at all. I also don't like my character written for at all, especially dialogue. If it's a small action to keep the story going forward, that's a-okay but full on actions/feelings/dialogues is a big no!\n\nAlso, feel free to check out my [profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/710ni7/f4m_whoryukens_profile/) with all my past ideas. If there\u2019s something else that catches your eye, I might be up for it!",

            "selftext": "To make up for my crimes against humanity yesterday:\n\nA common list of MILF\u2019s for your fucking pleasure.  Take your pick!\n\n\n**Kristie**\n\nKristie is new to the neighborhood, and she\u2019s all about reliving her high-school glory days.  She sucks off any dad who will come with her behind the bleachers at her kid\u2019s soccer game, her head disappearing under his beer belly as he holds up his windbreaker.  This dad will try to go home to fuck his wife later, but he blew his load all over Kristie\u2019s lipstick-too-pink-for-her-age lips, and the only way he\u2019ll get it up a second time in one day is to flip her over and pretend it\u2019s Kristie\u2019s fat ass-in-those-yoga-pants-she\u2019s-always-wearing that he\u2019s grunting into.  If you\u2019ve got a dad bod and are tired of fucking your wife and NOT having a MILF like Kristie, this is the girl for you.\n\n**Holly**  \n\nHolly looooves to have her pussy eaten, but she doesn\u2019t ever reciprocate.  She tells you that she will, and then kicks you out of her house, but lets you fuck her just often enough that you always answer her texts.  Plus, she pays for cable with all the premium channels, and you don\u2019t want to risk losing HBO Go, so you\u2019ll chow down like you care because Game of Thrones is starting soon.  Holly\u2019s some hot-shot attorney for some law firm you don\u2019t care about, and she\u2019s obsessed with staying fit and that fruit smoothie she insists is a \u201ctreat\u201d makes her pussy, at the very least, delightful to taste.  But this relationship is mostly for the HBO Go login; nobody likes not getting their dick sucked.     \n\n**Rachel**\n\nRachel is the single MILF of the group - awww.  She told you she loved you after a few traded text messages - one that included a series of pictures in a thong.  You said it back because lust is close enough.  She pinky swears she\u2019s on birth control, and you don\u2019t find anything suspect about how she insists you cum deep inside her.  Honestly, you\u2019re kind of into it, thinking about your thick cum right up against her ripe cervix.  You don\u2019t really want to be added to the list of baby daddies, but hey, it\u2019s true love and you\u2019re past the point of no return, just don\u2019t think about the consequences.\n\n**Amanda**  \n\nAmanda loves sucking her son\u2019s friends dicks (always over 18, she\u2019s not a monster) while he plays Fortnite.  She doesn\u2019t even bother to hide it anymore, he\u2019s so engrossed in the game he doesn\u2019t even notice his buddies are mouth-fucking his mom in the hall.  She gags and it makes you feel big, and isn\u2019t shy about those strings of saliva you\u2019ve forced from her mouth globbing down your balls.  Amanda also gives you beer because it\u2019s better to drink in the house than someplace else, and rides you while you\u2019re tipsy, her dark tanning bed thighs riddled with cellulite, but you don\u2019t care because she\u2019s getting your dick wet and when you finally get home and play video games of your own, every \u201cI was busy fucking your mom\u201d joke is 100% true. \n\n**Brandi**\n\nBrandi\u2019s always insisting she and her daughter are mistaken for sisters.  It comes up every time there\u2019s a gathering - with or without prompting.  She\u2019s obnoxious and you just. Can\u2019t. Bring. This. Woman. Down.  She loves being degraded, and you frankly want to fuck her skull until her eyes bulge, but the nastier you get, the more wet her pussy is, and that just makes you more creative. Her tits are always out, and her dyed blonde hair isn\u2019t fooling anyone into thinking she\u2019s actually her daughter, but that doesn\u2019t stop you from saying her daughter\u2019s name while you\u2019re balls deep in that waxed pussy.  \n\n**Ava**\n\nCute name, right?  Ava drinks too much wine and gets just this side of sloppy drunk and makes unfunny jokes about how her husband can\u2019t satisfy her, always with a wink like he hasn\u2019t noticed. She\u2019ll fuck any repairman, delivery man, passerby, you get it.  Basically, if you show her an erection, she\u2019s on it like white on rice. If you happen upon her when she *is* sloppy drunk, feel free to use her like a sex doll, she\u2019ll slur her way into consent.  She\u2019ll text you sheepishly the following day asking why her ass is sore.  You both know why it\u2019s sore, but you send her the video anyway of her begging you to \u201cput your balls in too!\u201d as you plowed her I-promise-I-never-do-this ass.  \n\n**Rebecca**\n\nDon\u2019t call her Becky.  She decided she wasn\u2019t Becky once she turned 30, and it\u2019s always a fun anecdote everyone\u2019s already heard.  Bex is your favorite unicorn.  She and your wife have threesomes with you, but really it\u2019s just a tenuous excuse for Rebecca to explore her same-sex tendencies without actually having to admit she\u2019s a lesbian.  She spends all her time hoarding your wife and making her cum better than you can, but that doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re still going to poke her with your dick as your wife denies any assertion that she might also be gay.  It\u2019s *your* fantasy, after all!  Just sit back and enjoy it! \n\n**Christina**\n\nChristina is the classic MILF.  Her body is toned, with breasts big enough to make your mouth water, and you wonder how her sports bra is containing them as she runs with her jogging stroller around the block.  Her hair is always perfect, swinging enticingly as she moves, and her smile lights up a room.  You want to believe she\u2019s an elegant cock-hungry set of holes, but she\u2019s just not picking up what you\u2019re putting down.  Your only hope is blackmail.  Surely a set of nudes she\u2019d forgotten she *didn\u2019t* send to her then-boyfriend now-husband (she was drunk, it was a mistake, he didn\u2019t mean anything!) taken from the cloud will do the trick. Hubby can\u2019t find out.  Each time she takes a load from you, you video it.  The evidence is mounting, and you\u2019ll be doing some mounting of your own. \n\n**Kelly**\n\nThe quintessential cougar, to be honest.  Kelly\u2019s husband works out of town, and she\u2019s home alone more often than not.  She\u2019s fit, tan, spends a fair amount of time on the treadmill and by the pool, and she\u2019s extremely aggressive.  The first time she told you to get on your hands and knees on the couch, you chuckled nervously, but when her tongue found your asshole, you saw stars.  Sucking your dick from behind was an added bonus at this point, but she just wouldn\u2019t stop after you\u2019d cum, treating you like livestock as she kept milking you and tongue-fucking your hole until you were hard again, moaning in ways you couldn\u2019t force out of the women you\u2019d bedded.  Why didn\u2019t you just move your body?  She rarely fucks you outright, preferring to get you off in unique and mildly sadistic ways, but hey - you could always just tell her no, right? \n\n\n_____\n\nI had a ton of fun writing these characters and they're meant to be extremely annoying.  I apologize to anyone I inadvertently offended who shares a name.  \n\nMake sure you tell me who you picked, otherwise it's dealer's choice.\n\nPrefer this in third person, and kinks should be apparent with the character.\n\nLimits on all:  anything involving kids, toilets, animals, or death \n",

I'm not looking for somebody to tell me I'm lying, so if you're not willing to play along, please don't message me!*\n\nI've been with my current boyfriend for 6 years now. He's totally sweet to me, he spoils me with gifts all the time, and has been doing my schoolwork since we got together in high school (we're both 21). \n\nIn all that time, I haven't given him so much as a handjob. I've seen his dick a few times, and it's as hilariously tiny as it is disgusting lol. I told him I want to wait till marriage, and as far as he knows, I'm a total virgin.\n\nIn reality, I'm a total slut. I've been fucking and sucking guys since we started dating years ago. I cheat on him so much, I couldn't even begin to give you a number of how many times I've actually done it. \n\nIronically, I got him to start wearing a chastity cage early on in our relationship, because I told him \"masturbation is basically cheating\". Of course, I still constantly tease him and wear outfits to show off my big full tits, knowing full well how much it hurts his tiny little dick when it tries to get hard in his little cage haha. \n\nSo, if you want to laugh at him with me, hear some stories, brainstorm some ideas for how to torture him more, and possibly jerk off to the tits he doesn't even get to look at (no nudes, sorry, but I'll still include sexy pics of myself don't worry ;) ), send me a message! PS - I **LOVE** when guys obsess over my tits, complimenting them like crazy, especially if they insult everything else about me!!\n\n**I LOVE insanely big cocks, so please feel free to exaggerate about your size! I won\u2019t question ANY number you give me!**",

Suffer the humiliation of me letting her in. Inviting her in.\n\nI answer the door. It is her.\n\n'Hi, Miss Grace!'\n\nMy son was right behind me. With my head swimming, I didn't even know he was there. He beams up at the woman at the door, his teacher, and she steps in and bends down to him.\n\n'Hi Seb! How are you buddy? Did you have fun at school today?'\n\nHe nods the affirmative and scampers upstairs to his room. I shut the door behind her and we stand together, alone in the hall for a moment.\n\n'Hi, Miss Grace.' I address her the same way my son does, but for different reasons.\n\n'Hi Dora,' her smile is friendly, not in the least bit sadistic. 'Is Stephen in his office?'\n\nI tell her that he is, and without another word she slips into the room where my husband is waiting for her, and closes the door. I ruminate for a few seconds on whether I would still be stood here, in this exact spot, with the same set of circumstances unfolding, had we just taken my son to another school. Then I think back to how long ago it was that I accepted Stephen cheating on me, and I realise the answer is probably yes.\n\nI walk into the kitchen and try to busy myself with making dinner. I'm chopping vegetables, meat, throwing everything in the stew. But my mind can't focus on the task at hand. So I do something I'm not supposed to. I slip into the pantry which backs onto Stephen's office, and listen.\n\nIt's sad, really. The lowest quality porno would provide more titillation than this. Rhythmic thudding which, had I not known precisely what it was, could have been anything. A few muffled grunts from Stephen here, or a light mewl from Miss Grace there, or completely indecipherable words spoken. But it's enough. My pussy is flooded, and my fingers are thrusting in and out with the sheer humiliation of my pathetic situation. I get close very quickly, and even edge for a few moments, but I don't cum. Christ, I'd be in enough trouble if she even found out I was listening in.\n\nThe phone buzzes. Shit. Much like the doorbell, I know what that is too. I leave the pantry, and on my phone is the message I was expecting.\n\nStephen: We're ready for you now.\n",

            "selftext": "I am intended for breeding.\n\nMind you, that isn't how I define myself. I like to paint, abstract mostly. I have a particular talent for gardening. I can speak French and Italian. If i were asked to describe myself honestly, I would say I am a dreamer, a plant and animal lover, a nurturer, an artist.\n\nWhat everyone else sees, however, is a hyper-fertile fuck toy.\n\nThe actual political history doesn't matter, unless you're into that sort of thing. Suffice to say, once owning humans was no longer strictly illegal, things changed. Just like porn is the reason VHS really took off, human depravity was a firestart for owning other people. Sure a house cleaner you don't have to pay is convenient. But what if you had an outlet for desires you couldn't ask your wife or husband, or simply wanted variety that wouldn't complain? Of course it was a slippery slope for a lot of things. Prostitution was less \"the oldest profession\" and more like a stable where you could pay to ride something that belonged to another. Marriages were interesting. Was it a marriage open to the use of slaves? Could both husband and wife have them? \n\nIt didn't take very long for more creative uses of slaves to reach peak popularity. Pregnancy ruins your body. Some women still found it important to bear their own, but for many among the elite, a sort of twisted Victorian way emerged. Getting heavy with child was for those too poor to foist it on someone else. Governesses, often slaves, would manage children while the parents could be less bothered by the young ones, unless they sought to play with them. A slave could be chosen for genetics and demeanor to bear your child with little negative consequence to you. They could be the wet nurse, or another could be used. Some women were brought into the family as the breeder, other times they were used once and no connection was ever reestablished. \n\nThat led to people like me after a couple of generations. I was, for all intents and purposes, bred for my genetics. Like a show dog, I have a certain pedigree that my breeder can tempt interested parties with. My bloodlines have an established history of fertility, intelligence, good health, easy demeanor, and beauty. As I understand it, there is a slim chance of my not getting pregnant when matched with a healthy male. I'm fuckable through my pregnancy, and it is expected that I will bear as many children as my owner wishes, when I am eventually bought. My master asks that either one child is sent back to him for continued breeding, or that I am bred once by a stud and that child is sent back... And if my owner grows tired of me, he sends me back to my breeder, who can figure out what to do with me.\n\nI also like poetry. I have a particular love of Tennyson.\n\nI am intended for breeding, and not for the layman. My breeder specializes in appealing to those who can afford me, which is to say the wealthy. I've been carefully raised in the most secure and high class of environments for a slave, to be sure that I will insert well into a rich household. All my life, my place, my duty has been bored into my thoughts. When I have been punished, it has been in ways to not leave a physical mark. And because blithe, unassuming breeders are in vogue, my master raised me like a favorite ward, only exposed very carefully to others, my chastity closely guarded as I was trained to please men and women, often between reading books in a deep chair by the picture window in the apartments I was given to live in. No one wants a dog with emotional baggage, flinching at men in hats or cowering at the newspaper. So I was raised gently, and with detached affection. If my owner wished to be rough with me, he could pay to do so.\n\nI don't look as smart as I am. I avidly read philosophy, and particularly enjoy the pre-Socratics, but thanks to my gorgeous parents, it's easy to assume I am both pure and vapid. I'm small, tight and petite aside from the womanly curve of my hips and the generous globes of my breasts. I am not out of proportion, but I have the hourglass of a woman who can bear children with those hips, and suckle a fat, happy baby at my breast as well as I can suck a cock with my dick-sucking lips. Big hazel eyes are framed with dark lashes, and my thick, luxurious hair is the color of dark walnut. My natural pout easily earns admirers. Frankly, it isn't uncommon for a breeder like me to have plenty of men who fawn over her, ones who end up at the parties I attend with my master, but not wealthy enough to buy me. When richer, more established men lean back in their leather chairs and grunt like bears as I suck them off at parties, they are the ones standing rock hard in the corner imagining carrying me off somewhere.\n\nEven as I sit at my favorite window, peering out at the hyacinths that were planted for me two springs ago, I know there are men stroking themselves to their memory of me, but frankly i do not care about them. I am preoccupied with what my master told me at breakfast as he pinched my nipples and admired the droplets of milk that pearled. I'm not pregnant, but with a sort of luxury breeder like me, it's all about the image, and girls with breasts heavy with their milk already in are considered the height of enslaved beauty and allure. So I've taken a few pills, and will now need to be milked at least once a day to avoid pain. My master has a woman who has paid to come and suck me dry for today, but even she is not what I am distracted with.\n\nNo. I look down at the creamy, blank back of my left hand, where the tattoo of ownership would be placed if I am chosen for purchase. Some breeders are rented out, but my master will only sell me. He has gone through too great expense to not get one large lump sum for me. He said this morning, as he caressed my sore breasts in his hands and made a mess down my front, that a man wishes to buy me, and that he will be coming to see me this afternoon.\n\nI am intended for breeding, my beautiful body sensitive and fertile like a field prepared for planting. And I am nervous, because I do not know if I am ready to meet the man who would go through great expense to make me grow heavy with his seed.\n\n------\n\nHi!\n\nThis is obviously a breeding/pregnancy and M/s roleplay, and there are a lot of ways to customize the story from there. I would like for this to become a passionate, even covetous romance, even if it takes time to get there. I do want to actually play through the pregnancy, perhaps even more than one. I do want a partner who can commit to working on this with me long term.\n\nBoth partners working on the story is a big thing for me, so who you want her buyer to be is up to you. I expect my partner to have a character in mind, with his own backstory, complications, and goals. Whether he is married or not, actually wants a family or just needs kids for his legacy, is kind or cruel, or any of that is up to you. I am into sweet, gentle M/s, and also the kinkier side of BDSM. I just ask that feelings and emotional growth is involved.\n\nI would like to work out a story around these characters with my partner, so they are central, and there are plot points we actually want to get to. The slave's vulnerability as a pregnant girl becoming more and more at the mercy of her new owner is something I find really hot. I like damsels in distress. I like drama. The drama could be theirs or an outside force. I'm cool with the new owner wanting no one else to touch her, or making her come to the office and blow everybody. Obviously the slave is submissive, but she isn't a brainless bimbo. I will play her with real and complex emotions, and i expect my partner to play his character with the same.\n\nAs far as setting goes, I'm picturing near-future that has become Victorian-inspired as far as intense social structure, high society, and economic gaps between each and poor go.\n\nSo let's have a baby, or a few. If you're interested, let me know and give me an idea of the kind it character you may be thinking of. I am a descriptive writer and willing to write first or third person, past or present tense. I won't respond to messages that aren't interested in writing stories together. ",

            "selftext": "My long flaxen hair brushes the wooden floor of his room at the inn. His fingers completely encompass my wrists, and my arms are dragged backwards painfully each time he seats his massive erection in my guts. A tendril of clear spit collects at my upper lip, gathers, and then falls. Jostled free by the way those muscular hips are pounding my perky posterior black and blue. I can feel his cock digging up through my bowels; feel the ache of distension as my flat abdomen is arched outward each time his balls slap into my taint. He's easily two feet taller than I am.\n\nHis right hand enfolds the back of my head, and I'm suddenly being ground into the grain of the floorboards. I see old stains. They smell worse than they look. I shudder, trying to ignore the wet, sloppy noises generated by the union of my *much*-loosened anus and the human's enormous prick. He's hammering down into me now, earning desperate animal yelps and keening grinding noises from my slender throat. He bottoms out suddenly, and I feel his dick get bigger in my colon.\n\nTears track down my cheeks, jaw slack as he pumps gently every few seconds. Huge gouts of virile, sticky cum gush through the looping contrails of my insides. I feel bloated by the third. By the fifth, I'm almost nauseous. By the twelfth such jet of ludicrously voluminous sperm, one of my eyelids is snapping open and shut. My curled toes denote my own climax, abused to within an inch of consciousness. He stays that way for a while, plugging my anus with the width of his prick.\n\n**Schlorp.**\n\nHis cock drags out of me, and I feel the gush of his seed. A solid splash that strikes the side of his bed, three feet away. I collapse for a time, dimly aware of him stuffing coins in my breeches where they sit in a neat pile a few feet away. I wake in the hall, a few hours before dawn. Groggily, I pull myself to my feet. I feel a man's ejaculate sluice down my inner thighs. Nothing doing, I'll just have to pray to Fehrot I find a man who likes it *nasty*. My breeches come on, my high leather boots, my tunic. All of them fit tightly. All of them display the fragile shape of me.\n\nThe curve of my ass. The length of my legs. The narrow, easily-grasped stalk of my neck, above thin collarbones.\n\n**I spot you at one of the nearest tables when I descend the stairs.**\n\nElves, right? You don't even notice my hand down your pants until I have all five fingers wrapped around your cock. Surely even the Border Provinces have laws against hands that soft. A squeeze, a slow pull of your dick. \"Two silver pieces and you can do anything you want to me,\" I whisper at you, thumb rubbing gently back and forth atop your pisshole. My soft lips part to display bright elven teeth in a lusty, encouraging smile. ",

            "selftext": "\u201cSo, how do you like to get fucked?\u201d\n\nShe gasps a little, a juvenile blush spreading across her cheeks. My eyes immediately register her hands wrapping around the seam of her sweater, clenching a little.\n\n\u201cAh, sorry, that was a little crude, wasn\u2019t it? Well, you don\u2019t have to say,\u201d I explain, trying to calm her down. Those first-timers are always so nervous, heh.\n\n\u201cThese are pretty universal. Not too expensive, either. Maybe for trying it out? Mh\u2026\u201d I tap a slender finger against my plump lips, the long, sloped ears wiggling with excitement, [my long tail](https://i.imgur.com/jxDPXpC.jpg) wiggling just as excitedly as the product I\u2019m selling. \n\nShe eyes the tiny little tentacles, detached and sad, giving me a look of pure confusion. \u201cBut they\u2019re\u2026 so small?\u201d\n\nI chuckle, [beaming a toothy grin at her.](https://i.imgur.com/mXptdIU.png)\n\n\u201cAh, but they won\u2019t be once you put them in warm water. Perfect for some relaxation after a nice, hot bath,\u201d I explain with vigorous determination. \n\n\u201cOh\u2026 are they scary?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can show you, if you like? We do live demonstrations.\u201d\n\nThe weak pink from before had flared into a stop-sign red, rivaling my hellish complexion. I still know her answer, perhaps before she gives it. Her bashful nod is met by an emphatic, brilliant smile. \u201cNot here though. We gotta go in the back. Can\u2019t do that with what, some young gadder busting through the door. You know how this district is, hun.\u201d\n\nHer steps are so cautious and steeped in delicate curiosity that the lush carpet swallows the sounds of her heels completely; her desire is evident - who but a lust-controlled newbie would follow a Minx into the back of a macabre little shop like this? Without protest, at that.\n\nShe squirms a little and turns away as I peel the tight, black top off my body, my ample tits falling in an almost provocative manner - but that\u2019s just Minx physiology, I suppose. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m not getting *another* cute top ripped. I tried some new type and I\u2019ll tell you, they just don\u2019t wait, hah.\u201d \n\nWith an inviting wiggle of my tailed, peach-shaped rear, I slip out of my panties. Only the thin black choker clinging to my throat remains, and with my knuckles digging into my ample hips, I present myself to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be shy, hun, it\u2019s not weird at all to want to see what you\u2019re buying in action, really!\u201d\n\nI sink to my knees, feeling the warm water against my lower-bottom. \u201cIt takes a few minutes, usually, and then\u2026 ooph\u2026 Oh yeah\u2026 Mhh!\u201d\n\nI let out a gleeful squeal and allow my eyes to close. My body\u2019s quivering in joy already, as a grey appendage snakes upwards, ties itself around my horns and bends me backwards, giving the blonde girl a head-on view of my cunt being invaded by a second tentacle, the slippery limb sliding in and out rapidly. One probing little fella intertwines with my long tail, pulling my ass up into the air, as its friends fuck me silly - all the while I\u2019m suspended mid-air, drooling in front of my sure-to-be-convinced customer.\n\nGosh, I love my job.\n\n---\n\nThis is a fun idea, I think! I\u2019d be looking to play a Minx - a sort of devilish race know for being a little more sexual than the rest of society - that runs a Tentacle Toy Shop. As for the setting, I\u2019m thinking Urban Fantasy would be *really* fun. I mean, magic sex toys in an apartment complex just screams of mischief, right? :P \n\nAs for you, I think we could go in lots of directions! You could be my boyfriend, both disapproving and excited at my profession and \u201copenness\u201d. You could be a customer who courts me. You could be my best friend who I share my favorite products with. Maybe husband of a woman I talked into buying the most intense tentacle pet we have, and now that you\u2019re upset she doesn\u2019t want your dick anymore, you demand I take care of it? Or maybe I just rent the space from you, and have to convince you of keeping me in there? There\u2019s LOTS of options. \n\nI\u2019m DEFINITELY looking for a long-term partner.\n\nMy kinks are freeuse and exhibitionism, tentacles (duh), pet play, cum play, oral, rough sex, light BDSM and restraints, Daddy-Doms, romance, humor, being shared\n\nLimits are pee, poop and underage character.\n\nI tend to enjoy the build-up and foreplay more than the sex scenes themselves, but depending on how creative and fund they are, it might be different. :P I usually write anywhere from 1-4 paragraphs, so ideally that length works for you. :) I\u2019d also love world-building this a tiny bit on the side. \n\nShoot me a message if you\u2019re interested! &lt;3\n",

In the sense I really like the idea of having the 'sins' I have inflicted on the world to be reflected back (in a very BDSM/kinky way), whether through some portal/kidnapping/whatevering. \n\nDrop one/multiple sin(s) in the subject and we can start tooling some of this out! \n\n***\n**Envy**\n\nI was always the jealous one. I wanted what everyone else wanted. It wasn't enough that I had the hottest boyfriend/girlfriend. I had to take them away from someone else. \n\nMy punishment? **Denial/Humiliation/Cuckquean**, what I took from others, out of jealousy, I would be denied and made to feel how little I was...surrounded by the hedonism I stole from others. \n***\n**Wrath**\n\nIf someone took from me...whatever little or small, I always returned it in kind and worse. Boss stacked my desk with last minute work? Slashed tires. Teacher failed me? I accused him of sexual harassment. No one crossed me, or else I would destroy them...\n\nMy punishment? **Painplay/Suffering** I desired the endless torment. No wonder, the bruises that healed too fast...the cuts that healed in an hour for my skin to be ripped open again, endless, permanent, and eternal. \n***\n**Sloth**\n\nI really thought I was a good person. I wasn't a bother, didn't speak up. No matter who got hurt, no matter what happened...oh someone got hurt, it's not my fault. Oh, that person's car broke down...oh no biggie someone else would help...\n\nMy punishment? **Bimbofication/transformation** I didn't care about the world, so I shouldn't care about what happens to my body right? I get modeled/given that ass...those beautiful breasts, so that the world won't ignore me. (could get really weird here if we wanted to, with some crazy/alien transformations)\n***\n**Gluttony**\n\nI was rich and made sure to stay it. I had it all, butlers to clean my shoes, the fanciest clubs...the fanciest of everything. I never was without a want, the top .000001%, hoarding everything to myself.\n\nMy punishment? **Toilet/Waterplay** I became the toilets..the trash collector, eating the scraps of the scraps, living off of them, made into the waste tank of hell. After all, I had so much, I had to understand what I stole from everyone else...\n***\n**Pride**\nThe world revolved around me. I created my own gravity. Perhaps a modern day queen, or a heiress. I had people on my beck and call, not because I was worth something, but because I meant something. I was better and they knew it.\n\nMy Punishment? **Latex/Petplay/Hucow** What's more fitting for a prideful queen to be turned into a pet, to have her identity broken, and to be nothing more than a latex doll, a bitch in heat, or just a set of utters waiting to be bred and milked...\n***\n**Greed/Lust**\n\nI'll come up with a bit of fun themes for these eventually, but for the time being. Let's use these two as a catch all for the five other sins! To have the fun mix and match sort of quality to it all. ",

            "selftext": "Greetings, fellow horny humans!\n\nRight now I have a hankering to be **someone's personal sex toy**. Not necessarily a slave, at least not in the rough sex way, but existing only to please you. A **concubine**, not a cocksleeve. Beyond that one urge, I am very open to suggestions.\n\nThat's where you come in (hehe). If you reply to this, please provide me all of the following, preferably keeping the numbered headings below so that it's easier for me to follow:\n\n1) What's our setting? History, alternate history, fantasy, real world, alternate reality present day, sci-fi? The more detailed and original, the better.\n\n2) A physical description of the character you want me to play as. (Hint: I'm bi, so bonus points if she's someone I'd want to sleep with myself!)\n\n3) How my character came to be part of your harem. Captured princess, slave market, willing volunteer, etc.\n\n4) Your character's physical description (you *may* also provide your irl description, if it's different from your character's).\n\n5) Your character's brief backstory. It's fine to keep them shrouded in mystery, but something more than \"guy with girls in cages,\" please.\n\nWHAT I WILL SEND BACK:\n\nIt always bums me out when someone puts a bunch of effort into composing a long message but I've gotten so many that I can't possibly reply to everyone and have to prioritize my favorites. I've been on the other side, too, so I know it sucks. So here's my promise:\n\n**Every single person who messages me and follows the above instructions will receive one or more pictures and/or gifs back as thanks.** I'm only planning on sending one to most people, but if you put a lot of effort into something I'm not going to be pursuing further, I'll give greater compensation. This way **no one's effort goes completely unrewarded.** All I ask is that you **be patient** as I work through my inbox - replies may take a day or two to appear.\n\nIf I do like what you send, I'll compose the first scene - what you see as you enter my chambers. You'll get to fuck me right away, unless you specifically request more build-up, but I'd rather casually discuss backstories beforehand than formally write them up.\n\nAnd if I REALLY like what you send? Over a course of an extended period of time, I'll roleplay as as many different slaves in your harem as you like!\n\nHoping to get some replies! :-)\n\nP.S. Not exclusively looking for alpha males here. I can only get throat-fucked so many times before it starts to become boring - not that I don't enjoy that from time to time. M, F, T, rough, gentle, old, young, whatever. Be distinctive.",

            "selftext": "College isn\u2019t for everyone. It certainly wasn\u2019t for me. It had taken me less than a day of moving onto campus before I\u2019d traded any semblance of sense for my sorority sisters, slutty skirts, and a sex live so varied it\u2019d make you shake your head. 6 months later my GPA was lower than my Mormon roommate\u2019s blood alcohol content on a Sunday morning and I was sent packing with that ever so gentle suggestion from the school counselor: \u201cCollege isn\u2019t for everyone.\u201d \n\nIt felt weird being back home. Still half hung-over from my \u2018going away\u2019 party the night before, I\u2019d slutted my way up the front step in a pair of skin tight jeans and a top cut so low that I would have been arrested for indecent exposure if you could find a cop in the county who\u2019d be able to keep his eyes on my license for long enough to write down my name. \n\nMy step-dad...hadn\u2019t been pleased. Between him yelling at me, Mom begging him to stop yelling, and the God awful day I was having with my split ends (whoever told you blondes had it best was a lying fuck), I was altogether too ready for today to be over. Over Mom\u2019s objections (the word controlling was brought up once or twice), he'd laid out some ground rules if I was going to live back home. \n\nRule One: I would be parking my sweet little ass (all adjectives added free of charge by my ego, thank you very much) in a lecture seat at the local community college three times a week or in a pair of uniform pants at one burger place or another. Unsurprisingly it didn\u2019t take much convincing to get me to choose the former option for that one. \n\nRule Two: Every article of clothing I would be wearing would be chosen by him for the entirety of my stay. From now on he would be buying my clothing and making my choices for me, whether it was a school outfit or something I\u2019d be wearing on a date (not that I expected to have too many of those any time soon). \n\nRule Three: It was Daddy from here on out. No first names, no \"hey you.\" Daddy. D - a - d - d -y. And I better not forget it. Something about teaching me respect or some bullshit like that. Honestly I wasn't paying enough attention to absorb much beyond the brief. \n\nRule Four: He\u2019d be making new rules as he thought them up. \n\nNo amount of crocodile tears or pleading looks to Mom could soften him on any of those points so rather than run the risk of being homeless at 19 I bit my bottom lip and nodded. I\u2019d only been back for an hour and I missed college already. \n___________________________________________________\n\nHey there everyone. As you might guess I'm looking for a long term partner to have a bit of fun with this prompt. So if you're interested message me back with what I should call you, your age, and (if you're feeling so generous) a sample of your writing so I can get to know you a bit! Looking forward to chatting!\n\nLikes: Long term character growth, humiliation, collars, dress up, stuck up girls being taught their place, submissiveness, slave dynamics, realistic roleplaying, spanking \n\nLimits: Age play, anything under 18, bathroom stuff, violence, animals, giving anal, partners who don\u2019t try :P",

If you take the time to submit something, I guarantee a response, and most of these don't require much up-front effort. So have some fun and treat yourself!\n\n****\n\n**Cake or Death**\n\nSend me a PM with the subject line as either \"Cake\" or \"Death\". If you select \"Cake\", I will write you a paragraph that is sweet, and loving, and delightful. If you select \"Death\" your paragraph will be dark, will be kinky, will be rough and wild. In the message field, include three words. Using your choice of \"Cake\" or \"Death\" and the three words you sent me, I will custom craft each paragraph for you, incorporating all of the above.\n\n****\n\n**Line!**\n\nProvide me with two (2) kinks and one sentence. I will write you back with a paragraph that incorporates those kinks in which a character in the scene will say that sentence. Keep that in mind when picking the line out.\n\n****\n\n**Questions**\n\nPretty straightforward. Just ask me questions and I'll give you an honest, detailed response. Feel free to go one by one or to shoot 5 at once. \"Yes or No\" questions don't facilitate intriguing discussion.\n\nMy kinks are generally quite open but I do have a few hard limits. I'll try my best to work with anything outside those specific limits. Results may vary.\n\nP.S: If you want to check out what to expect from the stories or want to read previous ones check out my sub :D",

Strong hands, lightly callused and capable of all manner of grips, caresses, squeezes, and strokes, complement a sturdy frame and twinkling brown eyes perfectly. Teasing lips and a nicely mobile tongue come standard with a catalog of flickering laps and gentle, suckling nibbles, to boot - and everything is a totally integrated system. Hands on your hips, pulling you back, fingers spiraling, stretching, stroking inside you, slickness slathered on them - it can be *yours*, as can those same fingers winding through your hair, pulling you back, letting that thick, hot swell push inside you and *warm* you.\n\nFrom the inside and out, there's warmth aplenty - and if that slight hint of coldness is *inside*, a little deeper than even the deepest reaches that make your toes curl and your mind go fuzzy? The Butt-Warmer, I'm proud to report, comes with arms that'll wrap around you and a suitable weight for pressing you gently into the bed, legs that'll curl around yours and stubble perfect for nuzzling against your cheek, fingers that will play gently between your thighs as you feel warmth  and a voice that can and will murmur into your ear how you feel amazing, and how you are, truly, *good.*\n\nThe Butt-Warmer: Your days of being cold inside are *over* - order today! \n\n---\n\n[DPP Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/5smcxm/m4f_snuggles_and_sex_or_just_snuggles_or_just_sex/)",

But there's still one part of the job that I find myself fantasizing about. Sometimes I'm the one who interviews the new employees. I ask them generic questions about what kinda person they are and what their work style is like. But sometimes I fantasize about seeing how desperate they are for the job. Maybe they're desperate enough to finger me, eat me out, or even fuck me. So if you're interested in working at a movie theater and fucking the manager upstairs in the projector room please feel free to message me with your name and age and a description of yourself",

            "selftext": "The grand park is laid out like a great irregular circle, divided into five zones, the sumptuous resort building (called, piquantly, the Hunting Lodge) located in the dead center, the entrances to the zones forming five of its boundaries. The sixth and narrowest boundary is the monorail that leads from the nearest civilized area (not quite a city, not quite suburbs) to the vast domain that lies before you.\n\nThe greeters are consummate professionals -- no bored college kids working a summer job they don't care about, not even the baggage handlers. What goes on here is too delicate, too avant-garde to be left to the hands of anyone who isn't fully committed to the resort's purpose and bleeding-edge science.\n\n\"Welcome, welcome, to Wilderness World!\" Your greeter isn't just a smiling face in a stylish peplum suit; he'll be your personal guide to your stay, walking you through the remaining procedures that will allow you to experience life on the wild side. You already passed the physical, proved you were 21 or over (plenty of 22 to 25 year olds are rejected anyway after the physical, on the basis that their bodies are too in flux to be receptive to the ... treatment), and -- of course -- passed the credit check. A week long stay in Wilderness World costs almost as much as a new family-sized sedan. A month would cost a solid year's salary for most people. Your physical and psych exams narrowed down the packages Wilderness World thinks you'll find most satisfying. Now it's just a matter of selecting your package, which your guide will be happy to help you with.\n\nOf course, a lot of people are nervous when they get here, and the guides (well-compensated as they are) have no small amount of skill in assuaging that anxiety. But you can't help noticing that when you pass the black-painted, sealed gate that leads to what must be a sixth zone of the park, your guide's smile becomes a trifle more plastic; his eyes a shade cooler than they were before.\n\n\"Oh, just an employees-only area, a place where we test new mixes to the formula, where we shelter park animals who need medical attention, that sort of thing. Now here is the African Savannah zone, where you'll see an array of lions, gazelles, a huge number of birds . . . \"\n\n***\n\n*Brilliant twilight floods the entrance to my den and my amber eyes flutter open. Slowly I stretch, surveying the shaggy wilderness below the lip of the cave, the once-tamed forest the Men have allowed to run riot since they closed this part of their game preserve. I rise up, stretching, my tail curling over my spine, tongue lathing my fangs as I yawn, drinking in the evening air. My belly rumbles with hunger and a low snarl escapes my lips...*\n\n***\n\nIt takes a certain personality to want to spend an extended period of time as an animal, but it's a more widespread desire than one might think. Throw in the opportunity to cavort and hunt and prowl and maybe even fly with absolutely no consequences upon returning to the human world and it becomes an almost irresistible fantasy. That's what Wilderness World offers ... or at least the next best thing. Full animal transformations are probably impossible at this point (reduction in mass being the biggest hurdle), but hybrid bodies are well within reach, the metamorphosis perfected to the point that it takes only about six hours from injection of the mutagen to the final transformation. On the walk from the monorail station to the gorgeously appointed lobby of the Hunting Lodge are a great many video images of satisfied guests, usually in before-and-after poses: wolves, foxes, great cats of every variety, graceful antelopes, great bears, minotaur-like bulls, long-eared rabbits ... a veritable zoo of testimonials. Predator and prey guests mingle freely, all fitted with nanotech tags that will send them into a restful sleep if they become too violent.\n\n\"Not that instincts are really a problem, you understand,\" your guide glibly informs you, repeating something you've heard from just about every representative of this place. \"What our guests enjoy is very muted compared to what an actual animal would feel -- it's just enough of a taste to make your Wilderness World experience that much more genuine.\"\n\n\"I've heard people get addicted to it,\" someone else in your small group pipes up. The guide laughs.\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n***\n\n*The heat is on me and I bare my fangs in a savage snarl. I can feel it -- blazing in the darkened flesh nestled between my thighs, my tail swaying needily already. Dimly I recall what it was like before my ... rebirth ... how dull and unsatisfying. Out there in the dishevelled forest there are males who can sate me. I prowl forward on all fours, raising my ass high, hissing as the night air blows cool against my aching sex. Slowly, a thin strand of nectar trickles from my slit to the tumbled rocks of the cave floor, glistening, putting my scent on the air, calling to them. Distantly I hear a howl. My amber eyes glitter hotly and I utter a wild snarl in response...*\n\n***\n\n\"In the fourteen years Wilderness World has been active, we've never had any serious injuries. Never. Our guests get a little carried away sometimes, of course, but that's one of the reasons you're here. I can't tell you it's perfectly safe, but I can assure you that you'll leave here whole and undamaged and brimming with a wild experience beyond most peoples' fantasies!\"\n\nYour guide walks you to the suite of rooms you likely won't spend much time in, where there is an assortment of folders on the kitchenette table, each one detailing a different experience the park thinks you should be most suited for. Outside your window you can see the gate to the Northern Arbor, the Great Desert, the Jungle Primeval ... and that black gate, closed and secretive. Somewhere beyond it, you hear a howl.\n\n***\n\n*My wolf is waiting for me. It's not the first time we've rolled together, hunted together, and as I think of his delicious body, his wild scent, I find myself salivating. Sometimes the Men from the Lodge come here, dressed in hunting clothes, armed with guns that carry sleep on their sharp needles. Sometimes they catch one of us, and the one they catch is forced to go back -- back to the soft, meaningless world of humanity. I would kill before I'd let them do that to me. Let them tell their lies. Let them believe those of us who came to this place and never left don't know every entrance to their game preserve. It only makes the hunt that much more enthralling...*\n\n***\n\nInspired by *Westworld* (back on the air and so is my prompt!), a futuristic park where things quickly go very wrong. This is very open-ended -- possible roles could include park staff, guests, inhabitants of the closed-off section, even the troubleshooters who are supposed to be retrieving the guests who decide they like things better on the other side. If you're interested, feel free to send a response in character, but be sure to outline exactly what you'd like to explore -- I'm open to many ideas! As long as you have a love of transformation, mental shifts, and anthros (decidedly not cute anthros, of course), we should get along fine.",

            "selftext": "Looking for a partner to discuss then RP with.\n\nIn the future, wealth inequality and economic stagnation have led to a re-emergence of slavery. Not chattel slavery, mind you, but something more like the slavery of the ancient world. Men and women can be captured in war, but it's more likely they've been forced into servitude as punishment for a crime or to repay their debts. Some slaves are chefs, personal assistants, or laborers, but young women are always in high demand. You know why.\n\nI am a recently and unwillingly enslaved girl. I'm about 5'6\", with [blue eyes and dark red/auburn hair](http://www.ladystyle.org/beauty/beauty-with-red-hair-and-blue-eyes/). My body shape and proportions are actually kind of similar to Emilia Clarke, except my bust is smaller (this isn't a character description it's actually what I look like). You would play my new master.\n\nMy kinks are non-con, humiliation, bondage, oral, anal, begging and dirty talk, collars/leashes, slavery, orgasm control. I'm curious about things like breeding and gang-bangs.\n\nBlood, gore, heavy pain, animals, incest, and things best left to the bathroom are hard limits.\n\nI don't mean to sound entitled, but I spent some time thinking about this and typing it up, so if you read all this and then send an 8 word response I'm not sure we're going to fit well. That said, I'm not a hypocrite and I've got some questions to help guide discussion before we jump in.\n\n-What do you look like (please be honest. If I want the Rock I'll just google him and grab the old magic wand).\n\n-What do you do in this brave new world?\n\n-Why are you buying me / a slave girl? Do you have a collection of girls or is this your first foray in buying a sex slave? Are you interested in the whole package or just one body part (nothing like a good ass-slave, right?) Maybe you've got a good heart and are looking for some companionship outside the bed as well.\n\n-What're your kinks and limits?\n\nI'd love to discuss the setting and our ideas and expectations before we start. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from someone!",

So when you put cat into a human, why wouldn't she have a razor's edge to her?\n\nThe same goes for several others. Kitsune? Foxes can be pretty vicious, and they're natural tricksters. Elves? They're masters of magic, and even the ones that aren't can put an arrow in you from miles away. So you've got a gun/know martial arts/can bench press a refrigerator. Big deal. I can kill you with my brain.\n\nI don't quite have a scene for this, just the character idea. I'm open to playing any mythical, at least partly humanoid creature as anything from playful to cruel. You can be her favorite toy or her prey.\n\n[Check out what I'm into.](https://i.imgur.com/pJxUALd.png) *Nya!*",

Currently in a century long blood feud with my [adopted brother's](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/185697785603948544/431495491755311124/jojo5.png) descendants. (It's a bizarre story.)\n\nWhat I like in women: [Ladies who are named after now totally irrelevant 80s singers](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/185697785603948544/431496500238090240/latest.png), flamboyant outfits, and near suicidal loyalty towards me.\n\nWhat I dislike: Ancient Tibetan breathing techniques that let people pull insane bullshit out of their ass, enemy\u300cSTAND\u300dusers, anyone with a remote connection to the Joestar family.\n\nSince I have arisen from my coffin, I have amassed quite the rogue's gallery of miscreants. However, it's become a... \"sausage party\". Don't get me wrong- they're all loyal henchmen that carry out my will, but vampires have libidos, man! If YOU were stuck in a coffin in the bottom of the sea for a hundred years you'd be in the same boat as I am. (Metaphorically. I murdered the sailors that dragged me into their dinky little ship.)\n\nI digress, I will be accepting suitors into my castle in Cairo (Don't worry, you won't miss it) so just knock three times and I'll know you're there.\n\nSo long as this is still up, I'm still accepting applicants!\n",

Oh, I love answering questions about myself so feel free to ask. Not looking to rp tonight, and I only chat on reddit.\n\nAll ages, genders, kinks, sexual orientations are welcome to respond!

            "selftext": "How's about an adventure in the land of Pokemon? Where you can capture wondrous creatures through battle, a hand of friendship, or *other* means. Are you ready to jelp me start an epic journey?\n\nNow you may ask how shall we do such an RP? I offer the choice of being by my side as a friend or rival, traveling throughout this awesome adventure, or with one of us as the Game Master, shaping the world around you, controlling everyone and everything either of us meet along the way. Maybe even both the other occasionally appearing as the freind/rival, while GMing the rest of the way! Or one of us could be a Pok\u00e9mon ourselves! The one that has been with their trainer for the longest time, even before they start their journey, maybe was even there when one of us were hatched from an egg.\n\nIf you want something short term, then maybe we\u2019re just two trainers who cross paths, and decide to have a battle. Winner does the other a favor?\n\nOr perhaps you're more interested in a Go related prompt, if you want something closer to the real world. Trading has finally been implemented in Pokemon Go, and one of us has a rare Pokemon the other wants, like a Lapis, Ditto, or even one of the legendary Pok\u00e9mon! What will we have to do to convince the other to give up such a rare Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nHere another idea, this one I would love to do, in addition to all the other options. I am the mother, and after my kid(s) get out of the house/leave for a long period of time, I can finally go the journey I've always wanted to go on! Expect a lot of comments on how I'm older than expected.\n\nFrom Kanto to Alola, to even entirely original regions, with the the power of the Internet, as I'm not intimately familiar with a couple of the regions, we can do them all.\n\nLong term or short term, it doesn't matter. What matter is that we have plenty of lewd fun, and maybe even craft a wonderfully erotic tale.\n\nBecause of the subject, this could include Pokefillia. If that is not your cup of tea, that's fine, not a deal breaker. We can exclude that. Hell, they don't even have to be how they are. Anthro, or even monstergirls is fine too, like Moemon.\n\nIf you wish to embark on this fantastical journey, simply send me a message, and we can discuss things further, such as the scenario, region, kinks, characters, and all that good stuff. I'd prefer if everyone at least over 18.\n\nAlso, just something to tack on as this is just a pet peeve, I would prefer if we use the animalistic sounds of the games, rather than them saying their names. It seems really silly, especially when it isn't universal.\n\nHere's hoping that we have plenty of fun as we try to be the best that no one was!\n\nEdit: Whoops, wanted to make that M an A. Ah well, maybe next time.",

She\u2019ll write about things you've done, things you've never done, things you never did on matter how much she *asked*. She\u2019ll write about how you never bought her flowers. Not once. She\u2019ll say in well-constructed prose how the whole time you were together, she never came home from a long week to see a vase full of roses, or daises, or anything; she'll say you never bought her chocolates, or toys, or jewellery, or anything even close to a present.\n\nShe\u2019ll continue this emphasis on what **you** had done to *her*, by describing things she had found, but said nothing about; not ever, not at all.  She\u2019ll talk about the note she found from a girl she didn\u2019t know-but you did- because in the scribbled handwriting she could make out your name. You were asleep on the bed and she was on the floor. She\u2019ll tell the reader how she held her legs and tapped her chin against her knee. And she decided that it\u2019s not wrong for men to have friends, because all men have friends, so she closed the wallet and slept without a blanket on the floor.\n\nShe\u2019ll later describe the moment in the bedroom when she sat at the foot of the bed and you knelt in front of her. She\u2019ll give you short choppy dialogue, tempered with a sneer, so that you sound distant, and tense, and cruel. She\u2019ll tell the reader how you said it\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t love her but you couldn\u2019t be with her and that it\u2019s more your fault than hers, except she\u2019ll tell it much more compellingly. She\u2019ll describe how she choked on her tears, how she held her head up high, how she couldn\u2019t move because her legs were welded there and she could only listen to you and watch the colours of the room turn grey, and faded, and the sounds of the world became a distant roar.\n\nAnd she\u2019ll send you a manuscript and you\u2019ll be on the couch where you both had sat and you\u2019ll read every word. You\u2019ll notice she didn\u2019t tell things, like the time you had to see her because she had been sick with the flu and unable to get out of bed. And you ran to her apartment to make sure she was okay. You ran in the dark and there was so much snow that your legs began to freeze. And she won\u2019t tell the reader how you didn\u2019t have gloves, or a good coat, and you couldn\u2019t see the patch of ice, and you slipped. *She won\u2019t tell them you slipped*. You twisted your ankle and your face landed in a snow bank. She won\u2019t describe the taste in your mouth, how you pulled yourself up and limped up to her apartment. You used the key she\u2019d just given you and she won\u2019t say how nice it was being able to just...slip in. And she won\u2019t say how good it was to see her asleep and that all you did was kiss her on the top of her head, and then stagger home, every step exquisite agony. She won\u2019t move into your head and explain how much you really loved her. How you almost started to cry when you walked, how much it hurt to put weight on that foot. You shook from the wind but felt safe because she was.\n\nYou\u2019ll sit alone on that couch where you made love to her, and you won\u2019t move and the glass of whisky on the table will not be touched. You won\u2019t get up to turn up the lights. You\u2019ll sit in the dim of your living room. And you will read.\n\nAnd by \u2018you\u2019, I , of course, mean \u2018me\u2019. But then, that was obvious already, I guess. It\u2019s true, though- never date a writer. Don\u2019t even think about it. Don\u2019t even consider the idea, or you\u2019ll end up like me. Buried in the corner of a couch, eyes fixed on a manuscript, barely moving, except to flick a page, not making a sound except a muffled sob. It was amazing, how something typed so neatly in Arial, size 12, could lay bare everything I\u2019d known. There were a hundred, thousand things she\u2019d never told me, that she\u2019d kept secret. That I\u2019d never known. There, for anyone to see, were things I\u2019d done, twisted and screwed by emotion, warped by her memory into things that made me seem some kind of monster, some drunken manchild who had the emotional depth of a mattress. But she\u2019d never know the things I\u2019d put up with from her, she\u2019d never know why I did what I did. Of course she told people how I\u2019d become withdrawn, how she\u2019d worried, how she\u2019d cried herself to sleep.\n\nBut would she tell them why? Would she tell them I\u2019d caught her writing stories with characters suspiciously like her, and our neighbour, having an affair? That I\u2019d heard her making calls to someone she\u2019d called \u2018baby\u2019 when she\u2019d told me once that she only called people she really loved that? That she\u2019d been cold and distant herself, and I was only hurting her because I didn\u2019t want to be hurt myself?\n\nLittle hint: no, she didn\u2019t.\n\nIt took me a long time to read those words, to read the truth masquerading fiction, and by the time I was done, all the light had gone, save for a single lamp behind me. My eyes were tired, my back aching, my arms and hands barely able to grip anything- but what I read woke me up, all thoughts and feelings of fatigue gone in an instant.\n\n\u2018Tommy\u2019, it said, and I felt a tug in my heart that reminded me of just how much I\u2019d loved her \u2018Tommy, I\u2019m sorry, for everything. I wanted you to read this first, to see what I had to say. It\u2019s done, and I\u2019m ready to send it off, but if you don\u2019t want anyone to see it, just tell me. Talk to me, Tommy. Call me the second you\u2019re done with this. Love from me\u2019\nThat was just like her- never signing anything with her name. She always said it was bad luck, and it was one thing I loved about her. One of many things I loved about her.\n\nI read over the note again, written in that curly way she\u2019d always had. My eyes fixed on it, I reached out, grabbed the whiskey, downed it in one gulp, gasping at the fiery warmth that slid down my throat. Fighting down a cough, I raised my eyes, studying myself in the murky light, my eyes fixed on the mirror I kept on the wall, my reflection staring back at me like a mocking doppelganger. Ice blue-grey eyes met ice blue-grey eyes as the reflection raised a hand like I did, running through black hair turned white at the temples. I stood after a moment, half-stumbling my way towards the mirror, my eyes fixed on the reflection with all the wide-eyed intensity of a madman. How had I let myself get so bad? Sure, I'd never been the best-looking guy in the world, but now I looked awful; I'd always been a little too skinny for my height, but due to far too many liquid lunches (and breakfasts, dinners, brunches, midnight snacks...) I was insanely slender, almost- but not quite- to the point of looking like a strong breeze would have blown me away. I'd always had dark skin- a throwback to my Mediterranean roots- but now it was tempered by red patches on my face, on my nose, on my cheeks. I'd somehow gone from being a pretty lithe, athletic guy who liked a few drinks and never looked drunk, to someone who wouldn't have looked out of place huddled in rags on the side of the road. Jesus, I was barely into my thirties, and I looked like Hell.\n\nI'd never really known what she'd seen in me, when we'd been together; I'd already been in my late twenties, and she'd been a college girl, several years younger than me, but oh so mature for her age (whereas arguably, I'd been insanely immature for mine, so we sort of matched). I'd been blessed to know her, and have her, and despite the problems we developed, I'd loved her, in my own way- even if I'd been too fucking paralytic to tell her, most of the time.\n\nI snapped myself out my nostalgia, out of my revelry, and concentrated on the phone on my hand, staring at it through slightly bleary eyes that seemed to see it as some terrible thing that would steal my life away. Slowly, hesitantly, I reached out a finger for the keypad, and started to dial her number from memory, before I stopped as a sick knot in my stomach reminded me that I really didn't need to do that at all, did I?\nI hesitated again, pressed the button to cancel the dialling, then pressed my speed dial- number one, which would connect me to her, unless she'd changed her number. Which I had a pretty strong feeling she hadn't. A moment passed, and then the phone began to ring; I relaxed immediately, although all it meant was that the number existed, not that she'd be on the other end of it.\nI listened to the ringing of the phone for what seemed like forever, the tones stretching into something that started to drive me insane.\n\nThey stopped suddenly, and I heard a sleepy breath as she started to draw in breath to speak. Quickly- before she could get a word out, and before my nerve failed me and I ended up just breathing heavily and making some sort of dirty phone call- I spoke. Just five words, which I spoke in barely a whisper, not trusting myself to say any more, or to speak any louder. I could see her in my mind, picturing almost perfectly the way her hair would be splayed over her pillow, the way her body would shift as she moved to answer, the way her breasts would roll as she turned over to reach out. I could almost feel the way that she'd end up pressed against me a little whenever she'd answered the phone whenever we'd been together.\nAnother second passed, and I could sense her just starting to wind up to complain- so I interrupted her, gently, with a simple \"It's Tom. I read it\".\n\nAnd then, I waited. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlright, so there we have it. In the interests of full disclosure, part of this is based on a post I read online a while ago, but the majority of this is original. If this breaks the last rule, I'll take it down.\n\nI'm not sure where we go with this; reconciliation, perhaps? Maybe one of her friends recognises him from the writing, decides to get his point of view? Maybe there's an agent, or a publisher involved somewhere. The possibilities are sort of endless yet not. \n\nSend me a reply, or a message to discuss it, or whatever your heart desires.",

Whatever you're in to, just make sure I can feel that you've been in to it.\n\nI don't really mind, I guess I just want to be a total cumslut, things could get even weirder, cumming in my food, drinking cum instead of water...

Just another night of dedication, working hard to increase those measurements. The sound of the pump and your headphones drown out the party below. You wouldn't let your sister's little get-together interrupt your progress. Besides - Some of your sister's friends were pretty hot.\n\nYour concentration is suddenly broken as your bedroom light flicks on. You didn't hear the door opening. One of your sister's friends, a busty Persian girl is watching you from the doorway, green eyes fixed on the fruits of your labour. She doesn't seem put-off though, her lips pursed out of curiosity, not disgust. Her long dark hair is tied up, giving you a distracting view of her immense cleavage.\n\n_________________\n\n- I'm into skinny, nerdier guys, but I can be flexible. I'm a sucker for details - describe your cock in as much detail as possible and I'll make it feel awesome... Hope to hear from you soon (but take your time, don't rush!).",

            "selftext": "In the year 2106, the world is very different to the one we live in now. We were all warned, of course. The rampant dangers of Capitalism, the unchecked changes in demographics, extreme policies, the damage we were doing to the environment. None of us paid attention until it was far too late, because none of us really cared. None of us cared when cities were destroyed by rampant geo-storms *because it wasn't us*. None of us cared when political dissidents were sent to prisons *because it wasn't us*. None us cared when countries like Germany or China were plunged into civil war *because it wasn't us*. We were safe, after all, we had Geocorp. A company dedicated to solving the problems of the world, it quickly was seen as more capable than any other government. I mean, free health care, no taxes, legalisation of drugs and prostitution, excellent foreign policies. The Corporcracy future we had warned of wasn't so horrible after all. Of course, there was still law and order in this world, and those who broke the rules, *their* rules, soon found themselves in fates worse than death. Human rights only applied to those who followed the rules of their company, after all. And when you own the hospitals, the military, the supermarkets, in a sense, *everything*, you can do anything. Of course, the Prisons were owned too, many leased out for 'Business Owners'. Some prisons became akin to brothels. Others? Test labs. Prisoners had no human rights, none at all, as I would soon find out.\n\nAcquired Taste, that was where I was being sent. A and fucking T, a prison we only heard rumours about. Geocorp, you see, wanted submissive but happy citizens. Slaves, happy to suckle from their new masters and follow the rules if it meant they were would be comforted for all of their lazy needs. But what about when someone went missing? What happened to Human Rights? The truth needed to be told, but in their world, the truth wasn't very profitable. And so I decided to go undercover, working for a resistance newspaper, ready to do anything. That was, until I was caught, and sent *there*.\n\nThe first thing you notice about the prison, on the outside anyway, was how different it looked to a normal prison. It looked cold, sterile, a large boxed slab of steel and glass, more medical looking than anyway. The guards were strange masks.. Indeed, everyone did, like some form of latex that covered their entire faces, and yet they were capable of breathing, seeing, hearing, even speaking. Perhaps they weren't humans after all? Robotics? Cyborgs? It was hard to tell, but you could tell how emotionless they were. It was eerie, to say the least. I was dragged into the processing centre, filled with scared women and men, many innocent, as we were taken on by one on a conveyer belt of some kind, then taken into separate rooms.\n\n\"Remove your clothes\"\n\nAnd so I did, the two guards who stood over me with their heavy, electrified batons didn't need to tell me twice. I was stripped naked, and fully expected some kind of molestation, though they didn't do anything, for now anyway. That was when I was shown my new uniform. That was when I realised the policy of this prison. I struggled, oh how I struggled at first, before a hefty whack on the head knocked me out cold. One I woke up, I was in my new cell, my new home for ten years. I was only 20, it was realistic for me to serve my time, so to speak, though I didn't know how horrible those years would be. When I awoke, I tried to speak, try to scream, tried to see, but nothing. Pure darkness. I wiggled with great restraint, attempting to free myself the best I could. But nothing. I was trapped. I found myself in a deeply uncomfortable position, kept up on my knees, my wrists suspended in the air and restrained. I could breath, barely, and hear, but that was all. That's when a noise began to emit, headphones of sort, speaking straight into my mind.\n\n(https://imgur.com/a/Yefy1FY)\n\n\"Inmate 1009RS. Welcome to your new home\" The voice spoke, very *lecherous* in it's tone. \"Liking your new suit? You better get used to it. It's a very special kind of prison suit you see. It can do a great deal of many things. Self cleaning, for a start, so it never needs to be taken off. We can censor your view too, allow you to see, or not see. Hear, or not hear. Speak, or not speak, and so on. A screen is rigged to your eyes also, so if we want some entertainment, you will get it, or, if we want you to watch something, you will watch it.\" I began to breath quite heavily at this point, my fear heightening as a video comes up on my screen, a guide of sorts. \"Of course, we can do some more interesting things too. As said, these suits are very, very special. Soon, you'll love it so much, you'll never want to be released!\" The voice laughs, quite cruelly. \"Via the suit, we can change your body to however we see fit. We can increase breast size, or any part of your body really. We can administer you drugs too, so don't worry, you'll never be ill. We can alter you, pierce you, brand you, tattoo you, *hurt* you, *please* you, all within the confine of that suit. We can make it tighter, looser, we can make it cold, warm, and so on.\" At this point, my heart is pacing. I am struggling with all my life to free myself, but i'm trapped. \n\n\"Ah, getting panicky are we? Don't worry, that's quite normal in your first days. We'll send an officer to ease you in just a minute. It's funny, isn't it? In a way, you've been imprisoned twice. But I wouldn't see the suit as an imprisonment, not really. See it as new skin, a new body even. You will submit to us, Inmate 1009RS. In time, you all do.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey there! Hope you enjoyed my prompt! There's a special emphasis on all things dystopian, latex, BDSM, bondage and sci-fi for this one, so i'm sure we can have lots and lots of fun! As always, i'm open to hear your ideas, suggestions and even mixing a prompt of yours and mine together to try something new :-) The theme for said RP is quite dystopian and prison based, though i'm sure we can flesh out the plot and world more if desired! Latex is pretty much a total must for this, however, so be warned! This is a special kind of latex however, as said in the prompt, and is capable of changing the body to the desires of those in control. I think we can get creative with that, don't you? ;) Below is the link to my profile which contains my kinks, limits and description etc etc, hope to hear from you soon!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/7whhb8/20fdm4a_good_stories_make_me_horny/",

            "selftext": "As you wake, you become aware of a dull ache in your head, slowly throbbing away as you rise from slumber. A chill on your skin makes you open your eyes, and you discover to your shock that you're naked as the day you were born. An effort to cover yourself reveals that you're restrained, wrists and ankles strapped to a lab of stone, inside a small, bare cave, the only light filtering through a hole in the ceiling through distant treetops.\n\nYou wrack your brain for memories. You were on a wild safari... Your jeep broke down far from help. You went with the guide on foot to get to an outpost... And then it goes fuzzy.\n\nThere's not much waiting to be done before light shines from around the corner of the tunnel, accompanied by the creaking of a primitive hinge. There's a faint padding of footsteps, and into view walks the most curvaceous woman you've ever seen.\n\nWith dark, almost black skin, tiny waist, hips almost twice as wide as her shoulders and each breast standing firm, larger than her head, she looks more like a fertility idol than a real person. She bears no clothing, only body paint daubed in patterns over her belly, breasts and face, with a stark white paste over her full, luscious lips. Her body bears ornate jewellery, a golden hoop hanging from each ear and each nipple, a stud through her bellybutton, and a loose chain adorned with simple gems hanging across her hips. But yet more striking are her eyes, burning with lust and passion as she sashays towards you, placing her hands on your chest as she caresses your muscles.\n\nThen she speaks, and in a way you don't quite understand, you can feel her meaning.\n\n\"I am sorry for taking you, outsider... But I had no other choice. Only you were strong enough to bear the burden of what I have to do...\" Her hands move up to cup your face. \"My tribe has grown petty and weak, and our people suffer. We have lost our connection to the land, and must regain it or perish. I wish to mix the power of the savannah's beasts into our blood once more, and only you are strong of spirit enough to bear the transformations...\" She smiles warmly, looking into your eyes. \"Your seed will be our salvation. You will father a generation's worth of our people, and we shall recover from our strife in time. Please, ready yourself. I shall draw out the beast within you, and we can begin...\"\n\nShe begins to chant, stroking your flesh as you feel something bubbling up to the surface from the depths of your soul. Something primal. Something strong. Something that she knows will save her people...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHi everyone! Hope you enjoyed that! I'm looking for a short-term partner for some transformation/anthro and impregnation play. As above, I'd like to change you (quickly or slowly) into a beastman (your choice of animal, preferably a jungle or savannah one) and have you impregnate me, the curvy shaman woman and maybe a few others too with your huge animalistic cock!\n\nKinks: Animal qualities, muscles, transformation, impregnation, BIG cocks/balls, cumplay, body worship (both ways)\n\nLimits: Bathroom stuff, violence, blood\n\nDrop me a line if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I hope you are all having a wonderful day, and to help make things a bit more fun I thought I might post a new prompt! Now, I usually end up getting carried away or lost in my crazy ideas on this subreddit, but for today I think I want to keep things simple (well...at least to start). I was thinking that it might be fun to take a family camping trip.\n\nNow, of course this won't be your average family trip, as there will be all kinds of kinky hijinks along the way. Especially between family members. I was hoping to make this a kind of free use or swinging prompt, where I take my son on a trip with my loving husband, only we have a surprise for him and discussed adding him into our sex lives beforehand.\n\nHowever, I don't want to just jump into screwing. Instead, I like for there to be a little buildup. Say teasing, cuddling, maybe some odd throwbacks to my nudist past... And I would love for there to be context. Say we are trying to cheer you up on spring break after a bad break up, or you get a trip for your 18th birthday, I would enjoy crafting something similar. It should all have some sexual tension, but not just start in the blink of an eye.\n\nAnd finally, with all that said I can say that my only limit is 18+. Besides that...well go crazy :) I do appreciate more effort though and I will work to match it in turn!\n\nI suppose thats all for now :) I hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "Hi, everyone! My name is Kim and I am looking to play a bimbo today. Just to clarify, I am black and looking for a white guy. Raceplay is a huge kink of mine, and white guys will pretty much always have priority when messaging me. I am submissive most of the time, but can be dominant if someone brings up a scene that sounds like it could be a lot of fun!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am willing to do any sort of scene that you want, as long as it seems enjoyable. Ideally I would start off as a shy, kind of chubby black girl, but you change me over time into becoming more of a bimbo. Enormous tits, ass, thick lips, different hair color, typical bimbo attributes. I could start off being dumb, or we could play through you making me incredibly stupid.\n\nWe can do any scene that you send to me, but I will be much more inclined to roleplay with you if you have actually put some thought into it. I'm not requiring you to send me a paragraph or two describing or introducing your scene, just add a bit of creativity to it and make it stand out from the others. I am open to any genre. Realistic, fantasy, sci-fi, video games, or over the top, silly scenes are all welcome! I would prefer scenes that are a bit over the top, ridiculous, and fun.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere are my kinks to give you a reference for what kinds of things I like: Raceplay, being humiliated, being abused, extremely rough sex, body-modification, bimbofication, being fucked in front of people, anal, spankings, cuckolding/cheating, betrayal, body shame, impregnation, guys who are very touchy/grabby, unrealistic/extreme amounts of cum, playing more than one character, being embarrassed/shown off like a trophy, being manipulated/corrupted, and being tattooed. I'm a bit chubby, and I love being teased/insulted about that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy only limits are toilet play, gore, and other gross things, so I am open to nearly any kinks that you may have.\n\nI look forward to your messages!",

            "selftext": "Bigger is always better, right?  \n\nHello! I'm seeking a long term partner I can gradually transform into a mindless piece of oversized meat that's completely dependent on me.  \n\nI'm going to overdose you with a drug that makes your cock and balls grow to enormous proportions, increasing your libido and semen production while diminishing your intelligence and self-control. The changes may be welcome at first  (who doesn't want a bigger, harder cock that shoots buckets of cum?), but the practical consequences of your condition will soon cost you your job, friends, sex life, and ability to go out in public. Your continuously growing genitals eventually become so heavy and cumbersome that you're rendered immobile and bedridden. I'm the only one that stays by your side to take care of you, which affords me the perfect opportunity to abuse you however I want (see my kink list below!). I'm willing to take this to an extreme/dark ending with total dehumanization and loss of sentience, though it's not a requirement.  \n\nWhile your growth is involuntary, the initial story setup can be consensual, dubcon/noncon, or evolve into noncon. Below are a few ideas but let me know if you have something else in mind!  \n\n1) I'm your girlfriend, ex-girlfirend or coworker seeking revenge against you for cheating on me and/or stealing from the pharmaceutical company I work for.  \n\n2) I'm a scientist and you illicitly purchase an off-market male enhancement drug from me, only to end up an unwitting test subject for more extreme experimentation.  \n\n3) We are in an established D/S relationship and I decide it's time for you to sacrifice your remaining independence and bodily integrity in submission to me.  \n\n**Kinks:** femdom, power reversal, loss of physical abilities, mental regression, objectification, becoming bedridden/disabled, neglect and abuse by caregiver, bed restraints, extreme CBT and genital torture, urethra penetration, sexual denial, chastity, orgasm denial, forced orgasms, cock milking, urination/bladder control, medical experiments, Big Dick Humiliation, public indecency, public humiliation.  \n\n**Optional kinks:** bad ending  \n\n**Limits:** scat, sissies  \n\nPlease respond with at least a few sentences so I can get a feel for your writing style and chemistry. Thanks! ",

            "selftext": "Another day, another stack of applications...\n\n\"Dear Mister ...,\n\nafter many months of research to decide on just the right university to shape my future, I am applying to the Clearview School for Young Women &amp; Men with great hope in my heart. I'm very enthusiastic when it comes to my education, while possessing a strong will to make my school proud and represent it to the best of my abilities.\n\nI do hope my determination shines through the lengths I am willing to go to attend your wonderful school, as I am currently located in Europe, but have proactively went through official channels and cleared the required papers, and am fully willing to relocate solely for the purpose of attending Clearview. My long-term desire is to be able to hone the creative spirit young women like me often suppress in favor of society's preconceived roles, while embracing my inherent feminine energy; I thoroughly believe this not only makes Clearview the perfect fit for me, but also will drive towards academic excellence. \n\nDespite my ambitions I'm a fairly quiet person, and as such will never cause disturbances of any kind. I'm a firm believer in upholding the rules established by authority, and have always strived towards being an exemplary student. Naturally, while I may be on the shy side of the spectrum, I assure you my track record of proper behavior will continue at Clearview.\n\nAs asked in the application form, I have no tattoos or piercings, am of legal age, and fall within the required body index for women.\n\nSincerely, \u200bEmily Summers\"\n\nPromising, judging by the pictures. You quickly phone your secretary and signal her to greenlight an invitation for me. A moment of reflection occurs; you truly are a blessed man, with a blessed life. Head of faculty at Clearview's School for Young Women &amp; Men. One of the finest and most exclusive universities in all of America if not the world. Graduates dominate their fields around the country, be it STEM, fine arts, or athletics. Alumnis, both notable and average, speak in brilliant praise. Yes, the press occasionally insinuates some less-than-favorable circumstances about the all-male faculty, and the \"Modern femininity\" classes all female students have to attend if they so wish to study at Clearview. The male students' \"How to lead\" courses are a little less frowned upon, but seem to escalate opinions on the girl's classes further. \n\nAnd sure, overall, the campus and its courses are fairly cut off from the public, secrecy preventing even the most ingenious paparazzi to breach our security. But the results speak for themselves. Your graduates go on to live happy, fulfilled lives, be it as the elite in their chosen field, or thoroughly happy housewives. So who are *they* to question your methods?!\n\nYou take a look at the \u201cunique\u201d courses scheduled for the week, remembering that something bugged you about the notes you had your secretary Miss Headly - the only female employee working for Clearview - make for you. Something was *amiss*\n\n*Monday: Modern Feminity\nTuesday: Marital Duties\nWednesday: How To Follow + Brains are for Boys\nThursday: Worship as a Source of Peace\nFriday: Intergender Experiments + Rewards\nSaturday: Individual Coaching\nSunday: No Classes (No edging punishments on Sunday)\n\nCorrections are to be handed out after class in private meetings or during recess in front of the student body.*\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d\n\nIn a eureka-moment, you finally make out the detail so glaringly absent from the notes. The Vow of Obedience for the female student wasn\u2019t noted down. Some educators seem to find it unnecessary after a while, but you know better. This isn\u2019t an optional part of class. Young women *must* be conditioned to accept their natural state. Must be taught about their place in the world. \n\nFinally, everything was prepared. Now, when was that young Miss Summers to interview?\n\n---\n\nHello! I hope you liked this little sneak peek. This roleplay is about a secretive elite university in which awful, outdated gender roles are reinforced through the faculty. The rules are fairly simple: Girls are encouraged to be sexually submissive. Well, encouragement isn't everything. Yes, the classes heavily nudge the female students towards becoming obedient, passive, happy little housewifey types, who don't refuse their male classmates, but this is still \"just\" that; encouragement and conditioning. Nothing is forced per se in class, other than the pressure of grades. \n\nHowever, staff, security, and the teachers *are* unrefusable. All female students MUST comply with their authoritive's sexual requests, or else they'll be punished and/or kicked out of the school. Body inspections, oral reviewing, required reassurance of the male ego, obedience, and many other such topics are an everyday aspect of life on Clearview's campus. \n\nThough *some* clever folks can piece the puzzles together, these policies and academic contents aren't public knowledge, and nobody who applies at Clearview, male or female, knows about these traditions. The thing is: Once you're in, it's fairly difficult to get out. For one, the school's security system is the best of the best, and if they believe you are merely in need for some... encouragement, you may not find your way out. Secondly, dietitians and psychologists working for Clearview work tirelessly to ensure a slow and subtle weakening of the female student's minds. Nothing major, they'll still be themselves, just... less resistant. More \"open-minded\" (and mouthed). This is especially helpful given that first years are somewhat isolated from the rest of the student body until they've been acclimatized. The process starts even during the interview, where female applicants must undergo a body inspection in only their underwear, conducted by Miss Headly in front of the principal. Sexually charged and uncomfortable questions are a mainstay, too. \n\nLastly, should all of these treatments fail at making the student eager to remain at Clearview despite their womanly duties, the financial clause - being that they HAVE to pay for the entirety of their scheduled studies even if they only attend for a few months - breaks most of their resistance. After all, even with these... exploitative institutions, a degree from Clearview opens doors all around the world. You just have to keep your will to work, instead of becoming yet another slut, I mean, dutiful wife. And in my case, I'm a poor European girl thinking she'll simply start her path to becoming an artist, so there's not much to go back to, anyways.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a long-term partner who *enjoys* dominance and would like to play the staff at Clearview. I am definitely looking to be as active of a partner as I can (especially in the beginning, when I will resist) but the nature of the roleplay is sort of inherently tied to a receptive role, so I hope that\u2019s okay with you. \n\nMy kinks are: freeuse, exhibitionism, medical/normalized sex, light BDSM, Maledom, DDlg, cumplay, pet play, praise, group sex\n\nLimits are: Pee, poop, children, animals, and heavy violence (but light is okay, especially with the corrections and stuff!)\n\nNow, Sir, are you ready to interview a hopeful attendee?

Could be a one shot piece, or we could build this into something longer. \n\nSome of the worlds I like to explore: \n**Star Wars** - *everything Old Republic from KOTOR to SWTOR. Jedi's versus Sith? SIS spies against Imperial Intelligence? Mandalorian bounty hunter and a lone smuggler?* - kinda hoping for SWTOR themed the most currently. Especially with the update coming next week... \n\n**Mass Effect** - *I have a weakness for turians, but don't feel you have to play one. Could set something between 1 and 2. A human colony at the fringes of space? Trouble on Omega? Intrigue on the Citadel?*\n\n**Dragon Age** - *could be set anywhere really. Mage and Templar? Grey Warden and his unexpected new conscript?*\n\nWould love to hear your ideas as well. I also enjoy Star Trek, Discworld, GoT, Harry Potter, and more. Open to create something together so we can both get what we want out of this. \n\nJust a few things about my style and my kinks: \n\nI only use third-person narrative, would ask you do as well. Personally I find it much more immersive. \n\nOn the spicy side of vanilla when it comes to kinks. But I like to explore and try new things. Tell me what you would like to try and I'll discuss how comfortable I am with it and ask you for advice in exploring it. Things I do like include mild roughness, light submission, size differences. I'm a sucker for angst and romance too. Hard core no's: gore, beast or toilet. \n\nYou could find samples of my writing and past prompt suggestions in my user history. Just be careful for the gonewild stuff if you shouldn't be viewing nudity right now. And, if you find you're interested then please send me a pm. Let's talk about what you'd like to write and see where we can go with it! ",

I suppose I didn't make an especially good impression when I made fun of your edgy robe in front of everyone, but you aren't exactly innocent either - I know it was you who tipped the local guards off about me. Not my fault we both have the necessary knowledge to take this troublesome pair of demons down.\n\nThere is one fact we both agree on, however. The hero of this story is incompetent. The holy chosen one, the bane of darkness and banisher of demons is definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed. He certainly is a tool, though. After a particularly long day of doing nothing in town, just watching him run past merchants, doing errands (was it really necessary to find that goddamn lost teddy bear of an annoying child when there's an incubus burning the village next door down, raping all the locals?), I decide to head out on my own and advance our foretold quest. Unbeknownst to me, you had the same idea.\n\nWe met up at the entrance of a cavern the prophet directed us toward. We might be sneering at each other and bickering, but deep down inside we are both glad we do not have to wander into a spooky dark cavern alone. Except I am highly incompetent and have a tendency to use people as meatshields. You figure you could just incapacitate me and leave behind as a bait if all goes to hell.\n\nWith a few crude words exchanged we head inside, darkness swallowing us both. Neither of us really knew the hole was home of a sentient plant releasing lust-inducing pheromones.\n\nMe - a conjurer who seems to struggle with conjuring up the most basic things, has a habit of drinking and is in trouble in several provinces for public inebriation. I swear I am talented, though, albeit at very specific items. Kinks: pegging, gentle femdom *or* receiving anal.\n\nYou - whatever class you'd like to be. You're renowned for what you do, which is why you got enlisted for help as a source of brute force, be it physical or magical. Kinks: having something up the butt, albeit none of your partners so far were willing to indulge you *or* fucking the people who annoy you (such as people who make fun of your stylish cape).\n\nThe antagonists - an incubus and a succubus, siblings and all about having sex with everyone. \n\nThe hero and the rest of our team - we can flesh them out if you wish for a longer-term roleplay.\n\nThe world - standard fantasy set-up, I imagined it as humans are the dominant race, so no elves/dwarves around. The technology is pretty medieval - and magical. We can agree on the specifics in PMs.\n\nI'd prefer this roleplay to be medium to long-term. I have never tried writing romance or romantic smut before, but it would be interesting to see how things turn out after some pheromone-induced feverish intercourse. My writing style is 2-3 paragraphs, depending on how interactive the scene is. I will not hold any grudge against you for sending a one-liner when the situation calls for it. I would like to have some fluff with my smut this time around, so let's get some  romance going later on.",

            "selftext": "\"Going to your high school reunion this weekend, huh?\" my coworker asks.  \"You talked to many of those people since then?\"\n\n\"Nah.\"  I shrug my shoulders.  \"I kind of did my own thing, you know?\"  But really, it goes deeper than that.\n\nI'm not proud of who I was in high school.  The people who know me now would never guess.  I moved to a new town, became a different person.  My name is still the same, and I have the same look.  It's not like I went into Witness Protection or got crazy plastic surgery.  The change was more subtle, more about not wanting to be a shitty person anymore.  \n\nIn high school, I was an outcast - but by my own design, more or less.  Scene kid hair, raccoon eyeliner, and notebooks full of shitty poetry aren't exactly an invitation for people to interact.  And when classmates did try to interact, they usually got some kind of insult tossed their way.  \"Poser.\"  \"Try-hard.\"  \"Wannabe.\"  I delighted in mocking the drama club kids during their assemblies they worked so hard on and in spreading rumors that the homecoming queen had bulimia.  Despite how much I complained about the popular kids being \"mean,\" I was really the mean one.  \n\nAll that brooding and mocking didn't leave much time for schoolwork, so I left high school without many career or education prospects.  After a year of bumming around town, smoking weed behind the 7-11 and generally pissing off my parents, they put their foot down.  Either I joined a career, went to college, or got kicked out.  \n\nI'd secretly always been jealous of some of the kids on the sports team.  What would it be like to jump a hurdle, to break a school record in a sprint?  And once I realized it was jealousy, not inability, holding me back... I decided to apply to the police academy in a neighboring state.\n\nEight years later, I'm a police officer working in the fraud detection division in a mid-sized city.  I haven't been back to my small hometown since that day when I applied to the police academy... and I won't lie, I'm a little worried.  I wouldn't even be making the effort to go back if it weren't for a latent crush on someone.\n\nSomeone who, I heard through the town gossip line that my mother is still heavily hooked into, might be single.  \n\nSomeone for whom I'm packing my favorite underwear and a few special extras... just in case.",

Just another night of dedication, working hard to increase those measurements. The sound of the pump and your headphones drown out the party below. You wouldn't let your sister's little get-together interrupt your progress. Besides - Some of your sister's friends were pretty hot.\n\nYour concentration is suddenly broken as your bedroom light flicks on. You didn't hear the door opening. One of your sister's friends, a busty Persian girl is watching you from the doorway, green eyes fixed on the fruits of your labour. She doesn't seem put-off though, her lips pursed out of curiosity, not disgust. Her long dark hair is tied up, giving you a distracting view of her immense cleavage.\n\n_________________\n\n- I'm into skinny, nerdier guys, but I can be flexible.

            "selftext": "**Holy fuck**. \n\nChristmas. If your family does anything right, it's motherfucking *Christmas*. The eggnog hangover already starting to pulse behind your eyes is at war with the sheer volume of turkey you ate in the course of the last twenty four hours. With sheer force of will, you drag yourself up and start to say something -\n\n*Shit.*\n\nYou halt, and grind the heel of your palm into your forehead after a moment with a sigh of exasperation. Emily isn't here. Emily cheated on you with the guy who was also giving her *fucking opiates*. You're an observant guy, but nobody seems to blame you for failing to see that the sweet little Catholic girl who couldn't utter the word 'penis' without turning scarlet would suddenly swerve the car of her life through a fucking guard rail.\n\nYou take a long piss, and glance down the hall as you exit what is now the guest room. Four hours to see your folks isn't so bad. Right - Mom and dad are swinging up the northern highway to pick up your cousins. Still. \"Jeremy!\" You call. No answer, but you *do* hear what might be a radio in the distant kitchen. Dad might not even be five foot four, and he might swell up like a sponge the moment pollen hits his cellular structure, but he was born to play the stock market. You're not really surprised that nobody can hear you from the other side of the house. You're determined to match that sort of success. You were on track.\n\n&gt;Fucking Emily.\n\nIt *is* music. Beyonce`, specifically. You swing round the corner of the kitchen, hanging by your fingers from the frame. Your mouth has opened to say something, and it just sort of gets stuck in the midst of that first stage.\n\nI'm singing along, moving my hips, intent upon the delicate dance of spatula and pan. A yellow sundress seems to be all I'm wearing. Ten A.M., bitch. Sun's up, guns up. Or something like that. Long legs, entirely devoid of hair. Dainty little toes. You'd put down the painted nails as a continued quirk of my high school metrosexual phase. Even the way my hair has grown down my back. Even the way it looks like the fat on my body is moving to places that are decidedly *girl*. Certainly, without the hat I've had on all week, you can see a kind of feminine curve to my cheeks and jaw that *definitely* didn't belong to me last year at my 18th birthday party.\n\nShit. It *has* been an entire year. Again, **Emily**. She had to burn every fucking plan you'd made, didn't she? \n\nWhatever. The point is, I turn to snag the pepper shaker, and you'll be damned if those aren't a-cups. Now that you think of it, I've been in baggy clothing since you got here a week ago. Hips moving to the beat, singing to myself, looking all-around bubbly and glad to be alive. You realize quite suddenly that I might not be ready to discuss this with you. You decide the right thing to do is sneak back upstairs, and then make an absolute racket of 'waking up' to give me time to scurry off to my own room and change.\n\n You are a *good big brother*.\n\nYou're about to take a step backward when you hear the gas burner click off. I turn, eyes on the tile floor to scan for Russel or Bella. Tripping over dogs is for noobs. Invariably, I find your feet. And you. Groping for the pan's handle in mid-turn, my eyes go huge and it seems like all composite atoms that are mine become locked in place for several seconds.\n\n**I scream sharply.**\n\nEggs, scrambled with love, splatter over one side of the dishwasher. The pan bounces off the tile with a ceramic *CLACK!*. I'm clutching at my wrist, teeth bared as I survey the height of my own dumbassery. I can't even focus on you right now, because I grabbed the fucking *pan* and held the fucking thing for the better part of four seconds before pain response overwhelmed the shock of *I thought you went with mom and dad.*\n\nHalfway between tears and sporadic, creative profanity, my overloaded brain can't do much more than make my petite frame hop from foot to foot. Water, self. Turn the tap on cold and shove that sucker under. No? You're just going to panic like an asshole? Cool, sure. Fine. No, it's fine.\n\nHelp your brother out?",

            "selftext": "### Backstory\n\nIt started when I was in 5th grade when all the girls were just getting to know about bras, I was already on C cup. Before that, I would show off my breasts unknowingly to everyone. By grade 6 I was on cup D and kept growing fast. My bras would barely last a couple of months before they were tight for me. And not only my tits, my was also getting big and round.\n\nBy high school I was huge, I mean really huge. I was mostly known as \"Tits\" or \"Boobs\" by everyone, even people who didn't know me referred me by those names for months before they bothered to ask my name.\n\nI was always treated like a freak because of my size and that made me self-conscious and extremely submissive. Guys started to take interest in me, well on my tits and ass. They would casually grope me, slap me on tits/ass and make fun of me, call me names. Some would always hold my ass while talking to me and some would pinch my nipples every time they see me. I was a pleasure toy for everyone.\n\nSince most of my body's work went into making me look like a whore, I couldn't get into college. My daddy agreed to take me in as her secretary and help him with, as he said, everything other girls won't do. I agreed, what could be worse than school, right?\n\n### About me\n\nHi! I am Nikki, submissive female, 20 years old. I am 5'7\" tall, fair skin, black hair, black eyes, athletic body. I have 36DD tits with pink nipples, big round bubble butt that loves spanking and a camel toe which my thong loves to dig into.\n\nThis is where you come in. You are my BDSM freak daddy, who got a chance to use his daughter as he likes. The only requirement is that you must be ruthless against my tits and ass, and wanting to make me an office whore. I want to experience new ways of pain play but mostly focused on my ass, tits, and nipples, most shameful humiliating gangbang situations. It's a plus if you like lactation. Just use and abuse my tits and ass in new and creative ways, fulfill your torture dreams on this delicate overgrown sensitive body of mine.\n___\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kinks:** Incest, humiliation, tight super slutty dresses, public play/humiliation/flashing, exhibitionism, body writing, face fucking, wedgies, spanking, cum play, gang-bangs, body modification (mostly my tits and ass), pain play (on my tits, nipples, and ass), lactation, and prostitution. **[Kink List](http://i.imgur.com/HGvjJoR.png)**\n\n**Limits:** Sweat, pee, shit, blood, gore, bestiality, cuts, needles, piercings.\n\nI also love it when you send me pics/gifs to express your actions better or my dresses.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease *upvote* my post if you like it. Waiting for all the dirty, nasty replies in my Reddit chat/inbox (I roleplay only on reddit chat, do If you don't have access to it, shoot me a message and I'll invite you)\n\nBye for now, My lovely little nasties :*",

            "selftext": "I lift my oolong tea gently from the saucer and take a sip, make a face, and set it back down. It takes only a flick of my eyes before one of the naked, chained, and well-trained boytoys hurries over. He keeps his eyes down, as is proper, and does not speak above a whisper.\n\n\"How may I serve you today, Mistress?\" he asks.\n\nI push the tea and saucer in his direction along the beautiful wood-paneled table. \"This, boy. What do you call this?\"\n\n\"I...I call it tea, Mistress. Oolong, one sugar, no cream, your usual.\"\n\nI glance up sharply and he winces back as if I'd struck him. \"It's *two* sugars, *boy*.\"\n\nHe winces again and I secretly smile. \n\n\"Fetch me another sugar and kneel.\"\n\nHe comes back as quckly as he can, hands shaking, a fresh tea remade and nicely whisked. I taste it before bothering to acknowledge him, and make a small noise of approval.\n\n\"That's better. Down boy.\"\n\nHe kneels at my feet; I nudge his ass until he is bent over, and take my riding-crop. All the Mistresses in this rather lovely establishment carry them with us for just such occasions; and several of the other ladies who'd come to take their tea here today are watching with silent glee.\n\nI give six swats, three on each cheek, before leaning back in my chair, panting slightly, and pick up my newspaper again. \"You may go.\" \n\n---------------\n\nI don't know I just have a very silly idea for a sort of Victorian-esque tea-and-submissive shop. This would be during modern times, but I like the image of classy ladies. All the men and boys are naked and chained up...I'd be more into having willing slaves than nonwilling. Message me with your response to this, maybe some OOC thoughts on what you'd like to do in such a scenario. Please do jump right in and include your age in the subject line. Thanks! ",

But out here on the edge of the treaty zone just outside the Pirate controlled quadrant on the Asteroid City, it's the furthest you could get.\n\nThree hundred square miles of rock in space, like New York City if it had three sides and a hollowed out center for mining operations. Owned by a rich Silvarian mining family. And it's like no Human city on Earth there ever was. It's ground zero for drugs, crime, and hit-men of all species. Alien crime lords and gangsters rule the rock with their potent drugs that get you high, horny, or easily manipulated.\n\nAnd Asteroid Security (A-Sec)--dubious enough on their own, is in their pockets. Who'd rather space you than deal with the paperwork, or sell any inconvenient people next time a Slaver ship from Pirate space makes dock. It's a hopeless, impoverished, grimy, crime ridden hell ...\n\nAnd it's fucking *wonderland* for [**you!**](https://i.imgur.com/dmEGRaP.jpg)\n\nYou\u2019ve learned at a young age, that jobs in the Asteroid City aren't meant to last. With every new job that comes, the Silvarians will lay off, cut wages, outsource, and automate it in due time. And there are two things that will always be in demand: Killers, and pussy. So both are your trade.\n\nIn desperate times (like the present), you wait in the seediest bars you can find. In a plasma repellent skin tight jumpsuit zipped down to your belly. Armed with plasma sub-machine gun, a vibro-knife, and a metric fuckload of Daddy issues: you collect heads as a Bounty Hunter, and sometimes give head as a hooker.\n\nWhen someone needs protection, someone(s) killed, or their dick wet, or all three, you\u2019re the one they come to you.\n\n... Or *on*.\n\n---\n\nHello, I'm Sadistic Dreamer, and I will be your Game Master and guide throughout your adventure on this tainted ass methed up Alien Chicago that makes Mos Eisely look like Disney World.\n\n**Other details we can hash out during your first post**: Backstory, personality traits (perky, sarcastic, miserable, impulsive). How bad are your Daddy issues? Would you like to be under a pimp or boss of some kind? Debts? Have any contact/frequent customers? Drug addictions?\n\nAdditonal skills: (ex. hacker, pilot, stripper).\n\n[*Kinks*](https://i.imgur.com/F3OVA73.png): **Consensual, dub-con**, non-con, monster/tentacle, **gangbangs**, drug usage, big breasts, big/small cocks, bondage, tattoos, **dirty-talk**, tit-fucking, pet-play, **name calling, humiliation**, outfit play (fans of the Slave Outfit anyone?), romance, public, pimping, objectification, misogyny, submission/dominance, exhibitionism, **enslavement**, light beating, anal play, punishment, facials, body mods.\n\nBiggest kinks? **Good writing**. Fun. I want to *love* your character. But I also don't want sex to be in every response or the answer to every problem, which leads me to **Creative solutions.** Why kill a thug when he's a potential customer? As long as he pays after.\n\n*Limits:* Bathroom, futa, sexual gore, things involving kids. Implications are okay. One sentence responses.\n\nI expect similar length responses, though my opening will be on the longer side for set-up reasons.",

            "selftext": "Annie Edison never had \"the sex talk.\" In 9th grade her high school's sex ed class was three 55-minute classes long. Their regular health teacher brought in an abstinence-only advocate named Candace who passed around laminated photos of someone who had supposedly gotten herpes on their hands. Candace advised them to be careful with who they even held hands with, and made lingering eye contact with Annie after explaining that she could tell who had impure thoughts just by looking at them. Then on the fourth and final day of sex ed class, they watched The Miracle of Life, and that was that.\n\nDespite her inexperience, Annie didn't like to think of herself as a prude. In high school, she was just a girl who was raised to believe sex was dirty and shouldn't be discussed. She never even really discussed sex with her high school boyfriend until they day they did it, and then they never discussed it again. She was a girl who became distracted by her pursuit of academics and then pill addiction, who only had room in her heart for Troy Barnes, who was never asked out by any cute boys anyway so what did it matter?\n\nNow, as a mature and thoughtful 20-year old college student, Annie decided she really ought to set some goals in regards to her dating life. Her therapist once explained that dating is important socialization for young people, and although Annie was a late bloomer, now that her neurosis and addiction were under control, she was ready for The Next Step. This idea certainly had nothing to do with her silly schoolgirl crush on Jeff Winger. No, no no. This was all about personal development.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nAnnie found herself increasingly distracted during today's study group session. She called on Jeff to read yet another section of their Biology textbook because she liked to watch his big strong hands turn the pages. Her fingers fiddled with the corner of her mouth - a silly habit she had taken up whenever Jeff was around - and she hoped her eyes looked academic and not lusty.\n\n\"Well, I better head to Psych.\" Britta's voice made Annie jump; she had forgotten that they were in a room full of people until everyone began snapping their textbooks shut and slinging their backpacks over their shoulders.\n\nAnnie zipped up her backpack and was nearly out the door before a hand on her shoulder spun her back around. \"Annie Edison leaving her textbook in the library?\" It was Jeff and Annie swallowed hard. She was already starting to feel warm - did people normally stand this close together in casual conversations? His hand was still on her forearm and she felt a strong urge to slide his fingers into her mouth.\n\n------\n\nHello, DPP!! This RP will be based on Annie Edison and Jeff Winger from the show Community. There's a lot of directions this can go in, but it will basically revolve around Annie trying to seduce Jeff and/or Annie asking Jeff to \"teach her\" sexual things. I would LOVE if this could take a dom/sub slant where Jeff is basically introducing Annie into the world of BDSM, but I'm open to ideas! Here are my likes and dislikes though I'm not 100% sure how many will work with this prompt:\n\nlikes: non-con, dub-con, degrading talk, dirty talk, humiliation, light bondage/pain, force/manipulation, blackmail, public sex, group sex, ageplay, sexual partners who really really like each other (:\n\nlimits: scat, gore, watersports, lots of pain, blood.",

Though you're (obviously) flat-chested, you have curvy hips and legs and the absolute nicest ass in the entire world. You love showing it off, too, in everything from tight skinny jeans to little lycra workout shorts. It drives me absolutely crazy. \n\nI've never thought of myself as even remotely bicurious before, and yet here I am, in your room, furiously making out with you. My dick is painfully stiff, forming a modest bulge in my pants. I can tell that this is the day that we go just a little further - the day we both bare ourselves to one another and experience the pleasures we can give each other. We're both nervous, but very eager. This is something that we both want. \n\nFinally, I can take it no longer. I drop to my knees in front of you and pull your jeans and underwear off in one swift movement. To my complete surprise, your thick, meaty cock comes springing out and slaps me on the cheek. My mouth drops open as I realize I'm staring at the biggest cock I've ever seen in my life...\n\n...and I nearly cum in my pants at the sight of it ",

He meets me with a smile.\n\n\"What do we have this time?\" he asks and closes the door behind me.\n\nI take out new notes from my college bag. \"It's Chopin. Second Sonata\" I shyly answer.\n\n\"Excellent!\"\n\nI walk slowly to the black grand piano at the wide window and carefully put notes on the music stand. The sun is reflected in the piano's polishing. I sit down and he stands behind me. I know he smells my hairs now. I take a deep breath, and put my little fingers on the white keys and the music begins. The piano flows into the forte while my gentle fingers run on the keys. I hear his breathing behind. The music develops when I hear the sound of unzipping pants. As I play I hear his breathing becomes harder. He rubs himself faster as my fingers run faster on the keys. Finally with my last chords he groans and I feel hot drops on the dress on my back.\n\nWhen I stand in the elevator later I stand with my back to the wall so no one would notice dirty drops on my clean dress.\n\nKinks: Slow build up, public risky situation, eroticism of music, literate partners, teasing.",

I want to hear your ideas and build a plot together!\n\n\n\nSo what's this one about? Well what I have now is very loose but I, a girl alone in the world, have secured a place on a ship bound for America around the turn of the century, let's say 1907. Maybe I'm a stowaway from Ireland.\n\n\n\nNow, you. You can be anything you like. A swarthy American ship captain cutting our way to the land of milk and honey, a cocky Irish boxer on his way to the Americas as well, a Finnish sailor, switching crews to see the new world for himself...the list is infinite here.\n\n\n\nWhat I want out of this is a slow burn. A romantic plot that develops with time. How do we meet? What is the turning point? What drives the two of us together? I love drama, check out my post history if you'd like an idea; the more dramatic, the better. Also, a morose love story will get you a long way in my book.

            "selftext": "It's always been you and me. From the very start of our first year of school, to the day we graduated, we have stood side-by-side. Maybe it was the fact that we were neighbors. Maybe it was the fact that our fathers worked together, and were old high school buddies themselves.\n\nWe shared the same interests, but perhaps that was more because we grew up sharing those interests together. I don't know if I would like video games if it wasn't for you, and I know for a fact that you never would have gotten into fantasy novels if it wasn't for me. I was the reason you passed history. You were my math tutor from the day they taught us addition.\n\nIt's always been you and me.\n\nAnd now?\n\nNow... I can't explain it, but something is changing. It's changing, right now, right in front of me. We went to the same college. We want to do the same thing. We want to be *together*. We never questioned each of us being single. It never really mattered. We had each other, the company of our friendship, and that was all we needed.\n\nThe door shuts, and we are left alone. The movers have left everything in a big pile, right there in the lving room. Little pink stickers mark which boxes are mine, dark gray tape covers the boxes our parents provided. Kitchen stuff, bathroom stuff, the basic furniture they bought for us... all of that stuff is all there, save the beds. One in my room, one in yours... and nobody else. A place all our own.\n\nThere's a finality in the sound of the door shutting. Whatever came before now feels a million miles away, even though it's only a 45 minute train ride away. \n\nWe both try to speak at the same time, and laugh awkwardly. We are almost always talking over each other, the pains of thinking mostly the same thing, at mostly the same time. You nod your head, and I laugh again.\n\n\"So... this is it, then.\" I say, quietly. \"Our place. Bills in the names of our parents, gifts for us maininting grades good enough to nab these scholarships. Weekly allowances shoved onto cards, so that if we don't want to work we don't have to. The most well-off, spoiled students on campus, spoiled to the point where we don't even have to live ***on campus***.\"\n\nYou nod your head, and I shiver. I have been alone with you before, hell, practically *all* of our time together has been spent with a degree of isolation to it. Nobody gets us better than us, after all. \n\nSo... why can't I look at you? Why do I find less comfort from the familiarity of your face than I usually do? What am I *so afraid* of?\n\nIt's still the same you. The same you that still hasn't stopped using [that awful picture of me](https://i.imgur.com/k4Hq5Iz.png) from the school festival a few months ago, even though I have practically *begged* you to change it. It's still the same you.\n\nIs it me? Am I different? \n\nI feel around my head. My glasses are still on. My hair is still messy. My t-shirt is still baggy. Those things that I believe make me *me* are still there, but...\n\nSomething's *changed*.\n\n---\n\nOh boy, oh boy. Childhood best friend tropes are BEST trope.\n\nI mean, they aren't always best trope, but when done well, boy howdy.  \n\nI think the automod doesn't like the way the tumblr url for the image source is formatted. I am trying again without it.",

            "selftext": "My wife's hand cups your cheek, and with a breathy moan her full lips are flush against yours - a deep, passionate kiss that leaves you panting in the aftermath.\n\nYou gaze down at her, your hands and knees braced against the soft cushion of the mattress; her body beneath you.\n\nAnd yet, she was the one in total control.\n\nHer fingers move to glide through your hair, meticulous nails grazing sensually against your scalp as she pulls your head down and your lips together once again. \n\nSoaked, desperate heat. Roaring need. It saturates everything - your mouth, and between your legs. \n\nIt seems like an eternity since you watched us walk out the door that evening; with cash on the table for pizza and a promise to be back by nine. \n\nThat was another life.\n\nOur return came with an emotional, physical whirlwind - the baby in bed, the wine flowed freely, and somehow your anthropology homework ended up forgotten as the warm spice of my cologne filled your mind and my wife's deft touch seduced you.\n\nYou start to speak, to ask - to beg - for more. She puts one, slender finger to your lips.\n\n\"Hush.\"\n\nA single word. That's all it takes to calm you; the sound of her voice is warm honey drizzled over your mind. Impossibly compelling. You obey.\n\nAnd when my hands grip your hips from behind, only the slightest whimper of pleasure escapes your throat. \n\nSomewhere, deep in the most primal part of your mind, an excited, giddy anticipation springs to life. You know you shouldn't do this. You're not on the pill, and you can feel the raw tip of my cock gently spreading your soaked lips. It's risky. Stupid. \n\nBut your eyes roll up in ecstacy as the head of my cock slips into your tight slit. My fingers tighten on your hips, and pull you back against me - onto me. You can feel the rigid shaft slide home, slick with the wet heat of your sex. There's a \"rightness\" to this. It feels different from your past boyfriends - natural, with a definitive purpose.\n\nFractured thoughts dance wildly through your mind. Of the potent energy building within me, preparing to erupt into your body. At the back of your mind, the rational, studious girl with the anthro homework is begging you to stop - to at least turn around, wrap your lips around me, and swallow.\n\nBut there's another voice - a sultry, relaxed whisper. It reminds you that this is natural. You're a woman. And crimson waves of primal lust overwhelm your mind. You can feel it. The anticipation of my cum, thick, and hot, pooling in your womb. Your belly growing in the months to come, with my wife's fingers dancing softly over your curves.\n\n\nYou can't hold back any longer, and a low, hoarse moan is torn from your throat as my powerful thrusts begin to build in intensity.\n\nYou can feel the strength in my body as I take you - your skin flush against the toned muscles of my thighs and abs. Every flex sends lightning up your spine and a shiver of ecstacy through your belly. Deeper. Harder. \n\nThe throbbing head of my cock pulses, buried within you, and you grind yourself firmly against me. The girl with the homework is gone. All that remains is a panting, desperate need.\n\nThe fingers woven through your hair pull your face down again, into another frenzied kiss. Your tongues lace together. \n\nMy wife's back arches upward from the bed, and her breasts press against yours as she drags you down against her - a drowning woman grappling with the insatiable need between her thighs. Her tongue slides between your lips, entering you just as I am.\n\nThe first ropes of potent seed erupt within you.\n\nYou were going to truly be a part of us now; joined together, with my seed growing hot in your belly and my wife's arms wrapped around you.",

Your hand is stuffed with value, with efficient assets... maybe you're into humans, or you're running elves, or you're the sinister girl with the burn deck. But you look to me and your heart sinks, knowing you don't have any options. Not *really*.\n\nI'm the permission deck. I control the board. I keep casting Thoughtseize to limit your threats and I've fatesealed away your best topdecks.\n\nYou have a presence on the board... but I've tied you down completely. Ensnaring Bridge restricts you from attacking and I've clamped down O-Rings on your most vital permanents. There's nothing you can do to remove them; even if you reach for your sideboard, I'll just Negate your efforts and smile.\n\nSo take a deep breath, tap out, and play your next spell. Normally you'd just place it down, but with me you have to follow the rules to the letter. So you hold it up, on the stack.\n\nDo you ask whether it resolves? Do you bite your lip and silently wait for me to counter it before you toss it aside? Or... do you say \"please\"? Do you entice me to offer mercy?\n\nAfter all... when it's us, the stakes are a little higher than a few points in a tournament. I always want to make things more interesting. I encourage you to try... and then enjoy my victory even more when I crush you.\n\nSo: what are the prizes for this matchup? What will you give to me when you scoop up your lands and surrender?\n\nChoose carefully.\n\nBecause I'm going to keep raising the stakes until I've opened you up like a booster pack.\n\n----\n\nKinks: \n\n* https://scryfall.com/card/c15/92\n\n* https://scryfall.com/card/lea/145\n\n* https://scryfall.com/card/m12/67\n\n* https://scryfall.com/card/ogw/53\n",

            "selftext": "In the dark void of space the *Vice*, a retrofit Heavy Frigate, begins to \"turn and burn\" leaving yet another nameless merchant freighter in it's wake as the warp drives begin to warm with a steady hum. *Vice*, to some it's a ghost story told to children by mothers threatening that 'Captain Whytte will come out of the blackest night and take you away if you don't behave!' Some of the crew whisper among each other that the Captain sold his own lover in exchange for the ship.  \n \nTwo sets of heavy boots could be heard ringing through the industrial corridors as a pair of imposing individuals made their way from the Assault Deck to the Cargo Bay. A crimson red skull visage projects over the visor of a tall looming figure and following behind him is a heavily armored Dhreugh. The red skull fades to darkness as the helmet is removed to reveal a surprisingly youthful and handsome face. A blonde ponytail intertwines with several ornate braids, the shaved sides reminiscent of savage pirates and northmen of yore. The man scratches a short beard with red flecks as his deep blue eyes turn to the Dhreugh beside him. When he talks it's gruff but charming, one of the few things from his upbringing he couldn't hide. \"Helgren, what's the status report?\"  \n\nThe Dhreugh, a creature similar to the dwarves of German folklore, glances at a projection display eminanting from his wrist mounted comm. \"Three of the boarding party injured during the initial assault, Captain.\" Helgren promptly responds as he pulls up the injury report.  \n\n\"Mostly light wounds, sir, but one might not make it. As for the freighter it was carrying Black Market goods. Tech, armor, and weapons that are being inventoried by Grim as we speak. From the crew we managed to take a dozen captives, members with skills worth keeping...a number of females from various species among them.\"  \n \nHelgren couldn't see it, but he knew there was a grin on his Captain's face, The first in a long while. Whytte finally breaks the short silence with a sigh, \"We best get down to the cargo bay before the men lose their bearing.\" The Dhreugh gives an affirmatory reply as they turn the corner and enter through the blast doors and into the cargo bay.  \n \nKneeling in a row are twelves captives of various species. Each prisoner having their necks and wrists fitted with grav-cuffs, restraint devices synced with the ships gravity core and Virtual Intelligence, allowing enhanced control of the wearer with a single command. Each member of the former freighter has their arms behind them, necks bowing from the collars setting. When the blast doors open it was as if a dark presence was palpably felt in the room, the pirates and prisoners falling silent. The Captain has finally entered to pass judgement.  \n\n---\n\nIt seems to me the Sci-Fi setting is a bit underplayed in these parts, and I hope to fix some of that. I find technology is limited only by imagination. If you are interested in what you are reading, I'm more than interested in what sort of character you are looking to play, and what sort of roleplay you are looking for. Are you a captured slave, or do you have a particular skill with weapons or engines that you find my crew\u2026.lacking in? Are you an old flame that now finds herself at Williem's mercy? Are you humanoid, alien, something sleek or something foreign? I am fairly open kink-wise so lets figure out where this ship is going.",

            "selftext": "My beloved husband was only a low ranking official in the King's army... but he was still considered of noble rank. And as such, the crime of my adultery could only be met with a deep punishment, to make of me an example to the other Ladies of the court. A commoner woman might be praised for declaring herself a free-use bitch--but a Lady must hold herself higher... must not let herself become sullied by such base temptations...\n\nThe fact that I had not committed such a sin was entirely lost on the jury.\n\nSurely it was strange that no proud man stepped up to proclaim himself my seducer (it was actually a mark of pride for a _Lord_ to stud another man's woman under his nose) but noble and commoner alike craved to witness a \"Entrapping Ceremony\" within their own lifetime. Tried, convicted, and sentenced... I soon find myself being solemnly led to the ancient castle on a rough rope leash.\n\nThe forest we journeyed through was enchanted and dangerous, but every man in the procession carried a lantern. No fae or demon would want to tangle with a crowd a hundred glowing lights strong. Soon we emerged into a decrepit courtyard. A priest solemnly and meticulously stripped me of every shred of fabric, holding each article in turn to be caught by the flames of a crumbling sacrificial brazier.\n\nThe rest of my worldly possessions had been burned and buried yesterday, depriving me of any proof that I had ever been a member of human society. Naked as the day god found me, the prayer the priest murmured over me formally stripped me of my humanity, and consecrated me forever a beast of the field. A beast of burden... of lust... of servitude. Any command uttered to me must be followed. And to any lustful man brave enough to journey to my resting place, violence or rape committed against me would no longer be considered a sin--I was naught but a beast to be enjoyed.\n\nAt last, I was led up an old ladder and ushered into the genie's lantern and made to kneel. As soon as the latch on the door was forced shut, I felt halos of light pierce into existence about my wrists, ankles, and neck, immediately shrinking and sealing to my skin... holy shackles.\n\nI was now naught but a fae pleasure slave, doomed to serve every cock bidden unto me, man or beast... for a millennia.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ewr0fHS",

            "selftext": "I'm an adult looking for another adult for fantasy roleplay.\n\nI set up a tinder account mostly out of curiosity, but then started getting hit on by a lot of guys and started using it more and more, if nothing else, it was a confidence boost.\n\nI had never met a guy from Tinder, and didn't know if I wanted to. It was just interesting to see all the guys who would hit on me.\n\nOne night, I was laying in bed, swiping through, and then stopped dead in my tracks. I nearly dropped my phone. It was a picture of you, my best friends dad! I thought you were happily married, but your profile said you were looking for a no strings relationship, and you were willing to spoil the right girl, but it had to be discreet. Oh my God! If Brittany knew about this.... I don't know what she'd do. I had to tell her... But then I thought... What if I don't tell her? I've kept secrets from her before.\n\nI knew you had looked at me, stared at me, and probably fantasized about me ever since I had started to develop. Now that your daughter had moved out and gone to college, it might not be so hard to get away with it without her finding out.\n\n\nI thought about it a long time, and then decided to hit like. I knew he wouldn't do the same, so we wouldn't ever match, he would just know that I was on here. Then it happened... We matched! I matched with you! Can you fucking believe it? You must have been on at the same time, because I got a message almost instantly \"Ashley? Is that you?\"\n\nShit! What now? What's going to happen?\n\nI have absolutely no limits. I enjoy being dominated and extreme kinks. Send a pic of the character you want me to play.",

            "selftext": "I'm a fairly normal girl with some fairly abnormal fantasies. I'm 5'4\", with short blonde hair, blue eyes...pale skin, slender body with small, pert breasts and puffy nipples...I've got a well rounded backside and a nicely shaven cunt between my legs. I just finished high school, and deferred my enrollment to one of the best colleges in the nation so I could spend some time exploring the world...\n\n...But things are about to go horribly wrong.\n\nPerhaps I audition for an innocent little \"film project\" that ends up being something far more devious? Or I sign up for a \"clinical trial\", not realizing I'm giving my body over to your twisted idea of \"science\"? Or maybe I don't even get that far - I allow the wrong young man (or woman - ladies are quite welcome) to pick me up at a bar? Or maybe I just walk down the wrong dark street at night and end up dragged into your van, basement, or dungeon? Alternatively - feel free to lean into a favorite horror film for inspiration. Perhaps I fall victim to a Jigsaw-esque series of traps? Or fall into a deep sleep on Elm Street from which I may never awake? Or maybe I just stay in the wrong hostel while touring Europe?\n\nMy main interest is transformation - the idea of being changed, modified, molded to suit the will of another, stronger partner. And while there are many who might settle for simplicity - a bimbo with bigger tits and round ass - I prefer things a bit more...creative. I'm sort of all over the map for how that may manifest, but suffice it to say, I enjoy transformations that are imaginative, kinky, weird. I'm not looking to be made into something beautiful - in fact, I prefer the idea of being made into something shocking, strange, inhuman or subhuman; something that only my Dom/me would find appealing. More than anything, I enjoy the idea of being changed in ways that tend towards themes of humiliation, objectification, dehumanization and destruction. \n\nIf it isn't obvious: while I certainly have played as \"consenting\" to changes, my tastes often lean towards more of a \"non-consent\" vibe. Since a lot of people seem to enjoy having and using them, I did one of those kink-list things, [here](https://i.imgur.com/8ixhKVa.png). Also...just because I feel it's probably worth saying...sorry, I'm not interested in switching.\n",

I am a tall woman at 5'10\" with full 34C chest and a very generous heart shaped ass that pops out just begging to be touched. I have long mid back dark hair and an olive complexion. The way you are gawking just calls for me to come up and talk to you. I am in business attire with a pencil skirt, 4 inch heels and a black silk top that shows just enough cleavage. I can see the stare of disbelief in your eyes as I sit down and my heart melt and pussy get hot. I set my coffee down and slowly and deliberately sit down beside you looking you in the eyes when they aren't taking in my body. \n\nI can't help but love your delicate features. \"Why hello there....I am Jenna I couldn't help but notice you sitting by yourself.\" I say biting a red lip.\n\n\n*Hello all, I am looking for an younger **innocent** man that finds me completely arousing. Mentally maybe reluctant but you are too turned on by me to stop. I want to be your loving Goddess. You will learn to ache for my attentions constantly. I love teasing, edging, orgasm denial, maybe chastity, some light bdsm, pegging and feminization. I want descriptive partners who tell me how they feel describe their burning desire. One sentences will only be excused now and again. Don't worry from time to time you may get to cum. Though it might be ruined but I will even make that good and you will thank me.\n*\nIf this is up I am interested. Send a message following the prompt.",
