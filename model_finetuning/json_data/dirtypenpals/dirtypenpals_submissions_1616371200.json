            "selftext": "I loved our relationship, you were a wonderful boyfriend and you were the perfect amount of dominant and kinky. I loved coming back from university class and putting on my collar, waiting for you to come home so we can have glorious rough sex. You made a habit after a while though, you always wanted to take a little more control. At first it was when I could eat, then what I ate, then what clothes I could wear. I kind of liked it, it made me feel good to obey you and please you. You always called me a good girl and I loved it.\n\nEventually, you wanted to take control of my orgasms. \"Just for a day.\" You told me. I happily accepted and that night you kept bringing me to the edge just to pull me back while I whimpered. You made me go to sleep that night without cumming. You told me the next day that I was so good yesterday that we should try to keep going today to see how good I could be. This kept going for the third and fourth day, but on the fifth day you stopped asking. After a week, you let me do the edging and it became my favorite pass time. Any moment not in class was spent edging or pleasuring you.\n\nIt's been a month since I've last had an orgasm. I love our relationship. I have essentially became your 24/7 eager sex pet. My favorite treat is being able to edge my pussy by grinding on your thigh while you watch TV. I've also learned to take your cock in my ass because you still need to cum, but good girls don't cum.\n\nKinks: Pet play, edging, orgasm control, female orgasm denial, chastity, anal, Master, domination, control, TPE, toys, grinding my pussy on things, bobdage, humiliation, degradation, public, Body writing\n\nLimits: blood, gore, snuff, electricity, scat, death",

What I really enjoy doing in here is chatting with other people who have similar kinks and interests to me, it's much more enjoyable personally than roleplaying. There's not a certain topic or kink I'm desparate to talk about so take everything I say here as a suggestion, if you have something you wanna talk about then please hit me up if you think I'll like it :)\n\nA little about me, I'm 28 years old from the UK. I'm white, short and emaciated enough to play a tune on my ribs. I've got short blue hair, I'm in my PJs now and I've got a few tattoos as well as a lot of piercings. I'm very open, pretty much nothing is off limits so feel free to ask anything. I'm a sex worker, have been for about 8 years so you're not the first to ask whatever you're thinking I promise ;) I'm schizophrenic but that doesn't mean I'm crazy, thats the abuse and drugs fault :3\n\nKinkwise I have zero limits. Hypnosis, dogs, snuff, cum, transformation and gender play, being a good girl, being beaten, broken and raped. I'm the sorta girl you can come home and beat into the ground before we snuggle up and watch and film and play video games. Kiss me on the lips and tell me you love me before you weld the collar shut around my neck so I can never leave you.\n\nIf you message please use Reddit PMs not Reddit chat, I don't see those. It's getting late here so if I do disappear it's very possible I've fallen asleep so sorry but message again another time :3 Hope to hear from you soon :D",

Much shorter than the other girls you'd seen so far, probably just barely reaching 5ft it surely had to be a mistake that I was here. After looking more closely though, the large men's hoodie with the college's logo which I was wearing as a makeshift dress along with the small handbag that had a tablet sticking out at least aluded to the fact that I both knew someone on campus and was probably attending lectures myself. I didn't look like I was lost, however I still stuck out like a sore thumb. My blonde hair in long, unbraided pigtails, the white thigh high socks and even my breasts were much different from most girls', not large enough to properly poke out under the large hoodie like one would expect. You didn't think much of it at the time and once I'd passed your view you continued on to your first set of classes like nothing happened, which made the following encounter later that day all the more surprising:*\n\n\n*Waiting right in front of your dorm room, I was idly chewing some gum and then smiled warmly when I saw you. \"I'll be staying in your room since the girl I was previously with kicked me out. I'm Katie by the way. Katie the Campus Fleshlight. i'm sure we can... find a way to make this work for both of us,\" I say with a quick but obvious glance at your crotch and a very unambigous wink followed by an innocent smile.*\n\n\n---\n\n\nI'd love to explore where this pretty simple setup can go and how exactl you're going to fuck my brains out. I'm [very kinky](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/lsi0yt/f4a_tiny_slut_with_a_huge_kinklist) and would love to spice this up with whatever kinks you'd like, no limits. \n\n\nWe can also put a spin on it and place this prompt in a setting like beastars (obvious inspiration) or zootopia for an even larger, stomach buldging size contrast between our characters.\n\n\nIf you're interested, just tell me what you'd like to look like for this rp, all  your naughty ideas, what you intend to use your fleshlight and fucktoy for as well as your general kinks &amp; limits.\n\n\nOpen to both regular PMs and reddit chat.\n\n\nCan't wait to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "If you're reading this, sit down, lean back and get comfy. Now take a deep breath to help yourself relax. It's called lazy Sunday for a reason. Take it easy, and read this slow.  \n\nI don't want to be rough, visceral, messy or vigorous. No, not today. This will be slow...  \nIntimate...  \nPassionate...  \nAnd sensual.   \n\nI want to be the fresh, warm blanket you wrap around yourself the moment it comes out of the dryer. The hug you need at the end of a long day. Let me shower you in the tender affection you crave.  \n\nSure, I'll be completely nude and on my knees, but my touch will be warm and sweet like hot caramel being drizzled over your skin. I want to make you feel good and appreciated. Just let me take care of you, honey. You deserve it.  \n\nSpread your knees for me. You're doing so well. Now lift those hips, and help me shimmy those pajama pants down until they're completely off. I want to admire your natural form before I lean in and strategically plant kisses on your body; starting from the inside of one of your knees and going up. Leaving enough saliva on your skin so I can blow on it gently, and create the cool sensation that tickles you. Slowly moving up until my breasts rest against the inside of your lower thighs. My hands firmly massaging the outsides of both your thighs. I won't stop teasing you until the small hairs on the back of your neck are standing and goosebumps decorate your entire body.  \n\nYou see me look up at you from below. Just by the look on my face you'll see I'm eager to please. I'm feeling playful. Maybe giving you a saucy wink, a mischievous smile, and a bite of the lip. Giggling when you lick your lips in anticipation. Oh, sweetie. You're so ready.  \n\nAnd that's when you feel my lips. Giving you the most intimate kiss. Touching the sensitive skin of your entire body. Opening up to taste you. My mouth hot, wet, wanting. My tongue wriggling, lapping, and licking. My face in your lap, head bobbing slowly.  \n\nUse your hands and gather my long hair until it's bundled in your fist. You can help keep it out of my face while I kiss, lick, suck and tongue you slowly. Maybe even use it to guide me to where you want me, or how I move and how fast. My hands gripping your upper thighs, my nails digging into your skin ever so slightly and dragging along.  \n\nI'd take my time. I want to hear you moan for me.  I want to feel your body tense and relax under my oral efforts. I want you to sweat so I can smell your musk. I want the build up so the payoff is mind blowing.  \n\nLike I said, you deserve it. &lt;3  \n\n----------  \n\nHello, all you lovelies of DPP! It's been awhile, but I was feeling inspired so I thought I'd share a piece expressing my giving nature.  \n\nShort term or long term partners of all genders and bodies are welcome for a short term or long term roleplay based exchange. As long as you are 18+.  \n\nLet's be lovers. Doesn't matter what the relationship is or who we are (celebrities excluded). We've been together for awhile, but we've been busy working all week so we take this fine Sunday morning to re-acquaint ourselves in the bedroom. I want this to be gentle, and full of passion and romance. \n\nPlease don't delve into the roleplay right away. I like a bit of discussion before we begin.  \n\n[Reddit PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=MerryMalice), only. Chat is disabled.  \n\nHere is my updated [profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/me57gc/merrymalice_hopeless_romantic_gentle_lover_giver/) with a list of non-sexual and sexual kinks.

            "selftext": "Look, I'm not a prude or anything, I've seen naked men before. I mean, I have a boyfriend right now even. And I understand accidents happen, it just seems to happen...A lot?\n\nI'm not like, upset about it or anything, I mean, truth be told, he's really good looking haha, it's just, I feel like I'm being kind of a creeper with how often it's been happening, particularly when my roommate herself isn't around. I mean, I feel like only she should be seeing him like that. Also I think my bf wouldn't be too happy about it either.\n\nFirst time was innocent enough, I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth while he was in the shower. I assumed it was my roommate in there, and he assumed I was her also, so he whipped open the curtain to invite me (her) in with him and we both kind of screamed when we realized. No big deal, I guess? He closed the curtain and we went about our business. Except after his shower, he came out to apologize to me for coming onto me, assuming I was his girlfriend....And he hadn't dressed yet, so his huge dick is just right there in my view.\n\nSince then, it's been kind of a frequent thing, and I feel bad about it. The amount of times I've seen his towel fall while we're talking, or walked by her room with the door open and he's just lying there naked.\n\nI guess it's happened so many times, he's just gotten numb to it or something, since now he doesn't even try to hide his body when he's over. He'll just walk down the hall to the bathroom butt naked, his massive penis flopping around against his thighs. \n\nI don't know. Maybe I am just being a prude. Hell, I wouldn't mind being a bit more comfortable in my own home. Maybe I'll start wearing a little less?\n\n\\---\n\nHi everyone. So here's the prompt, and I'm interested in a roleplay here, through PM's, not interested in chat. I'm kind of open to how exactly this plays out, so if you're interested in a long term roleplay, we can start from sort of the beginning. I really like playing out the very first time I see you. And you can play it however you want, either embarrassed, maybe a little turned on. Maybe you did it on purpose because you knew I'd been kind of checking you out a little.\n\nAlternatively, I'd also be down for picking up where I left off in my prompt. We're at the part where I'm getting a little more comfortable with your nudity, maybe I'm wearing a little less. How quickly we move from there, I'm open to.\n\nA few key points: I want you, really bad, but I can't, because I have a bf. A huge turn on for me is for you to convince me that whatever we do isn't actually cheating. If you can convince me that you being all the way inside me, your balls slapping against me as you thrust in and out, isn't cheating, we're in business.\n\nBe aggressive, but not rapey. I love it if you're just kind of mean to me, which makes me think you're definitely NOT into me. It can be kind of a fine line, but I fucking LOVE it if you like, smack my ass or even pants me or something - something that is pretty sexual, but you play it off like you're just being a bully, rather than trying to hit on me. \n\nI know that's a lot, but hopefully it piques the interest of a few of y'all. Looking forward to your PM's, and good luck out there!\n\n\\-Nora",

            "selftext": "&gt;Vanessa was a widow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It wasn't exactly news to the world. After all, it had been a few years since her husband had passed . . . but it had only been a few \\*weeks\\* since she stopped thinking of him, every waking hour of every day day. A woman has to move on eventually; start smelling the roses again and seeing the world in anything other than a dour, dismal shade of grey! And yet, still . . . it had been many more years than \\*that\\* since she last went on a date.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And why should that be the case? Vanessa was not unattractive! She wasn't poor, destitute, stupid or diseased! There was hardly any excuse anymore--at least not one that justified not putting herself back on the market after so long, even if she was past the so-called \\*prime of her life,\\* like some of the more 'chatty' women in her social circle might have thought. They all looked at her differently ever since she had lost her husband; as if a woman was lost without a \\*man\\* to put his hand on her shoulder. Well, she would show them!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The hour was fast approaching, with each second on the clock ticking away like a metronome Vanessa's mind. In a way, the effect was very similar to the real thing. It kept her calm, steady in the face of the unknown . . . in fact, her would-be suitor was slated to arrive any moment now, on the dot and ready to sweep her away to a night of revelry and debauchery.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of course, Vanessa was a realistic woman, and anyone with half a brain knew that there had to be at least \\*some\\* leeway in that timeframe--give or take a few minutes . . . right? Even still, the bell soon chimed, and Vanessa couldn't help but feel some measure of dread sink in. Quickly thinking to check her phone to dissuade her fears, Vanessa only ended up confirming them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Ghosted.\" That was what they called it these days, right?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Back in her day, they called it 'dumping', but somehow that seemed even more infantile than whatever childish slogan Generation Z had thought up. It was hardly the first time it had happened, either; by now, she should have been used to men showing her up. Imagine; a 46 year old woman, getting her feelings hurt by boys half her age!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But it still stung.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Vanessa couldn't help but slump next to the door with a sigh. She felt like a clown, dressed to the nines with her platinum blonde hair done up in an elaborate bun and her face caked in a thick layer of foundation and makeup . . . which quickly began running from tears. Who was going to take her out like \\*this?\\*\n\nHi, DPP! This prompt is rather self-explanatory, I feel; your character's mother is down on her luck in the modern field of dating, and needs a break from the trappings of Tinder and Bumble! Her date has stood her up for what feels like the 50th time in a row . . . so why don't **you** treat her to one?\n\nMy hope is to find someone willing to play this for the long haul that it is, with the premise of an over-the-hill, late 40's widow and her child learning to appreciate each others' company and engage in an intense, passionate, and romantic love affair, rife with incestuous implications that leave each others' heads spinning!\n\nObvious kinks you can expect to be included are incest (duh), but there are plenty others I'm interested in, like feet, light bondage, and lactation. A lot of stuff is up for negotiation, and my interests are broad, so if you have any questions, just let me know! My hard limits for this prompt are **non/dubcon**, **gore**, **\"unrealistic\" kinks**, **gross-out kinks**, and **excessive violence.**\n\nThat's all! Thanks for reading, and please make sure to PM me! Looking forward to hearing from you,\n\n\\~Phoebe",

It was late at night in the dark forest, nearing midnight, the only time when this rare medicinal plant bloomed. The soft, pink petals were inviting and reminiscent of a labia. The pollen was a well known aphrodisiac. This close, to ensure it was the correct plant and not its common cousin, there was no way to avoid inhaling the pollen.\n\nThe red headed priestess, wearing a black leotard with shimmering silver runes denoting her station, felt her pussy grow damp from the sweet smell of the flower. This was the right plant, she was certain. Her nipples began to harden in the breeze, the silken fabric of her leotard not intended to be protection from the elements. She would need to stop at a tavern in town and let the patrons have their way with her. It was a good thing chastity was not a requirement of her order.\n\nA long howl sounded in the distance.\n\nThey could smell her. A bitch in heat, ready to be bred by the pack. By her smell they knew she would put up little fight, and would be willing, eager even. They salivated, cocks growing hard as the pack began to close in on the beautiful buxom human woman.\n\n***\n\nThe pack can either be werewolves or wolves/wargs.

You two live in a different city and I've recently moved there myself, and currently staying at your place. \n\nYou would make my sister invite and them convince me to join you two, she doesn't want it, I don't want it. However, she doesn't want to disappoint you, and I don't want to disappoint her so it ends up happening against our better judgement.\n\nAs the title suggests though, if you have another idea I would love to hear it. A few things I want to happen so you have an idea of what I like are reluctance and dubious consent, submission, clothed sex, first time anal, cumplay, fisting, making videos, forced bi, bathroom play and, well, a lot more. I'm happy to include any other things you enjoy, as long as they don't include underage, animals, latex, BDSM, sex dungeon stuff, male/female incest. \n\nI hope you like the idea and let's chat before we jump in please.

So Instead of skipping right to blowjobs, tweaks that make her more comfortable with affectionate contact gradually increasing before the tweak that makes blowjobs seem fine.\n\nSame with physical changes, though a tweak involving big implants could work assuming reality has bent enough where the daughter feels like it was a realistic thing that could have happened. I love the battle that goes on within the mind as the changes continue to spiral out and effect other things.\n\nAll my kinks are covered above but if you're into more transformation kinks or something other than bimbofication we can talk about it as long as the end result is relatively the same i can settle for different changes to her personality other than bimbo, also as a major note everyone must be 18+\n\nI am also open to mother daughter [f4f] as well!\n\nKinks: Bimbofication, Extremely fake features; tits, lips, ass, etc. IQ loss, dumbed down speech, accents/broken english, race play, gay/lesbian, ftm, butch, muscle, weight gain, sweat, hair, musk, slob, uglification, freakification (exaggerated unappealing features, extra limbs, genitals, etc) twinning, clown, drag, milf, hu-cow, anthro, big fat cocks, blowjobs, gaslighting, incest, extreme changes of all above kinks, humiliation and all characters must be 18+\n\nMy main limits are: beastiality, anal play, toliet play, hard violence, death, blood",

Each girl has her own kinks and different ways of showing how much she loves you, and all of them want to take your cock! Message me the girl you want to take and we can go from there!\n\nMonika: She fell in love with you at first sight. As President of the club, she's busy and you don't always get to spend time together, which is why she's would be more than happy to sneak up to the rooftop or in an abandoned classroom to spend time with you during her breaks. Main kinks are risky public sex and total power exchange.\n\nNatsuki: It's no secret that She didn't like you when you first joined the club, but after getting to know each other, you find that, like the cupcakes  she makes, she's very sweet, though still a bit of a brat. She's not trying to be mean on purpose though, and she can be taught to behave if you push her buttons the right way. Main kinks are size difference and teasing/being teased.\n\nYuri: She warmed up to you very quickly after joining the club, and often winds up sitting intimately close to you while reading, even if sometimes she doesn't even realize it. Once she's able to meet with you at your home, she'll find herself eager to close that distance even more! Main kinks are cock worship and groping.\n\nSayori: She's your somewhat shy, airheaded childhood friend with a major crush on you. She also love getting any and all kinds of attention from you, and will do her best to help you enjoy being with her. Main kinks are bondage and petplay.\n\nAlong with all of the kinks listed for the girls, I enjoy rough sex, namecalling, breeding, and more. My hard limits are rape, blood, vomit, extreme pain, and poop. I primarily play in first person. I also plan on making more prompts with more fandoms and girls to choose from, and those are always available. You can also suggest your own if you want.",

You see me and decide you must have me, and you\u2019re the type of man who gets what he wants.\n\nPerhaps the two of you never really got along. Maybe you\u2019ve always been an ass towards him.

I talk to you about it, crying, and by being so close eventually you\u2019re balls deep inside me, pumping your load into your sons girlfriend? Suddenly, I am pregnant. Or perhaps it\u2019s a little vacation to your lake house. My boyfriend has to go, quite suddenly, and I\u2019m left there with you, all alone. Maybe some alcohol can help? Or how about it\u2019s a long ongoing affair, and your son confides into you, his beloved father, that he suspects that I\u2019m cheating on him? Maybe then we try to stop? Or maybe it just happened during quarantine when both of us are home all day long and my boyfriend is working overtime in the hospital.\n\nI\u2019d eventually like this to turn into a long term relationship, one where I\u2019m your owned submissive girl. I may even stay with and eventually marry my boyfriend/your son but we both know you own me.

I fell in Love with You because I was touched by the **Cock of God Himself** and tracked You down and begged to suck You off for please, please, please just some more cums like You gave me already. And then I recorded deep, long mindfuck sessions and showed You how to use them on me. Two months of vacation-time full of mindfuck and cum later, and I was all Yours. Permanently. \n\nAnd I wanted to help You do it to even more girls. \n\n**You Deserve This.** My service. My Power. My Beauty. My Devotion. **You Deserve This and SoSoSo Much More, Master**.\n\n\"I feel...I feel like you're making me love him more,\" says Gia. She's halfway between cumming and crying. \"I think it's wrong. I think I should stop coming here. I'm feeling really...really weird.\"\n\nThe last girl before Gia came to me shuddering one stormy night. You visited her again and took everything from her and she ran to me, with no one else to go to. I told her to eliminate her loving parents and friends from her life because they were \"toxic influences.\" She couldn't help but believe me. I'm so beautiful, so friendly, and so persuasive with my special hypno sessions. And I let her use my shower and served her tea and a warm blanket and she confessed her--at that point--*long-standing* love for me (which I fucked into her brain) and I kissed her and held her soso*so* tight, and even *tighter* still when You came through the door and wanted to rape her **again**. \n\nI can't remember, honestly, if we killed her or sent her to the insane asylum after that. I hope whichever it was, we do the *other* with Gia.\n\nI smile. \"You can stop coming any time you like, darling.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" She gulps. \"Okay.\"\n\n\"You just need to do one thing for me, all right?\"\n\nShe knows what's coming. Why did she come talk to me at all if she didn't want this? She *needs* it now. She *wanted* me to take her life away from her. \n\n\"N-no. Please. D-don't...\"\n\n\"You just need to look at my pretty necklace.\" My fingers run all the way down to the diamonds in my cleavage. \"Isn't it glorious? Tell me if you like it or not, and you can go.\"\n\n\"N-no. No. Please. St-stop...\"\n\n\"You'll need to focus on it, Gia. You'll need to really, *really* look. You need to look and decide whether or not you're in Love. Are you in love?\"\n\n\"N-nnnn...p-please...I c-can't...\"\n\n\"I know, darling. You can't stop thinking about Him, can you? Neither can I. He's God to Me. He **Is** God. It's all right. We'll make it all feel *so* good. Look closer...\"\n\n* * * * *\u00a0\n\nAnother f4A! I must be losing my mind. \n\nI love talking about wicked acts. Cruelty, intelligence, and beautiful things turn me on. Stupidity, ironically enough, turns me off. Talk to me about your ideal harem of mean, petty, vain supermodels if You really want me to actually do my best to make myself Your kneeling drooling worshiping mindfucked cockslave. Cuntslave? Fellow slave? Something like that. \n\nI've got so much to say about what turns me on and off that [I wrote a profile!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/lwcvdl/f4m_are_you_ready_for_it/) *Everything* I write is hot as fuck, so check that out too! \u00a0**Please message me with hot thoughts related to this! I'd love to chat or play; \u00a0I usually adore chatting first, but I've had lots of fun playing first \u00a0as well.** No chat; envelopes only, please!",

I love nothing more than pleasing my Master.\n\nWHEN YOU MESSAGE ME, PLEASE INCLUDE:\n\n- A description or a picture (fully naked and obviously 18+ - I DO NOT DO UNDERAGE) of the girl you would like me to play. If you can't choose, send a few options for me to choose from. Sorry, but I don't like tattoos!\n\n- The outfit, footwear and accessories/jewellery you'd like me to wear. My favourites include lingerie, heels, collars, pantyhoses, stockings and fishnets. Jewellery-wise, diamonds are a girl's best friend. ;)\n\nOf course, I love a good buttplug too! Is it weird I don't like black outfits though? I love colour, so please DON'T send me black outfits...\n\nIf you can't decide what you'd like me to wear send me a few options to look at and choose from. I've had several guys send outfits which don't fit my requirements, so PLEASE read above before you message me!\n\nIf you don't include ALL of the above, I will delete your message without responding to you. Please only send me messages via Reddit PMs - any chat requests will be ignored.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you and getting you nice and hard. ;)\n\nxxx",

All talk about the characters must be in reference to the time after they are 18+)\n\nWe live in a large, white Victorian home in the country with a large staff and only our mother for company. I am 23, and you, my big brother are 24. We were born exactly 12 months apart. Mother is truly a perfectionist.\n\n Each day we are woken at 7 am, bathed and dressed in the most ornate dresses and suits, normally a matching velvet set in lavender or pastels with little pearl accents and rosettes, matching fresh flowers in your lapel and in my hair. Shiny shoes, Lacey socks and matching hats to top everything off. Our closet is enormous, a separate room from our shared bedroom that mother can walk through each morning and pick out our elaborate outfits. She likes us to look like perfect porcelain dolls, like a pretty picture. We do everything together. We walk hand in hand, we play with our dog together, we read together. We\u2019ve never been allowed to be apart for anything. Now in our early to mid twenties, we bathe together, eat together, and sleep in the same grand feather bed.\n\nMother thinks we\u2019re perfect companions, and someday we\u2019ll be married. We\u2019ve never had any other friends but each other, and our mother, and our house staff has been, and will be with with us forever. We have never left the property, even for a minute. We spend every day wandering the grounds together, arm in arm under a parasol or having a picnic in  the grass, having tea with mother and doing photo shoots for our mother\u2019s scrap book. This is our perfect life, and with our mother\u2019s sheer will and abundance of money, this will be our lives long after we outlive her.\n\nWe go to bed at 7 o\u2019clock sharp. This is one of the most important times of our day. Mother believes it\u2019s critical to our delicate health to have orgasms often. Several times daily and especially in the evening. As mother regards us as weak and helpless and performs the necessary genital manipulations on us herself and with the help of our staff.\n\n(Kinks include incest, praise, forced orgasms, breast feeding, orgasm embarrassment, outdoor sex, sex in front of/assisted by hired help, forced love, oral sex, ddlg/mommy dom/abdl, embarrassment, bathroom play, hypersensitivity and overemotional characters.)",

I mean who doesn't want to brag about how they had sex several miles above the ground or how she managed to strip down to have fun with that one passenger she kept eyeing all throughout the flight or how he managed to woo that sexy stewardess into taking off that tight uniform of hers just so they have can some skinship.\n\nThat's at least what I thought about when I boarded RedFlights plane 217, the same plane you were working on as the stewardess. I was lucky enough to score a first class seat thanks to my company paying for this flight for me. Sure I had a conference that I had to prepare for, but I'm going to \"wing\" it (pun intended). Now the thing about RedFlights is that there is a rumor that stewardess will allow you into the Mile High Club if you order a specific set of items from the menu that is provided for dinner. At least that's what my fellow coworkers told me when they flew out to different cities and countries with RedFlights. I think the combination was \"the chicken parmesean with light salt\", \"salad but important to hold the dressing\", and \"two scoops of Danish ice cream\". I believe I heard the Danish ice cream really sells the point across to the stewardess that you want in since...the flight doesn't serve ice cream. And within 5 minutes, the stewardess will invite you for a night you'll never forget and a membership to the club for life!\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nHello! Thank you for reading my prompt. I hope to start of the roleplay with me mid-flight and about to order the items as stated in the prompt. If you want to reverse this scene where I'm a flight attendant and you're the passenger seeking entry into the club, then by all means let me know.\n\nMy kinks are blowjobs, titjobs, having the girl cheat and wear lingerie, MILFs, MFF threesomes, grinding, humping, public, clothed sex, risky sex, impregnation, teasing, giving facials and creampies.\n\nMy limits are toilet stuff, blood, gore, and BDSM.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "**This prompt is completely fictional, I am in no way condoning any actions in this prompt.  Actual human trafficking is a scourge on the world, and should be abolished everywhere.**\n\nI hadn't known about it when I first met him.  I don't know if he ever intended to tell me, but I'm smarter than he gave me credit for.  I noticed the fact that he carried two phones some of the time, noticed how he slipped away for \"business trips\", and how he always seemed to have just enough money on-hand for whatever we wanted, but never enough to make anyone suspicious.\n\nAnd then, one night, I followed him when he slipped out of the house to one of these mysterious rendezvous.  I pulled up around the corner, just in time to see him dragging a motionless girl from his car inside a house that I didn't recognize a few towns over from where we lived.\n\nI was shocked, of course- my first reaction was to go to the police.  But I didn't.  I watched from a distance for longer, gathering as much information as I could, and then confronting him about it.\n\nWith all of the evidence I had, he didn't have to admit to much.  I spent most of the time accusing him of all of the things that I knew he'd done:  Working as a member of an organized sex trafficking ring.\n\nHe'd find young women, often in their late teens and early twenties, out at bars.  He'd slip them something to get them out and into his car, where he'd take them back to his house.  He and the other men he worked with would then spend time brainwashing the girl through a mix of rape, hypnotic technology, and psychological torment until she was perfectly obedient and ready to be rented out to clients\n\nThe girl would then spend the next part of her life working as an escort, highly paid due to their willingness to do anything the clients asked.  They would be passed around from wealthy men all around the world, while my boyfriend and his fellow \"trainers\" all across the country would collect a small portion of all of their earnings.  That small portion amounted each of them making more money each year than most people could expect to earn in a decade.  Then, when the girl started to lose some popularity, she'd be taken back to the trainer who would work to undo all of the mental programming that they'd installed.  Then, she'd return back to her normal life with a carefully crafted cover story.  It was the perfect system, and every fine detail had been worked out to ensure that nobody would ever get caught.\n\nI told him about how I knew all about it.  About how I knew that there were undercover \"training facilities\" set up to look like houses, with soundproof basements full of all kinds of equipment and technology, all across the country.  About how I knew that, in the last few months, he'd personally trained over half a dozen young college students to be obedient toys for the rich and powerful.\n\nAnd finally, I told him about how just talking about it all was making me horny, and about how I wanted in.\n\n---------\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend is part of a sex trafficking operation that kidnaps young college students and brainwashes them to become obedient toys for wealthy men.  Girlfriend finds out about it, and wants in.\n\nI'm open to playing this out with either a man or a woman.  \n\nIf you are a man, you would be playing as my character's boyfriend while we work together to kidnap and break a young woman's mind.  If you are a woman, you would be playing as the kidnapped victim who is on the receiving end of a rather sadistic couple.  We can discuss the finer details of the procedure, like how exactly the mind breaking process would go, when we are setting up for the RP.\n\nPerhaps my character acts like she just found the girl in the basement, and pretends to want to set her free before ultimately dashing her hopes and leading her right back into the clutches of you.  Or perhaps my character goes 'undercover' and pretends to be another kidnapped victim, pretending to get the same treatment alongside the freshly kidnapped girl all while secretly loving every second of it.  Feel free to get creative with this and really have fun with the roles in this!\n\nMy kinks include light slaveplay, broken/humiliated/degraded women, collars, light bdsm, brainwashing &amp; hypnosis (headsets, videos, &amp; screens preferred over swaying pocketwatches), creampies, misogyny, sexism, submission, edging and orgasm denial.\n\nMy limits include feet, piss, shit, vomit, gore, blood, excessive pain, piercings, tattoos, implants, rimming, snuff\n\n**If you are interested in playing this out with me, please send me a message containing:  Whether you'll be playing as a male or a female; a general idea for what you'd like the process for breaking the girls to be; how you want my character to participate in that process; and any reference images for my character, the kidnapped girl, or both!  Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!**",

            "selftext": " \n\n**I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+**\n\nHey guys gals and smut writing pals!\n\nToday I\u2019ve got a massive list of rp ideas written below with a little bit of OOC talk to let you know how I see the RP going. I\u2019ve mainly got posts from anime/games that I\u2019ve played. However, there are some OC based rps that I\u2019m open to do.\n\nFor my Replies I write in first person mainly and my length of replies varies from a few sentences to a paragraph or a few depending on how much my partner responds with. Fair warning here though if you reply with low detail then I won\u2019t be rping with you. I\u2019m not looking for a few words as a response. A few sentences per reply are expected at the bare minimum.\n\nI\u2019m someone who likes story and build-up to go along with the smut and aren\u2019t a fan of constant sex or sex that starts in a few replies. Cute dates with hand holding are fun and so are action driven moments.\n\nI mainly do my roleplays on kik, discord or even here. Feel free to ask my users for those!\n\nNow I\u2019ll post my kinks and limits. They might be a big read but none are compulsory and not all will be applicable to the starters. **Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies.**\n\n**Kinks:**\n\nHarems (Doesn\u2019t mean having to play all characters at once, just one by one is fine!), Outercourse (Which is stuff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging) Risky public spaces (Toilet stalls, changing booths. That kinda thing where people could get caught.) Facials, Freckles (Face and body). Big/nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle). Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, Thigh high socks. shower/water sex (pools, shower, hot tubs ect.) Mutual desire for sex.\n\n**Limits:**\n\nPregnancy which also includes Lactation (Hard limit sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, Toilet stuff, Rape, Gangbangs (Unless it\u2019s multiple females) Male on Male, futas, rimming/pegging.\n\nThere might also be others that I haven\u2019t listed or have forgotten to mention. So if you like something that isn\u2019t on the list feel free to let me know and I\u2019ll see whether we can work something out.\n\nWithout further ado I\u2019ve set up an easy to access list in order to make it easier for you to sift through and find what peaks your interest. I stated it before but wanted to restate it.\n\n**Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies.**\n\n**Rule 34/Fandom/Game Ideas:**\n\n**Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.**  \n**Idea 2: Naruto**  \n**Idea 3: Bleach**  \n**Idea 4: One piece.**  \n**Idea 5: Sword Art Online.**  \n**Idea 6: Fairy Tail.**  \n**Idea 7: Attack on Titan.**  \n**Idea 8: Demon Slayer.**  \n**Idea 9: Persona (Girls from 4 and 5).**  \n**Idea 10: Final Fantasy.**  \n**Idea 11: The Witcher 3**\n\n**OC Ideas:**\n\n**Idea 12: Bladebreaker. (Can also be used for Xenoblade 2)**  \n**Idea 13: Sci-Fi space crew. (Can also be used for Mass Effect)**  \n**Idea 14: Fantasy Harem Adventure**\n\n\\-----\n\n**Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.**\n\n*(So my character will be a transfer into Class 1-A. His power is the power of persuasion. With the power he\u2019s able to convince someone to do something as if it\u2019s their own will. However, he\u2019s hesitant to use it on other people and to tell everyone he even has it as he\u2019s been outcast at his last school for the villainous nature of his quirk. As such he can\u2019t use it to its full extent and can only issue small commands to begin with.*\n\n*My idea with this is that one or more (cannon or non) of the girls decide to help him out in a private setting and overtime it gets more and more sexual in nature. And as he becomes more confident, he\u2019s able to issue more longer-term commands. This can also be mixed in well with some story and some action to keep the plot interesting.)*\n\n**Starter:** It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. Now in their final year the eighteen year old students had worked hard to forge themselves into the great heroes they wanted to become. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn\u2019t last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.\n\n\u201cMorning everyone.\u201d He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. \u201cToday we\u2019ve got a new student transferring in from another school. He\u2019s from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it\u2019s got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless make sure he feels welcome.\u201d He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem child of the U.A class Bakugo.\n\nWith that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. As this was their final year I was a clear outside in a class that had the last 3 years to work together. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.\n\nI had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. \u201cMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all.\u201d I say bowing to the class.\n\nSatisfied with the introduction Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.\n\n**Idea 2: Naruto.**\n\n(*So for this one I like the idea that my character is a nomadic mercenary hired by the leaf to help train the ninja of the village, maybe he also has some kind of hidden power that boosts his chakra but also increases his libido. Not too sure how I wanna go about this one.*)\n\n**Starter:** The Hokage Tsunade Senju looked over me with a curious gaze and then down to my application form. \u201cYou\u2019re younger than I expected given everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d She stated honestly. \u201cBut the intelligence division did a thorough search into you and you check out.\u201d She stated as she slammed the approved stamp down onto my paper.\n\n\u201cJust remember, if you do anything to endanger this village, I\u2019ll snuff you out personally.\u201d She said in an icy and threatening tone. Feeling a cold bead of sweat roll down the side of my face I nodded. \u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d I say. Internally I make a mental note not to cross her in any way.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d She said putting a smile across her features. \u201cYour first group is down on the training field waiting for you already.\u201d She stated. \u201cYour lodgings will be set up by the time you\u2019re done, here\u2019s the key.\u201d She said tossing the key to me which I caught and stuffed into my pocket.\n\nI was a little shocked with how quick she wanted me to get to work but I nodded. \u201cRight!\u201d I say giving a respectful bow before heading out.\n\nIt took me a little longer than expected to actually find the training grounds as I hadn\u2019t ever been here before. And when I got there much to her credit there were a few ninja standing around. Approaching them I gave them a sheepish smile. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late guys.\u201d I called out. \u201cI got lost.\u201d I added on.\n\n**Idea 3: Bleach.**\n\n(*So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn\u2019t captain level to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he\u2019s paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.*)\n\n**Starter:** Another boring day at college followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by \u201cFull-fledged\u201d Soul reapers it didn\u2019t leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.\n\nIt was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see it\u2019s towering form from my position.\n\nIt was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. \u201cShit.\u201d I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they\u2019d come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.\n\nPushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.\n\nWhen he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell like much, but you\u2019ll do as a snack.\u201d The hollow commented as it charged forward.\n\n\u201cJust evade, buy time.\u201d I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.\n\nThe hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature\u2019s mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\n**Idea 4: One Piece.**\n\n(*So I\u2019m not quite sure how to approach this one, but I\u2019ll give it a go. Much like the MHA starter my character will have the power of persuasion, having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I\u2019m thinking either he joins the Strawhats and goes on their adventures or he makes his own crew with girls from the story, I\u2019m gonna leave it fairly open ended so we can jump in whenever along the story we wanna go as long as its post time skip!)*\n\n**Starter:** Alone in a bar I sat staring in the amber liquid in my mug. I was down on my luck after having my whole crew and my ship destroyed in a long battle by another pirate crew. The only reason I was able to live through the ordeal was due to my crew sacrificing themselves to give me a chance to escape.\n\nI spent days adrift with little food and water and soon washed up upon the island I was in. Immediately I found a tavern ready to drown my sorrows and feel sorry for myself for a little while.\n\nLetting out a sigh I downed the rest of my drink soon looking at the few drops of liquid bottom of my mug. I knew being a pirate wouldn\u2019t be easy, I knew it\u2019d be violent and end in violence. However, to lose in that fashion without even being able to use my devil fruit to calm or question our opponent and losing everything still took its toll on me.\n\nScratching at the growing stubble with one hand, the other I raised my mug to demand another drink and as such the bartender approached to fill my mug.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking a little rough there, you sure you need another?\u201d The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to do. I don\u2019t even know what else to do with myself.\u201d I responded grumpily. \u201cJust fill it up.\u201d I demanded.\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.\n\n**Idea 5: Sword Art Online.**\n\n(*Fairly simple it\u2019s SAO set in the original death game. I love the idea, so I\u2019ve always loved rping this one. If you want to play canon characters my favorite is for sure Lizbeth, but I\u2019m open to OC characters!)*\n\n**Starter**: It\u2019s been months since Akihiko Kayaba has trapped us into this death game. Or at least that\u2019s how some people looked at it. Others saw it as their dream come true. But most if not, all wanted to push forward and beat the game.\n\nDespite the desire to push forward little progress has been made. Guilds and parties have formed to push through dungeons but with the increased danger and with it more deaths; more and more people simply decided to live out their lives on the lower floors.\n\nUnlike those rushing in to push through the content I was happy enough to go through it at my own pace. This place was like a dream for me, save for the fact I had an increased chance of dying. I was able to live in this game without the worries of the outside world.\n\nI was doing some late-night grinding in an area of dense forest. The sun had set and there was little light save for the bright moon poking through the trees. All was calm, the trees swayed with the wind and the occasional sound of creatures moving about was enough to calm me.\n\nHowever, the deeper I got into the forest the louder a sound became. At first it was quiet but as I approached, I heard it more clearly. It sounded like steel clashing against steel. Someone was fighting. Moving from a casual walk into a jog I quickly came to a small clearing where I saw two figures fighting, although in the low light I couldn\u2019t make it out until I got closer.\n\n**Idea 6: Fairy Tail.**\n\n(*it\u2019s been a little while since I\u2019ve seen the series, but I\u2019ve always loved it! Given my time away I might have to take some time to refamiliarize myself with the magics. My character will simply be an entry level member into the guild to begin with, canon characters are welcome just as OCs are! This will be set four years after the series ends so all characters are over the age of 18.*)\n\n**Starter**: Four years after the 100 year quest and it was another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn\u2019t part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.\n\nI had only been part of the guild for a few days and so far, it\u2019s not been as exciting as I\u2019d hoped, although I figured that it\u2019d pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. \u201cSchwarzer my boy!\u201d He said as he patted me on the shoulder. \u201cHow are you fitting in?\u201d He questioned.\n\n\u201cFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.\u201d I say to him in response.\n\n\u201cGlad to hear it! You\u2019ve been doing a good job, although I\u2019d like to see you do more.\u201d The male said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?\u201d He questioned.\n\n\u201cYes of course!\u201d I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.\n\n\u201cGreat!\u201d He said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to who you\u2019ll be working with.\u201d He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.\n\n**Idea 7: Attack on Titan.**\n\n*(So this is just an attack on titan rp, it\u2019ll be a mainly adventure and action adventure-based RP. I\u2019ll probably stick the start of the story after everyone reaches the scouts. I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019ll make him a titan shifter or not.)*\n\nThere was a soft \u201cthunk\u201d as my hooks embedded themselves into a tree and I reeled myself onto the branch. I panted heavily as I felt the titan\u2019s blood evaporating off of me and turned towards the titan corpse which was steaming.\n\nI was panting a little heavily as I wiped the fat beads of sweat from my brow and slicked my ginger hair back from my face as my blue eyes looked towards the large forest. No matter how many titans I killed it seemed that there were more.\n\n\u201cDamnit how did I get stuck on this mission?\u201d I questioned as I wiped my forehead with the back of my hand flicking it off into the undergrowth below. Soon there was a \u201cthunk\u201d which signalled that another was joining me and I turned towards the female form reeling herself up. \u201cNeed a hand?\u201d I asked them as I reached my hand down to help her up onto the branch.\n\n**Idea 8: Demon Slayer**\n\n*(I\u2019ve recently seen the Mugen train move and it reignited my love for this series so of course I had to include it! This\u2019ll be pretty open with ocs or canon characters so feel free to jump in as wither way! My character will be a member of the demon slayer corps on a mission.)*\n\nStarter: I panted heavily and clutched at my side. My shaking hand held the hilt of my blade tightly in my hand as I felt as though my body was going to give in at any moment. \u201cDamnit. There\u2019s no end to them.\u201d I say staring to the mass of the demons in front of me. Behind me laid a mass of them which had all been decapitated and was in the process of being evaporated.\n\nChecking my hand clutched at my side I inspected it to see it had begun to dampen with blood. I cursed under my breath wondering if this was it and steadied my breathing hoping to staunch the bleeding or at least calm my heard down enough that it\u2019d be slower. This might be it for me. A mission which seemed to have no end. I cursed as I wondered if even a Hashira would have issues with this.\n\nThe surge of demons rushed forward once again and I exhaled. Steadying my breathing the winds around me changed. \u201cFirst form: Dust Whirlwind Cutter\u201d I say as I surged forward slicing through the closest demons and giving myself another moment to breathe. However my feet were shaky and I stumbled slightly. Many of the demons who noticed my weakening form began to laugh almost in a taunting and mocking manner as they stepped towards me once again.\n\n**Idea 9: Persona.**\n\n(*So basically this is just gonna be a fairly interesting idea. My character along with the girls of persona 3, 4 and 5 get stranded in this strange dimension where they have to fight their way out to make it back to their own worlds.*)\n\n**Starter:** It all happened so fast. One minute I was in a team meeting with my group discussing what we should use our newfound powers for next. And the next second, I had blinked and I was in some kind of strange room.\n\nOne by one more people were added into this room. Some of which were dressed in some elaborate costumes. And I frowned as I looked at each one of them, all of which I didn\u2019t recognize at all and judging by their looks they didn\u2019t recognize me. Although before we managed to introduce ourselves a booming voice broke the silence.\n\n\u201cWelcome all!\u201d The clearly male voice commented. \u201cTo the room of my design.\u201d He added on. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all confused. And no doubt you\u2019ll want to return back to your homes. However, to do so you\u2019ll need to enter my labyrinth. \u201cMake it to the end and you\u2019ll all return home.\u201d The voice explained.\n\n\u201cOf course, this maze isn\u2019t without its dangers. Enemies, much like you encounter on a regular basis will roam these halls. As well as beasts of my own design far stronger than those\u2026 Fear not though for every checkpoint you reach this room will become more furnished with amenities. For now, you simply have beds to rest on.\u201d He said as there was an audible click and the dark room was suddenly lit up. Sure, enough there were rows of beds all lined up one for each person to sleep on.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to test yourself, step through this door and enter the first level of the labyrinth.\u201d He declared as a large door appeared and opened up in front of them.\n\nFor a while nobody said anything, probably all too stunned to even process the information. \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re all persona users given what he just said.\u201d I spoke up. \u201cI guess we should probably start with names and strengths, right?\u201d I questioned the group. \u201cI\u2019m Chris Schwarzer.\u201d I say. \u201cMy persona Serapth focuses on ranged combat.\u201d I explained.\n\n**Idea 10: Final Fantasy.**\n\n*(So this is simply going to be an idea with no starter since it will probably change depending on the many FF universes. My favourite however is defs FF7. (Tifa, Jessie and Aerith are best girls) with follow-ups being 12, 13, 15, 10, 8 and 9. Basically a fight would take the Main character of those series, Cloud, Noct, ect out of commission and needing a leader the other characters step up and hire mine on. Similar to some of my other prompts but I never said I was creative :\\^) With that being said though if you ARE interested in this one let me know and we can work out details depending on what world we\u2019re in!)*\n\n**Here\u2019s my starter for Final Fantasy I\u2019ve left it open ended so it can be moulded to fit any of the stories!**\n\n\u201cHiyah!\u201d I grunted out as I swung my blade slicing through a monster\u2019s flesh and parting its head from its shoulders. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. Crouching down over the beast\u2019s head I picked it up and placed it into a burlap sack before hoisting it over my shoulder.\n\nI was a rather well known mercenary by trade and as such I was told to go out and kill this creature. Easily done and it paid a decent amount. Heading back into town I headed over to the bar which the notice was posted in and placed the head of the creature onto the counter. \u201cGot it done.\u201d I mentioned to the barkeep.\n\nThe older man frowned a little and looked down at the bag. The blood splatter against his counter showed I was telling the truth and he placed a sack of Gil on the counter which I scooped up. \u201cThanks.\u201d I said which earned me a gruff grunt back.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019tcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain\u2019t want it.\u201d He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.\u201cRight, I\u2019ll get on that.\u201d I say as I grabbed the sack.\u201cAn there was a woman lookin for you.\u201d He stated. \u201cShe\u2019s in a room upstairs. Second on the left.\u201d He said as he got to work cleaning the blood from the bar.I gave him a nod and thanked him while I headed out and disposed of the head. With that out of the way I decided to head up to the room to see what this mystery woman wanted. Knocking on the door I cleared my throat. \u201cIt\u2019s Schwarzer, you asked for me? Down at the bar?\u201d I called out.\u00a0\n\n**Idea 11: The Witcher 3.**\n\n(*So my character will be a Witcher. (wow!) Saving people, hunting things you know? The family business. Anyway, I\u2019m gonna leave it super open ended for you to come in however you like! If you wanna play a canon character my top two are for sure Ciri and Trist, and OC characters are accepted too!*)\n\n**Starter:** A Werewolf, an odd and rare contract, although I figured it wouldn\u2019t be a hard one. In fact I figured with my silver blade that the creature would go down rather quickly. Starting the encounter, I was faced with a harsh reality due to my hubris. I started off well enough, however due to my carelessness I was quickly on the backfoot.\n\nThe beast roared as it swung its large clawed hand towards me. I had barely managed to roll out of the way of the attack. Probably due to the increasing levels of blood loss resulting in a careless action on my part. A level of confidence quickly pushed down by the fact a handful of open wounds stung at my flanks.\n\nMore scars for later given that I make it out of here, although with my silver blade thrown on the other side of the area leaving me with only a steel sword which barely even phases the thing. I had to reach my blade, although with my focus on dodging the attacks it was hard to find an opening to do so.\n\nI raised a hand and cast the igni sign launching flames at the creature who leapt back and I tried my best to make it past the creature only to have to dodge another strike as the beast recovered remarkably fast. \u201cStubborn bastard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I questioned a little sourly.\n\n**Idea 12: Space/Scifi (Or Mass Effect).**\n\n*(So this is a scifi adventure. My character is the captain of his own ship and is currently looking for recruits to join him and help run it. There will probably be lots of interesting planets our characters go to and I\u2019ll certainly be making them up as we go along! Your character can range as anything from a human to android or even an alien.)*\n\n**Starter:** Stepping out of The Tempest I breathed in the humid station air of Astra station. The station which was on the furthest reaches of the space ruled over the galactic council; was a haven for the depraved. Outlaws, mercenaries, drug dealers you name it Astra has it and in bountiful supply too.\n\nWhich made it a perfect spot to find someone who was desperate to get off the station. Someone who would work for cheap or for free. All I needed to do was to find them.\n\n\u201cSchwarzer, don\u2019t forget to stock up on food, military rations are sad.\u201d A voice commented through the earpiece I had.\n\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll head through the slums and to the market. Thanks, Evai.\u201d I responded.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t cause any trouble, I don\u2019t wanna rot in this ship while you\u2019re dead.\u201d The voice added on.\n\n\u201cYeah yeah I\u2019ve got it.\u201d I responded as the communication line was severed and I started on my walk.\n\nI headed through a nearby door and down into the depths of the station. Soon I entered the overcrowded and frankly smelly slums. Beggars and gang members lined every corner all looking at me with a cautious eye as I passed. There were even a few tweaked out drug users laying scattered about in some dark corners. Even a few corpses.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop though, if you stayed in one place too long down here you were asking to be jumped and quickly, I pushed on heading over to the bustling markets. The food quality here wasn\u2019t the best although it was abundant. I even talked to a few of the store owners to see if they knew where I could find the extra hands to help me on my ship.\n\n**Idea 13: Bladebreaker/Xenoblade 2**\n\nSo this rp is going to be based heavily off of Xenoblade 2, however I\u2019m going to leave it more OC so that anyone can jump in. I\u2019ll give as much information as I can and if you have any questions let me know! I\u2019m going to be looking for a few blades (Human weapons) and a few human party members as well! ))\n\n\\-----\n\nThe human population is facing extinction. Currently humanity is living on the back of giant, living creatures called titans, these titans come in many different sizes from full sized countries to small boats. However more and more of these creatures are dying and leaving humanity with little space to live.\n\nOf course, the dwindling space has given rise to wars and famine. Desperate countries hoping to expand and find new places to live. Two empires in particular. The Reksis. An empire ruled by an inexperienced ruler. They subjugate titans to their will twisting them into tools of war, and breaking their bodies with the use of machinery.\n\nThe other side of this war are the Eldians, those who work alongside their titans and build lesser modifications using the titan\u2019s natural resources. Their towns and cities are built in ways that don't harm the titans. Their leader is elected democratically and their weaponry is much more infantry based. They also rely on mercenary bands in their armies who act much like unleashed dogs against the armies and civilians they are sent to.\n\nTitans didn\u2019t just hold life either. They provided for their users with beings called blades. These blades which start off in crystal-like cores unless awoken are weaponized life forms who link with humans in order to give them superhuman abilities. Some blades give access to a certain element, such as fire, ice, earth, wind, water, electricity, light and dark. Some focus on healing their user. Others boost primarily physical attributes. Some do a mixture of both if not all. Such blades are incredibly rare though. (Kinda like rare pulls on mobile games)\n\nThose who summon these blades are called drivers. Unique people with aptitude. And with the immense number of blade cores in the world there\u2019s a divide between a low-class blade and a high class one. Drivers aren\u2019t exactly rare as most people have the aptitude given the right blade. However, those who try to summon a blade outside of their abilities are met with severe consequences. Although that hasn\u2019t stopped many drivers from having multiple blades\n\nAs such people who are after rare core crystals pay a heavy fortune in order to get their hands-on rare lifeforms in order to give themselves power.\n\nThat\u2019s where I come in\u2026 I\u2019m not a driver\u2026. Or at least I wasn\u2019t \u2026 I was a simple mercenary\u2026 sort of, I did\u2026 and still do jobs for the right price.\n\nOr at least I did until this particular job\u2026\n\nMy footsteps splashed against the wet concrete and my breath was laboured as I held a glowing core against my chest. I was hired to steal it from a wealthy merchant\u2026 I just didn\u2019t expect the merchant to have a driver as his security. And a particular strong one at that. My left hand held my blade which had been shattered by one attack. I was lucky enough to guard it, however I had no chance of fending him off now.\n\nI rapidly approached a wall of concrete and turned on my heel. I was backed in and the Driver knew that. He approached holding a large axe, a weapon manifested from his blade which walked beside him. The tether of light shone between them showing their link.\n\n\u201cKill him.\u201d The blade spoke up. His form is humanoid however he had robotic wolf-like features.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t no fun in killin him so soon, he\u2019s got nowhere to go.\u201d The driver responded as he hoisted the great axe over his shoulders.\n\n\u201cGo on now, hand over that core crystal and I\u2019ll make your death swift.\u201d The male commented as his blade paced back and forth like a hungry wolf. \u201cIt\u2019ll be more fun if you resist.\u201d The blade commented clearly excited about the prospect.\n\nI clenched my jaw as my hand squeezed around the core in my hand\u2026 it seemed to be my only chance to escape. It wasn\u2019t like I had anything to lose when I was facing death. With a deep inhale I closed my eyes and crushed the core in my hand.\n\n\u201cHey! Hey! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d The driver said as he shot forward. There was a bright surge of light which enveloped me. A long blade of light was formed in my hand. Its hilt felt warm while the blade itself was a blue light.\n\nThe driver swore and leapt back as he saw the lone figure become a pair, his axe at the ready as he knew a fight was inbound. I turned to my right to see the blade I had tethered myself too. Clearly a female form, and while she didn\u2019t look like much the brilliant shine of her weapon in my hand was enough to tell me she wasn\u2019t just an ordinary weapon. \u201cSorry to wake you up like this, I didn\u2019t have much of a choice.\u201d I mentioned to her apologetically.\n\n**Idea 14: Fantasy Harem Adventure.**\n\n*(This one is fairly basic in nature. Basically, a young man with little combat experience leaves his poor hunting village once he\u2019s of age and sets off to join the adventurer\u2019s guild to make a name for himself and also to send money back home. He\u2019s fairly modest, naive and kind hearted. Which makes him likable and easy to take advantage of.*\n\n*We could add a story with war elements, racism and darker themes to show him that the world he idolizes isn\u2019t as cracked up as he thought it\u2019d be. Ideally, I\u2019d like a full harem party for this one but I\u2019m cool with one on one too.)*\n\nStarter: It had been a few days since I was finally able to leave the small village, I was raised in behind me. Sword on hip and keen to become an adventurer. Of course, I also wanted to make a name for myself and I was even more excited to see everything the world had to offer. With driving me forward I headed from my village over to the closest city which had a guild branch. A city called Ruan. It was nearly five times the size of my village if not more and yet it was nothing close to the capital city of Grancel.\n\nSmooth dirt paths soon gave way to cobblestone and my boots clacked rhythmically against the pavement as my steps soon got faster and faster as Ruan came into view. My stomach was in knots as I gripped the straps on my bag tightly and after steeling my nerves and taking in the sight of the large city, I headed through the large stone arch to the busy streets beyond.\n\nMy excited eyes looked around at every nook and cranny as I took in every detail that was on offer. Soon coming across the large marble and wood building of the adventurer\u2019s guild in front of me. I stood in front of the large building clearly awestruck and for a moment I felt completely overwhelmed. This was it. This was the first step I was going to take on my journey and yet I felt far too nervous to head inside. Instead, I stood there shaking slightly as I tried to work up the courage to push those large oak doors aside and declare my presence to the world.\n\n**Closing words:** And that is everything!! I wanna say thanks for reading this and if you have any questions or suggestions, I\u2019m open to hearing them! I know this was probably a big read so thanks again for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon!",

I'm so sad that it's cold now and I have to cover up my body to keep warm.\n\nWhen I have the energy and guts, I've been going out, dressed like a slut, looking for guys who will grope me or worse. I feel so ashamed as they touch me, but when I get home I cum incredibly hard! I've been taking more and more risks, hoping for more and more serious \"assaults\".\n\nDo you do this too? Or, do you just want to talk about what a ridiculously fucked up slut I am?\n\nI have a whole lot of taboo turn ons. Some I've tried, some I only hope to. Watersports, exhibitionism, incest, body modification, and sex work are a few that come to mind.\n\nIf we've talked before, please get back in touch! My other prompts are open too.",

I won\u2019t be as harsh as I want others to be to me, I just can\u2019t deny how much I love to bring pleasure to others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I can make it pleasure at my pace, under my control. I can pull you out of the club and teasingly blindfold you before taking you to my bedroom, tying you up and then edging you with my mouth all night. I can put you on the leash and walk you around town before giving you your treat. I can make you wear the buttplug all day, rewarding you for your endurance by stepping on you in my heels before I ride you cowgirl. I can pound your asshole with a strapon and film you as you eat me out, and it\u2019s ever too much for you to handle, you can try and turn the tables on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I\u2019m a 4\u201911\u201d chinese descended slut who is donning the leather of control for the first time, keeping my DDs bound in latex or leather, not lingerie and tying you up, not getting tied up with my long black hair. But I know this isn\u2019t the traditional look of a domme so I\u2019m happy to RP as my actual straight (well bi) domme friend Ellen. Blue short hair with pale white skin, always in black leather, just slightly less of it when domming, tall and thin with like, I guess B cups?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut if you\u2019re wanting either one of us to pull you out of a club and take control of your night/week drop me an orange envelope, I want to find out if I like domming and if anyone else likes getting dommed.",

            "selftext": "It all started a few weeks back... after a break up you needed a new place to stay, and the room I was offering seemed too good to be true. Cheep rent, good location, and just one roommate you could have sworn you recognized from something... there was only one down side, you would occasionally have to stay out of the living room while I do a photo shoot for work. What else could you say but yes?\n\nOnce you moved in life was pretty good, you knew I was some kind of model, but never really asked any more that that, your work was going smoothly, and I\u2019d only had a shoot in the apartment once since you moved in. But... you were now single, which means that most nights lead you to, *ahem*, that side of the internet. You scroll through the familiar videos of \u2018teen sluts\u2019 and \u2018honey Latino milfs\u2019 until you click on one you\u2019ve never watched before. The best kind of porn, new porn!\n\nYou let the video start, slowly getting to work on yourself, before something clicks... You stare at the screen as your eyes go wide. Now you know why you recognized your new roommate, it was because you\u2019d seen her before, only naked and with a face full of cum. You turn the video off, you cant... not if your living with her... You head to the kitchen to grab a drink, only to find me bent over in front of the fridge, wearing nothing but a loose hoodie, smiling as i see you. It... couldn\u2019t hurt to ask about it... right?\n\nHey guys! So, fun scene idea that popped into my head today during work... what if your roommate was a pornstar? I\u2019m wanting to play this out as a slice of life kinda thing. Do you just try and get her to fool around with you a little? Or maybe you end up romancing her? Either way I\u2019d like you to be a regular guy or girl, even a little more cuddle if you get me ;) As for me I\u2019m Sam, 21, 5\u20194, tone build, light all over tan, green eyes, shoulder length hair died blue, c cups, piercings in ears, tongue, nipples belly button, and clit. Kinks include oral, anal, squirting, soft sex, fingering, casual nudity, and toys. Hope to hear from you all soon~",

            "selftext": "My name is Ashleigh. I'm bright, bombastic, and quite ambitious. I'm a 22 year old who models regularly. I consider myself pretty attractive and others do as well. About a year ago, I met a girl named Sarah at one of my shoots. She is also a model but only part-time. We hit it off immediately and there was something that really drew me towards her, perhaps it was just the fact that she was practically dripping in submissiveness and I am naturally very domme. There was only one problem. I love my girls a bit softer and considering we met at a modeling shoot, you can probably guess she was quite lean at the time. We would up talking more during the shoot and then we started seeing each other outside of the shoot as well. After a few chats, she started to give in to my desires a bit and it only made sense. Only one of us was going to take off in modeling and it was probably going to be the younger, taller, more ambitious one. She was already 27 at the time which is impressive that she had held on for as long as she had, but she was working full time in a different job so she knew the writing was on the wall. No more dieting and much more living for pleasure. Needless to say, I have gotten more gigs over time while her gigs are getting fewer and fewer yet we both really, really enjoy the path we are on and we want to chat and share with others about it all and most certainly have some fun along the way as well.",

Sometimes I can rapid fire, sometimes it may only be a few times. But I usually reply at least once a day. And I never ghost. \n\nI average 1-3 paragraphs per response, depending on the length of the message I'm replying to.\n\nI was thinking you'd be a single mom, with me as your supporting son. Maybe I've got a sibling as well, or maybe it's just us. Dad either died or abandoned us. You did your best to raise us, but as soon as I could help, you started leaning on me to give you a hand. \n\nLife isn't easy, I was thinking you work as a waitress/stripper or another low-income type job, and I work odd part time jobs to help support us. I didn't want to play this off as us being sleazy or trailer trash. It's just what we need to do to get by. I'm known pretty well by the people you work with, and we're sort of like a family, in a lot of odd ways.\n\nI'd like to explore us developing a relationship. Some story to go along with the smut. It could be purely sexual, or maybe we fall in love and have to navigate the ups and downs of a forbidden relationship?\n\nI'm hoping for something with equal parts story and smut. Maybe we live in a big city, or maybe we live in a small town where everyone knows each other?\n\nI'd like to build on the above a but together. I left it a little generic to try and allow for anything you might like to add into it before we start. I'm happy to build on or adjust anything to better line up with what you might like.  \n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "\"Okay, my turn,\" Susan said, leaning back on the carpet to take a long drag of her cigarette. \"Never have I ever... smoked weed.\"\n\nThere was a sound of clinking glasses and fizzy bubbles, as most of us in the room drank. The only exception was Allie, my girlfriend, who'd never smoked weed in her life. In a drinking game intended to reveal what naughty things each person in the room had done, hers was the only cup in the room that was still full.\n\nStill, I was glad that my girlfriend was being a bit more social. She'd had a very sheltered childhood, and when we met, she was too shy to meet people or make friends. She didn't date or sneak out during high school, and she didn't drink or party in college. In fact, it was only after meeting me that she'd learned to relax and enjoy the occasional house party.\n\nIt was Brad's turn after that. \"Never have I ever...\" he mulled, trying to think of something that hadn't been asked yet. \"Never have I ever....dated two people at the same time.\"\n\nThere was a lot of giggling after that, as Ben, Chris and Susan all drank. \"You mean like cheating?\" Allie said, sitting bolt upright from her seat on my lap.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Chris mumbled, sharing an embarrassed smile with his girlfriend. \"We think of it as more like....polyamory.\"\n\n\"We have an open relationship,\" Susan explained gently, knowing it might be a new concept to Allie. \"We both date other people sometimes, or just sleep with them. But we're both okay with it.\"\n\n\"But you *have* a boyfriend,\" Allie frowned, still not comprehending. \"How can you be dating someone else? How does that even *work*?\"\n\nBut as she asked, I recognized another emotion in Allie's face. She was leaning forward, her eyes wide and intent. Her lips were pursed, as if dying of curiosity and eager to explore the concept further.\n\n\"My turn,\" Ben said, his eyes briefly flitting towards Allie's face, as if he'd also noticed her rapt expression. \"Never have I ever....been attracted to another guy while I already had a boyfriend.\"\n\nAllie's face turned bright red when he said that, as if he'd exposed her innermost secret. Slowly, for the first time that night, she picked up her cup and took a drink.\n\n**Some Months Later**\n\nWe were back at Susan's house, and once again playing Never-have-I-ever. But things were a bit different this time: Allie was leaning comfortably against Ben's shoulder, her feet in my lap. She took a long drag from a joint before she passed it towards me, and then turned to refill her drink.\n\nAs the three of us lay puddled together on the futon, I tried not to notice the way Allie would occasionally run her fingers through Ben's hair. And I couldn't help the strange, occasional stirrings of jealousy when his arm slipped comfortably across her chest.\n\n\"Okay, my turn,\" Susan said. There had already been a lot of questions so for, as well as Truths and Dares. About half the people in the room had already lost or removed an article of clothing.\n\n\"Never have I ever,\" she mused, searching her memory for something that hadn't yet been asked. But then she saw Allie, and a wicked smile crossed her face. \"Never have I ever made out with someone right before a house party.\"\n\nI stared straight ahead, trying not to notice that Allie and Ben both took a drink.\n\n**Kinks** Good girls, smart girls, shy flirting, good writing, outercourse, vanilla sex, mild jealousy and guilt, believable characters with realistic bodies. NSFW\n\n**Dislikes** Improbably-proportioned body parts, deliberate humiliation, excessively-slutty clothing and bad writing. I'm okay with racial differences, but I'm not into fetishizing them.\n\n*If you think you could play as the girlfriend, tell me what she might like to do on a first date. Reddit PMs only, no chat.*",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! \n\nMy name is Stephanie. 28.f.USA. \n\nI am looking for people who are extremely open minded, creative, and detailed. Please respect this request and don't just message me for no reason. \n\nI am looking to provide a fantasy type pic with a few specific details added to someone and then pick your brain on a scenario idea regarding it. From there we can either write a smut story or possibly even roleplay the scenario together!\n\nIf we are a good match and you enjoy doing this, we can do more pics as well. It is a fantasy type pic (involving a humanoid anthro) and not of me so the story will be of 3rd person perspective. \n\nWarning: scenario is very sexual and sci-fi based. Huge bonus if you're a cocky bisexual! So pls mention if you are!\n\nK: geeky_stephanie",

            "selftext": "Ever wished you'd dated more when you were younger?\n\nMy girlfriend does. She'd always considered herself a bit of a Plain Jane, but the truth is she was just shy. As a result, she missed out on a lot of the fun of growing up: no parties, no awkward makeout sessions, no late-night sneaking around. She'd had crushes on a couple of guys, but she was too introverted to do anything about it.\n\nNow she's in her twenties and a year into a committed relationship. I don't think either of us would give that up for anything....but I can't blame her for wondering.\n\nThings started to change after we started dating. She's become a lot more confident, learning to flirt and dress up and work out, and started going out to the bar once in a while with her girlfriends. She's even made friends with some guys.\n\nWhich led to a slight dilemma: one of her new guy friends seems to have a bit of a crush on her, and she admitted to me in hushed tones that she finds him a bit cute. He's just her type: smart, bookish, a bit of a musician, but confident enough to flirt casually without getting awkward about it.\n\nI admit, I was a bit jealous at first....but soon I was peeking over her shoulder as she texted him, helping her decode the flirty emojis when he texted back. And soon after that I found myself helping her pick out a cute outfit, showing just enough curvature to attract his attention.\n\nAnd soon after that, I found myself sitting at home alone, staring at my phone and wondering if I should text again. Wondering if she'd need a ride home....or if she'd be staying the night.\n\n**Kinks** Good girls, smart girls, shy flirting, good writing, outercourse, vanilla sex, mild jealousy and guilt, believable characters with realistic bodies. NSFW\n\n**Dislikes** Improbably-proportioned body parts, deliberate humiliation, excessively-slutty clothing and bad writing. I'm okay with racial differences, but I'm not into fetishizing them.\n\n*If you think you could play as the girlfriend, tell me what you think she'd like to do on a first date. PM only, no chat.*",

            "selftext": "I love casual face-sitting and ass worship. Don't get me wrong, I love the lick now slave stuff too. But there is something about it not needing to be said and just expected. You don't tell your refrigerator to keep things cold do you?\n\nThe other aspect of it that I enjoy is the act being somewhat ignored. Not entirely because that would make for a boring roleplay but just mostly. The attention is mostly on you doing something else. You don't focus on your pillow when you're reading in bed unless you need to reposition. You just focus on what you're doing.\n\nHence, \"Facesit and Zoom\" I want to be your seat while you're doing something else. Need to be in a boring meeting and need a little entertainment? Want to binge watch some show but don't want to just flop on the couch? Feel gross if you go for a jog and sit on the couch? My face is available no matter the situation.\n\nAll you have to do is say \"I have a meeting\" or \"I need to catch up on the latest season\" and I'll get right in position. However I do love the idea of being encased or bound in such a way that I don't have a choice. I'd still happily chose to be in that position but having the choice taken away excites me.\n\nIf you want to roleplay a scene like I've described or just chat about face sitting or ass worship, please don't hesitate to send me a message.",

            "selftext": "The website had been booming which was natural considering the success of Blacked. It was only natural before someone pitched the idea.\n\n'What about BLEACHED?'\n\n'What?'\n\n'You know, the opposite of BLACKED?!'\n\n'Uh, okay... I guess.'\n\n'BIG WHITE COCKS.'\n\n'*Okay*...'\n\n'Big white cocks opposite of women of color!'\n\n'Okay, *okay*...'\n\n'And the women want their butts fucked!'\n\n'FUCK YEAH! SOLD!'\n\nAnd BLEACHED was born. With the launch of their first video, it was a major success. Millions upon millions of views, all of their social media profiles blowing up considering the market was hungry for the sight of big butts being split by white cocks. With the world finally embracing huge butts, it was about time that they got the fucking they deserved, and on camera!\n\nWas there anything better than the sharp contrast of a heavy white dick opposite of a stacked woman with a different skin tone? Of course not. Picture it; a chiseled white man with a fat, heavy cock... Opposite of a curvy, thick and stacked woman with all this juicy ass meat that needs to be spread and plugged by a white pole.\n\nIt's always a depraved and hot time. Nasty talking with lust, the poor slut begging for that white cock. Gorgeous scenes of big butts sitting on the face of these white men, hungrily riding that face with the view of that little pucker being tongued.\n\nAnd there's so many different networks of BLEACHED. Bangbus, casting couch, gangbangs, risky public fucks, cheesy porn scenes with terrible plots.\n\n---\n\nKinks -&gt; Assplay (rimjobs, anal, fingering, etc), oilplay, dirty/nasty talk, humiliation, public fun, cheating, interracial, creampies, facefucking.\n\nTell me which sort of scene you would enjoy writing, open to ideas when it comes to the porn being shot! You can also tell me which race you want your big booty partner to be in your scene. Let's create a hot, kinky and filthy anal scene on camera together!",

            "selftext": "Professor Teak's heels clacked as she walked down the aisle and collected everyone's papers after her pop quiz. Whenever she received one she would quickly glance at it and make internal comments.\n\n*Hmmm, looks good.*\n\n*Oh no, close but no cigar.*\n\n*He needs to study more.*\n\nFinally she came up to one student, one Miss Leila Bradford. Her cheeks slightly blushed and she took a keen interest in what her answers would be. She had not so subtly hinted at the pop quiz to her beforehand and outright gave her the answers so she expected full marks. What she saw next stopped her in her footsteps. The quiz consisted of ten questions. Her answers were...interesting.\n\n1. I\n\n2. Want\n\n3. To\n\n4. Sit\n\n5. On\n\n6. Your\n\n7. Face\n\n8. Your\n\n9. Office\n\n10. After\n\n10a. Class\n\nThe gall of her, to even put a 10a to fit in her extra word. Nevertheless Professor Teak's thighs clutched together as she felt her sex moisten. She quickly composed herself and continued walking down the aisle collecting papers with no one the wiser. She looked back at Leila and saw a mischievous smile on her face which made Professor Teak's own blush deepen. She knew that Leila had her around her little pink, and she fucking loved it.\n\nAfter class she tried to quickly pack her things and leave but a few students approached her with questions about the class, the pop quiz, and other nonsense. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Leila leave the classroom and wanted to stamp her feet in frustration. She didn't want to miss this but she had duties as an educator. She quickly answered their questions and made it obvious that she had somewhere to be.\n\nFinally she managed to slip away to her office. She had tenure at the university and was given a single office where most professors had to share. It was a very helpful perk, especially at times like this. As she opened the door she saw Leila at her desk rifling through last week's test papers. Immediately she locked the door behind her, set her bag aside, and dropped to her hands and knees before crawling around the desk to Leila.\n\nLeila paid her no mind and continued to rifle through the papers and occasionally laughed. \"Haha, that idiot. Why would you put that there?\" Leila's legs were crossed and one leg shook in front of Professor Teak's face. The only thing she knew was that she had to serve. So she stuck out her tongue and began to lick at Leila's heels. \"I'm sorry I took so long mommy. The students. They *mmm mmm shlrp shlrp* They had questions and I *shlrp* I had to.\" \n\nLeila's eyes didn't move from the papers and responded. \"Hmm oh right. So, have you been a good girl today, Emma?\" Leila picked up a fountain pen and began to scribble comments on a few of the papers. Some of them quite demeaning to the student. She had taken up a habit of doing so but Emma couldn't find it in herself to stop her, even if it endangered her job. \"Y-yes Mommy. I did all your homework, washed the laundry, fixed your bed, and mopped the floors today.\" \n\nLeila giggled as she wrote another silly comment on a paper. \"Hmm. Good.\" Her legs uncrossed, giving Emma permission to go further. Emma began to kiss along her legs starting from calf to knee to thigh, worshipping Leila's legs with her lips. Finally Leila had gotten bored of vandalizing the papers and spun her gaze to look at Emma's vulgar display of submission with a smile. Emma was a highly respected professor but in front of Leila she was nothing but a submissive little suck pet. Leila was almost half Emma's age but Emma still called her 'Mommy' to show her deference. \n\nEmma's kisses had gone up Leila's thighs so deeply her head was in Leila's skirt. She hadn't been given permission to lick *there* yet, so she could only kiss and lick at Leila's thighs and beg. \"M-may I please make you feel good Mommy? Emma has been a good girl today. *mwah mwah mwah*\"\n\nEmma couldn't help but feel shame at her lowly display. She wasn't even begging to be pleasured, that might have made a little sense. She was begging to *give* pleasure. It was so fucked up but there was something about Leila, something about making her feel good that satisfied Emma in ways she couldn't even begin to understand. Nothing in her life had ever given her more pleasure than being Leila's suckpet. That's why she let Leila scribble on her notes, that's why she did Leila's homework, that's why she risked her job by giving Leila the test answers, that's why she degraded herself by calling a younger woman 'Mommy', that's why she was on her hands and knees begging like a dog to just be given permission to use her tongue on Leila's perfectly pink pussy. She panted and whined as her panties soaked with her desire.\n\nLeila looked down at Emma and giggled as she pat her on the head. \"Good girl. You can lick now.\"\n\n-----------------------------\n\nHope you enjoyed that little story. In the RP I would be playing the role of Leila. I'm essentially looking for a suckpet that likes to give more than receive. If you look at my username you'll see what I mean. \n\nI like the dynamic of it being an older woman being a submissive little girl to a younger woman. There's just something about someone so highly respected being turned into nothing than a pet that's insanely hot.\n\nIf you're thinking of messaging I do have a few requirements. My partner would need to be able to write 3+ paragraphs at least and I absolutely do not respond to reddit chat. Unlike the story written here I write in first person, paste tense and like the same from my partner. I look forward to your responses! :)",

            "selftext": "All characters 18+.\n\nI've provided an excerpt below, which is a kind of rough draft, that may help to set the scene. I've seen some people comment on things about the woman writing the introduction of the male character; from what I've seen on certain threads, some seem to think that it's off-putting when a woman does that, essentially taking the freedom of characterisation away from their partner, while others seem to prefer having it set out for them, and seem to be left lacking when there's no 'role' for them to slip into. As such, I've tried to provide a balance below and strike it in the middle - I've written a little bit of John's introduction, but it's not absolute - it can be changed.\n\n\\*\n\nIt was by odd happenstance that John found himself in the company of two much younger women - Daisy and Robyn. Both were nineteen, while John was into his forties. Robyn has a kind of bleached-blonde hair and brown eyes, with shy looks, pale skin and a figure that's slimmer than Daisy's - not that Daisy is overweight at all, she just possesses more of the 'Instagram model' look in her body than Robyn. Robyn's ass and breasts are smaller, and she's more covered than Daisy, who has brown hair, pale skin to rival that of Robyn, blue eyes and a somewhat thick, delectable ass.\n\nDaisy's bikini wasn't like a standard bikini; it did the job of a bikini, but the lower part of it more had the look of a 'cheeky' type of underwear. As such, the shape of Daisy's ass is captured very well, rather than obscuring a great deal of it. The pale, supple flesh of the round globes were positioned against the sun, although this was largely a wasted exercise; despite her attempts, Daisy hasn't been able to tan well.\n\nWith the end of the lockdowns and the onset of summer, people have flocked to recreational areas and the like, desperate to enjoy the sunny weather with their friends for the first time in what seems like an age. Daisy and Robyn didn't mind having company such as John - both are single young women, and the amount of younger women that seek out older men has now peaked, with an exponential rise in such a phenomenon. Daisy and Robyn are no exceptions, to which they're explaining to John.\n\n\"I think I prefer older men to those our own age.\" Daisy says to John, who has only met the two within the past twenty minutes. Robyn curls the flap on the end of her purse in her hand as Daisy speaks, taking in the words and momentarily trying to be a little more coy about her feelings on such a matter, coyness of which is abruptly subdued when Daisy finishes speaking. \"It's kind of hard to explain why.\" Daisy says, lying down on her stomach all the while. Robyn then interjects, adding \"Experience, maybe? Experience is *everything*.\" Robyn says, looking at John.\n\n\"Oh my God, yeah it is.\" Daisy says, a note of longing in her voice. \"The older man's touch must feel so good. Not that I'd know, my Dad keeps older men away from me.\" Robyn nods in agreement - she's known very well of Daisy's father's stance on the matter, even after Robyn had often suspected him of partaking in the phenomenon himself.\n\nJohn has taken all of this in with pleasure, the erotic part of his brain purring as he hears these words. He'd heard of this phenomenon before and had even heard of it rising in recent times, but he never considered that it may happen to him. \"Well, to answer your question...\" John says, taking a pause before answering, purposefully acting as if he's drawing on his experience of thought before answering \"...older men do of course have more experience than the... men, your age.\" John continues, leaving a note of derision in his voice when describing men of Daisy and Robyn's age. \"I was married, and I learnt so much life experience, I can't even tell you how much.\" He finished. John was divorced, and can only imagine the reaction of his ex-wife if she saw him now.\n\n\"Er, I hope you don't mind, but I sometimes prefer to tan with my bra off.\" Daisy says to John. \"Would you mind if I did?\" She asks in a matter of fact way, a manner than maintains decorum. It helps that the three of them have a good spot, which makes Daisy feel comfortable enough to remove her bra, which she duly does after John had shown a facial expression of passivity. As she pulls off the blue fabric that concealed the most intimate part of her upper half, her breasts seem to flow out in freedom. John, of course, had mostly averted his eyes, but he could still see that Daisy's breasts are almost as good as her ass; a good shape, and not droopy or sagged.\n\n\"You mean, you try to tan with your bra off.\" Robyn teases, alluding to Daisy's failure to get a tan, to which Daisy retorts with a tongue-in-cheek middle finger as she lies back down, this time upon her back. Smiling, Robyn continues \"You shouldn't worry about it. They say some men like pale women. Maybe older men do?\" She finishes, looking at John as she lies down as well.\n\n\\*\n\nThere it is, a kind of draft. I'm open to changes, so please don't feel discouraged if you think I've laid John out too much in the introduction. We can detail how he comes to meet the two and we can also place more padding into their conversation.",

Maybe it\u2019s fun bringing her partner, or hookups to a place that\u2019s so normal, maybe she meets a local neighbor, lots of options. \n. \n\n* Maybe she\u2019s letting a relative live with her for a while as he changes careers or something- sure it\u2019s a large home but there might be some awkward moments nonetheless. \n\n* Maybe she\u2019s recently married, and has a naughty honeymoon or other getaway with her husband and her new stepson. Maybe she\u2019s not married but takes her brother or nephew on a vacation she\u2019d intended to go on with a recent ex. \n\n* Maybe a celeb is trapped in her hotel/resort/cabin/etc by weather and passes the time in the most entertaining way possible :p \n\n* A celeb overhears someone else getting lucky, or maybe finding a relative\u2019s Magnum condoms and getting curious.  \n\nIf any of those ideas appeal, run with it! Or add a twist! Or combine some ideas! Or offer something totally different! \n\n\nPossible celebs: Scarlett Johansson, Lacey Chabert, Emilia Clarke, Kristen Bell, Ashley Tisdale, Mila Kunis, Kate Beckinsale, Jennifer Lawrence, Rihanna, Angelina Jolie, Alyson Hannigan, Audrina Patridge, Margot Robbie, Halle Berry, Courteney Cox, Christina Aguilera, Amanda Seyfried, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Emma Watson, Kaley Cuoco, Katherine Heigl, Anne Hathaway, Jenna Fischer, Hayden Panetierre, Yvonne Strahovski, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Emma Stone, Mila Kunis, Sofia Vergara, Carmen Electra, Taylor Swift  would all be fun today. Please name **5 faves** from that list, I love options. \n\nBe as creative as you\u2019d like, I\u2019m really quite open to the sort of plot you\u2019d like to explore!\n\nJust name your kinks and limits, and maybe mention a few general ideas that you find appealing, and we'll work something out together :) (if you had a specific idea in mind I\u2019d love to hear that as well!) \n\n\nPlease refrain from anything underage, toilet, animals, or extremely Dom/sub oriented, and I'll be happy. :) Also, avoid cliches like directors, bodyguards, etc if possible. I applaud your interest and ideas :). \n\n\nBonus points for ideas involving MFM threesomes, guys who like foot play, something taboo (like some family themes), a well endowed partner, a \"normal\" event or setting with a twist, or maybe something based on a romantic premise (though perhaps one that didn't turn out as expected?).\n\n**This prompt is open indefinitely!

            "selftext": "I couldn't really believe this was happening. My dream of moving to Los Angeles was really coming true. Ever since I was eighteen and started working out, soon becoming an amateur model, I had decided this would be my goal. Move to the model and Instagram influencer capital of the world. Sun, beaches, bikinis and showbiz. What more could you want?\n\nI had signed with some small time agency who partially funded my move from London all the way to LA, but couldn't get much of an apartment. Small but functional. What was more important, however, was the gym on the ground floor. I made sure to get in there as soon as I could do I could update my followers on the big move.\n\nI made it to LA. Thanks to everyone who supported me along the way. Can't wait to see what the future holds in the next chapter of my life!\n\nI didn't think much of what I posted but I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, one it'd the absurdly hot Instagram models that lived in the area would see this young English stud and slide right on into my DMs.\n\nWhat a dream that would be, right?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nTall, handsome, muscular and giant cocked Instagram stud moves to LA to grow his brand and expand his influence. Naturally, he ends up balls deep in a bunch of models along the way. That's where you come in.\n\nEither playing one girl or a series of scenes with multiple models, we can recount the tale of the man that takes over LA and Instagram with his powerful body and giant cock before flying around the world to 'shoot' with plenty of other goddess that Instagram has to offer.\n\nGirls like Sabrina Lynn, Antje Utgaard, Abigail Ratchford, Anna Louise, in LA, Lyna Perez in Miami, Nata Lee, Valentina Grishko or Sveta Bilyalova in Russia, Veronica Bielik in Poland, Abby Dowse or Annelese Milton in Australia and tons more. Classic older MILFs like Denise Milani could be thrown into the mix as well. We can discuss the details in PM. Celebrities could play a part later on as well.\n\nHope to hear from you!\n\nAll my other prompts are open.\n\nCan play on discord too!",

            "selftext": "*It\u2019s Spring Break, and that means beaches, beers, sun, and fun! Just like thousands of other college students, on our own and without any responsibilities, I\u2019m headed for a week that I\u2019ll never forget. Unfortunately, by the time the week is over, I\u2019ll wish that I could!*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nToday I\u2019m interested in a roleplay centered on all of the misadventures that I can end up getting into on my first-ever Spring Break. I\u2019ve got a few ideas for what those misadventures can be:\n\n*Going Wild*: Girls Gone Wild may be a thing of the past, but there\u2019s plenty of other copycats popping up. It\u2019s a simple enough setup: go to local parties and night clubs, pick a girl, make sure she\u2019s over-served, young and impressionable. With the right amount of pressure and coercion, one thing leads to another, and you\u2019ve got yourself a hardcore porn video...\n\n*Why Do They Call Them Roofies?*: ...when you\u2019re more likely to end up in the floor? That\u2019s the question you and your frat brothers always ask each other, not that it really matters. What matters is that they work, and well, as I\u2019m about to find out firsthand when you and your boys slip them into my drink and take me to your AirBNB for a night of fun...\n\n*The Local*: Of course not everyone appreciates the flood of drunk and horny teenagers into their otherwise-quiet beachside town. After all, you moved here for peace and a beautiful view, and they\u2019re loud, obnoxious, utterly disrespectful; but sometimes one of them wanders into the wrong part of town, *your* part of town, and that\u2019s when Spring Break begins for you...\n\n*The Locals*: Then again, there are some locals that *love* the influx of fun and excitement when Spring Break hits their sleepy little beaches. After all, who doesn\u2019t love college girls? And some of those same college girls happen to have a weakness for charming older men that can offer experience that boys their age just can\u2019t...usually with a healthy dose of *kink* to go along with it...\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI\u2019ve got a ton of kinks and only a few limits: *no scat, blood, gore, or writing for my character*. Everything else is fair game, or at least negotiable!\n\nI love: non-con, dub-con, very rough sex, first time anal, bondage (the heavier the better), predicament bondage, abuse, humiliation, degradation, pressure and coercion, forced/denied orgasms, lots of cum, old men, humiliating pairings, gangbangs, being filmed/photographed, and much, much more!\n\n*Reddit DMs only.* Please don\u2019t just start a scene! Let\u2019s discuss, figure out what we both like and want from this, and then let\u2019s play! :)",

It's Princess Jasmine!\"\n\nMy eyes perked up from my plastic cup holding the orange juice I was nursing, and my other hand dropped the party hat that I had been fiddling with in my boredom. I knew that my wife had gotten someone for entertaining the kids our daughter's birthday, but I knew nothing more than that and let her take the lead in planning the entire kiddie birthday party.\n\nI looked up at my wife\u2019s announcement and  found myself staring at a vision of utter beauty. The early morning sun danced in through window curtains and painted streaks of light across her smooth olive-colored skin. True to her character, she wore  an emerald blue belly shirt and baggy translucent pants, while her hair was done in a long braid behind her back. \n\nAs she walked though the kitchen, I glanced sideways and could see the eyes of the other dads tracing the curves of her body, following her bouncing breasts and swaying as she interacted with the children, picking up the smaller ones while bending down to give hugs to the older children as they took selfies with her. \n\n*****\n\nJust a general idea about a dad sneakily fucking the Disney princess that his wife hired for their daughter's birthday. It doesn't have to be Jasmine and we can go with other princesses (or even non-Disney characters, superheroes, etc.) For the long term, it can progress to an affair or something along those lines, depending on how we go.\n\nLong-term detailed partners only via reddit inbox, no chat. 1-2 paragraphs per response.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for roleplay centered around discipline, spanking, and punishment. This isn't a story about kinky foreplay, no in the scenes I want to play the punishments aren't enjoyable they're a real consequence and deterrent. Similarly I'm not looking for this to be inherently sexual, for me the focus might be more psychological and emotional.\n\nThere are some different punishments and scenarios I can think of(see below) but pretty much all of them involve me(or my character) getting spanked until my bum's red, and I'm tearing up and promising to behave and be good. Maybe it's just that, maybe there are other or additional punishments too. Such as being put in the corner to think about my actions, writing lines, getting my mouth washed with soap, being given extra chores, etc.\n\n**1. an old fashioned college**\n\nNestled out in the country beside a quiet town there's a college, not ivy league strictly speaking but prestigious despite not being well known. The beautiful architecture isn't the only thing there that's old fashioned so to is the approach to discipline. The cane, the paddle, retired implements of a by gone era in most places still find plenty of use here. This setting could also include uniforms if you wanted(though it doesn't have to).\n\n**2. A Traditional Household**\n\nPerhaps based of the 50's or 60's in this setting it's not unheard of for a husband to lovingly but firmly put his wife over his knee. While traditional gender roles aren't something I go in for at all irl I'm not opposed to playing around with them for something like this. (I'll admit this is the one I'm least keen on currently but still open to with the right partner)\n\n**3. A Criminals Rehabilitation**\n\nNew research indicates that many people, especially young women become irresponsible because they lacked the appropriate discipline growing up. As a result a new judicial program is created for more minor offenses that aims to correct this by providing them with said discipline. Maybe this gets carried out in smaller group homes or maybe integrated in to actual prisons(My previous prompt was more prison focused this could tie elements of both).\n\n**4. The Princess's Tutor**\n\nProbably set in a pseudo medieval fantasy world. (The other option could be a kind of princess diaries situation involving a character becoming royalty of an obscure modern nation and needing to be brought up to speed on the customs.) This would involve a royal or noble lady being educated be that in politics, the arts. high society what have you. It would also play with power exchange as the person doing the tutoring would likely be of lower conventional standing in this world.\n\n**5. Moving Back Home**\n\nIt didn't matter that I was an adult \"our roof our rules\" was the mantra I found myself in. Maybe I flaked out on a job maybe the economy is just harsh one way or another I find myself moving back in with family. Suddenly chores, spankings, curfews, getting grounded and things I never thought I would be dealing with at my age come into play. This could also involve step family, or an aunt uncle, older sibling, or an older friend /mentor figure\n\n**6. Your Idea**\n\nI'm open to suggests if similar themes and dynamics are in play. also my other prompt about being locked up while different is still open\n\nAbout me\n\n30 year old female switch(while I'm mostly looking to be on the receiving end I might consider things the other way round for the right partner) with a little real life experience. I'm open to playing characters of different ages then my own provided they are at least in their 20s. Also I'll put this as a disclaimer while the scenes I think up may involve non or dub con elements with regards to punishing some one against their will obviously I don't condone that kind of thing in real life.\n\n**Things I want.**\n\nDetails, characters, build up/progression, context. Thoughts are also a plus I like hearing about how characters feel and what they think about what's happening. A certain degree of fairness. Punishments can be strict or harsh but I want my character to have done something to earn them it's a lot more meaningful then them being just done arbitrarily. To be scolded and lectured about what I've done wrong and how I can improve.\n\n**Things I don't want.**\n\nDegradation, words like slut or whore are instant deal breakers. Being spoken down to a little is fine in some contexts but there should still be elements of respect. Some other limits: underage, toilet stuff, rape, death etc. Really if it's something I haven't included or alluded to here you should ask about it first.\n\n**message only no chat**",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nToday I am looking for someone who'd love to create a role-play with me. A few days ago, I had someone message me about an idea that sounded like a lot of fun, yet like always, that person randomly ghosted me in the middle of the role-play. So today, I am going to be looking for someone that would love to start fresh when it comes to the same idea.\n\nFor this role-play, I am looking to play a man who owns a kennel. This kennel isn't the typical one someone would bring their dog to while they are gone or need someone to watch their pet. This kennel has a secret, unknown, and special feature. A feature that allows the dogs to be trained to fuck. And to those who don't know about this secret see the kennel as a normal one. \n\nIn the back rooms of the kennel, away from customer's eyes. My character trains dogs who are brought in by customers (who know the true vision of the kennel, of course) to breed with women.\n\nWhenever a new dog comes into the kennel, my character welcomes it and goes through a small screening test to see the attitude of the dog. When the customer leaves, the dog goes into the back for training.\n\nIdeally, I am looking for someone who would like to play as a woman who works at the kennel with me. And as a worker your job consists of one thing. Being the one i train the dogs to fuck.\n\nYou personally have sex with the dogs and help teach them to mount you the right way, train them to eat a pussy/ass with their long, rough tongue. You train them so well that the scent of a wet pussy can get a doggy hard almost instantly.\n\nSo, would you like to play? I'd love to hear from someone!\n\nSend me a message so we can discuss ideas!",

I'm particularly interested in fantasy or sci-fi settings with a nice mix of story &amp; sex scattered throughout the world we explore this world of course can be entirely homebrew or just a variation of Skyrim, Warcraft, Mass Effect or some other iconic world you know and love. Aside from that I'd like to play as female or femboy characters only whether its following my single \"main character\" or I could play as a group/party of heroines for you to meddle with the choice there is yours entirely. I will say if I'm going to play a single character reddit PM's or Discord suffice for our platform while playing multiple characters naturally discord is far easier to manage information with so I'd prefer your willing to move there for a whole cast, I've also taken some time to list any extra info below so please enjoy and send me a message anytime you'd like. \n\nSome Info\n-------------------\n\n* I'm a North American User (EST) I'm totally fine with timezone differences or delays in messages though but I'm aware many people aren't\n\n* I have NO limits\n\n* I can play one multiple female/femboy characters \n\n* Top 10 Kinks Everything Involving: Anal, Clothing, Monsters, Impreg, Feet, Cumplay, Bad Ends, BDSM, Sloppiness &amp; Group Scenes \n\n* I prefer Fantasy or Scifi themed roleplays \n\nAside from all of that my characters are more negotiable I can happily play as celebrities or my own OC characters all I'd ask from you is to play the handfuls of monsters &amp; men that we desire to include. I hope to hear back from a few eager penpals and hopefully we can begin discussing &amp; working out details with one another.",

I'm Sarah, 24/F, Asian-Australian (although ethnically half-Chinese and half-Japanese, if that matters).\n\nThis is pretty embarassing to write, but I've never really been the smartest girl. Like, not book-smart or any kind of smart, really. It first became noticeable when I was a high-school, like jokes would go over my head or I wouldn't get that somebody was laughing over something kinda dumb that I came out with. As I've got older it's only become worse, and I'll often get teased about it or just get the impression that people don't think there's a whole lot going on in my head. Maybe it's my Daddy issues or something, but I've also always been really into mean, dominant men. Bullies, assholes, jerks, you name it. Anyone that talks down to me really strikes at something in me, idkkk. They're the type of dudes I'm always falling for, even though I know I shouldn't be.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling now, so let me get to the point. I'd love to do an RP based around this idea. Maybe we meet at a houseparty, or at a cafe, or just about anywhere, really. We get talking, and somehow or another things evolve. Maybe I have a boyfriend that hates you, or maybe I don't. Regardless, I'm in over my head far sooner than I expect, unsure of how I ended up getting dicked-the-fuck-down by your bitchbreaker of a cock. Lmao. You get the idea. If you think any of this is dumb, please feel free to suggest your own ideas! I'm very open.\n\nIn terms of looks, I look like a stereotypical asian gal in a lot of ways. 5'2\" (but I tend to bump that up a bit with heels), long black hair (duh), a lil flat nose and pouty lips that are normally wrapped around a boba straw. I work out a lot, to the point where I'm pretty much \"slim-thicc\" now, which is a nice way of saying my waist is skinny and my ass is fat. Happy to send a reference picture!\n\nKinks include gaslighting/manipulation, sucking dick (lol), getting fucked with, raceplay, bimbofication, etc. My biggest kink is probably just appealing to your kinks, though!\n\nLimits are boring, but I'm not into the usual stuff like bathroom-related things, snuff, animals, ageplay, etc.\n\nOh! And please don't feel like you have to treat me too nice outside of the RP either, lol. Discord is heavily preferred, too!",

            "selftext": "Looking for a female to roleplay this morning. We\u2019ve been best friends since childhood but have never dated before. Your bf is out of town visiting family so you decide to go out tonight with me a group of mutual friends. You had a bit too much to drink so I offered to let you crash at my place for the night. You\u2019ve stayed before so it\u2019s no big deal. \n\nBack at my place, we start talking about relationships and our sex lives. I haven\u2019t dated since my last break a few months back and you reveal that your relationship is a bit of a rocky point lately. During conversation, you bring up the time we almost hooked up years ago but we both stopped ourselves as we didn\u2019t want to ruin our friendship. \n\nEver since, we\u2019ve both been curious but have never acted on it, even years later. I\u2019m not one to cross the line with a woman in a relationship but due to the alcohol, the sexual tension, and some persuasion, things begin to escalate. This leads to clothes coming off and ending the night with great sex. \n\nWilling to discuss the scene or change their relationship (roommates, classmate, siblings friend, etc.) if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to add. I just want it to be realistic and like to write in the first person. After discussing, would like to dive right in to it.\n\nOpen to most kinks and willing to discuss those as well. Some of mine include dirty talk, moaning, praising, oral, doggy, seduction. My limits are beast, gore, vomit, scat and things like that. In your message, tell me your age and where you\u2019re from. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, send me a chat or a PM. Looking forward to hearing from you!",

I am hoping to create a romantic roleplay for both me and a dominant partner who hopefully guides my character through lovemaking gently. \n\n\nThe sun shining high in the sky, its light darting across the sandy beaches of Skopelos. I,a fresh college graduate had just arrived by ferry to explore the island. The island and its people were very welcoming and hardworking, I myself a foreigner had trouble making my way around. While walking, I take note of the buildings and start sketching outlines and features, slowly adding depth before coming up with rough sketches of the architecture. Bumping into an individual, I drop my notebook and pencils. Kneeling down I slowly look up and meet eyes with You. \n\nWho are you? Are you a local fisherman? Maybe an artist who wishes to grant a fellow creative mind a space to work? Or perhaps your a local barkeep who sees I\u2019m a bit down on my luck. Maybe I don\u2019t need a place, and I\u2019m just needing someone to be friends with. Whatever the case, I still need someone like you.\n\nThis is what I\u2019m hoping to start the roleplay out as. Maybe we can switch it up with you coming to the island. Maybe we\u2019re both a bit acquainted instead of complete strangers. I don\u2019t mind either ways, as long as you take my character easy.\n\nKinks that are hopefully included: Romance ,Foreplay, Facial Hair, Public,Body Hair, Age difference, Size Difference, Flirting, Raceplay.\n\nRead my profile to check for my Discord tag or message me in PMs and Chats to ask.",

            "selftext": "The entire point of the app was that you don't meet the same person twice. You register as Dom or Sub: the Sub allows phone tracking and uploads a few photos, and the dom picks someone at their leisure that happens to be within a one mile radius. Click a button, wait for the sub to accept based on your pictures, you each get a code word for verification, and then you find her, confirm the code word, and shes yours for however long you want her in whatever place you decide. The encounter ends either when she says the code word again, or you decide youre done with her. After that she never shows up on your app again.\n\nUntil, that is, you meet me. Sure, I look wide eyed and innocent, despite my busty figure, but my absolute desperation to please you, no matter what, has you instsntly hooked. It also helps that I suck a mean cock.\n\n---\n\nQuick idea i had. How do you find me again? Maybe you stalk me? Maybe you start deleting and remaking your profile to reset the algorithm? Maybe its an app glitch, or maybe you just get really, really lucky and happen to keep bumping into me. Your character's path is all up to you!\n\nDefinitely willing to play this with both kinky sex and eventual romance. Bonus points for anyone who wants to include breeding. \n\nI prefer first person, present tense, and read only DMs, chats I just ignore.\n\nKinks: Rough sex, bdsm, impregnation, breeding, spanking, slapping, choking, face fucking, ddlg, praise/degradation, name calling, punishment/rewards, being called \"good girl\", really anything where I can be an absolute sub\n\nLimits: gore, vore, bathroom stuff, feet",

I want to get away as every day is a shouting contest and for once I want them to worry about me for a bit and so I've started planning. There's a wealthy neighborhood nearby where you barely hear about any crime and so I've thought about \"borrowing\" a house for a few days while someone is out on a business trip or on a vacation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a few weeks and for the last three days, a car that's always there in the evening has been gone for the last few days. Why would anyone not be at home for a few days if not out on a business trip or on vacation? It seemed to be a single person living there from the initials on the mailbox and from what I could scout from my walks through the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonight, picking up a bag with some clothes and some money, I decide to head out. Once inside the backyard, I walk over to pick the lock on the door, putting to use some skills I've gotten from watching online videos and breaking out of my room at night when they would lock the door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's close to midnight at this point and the house is quiet. I go around looking through the cupboards and fridge for food, and as suspected there isn't a lot there, thinking that they must have made sure to not leave anything behind to spoil. What I don't realize is that you're still at home and hiding on the staircase, looking for an opportune time apprehend whom ever has broken into your home. As I walk past the stairs, a shadow comes rushing up from behind and restraining me. What happens now?\n\n\\-----\n\nHey DPP!\n\nI'm leaving this open for you to come up with what happens next. Does he take pity on me and let me stay, wanting to give me a safe place to be for a little while? Does he try to take advantage of me but in the end I manage to escape? Or does it go the darker route and this is the completely wrong house to break into? That I'm soon gonna be finding me with a collar and leash, made to be his sex slave pet?\n\nI'm imaging my character in this roleplay would be between 20 and 24. A little too old to be living at home, I know, but let's leave that part up to the imagination as to why!\n\nKinklist:  [https://i.imgur.com/dK9m8oH.png](https://i.imgur.com/dK9m8oH.png)",

If you\u2019re not sure what that is give it the ol\u2019 google- It\u2019s 2021! \n\nI\u2019m thinking my character maybe was left on the pacifier or got suckled for too long- Maybe she was allowed to suck her thumb to late into life, and now had a problem where she depends on her oral fixation to relax and handle stress.\n\nYou know. Sucking lollipops, her thumb, getting on her knees. Anything that fills her mouth and keeps her tongue and lips occupied helps her stress. \n\nIt\u2019s totally not a sexual thing, okay? A cock in her mouth just happens to fulfill her fixation more than anything. \n\nWhat would their relationship be? Are they just friends and whenever She\u2019s nervous she might have a guy over and suckle on his cock for a while? Maybe you play her boyfriend that understands that sometimes she has to suck cock from other guys just because she physically can\u2019t help it? Are you some asshole that purposely stresses her out for head? Maybe she\u2019s gay but can\u2019t help but sucking cock for her fixation.\n\nInterested on what ya\u2019ll think! I\u2019m looking to spend a little bit of time setting this up and then playing it out over a few days. Mostly interested in third person play! \n\nSend me a message. Let\u2019s figure this out!",

If you give me no more than a sentence in your introduction, I'm going to ignore you.)\n\nYour sisters become obsesed with your cock! Could you blame her? You have the cock of a god! A massive, *girthy* multi foot long cock (and still growing) with balls that made each passing movement and churn of cum audible to all around. .\n\nIf they didn't see the bulge that made it look like you had a small whale in your pants then the sound of cum being produced at 2000% definitely would.\n\nIt wasn't uncommon, me impaled by your cock I mean. Spending hours each day mounted on that perfect fuck stick. Riding, sucking or fucking like my life depended on it until that tub sized load of extremely fertile baby batter filled my womb/stomach to the absolute brim! \n\nIn public, or private it didn't matter. I didn't care who knew your slutty bimbo of a sister was obsessed with your cock. I wanted to the world to know who was filling my womb, and I had no shame in admitting it was my own brother. \n\nCould you blame me? \n\nKinks: futa, lactation, impreg, hyper preg, asset growth, hyper assets, cumflation (extreme preferred), being a baby factory, multi tits, multi cock, nonstop sex, latex, petplay, public, shota, etc\n\nLimits: toilet play, feet stuff, sweat and musk. \n\nI am 18+ and all characters and all participants must be as well",

            "selftext": " \n\nThere was spring in the air and a spring in my step. Something about this season just resonated with me: the sense of boundless opportunity and optimism, a world around me that felt ripe for the taking. Of course, it wasn\u2019t just about the liberated flowers, but the liberation spring brought to the wardrobes around town. In a sleepy college town like this, sundresses seemed to be everywhere. And what man wouldn\u2019t be absolutely delighted with that? With floral patterns and that breezy playfulness that always seemed to tease the eye, it became a challenge to keep your eyes to yourself.\n\nWalking around campus, heading into my lecture hall, I could feel that tingling sense of spring-time exuberance in the air. No, that felt like an inaccurate, incomplete way of describing it: there was *lust* in the air. Gone were the bulky winter jackets, in were the sundresses and ponytails. All these college girls that had been cooped up inside for so long, suddenly all too eager to show themselves outside with the perfect kind of outfit to draw more than just a peek from men like me. What I wasn\u2019t expecting though was the looks I was getting, longing and lingering gazes, and the influx of cheeky flirting and stolen winks heading my way.\n\nMy colleagues jokingly referred to this as *\u201cbirds and the bees\u201d* \\-season, warning me about warning what was in the air. The college was known as a MRS degree school in the best of times, but this reached a heightened peak each spring. Stories abound of professors finding female students purring for more than just scholastic attention on their desks, a temptation some just couldn\u2019t resist. It wasn\u2019t surprising to hear some of these heated dalliances ending up with a student knocked up and a professor sweating like Ryan Seacrest watching Brokeback Mountain.\n\n\\+++\n\nHopefully this prompt excites you, I felt that a spring-time focused roleplay would be perfect for homing in on two kinks: sundresses and skirts, and breeding. A season that drives young women to be more than eager to hike up their cute dresses and beg you to come on over. A season that sparks a myopia in all men: surely nothing bad happens if I just give in to the temptation and fucking her brains out? Let me know what kind of thoughts this prompt sparked for you, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!\n\nPlease, [PMs only](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Sentient_Cauliflower)**.** You can find my profile [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/kbpvfn/m4f_a_sentient_cauliflower_saying_hello_to_dpp/), complete with a [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/7T3eyF3.png) and a deeper explanation of what I'm looking for, if you'd want further reading. Also, my other prompts are open, if those interest you more!\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello there everyone! I'm your resident ***HarknessSmuts***, here recruiting for a group rp I've wanted to do. I recently dreamed about a society of second born royals who are superheroes, and I'd love to actually play it out. I'm looking for one other female and two males who are interested in playing these characters, and a Game Master who wants to explore and cultivate this world with us, playing the enemies they run into, teachers and more people around the world. ( Disclaimer: I'm a person with high standards. ) We have two guys and one girl ( me, ) and we\u2019re in need of a GM and another female.\n\n&gt;There's a gene specific to second born royals; Superpowers to be specific. It's been going back for hundreds of years. Starting with *King Henry VII* who was gifted, or more specifically **cursed** with the power of lust. The powered population has slowly shrunken over the years, with natural death seemingly being the cause.  \nNow, there are only four powered second borns left, who have all been placed into a special school to keep them safe, and help them control their powers. but, there's a threat brewing, one that corrupted some second borns and turned them against the very organization they once aspired to join. will these four rise to the occasion? or will evil prevail?\n\nIf you have read this all the way, send me a ***PM.*** ( not a chat ), with a writing sample involved ( 3rd person writers only please ), and tell me:\n\n* What superpower would you have if you were a superhero?\n* What you feel your strengths and weaknesses are as a writer.\n* Why you feel you'd be a good fit for this group.\n\nAlso, introduce yourselves!\n\nFor all my GMs out there, give me a sample for a previous GM experience you've done, tell me why you're excited to be apart of this, and tell me your ideas for where this plot could go!\n\nI'm so excited to write with all of you!",

            "selftext": "(F4M) A bad blind date atleast for me!\n\n\nHello ... in this I am playing an 18 year old girl who put herself on a dating site looking for someone to love.  She\u2019s super innocent and super sweet and caring and has a thing for a guy who has a hard time finding love.  Unfortunately she will learn there is a reason for that, but we agree to an all day date.  The play will be that date where at some point my virginity (or all of them) will be taken. \n\nHere are your choice for the guy...\n\n1: the lonesome loser.  You\u2019re not attractive, you rarely get dates, and you\u2019ve never been laid.  Because of that you\u2019re not only super horny but you kind of expect any girl that loves you to sleep with you because that\u2019s how it works in movies.  You\u2019re clumsy, awkward, and so sexual stuff is even harder and more painful for me.\n\n2.  The wannabe cool guy.  You\u2019re into loud music, driving fast and scary, and you expect all girls to be sluts for you.  You think your rough tooth guy crap is what women want so you\u2019re very alpha and very expecting.\n\n3. The horny jock.  You\u2019re not smart but you are muscular and because of some roids you\u2019re also very temperamental and rough and love a girl who will tell you she needs it and deserves it.  You love the intimidated shy week girl because it makes you feel even stronger.\n\n4. The jerk.  You\u2019re crude, almost disgustingly so, you like to be in charge, you like your girls submissive and humiliated.  What you lack in looks, which is a lot, you make up for in attitude and arrogance.  You enforce that attitude with your belief that men have a right to discipline.  \n\n5. The black man.  You\u2019re black and have a thing for virgin white girls and have a chip on your shoulder for how you\u2019re treated by white people and want nothing more than to abuse and be worshipped by your very own white girl to make up for all you feel went wrong with her body, her dignity, even her possessions.\n\n6. The gamer geek.  You\u2019re into your games and want a girl like you see in your games ... sees you as the hero and is the worshipful ever grateful girl who dotes on all your needs no matter how corny you are.  You are also into BDSM but an amateur in that you hit too hard or with things that shouldn\u2019t be used or candles whose wax is too hot or charging cables or nut crackers for nipples etc \n\nThe date should be casual ... no limos and mansions and fine dining.  You\u2019re job is to convince me to become the girl you want me to be, the one to love you how you want to be loved, playing on my desire to be the right girl for someone and how shy and easily intimidated and easily guilted I appear to be.  You want me to be scared and guilty to not love you how you want to be loved. \n\nLimits: random face slaps, pleasing me or turning me on, going from hole to hole.",

            "selftext": "(This prompt is kinda directed towards a male partner. But females of all kinds, hmu too and we can adapt it for you)\n\nCovid just never seems like it ends. Every single night I sit still single annoys me, frustrates me, makes me yearn to be around another. So much so I may be willing to sacrifice my standards a little bit to get a girlfriend again.\n\nYou see I'm a lesbian, but I haven't had any contact outside of our appartment in months. But I came up with an idea, what if I made you my new girlfriend.  When I told you about it you were super happy, as you always had a secret crush for me but just thought it would never happen.\n\nSure, maybe you have a cock, but I was more than happy to buy a cute pink cage to lock that away so it wasn't the focal point. Sure you were a really hairy dude, but honey, you are going to shave for me to have that perfect femme smooth skin.  And hell we are gonna make sure you are wearing some cute clothes and make up.\n\nBut also, don't you worry babe, I am very affectionate. I have always loved all my girfriends and always will and you are no exception.  I wouldn't enter into this relationship lightly.\n\nBut I just cant stand the idea of a guy gaining any power over me. So I'll call you a good girl as I tie you to the bed. I'll suck on your nipples before I bite down on them. I'll even pull out my strap and fuck you until you are blasting your cum everywhere. Afterall, no girlfriend of mine is going to be left unsatisfied.  And if all else fails I'll ride your face as I use my wand on your little caged clitty.\n\n-----------\n\nHey there, I'm Jessica, and I am in desperate need of a desperate girlfriend. I don't normally take a dominate role, but let's fucking do this. I have long brown hair and an overall petite frame.\n\nI will say I'm not looking for a sissy bitch here. I don't want someome who is gonna call me Mommy or desperately beg me to fuck them. No, I'm looking for a lover. One that I will love and take care of. You just have to put up woth me treating you like the perfect girlfriend for our relationship to stand a chance of working.  This isnt something humiliating, its beautiful and caring. \n\nWomen who are interested!  We can change this up however you would like and I will still dominate you if you so desire. Don't be shy about messaging me.\n\nMy kinks are: oral, fingering, light bondage, light breath play, face sitting, hair pulling, biting, scratching, nipple pain/pleasure.  Toys, vibrators, strap ons. Love, affection, aftercare. And so so so much more. \n\nLimits: Non-con, scat, bimbos, latex/leather, underage, humiliation, bad smells.\n\nI usually write about two paragraphs a response and I want the same energy from my partner.  If you write more than that I'll match you.  When you message me please tell me a bit about your character, limits, kinks, and how you can further enhance yourself to be my perfect girlfriend. Also let me know where you would like to start with all this.",

            "selftext": " \n\nEvery girl, or should I say slut, has a place they go to troll for dick. It was the same for me and my girlfriends. The difference, however, is where we go looking. The ladies I know go to bars, parties, or even the gym looking for a hot stud to give them a give time. I, on the other hand, had a different stomping ground: Conventions. You see, I don't like the kinds of guys my friends go for. No, tall, muscular frat boys don't do it for me. In fact, I prefer the exact opposite. I'll take a fat, shy nerd over a jock any day. They're so much more fun and so much kinkier. And yes, I know not every guy that goes to conventions is like that, but these are the guys I happen to be looking for.\n\nWhile my friends go out drinking and partying, I look for the nearest con so I hunt down that good dick. I dress in the same cosplay outfit every time. I dress up as Sailor Moon. It's nothing fancy or extravagant, but it gets the job done. I put my blonde hair up in some pigtails and throw on that all too familiar white and blue outfit. My top is way too tight and small, showing off ample cleavage while not even covering my belly. My skirt is so short it barely covers my ass. That's just the way I like it. It's also the way my nerdy suitors like it as well.\n\nThat brings us to now. I had found a local anime con that was going on today and couldn't pass up the opportunity to look for some of that prime meat. I practically skip through the convention hall, smiling and winking at all the fine gentlemen around me as I go. Some are in costume while others aren't. It doesn't really matter to me. I'm just waiting for the lucky guy, or guys, who decides to swallow that social anxiety and approach me. And I sure do hope someone does soon. I'm aching for some nerd cock right now.\n\nHi there! As you may be able to tell, I want to be the gorgeous slut that picks up those \"undesirables\" that most college sluts stay away from and rocks their world. And again, yes, I know not everyone who goes to cons is like that, but I'm looking for those ones that are!\n\nHere's my [kinklist](https://imgur.com/kLPkmN1). My biggest limits are scat, gore, and snuff. If there's something you'd like to include, just ask! To let me know you've read this, title your message your favorite anime or I won't respond.

I have to admit, I'm a little morbidly curious. \n\nWhen was it that you decided that you were a girl? \n\nI mean, I'm very sure it couldn't have been just meeting me- I'm not nearly that egotistical to think that, after all. \n\nI know- how about you tell me when I hit the mark? Ok? Good. \n\nWas it when I bought you that drink? No, I doubt it. You still thought you had some shred of masculinity left. \n\nHow about when we met at that bookstore? Where you dressed up like the nerdy little librarian? Hmm... Maybe. \n\nWas it when I pinned you to that rough brick wall outside, your hands clutching your purchase to your chest? When my tongue entered you? When you bent your head back and let out that long\u00a0 low moan?\n\nWas it the week I refused to call you back? The double texts you sent? No, but I think the seed was sprouting, wasn't it? \n\nPerhaps it was when I showed up on your doorstep and planted my manhood in your boy pussy with your apartment door unlocked. When I let the entire building hear you yelp and scream until I shoved your face into the pillow and rammed you until I knew your security deposit was going to go entirely to fixing the damage your headboard made. \n\nMaybe it was then. \n\nI suspect that specifically because I recall you wearing panties to our next date. Not that they stayed on very long. But still. \n\nMaybe even then you fooled yourself into thinking that you were just playing a part. That somehow, somewhere, inside the depths of your psyche, there was still a nugget of masculine energy left. \n\nBut as I wake you your lips around my shaft, your make up ready for me to ruin, your ass warming my hand as you purr- I get the distinct feeling that I long fucked that section of your psyche out of you.\n\n/////////\n\nHello there! \n\nI am looking for cute femboy fuckpets that would like me to do awfully degrading things to their bodies. \n\nAs usually absolutely no underage, blood, beastiality, or bathroom stuff.\n\nPlease send a message, not a chat.",

With clear glass windows and green gardens. People with suits and cases walk in and out of the tower, accompany by body guards. This the ruling class of City-X. Handelling all the money in world, real state, diplomacy between sectors and so on. Around the tower are multiple large mansions for does who enjoy the old style of living. But at the edge of this paradise are large metal walls, with arm guard on every corner and robots. They protect the tower from the outside, the outside is extremely different from the tower. With middle size houses, shops, schools, and police department. A normal looking city with clean streets. But as you get further away from the tower, the surroundings get dirtier, the people become poorer, let's hopeful.

The water is cold, the roof and walls are molding, and the neighbors are annoying. But it's a house, at least you are not homeless. But there is something you can always look forward to. Games, specialy vr games. This Is how you drown your sorrows and enjoy life in this hell hole. Everyone has a vr helmet, it is one of the only mandated things in the city. With thousands of games, your life has its moments. As you come from work and finish cleaning your self from the smell of tabaco and alcohol. You go your bedroom and hop into bed, saying to your self you will eat tomorrow morning. \n\nYour hands hold the cold helmet and place it on your head. Soon you are transported to virtual lobby. A private place were you can browser through all your games. You ignored the popular mmorp's, already max out in does. You ignored the first shooters, already a pro at does. You ignored everything as you have drain every game out of its value. Got to get your money worth. Soon you arrive to the final game. A game you bought for extremely cheap, a game with only two reviews. From you and some other person. The game is call \" Second Change\". A game were you solve problems, a simple game but with unlimited content. You don't know who is making this levels, but there is always more the next day. But before you click the newest level a pop up appear. With the following words.\n\n[ Open Beta for the new mode, Second Change-Romance] \n\nYou look confuse, romance? What is this a dating sim? This game never had anything like this. The levels were always puzzle or action base. But you figure it was worth giving a try, after all nothing this game made has disappointed you. You click the open Bata and click the first level you saw. \n\n[Broken House]\n\nYou go blind as light surrounds your being.
