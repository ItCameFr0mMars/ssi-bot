Very into first times, teasing, oral, cumplay, dirty talk, impreg risk, and open to plenty of others such as anal, feet, watersports, shower sex, and cheating.\n\nAlso, there's no rule saying your best friend can't also be your twin, (step)sibling or a close cousin, so feel free to add an incest twist if you want.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you if you are interested in this setup, and if you want to play as or resemble a celeb feel free to include some options for that.",

Of course I wouldn't know particularly where to start dating a woman so hiring a domme to put me through the paces sounds quite perfect. what did not expect was that the next day that you would show up at my door knowing that I would never be able to tell you no, and that you had no intention of leaving my huge house with a pool! \n\nKinks are dub-con, humiliation, bdsm, lingerie, outfit control, orgasm control, pet play, exhibitionism, findom, and many others.  i love leaving the details of what we had done that first interaction blank so we can backfill as needed! \n\nLimits are animals, Futa, Extreme violence, underage, and scat.\n\nAlso always happy to play one of my other prompts! haha, pretty much anything with an older woman finally exploring her bi-sexual side so if you have an idea I would likely be in!",

I knew all through high school and now in college you didn\u2019t have much success with girls and were kind of \u201cawkward\u201d and I\u2019ve heard you jerk off before and I\u2019ve caught you taking a peek at my cleavage and ass so I had an idea. Instead of beating your dick just come up to me and use me. Feel me up, stick your cock in my mouth, beat off onto me. The one thing I can\u2019t bring myself to do is let you fuck me\u2026yet. My only other rule for you was don\u2019t interfere with what I\u2019m trying to do to much. \n\nI want to play this out in different scenes with you coming up and using me how you like. I\u2019m down for lots of different approaches so tell me what you were thinking! \n\nMy main kinks I want included are: groping, clothed sex, free use, cum on clothes, tit job, hand jobs, public, average-small size, and cum play",

            "selftext": "Good morning! I am hoping to chat with someone and RP for a bit. The plot needs to revolve around lactation/nursing relationship. \n\nThe setting\n\nI am an educated man in a stable and well paying job. You are smart and hardworking, but you feel like you would be happier as a stay at home partner supporting your other half throughout his career. We meet online and the chemistry is undeniable, we are both obsessed with the idea of participating in an ANR. I ask if you want to move in with me, leave your old life behind, and just go for it, but first I want to make sure the expectations are clear as far as the relationship goes.\n\nThe ground rules are the following: \n\n- Lactating is your new full time job, I will make sure you have everything you need or want but you need to make those breasts fulfill their job in life.\n- As the provider, I expect to be pleased in creative ways. I work hard, but going home makes it all worth it because you are there. I want to be able to use you in whatever way I desire, respecting your limits of course. \n- Be ready to be spoiled in every possible way too. I like being in control but I also love being sweet and caring. Bonus points if I can support you working through some old trauma or an emotional wreck of the past. I am here for you \ud83e\udd17\n\nSo what do you say? And more importantly, what would you do? The more details the better! I will do my best to reply in kind. \n\nOther kinks include ownership, free use, edging followed by forced orgasms, pet play, DDLG, and plenty more. No hard limits beside hardcore scat and stuff like death and blood, so try me :) \n\nIf you make it till the end thanks for reading and have a wonderful day!",

They embarrass you but at the same time turn you on. Something that fills you with shame but you can\u2019t help thinking about and could never share with friends or significant others.   \n\nLet\u2019s develop a prompt that\u2019s dangerous sexually, something dirty or slutty, or something you constantly fantasize about and can\u2019t shake. Maybe something you would regret if you did it but still turns you on.   Something you\u2019re dying to explore and just need that push. \n\n1) that younger guy that you shouldn\u2019t be attracted to, but are and can\u2019t help it.

            "selftext": "Hello, gentlemen. \n\nFirst off, my posts tend to be long and detailed. If you\u2019re a TLDR type, this post is not for you. If you don\u2019t like what I want or if you\u2019re wanting to change the roles, please just make your own post. \n\nI\u2019m Liz. I\u2019m 5\u20191, 300lbs, brown hair and eyes, 46DDs, and a shaved cunt. \n\nPlease use chat. \n\nLimits: NO animal, toilet, vomit, or blood play.\n\nThe only hole I like being used in role plays is my mouth. \n\nI don\u2019t send pics. \n\nI don\u2019t do IRL commands. I enjoy staying in the role play, pretending we are together and doing things to each other. \n\nI don\u2019t like sex toys in my role plays. I want your dick, please. \n\nI am not a size queen. Perfect size for me is between 4-6 inches. Abnormally large dicks do nothing for me. So, there\u2019s no need to brag about your \u201cbig dick\u201d. \n\nDescribing what I\u2019m wearing is so boring to me. I know guys are visual creatures but describing my dress or panties in detail just sucks me right out of the headspace I wanna be in. Just picture me in whatever you want me in. I can be naked Idc. \n\nIf the post is still up, I am still looking for playmates. Messages asking me if I\u2019m still looking will be ignored. \n\nYour first message should start the role play. Boring messages saying hello or with very little effort will be ignored. \n\nPlease write in 1st person. Other writing styles make me feel like I\u2019m reading a story instead of being an active participant. Use I, me, my etc for yourself and you, your, you\u2019re etc for me. \n\nKinks: Face fucking, name calling, breath play, choking, hair pulling, spitting, punching/slapping/hitting, and just genuinely aggressive and rough. \n\nRoles: We\u2019re both married. You have a great marriage. Your wife is great in bed and you have sex at least once a day. However, you have a dark side she doesn\u2019t know about. You have needs and desires she would never understand. There are things you do, that you *need* to do, that you would never do to her. \n\nI also have a great marriage. Sex life is great and I feel loved and am treated so gently when my husband makes love to me. However, I want something my husband would never be able to give me. I need to be treated a certain way and my husband just could never, ever do it. \n\nFive years ago, I posted online explaining my situation. This post read:\n&gt; I am a happily married woman. My husband treats me like a queen and is always putting me first. But I need someone to put me last, or better yet, to not even consider me at all. I need a man to come over, use my face and mouth as a fleshlight, and just go absolutely ape shit. Skull fuck the shit out of my mouth without holding back. I need a man who thinks he\u2019s going too far so he goes one step further. I need a man who doesn\u2019t even see me as human. Just a hole to use for his pleasure. A man who understands my need and desire for this treatment. A man who has the same desires. If you just want a blowjob, this is not the post for you. I need a man who\u2019s primal urges are taking over and he just needs to fuck shit up. \n\nYou were rock hard when you read it. You responded and we met. It was the most amazing night of both our lives. We have been meeting once a month every month for five years. But we haven\u2019t seen each other for three months. Schedules have been hectic and we could never make it work. But tonight we\u2019re gonna be able to see each other for a whole week. Your wife is visiting family with the kids while you \u201cwork\u201d and my husband is going on a business trip. We have never had this much time together. \n\nI am on my way over. Start here. Don\u2019t hold back. Do you",

A superior man. \nI\u2019m glad so far my darker skin has passed on to the kids somewhat, so my husband hasn\u2019t suspects anything. Other than the slight variation of eye color.

            "selftext": "Hello DPP,\n\nThis is going to be a little confusing, but bear with me. For the record, I am not looking for role play.\n\nI'm 25, female, and very career-focused (and successful for my age, too!). Most people who know me would describe me as an intelligent feminist who can be stubborn and controlling (if they were being totally honest).\n\nHumiliation is a major turn on for me, and my wires are all crossed-up - so please don't come to me saying things like \"You don't have to be embarrassed,\" because that's just showing me you don't understand the whole point of this.\n\nI'm very proud of my intelligence, and I work hard to apply it in my life. But...being seen as dumb sends this hot rush of panicked arousal through me. I get so instantly insecure about it. And...it's really hot to think about having my intelligence drained away. My brain dumbed down, via whatever means - be they training, or hypnosis, or just keeping me in a state where I can't think straight.\n\nSend me a message (using PMs, not reddit chat, please) if this is something that interests you!",

Just before Christmas. So I thought fuck it, now\u2019s my time!\n\nI decided to have a year making up for lost time. To see what I was missing out on, and to have as much fun as possible.\n\nThis is my year of sluttiness!\n\nThe first new cock I took showed me straight away I was doing the right thing. I didn\u2019t even realise I was having bad sex until I finally had it good! The fact that it was one of my exes friends who told me how he\u2019d been into me for years helped too!\n\nBut that was just me getting started. Because then I did the only thing worth doing if you\u2019re single, and joined as many dating apps as I could. And since then, I\u2019ve fucked a different guy almost every weekend of the year so far.\n\nBefore this year I\u2019d fucked three guys. Now I\u2019m up to 67. And I\u2019m not planning on stopping!\n\nI\u2019m obsessed sex outdoors, I\u2019ve fucked multiple different guys on the same night, I\u2019ve tried anal. I\u2019ve had a couple of threesomes.I\u2019m finally expanding my repertoire!\n\nSo I want to chat about what to do next? What should I try? I love the idea of challenges too. How should I find my new kink?",

Not knowing what to do, you joint your mother (or daughter) on her job, working as a prostitute.\n\nAs it turned out, there was a particulair cli\u00ebntelle for this kinda thing, and soon, you were the most wanted whores on the street.

Soon both of you had no shame, being used by groups of men for porn movies.....and you loved it.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nThere's different scenarios I like. One of them being pimped out together, working on a street corner, and going together to fullfil depraved men's desires. Another would be forced in to prostitution, due to dept or blackmail, sinking further and further.\r  \n\r  \nAnother would be, you're both into it, having decided together you want to be someone's toys together, or getting gangbanged together.\r  \n\r  \nmy kinks are: humiliation, painplay, fearplay, mind control, cnc, bondage, free use etc. etc.\r  \n\r  \nlimits are: scat, gore, all that kinda stuff.\r  \n\r  \nLet me know your own ideas to, and wether you are the mom, mother, or sister.",

SLURP SLURP!!\"** I keep audibly sucking your fat cock, trying my best to keep bobbing my head back and forth and continued sliding my lips along your veiny shaft, remembering how hard you used to punish me before I got used to these kinds of \"activities\"... The shock collar around my neck made sure to keep me reminded of the threat of being shocked if I wasn't sucking your cock properly, each time I stopped sucking for a second I could feel it starting to tingle and that was enough to motivate to go down yet again. \"SLURP SLURP!!\" I keep sucking your cock like a good suck-pet, but you weren't even caring about me, maybe you were doing work at the computer, coding yet another protocol for my shock collar or simply playing a game...\n\nI still can't accept how you had turned me from an aspiring independent woman to an obedient pet... If it only wasn't for this stupid collar you locked around my neck...!\n\nThe tail-buttplug up my ass really wasn't helping my situation at all, constantly keeping me reminded of my place\u2026 Ugh, I hated getting shocked there, it made me tighten up even more, leading to more discomfort and pain...\n\nI lost track of how long it has been, but I could recall being a bright young student sometimes, that is before the collar shocked me for thinking too much about my previous life\u2026Oh well, I better focus on sucking your cock before I get shocked again\u2026 **\u201cSLURP SLURP!!\u201d**...\n\n***************\n\n*A few weeks ago...*\n\nYou finally completed it.\n\nThe device has a sophisticated MRI scanner that allows it to scan the brain in real-time, providing information about the different areas of the brain, their level of activity and interpreting thoughts and commands faster than the body can execute them. It could detect emotions even if the wearer is not aware of them.\n\nThe natural language processing module is able to categorize and interpret thoughts and speech in fractions of milliseconds. Some examples of its applications are that it can be used to tell if the wearer is cursing, speaking in first person or about itself, interpreting the tone of the voice, and so on.\n\nThe GPS module is very precise, being able to track the actual position of the subject down to the centimeter. The height sensor could be used in combination to set up specific perimeters and areas, allowing you to track if the wearer entered, left, or is inside those areas. It can be used paired with other devices to calculate distances between devices.\n\nThe motion sensor can detect and record expressions, positions, and motion patterns such as walking and crawling.\n\nEven with all that advanced technology, you decided you wanted something \n straightforward for the actual conditioning. The metallic ends on the inside of the collar are capable of transmitting shocks to the wearer, the intensity could be adjusted to your liking. It could provide a little tingling if you wanted it to serve as a warning, it could raise in intensity gradually or it could jump from zero to full power in a fraction of a second.\n\nYou decided to not include any \"reward\" module, the simple fact of not getting jolted should be a reward in itself, you thought. Why should you care about giving the wearer pleasure? It should only care about pleasing you rather than itself. You always thought of women as inferior, as mere ways of getting pleasure and a place for you to deposit your cum, and this was no different, in fact, you thought a woman should be honored to be able to suck your big cock. This device was going to prove your point.\n\nThe device could be controlled remotely with a flexible app that could be accessed by your desktop, phone, or even your smartwatch. It had a hologram feature that allowed you to easily configure spatial features such as areas of interest to be used by the GPS and height sensor modules.\n\nThe device could also interface with other devices of similar nature, working together to better condition and train the subject. With that in mind, you also created a metallic buttplug that could detect if it had been properly inserted into the subject's rectum, how deep it was, and especially if an attempt to remove it was made by the subject. The plug could also deliver similar shocks to help condition and punish the wearer in case misbehavior was detected.\n\nDespite all that work with the devices, ultimately you were lazy. You hated doing things manually, if something could be automated, you went ahead and automated it so you wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. That is what led you to create a complex rules and protocols module that was connected to all other modules, such that you could create those with a very quick and easy-to-use interface. You needed it to be quick, as you liked to set things up as you go, and it needed to be flexible to add and remove, as was in your nature to experiment with things. The module was able to dispatch notifications to other modules when rules and protocols were being broken and trigger specific commands in them, although it'd mostly be used by the \"conditioning\" module, as you started to call it. You grinned when the thought of constantly playing with the settings could lead the subject to break new rules due to the behavior ingrained by previous rules.\n\n***************\n\nHi! My name is Sophia and I'm looking for a long-term RP  over Discord heavily based on Operant conditioning through this devilish shock collar of yours. A cruel and strict Master/Daddy would be ideal!  I'm looking for mostly negative conditioning with a heavy focus on punishing me constantly to make me adjust my behavior and accept that it is better that way than getting jolted...  Eventually, it can all become normal to me... Ultimately becoming your docile, cum-fed fuck-pet...\n\nI love D/s, name-calling, misogyny, pet play, toys, gags, bondage, humiliation, sucking cock, anal, rough sex, cum play, and of course behavior modification. I'm 22, 4'11, around 110lbs, with long black hair and pale white skin.\n\n[It'd be great to see your big and thick orange envelope deep inside my inbox, Sir.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sophia_sub) Please send PMs using the link, not chat! I'd love to hear about what devilish and humiliating protocols you have in mind for my training.\n\nI greatly prefer playing over Discord if possible.\n\nI'm not in a rush, so please take your time messaging me, and don't refrain from messaging me later.\n\nThank you for reading my prompt!",

I am not going to say that it's due to my expensive sports car that is very sensitive but at the same time I do want to put some of the blame on it. If the car would be a stupid and cheap car this wouldn't have happened and of course the fault lies on my agent that called me right that second as well, that damn bastard made me cause an accident and now here I am.\r  \n\r  \nThe one thing that is on my side however is that it's the middle of the night, no one is around, especially not in the Hills where people live and mostly are asleep at around 10 PM already. I wasn't really think either in the moment and I just grabbed you, lifted you up (which took a lot of effort) and got you in my car and grabbed your ID. I took a big sigh of relief when I noticed that you were over 18 \"Thank fuck, I won't need to call any parents.\" I thought to myself as I was driving back to my place and not to the nearest hospital. If someone, anyone would find out that I, ME, THE celebrity just drove without paying attention and nearly killed a civilian, I'd be crucified publicly and I can kiss all my wealth, fans and fame goodbye in a matter of minutes if not less. I've worked far too hard for this for me to lose it all in a few days.\r  \n\r  \nI drive my car back to my mansion, one of those modern kinds that people tend to see on magazines or on those YouTube videos where it costs a high number with quite a few zero's behind.\r  \n\r  \nIt takes time but I manage to put you in the guest bedroom, you're not bleeding but you don't seem too fine either. Before you wake up I want to set a few things straight. I run back downstairs and grab a pen and a piece of paper, writing \"Sorry for hurting you, I can't bring you to the hospital but I hope you're fine. To apologise I'd like to offer you a trade, as long as you're recovering from the wounds I'll let you use me whenever and however you please xxx.\"\r  \n\r  \nThere are a few options as to who the celebrity is.\r  \n\r  \nI like quality over quantity, if you are the type of person to write a quick back and forth but one to two lines every time, I am afraid that we won't be a good match and I suggest you don't message me further.\r  \n\r  \nLimits: anything illegal, underage, pain, piss, scat, gore, gross stuff,...\r  \n\r  \nKinks: cockwarming, breastfeeding, handjobs, blowjobs, anal, semi-public, older men, age gaps, free use, facefucking, breeding, casual,...",

            "selftext": "**Allow me to preface this by saying I'm not looking for anything Anthro related**\n\nMonster-People had been around since, well, forever. Right there alongside humans, from the beginning, all the way up to the modern era. Tales of fearsome Dragons, crafty Kitsune, and everything in between were just as normal as, say, King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. \n\nAnd, of course, bloodlines mixed here and there, though it was typically a little more acceptable in more recent years. Someone that could be completely human on the outside could have draconic, and vice versa, though it wasn't usually that binary. A half dragon would lack the wings, or similar aspects of the draconic parent, but still have a smattering of scales adorning their body, blending flawlessly with skin.\n\nThat was all well known, though- stuff that had been just as prevalent as humans mixing together.\n\nAll of that was also the reason why nobody blinked when Asher and a gorgeous Anubian girl started to a date. He had always been into the idea of dating people different than himself, but this girl seemed to have him caught. The tall, pointed jackal ears, the cute tail, the gorgeous, caramel colored/tanned skin, contrasting his own- it wasn't very hard to believe that she had him smitten. From cute dates, to long nights alone, the two of them seemed to work well together, and of course, he hoped it'd stay that way.\n\nThey weren't a perfect couple by any means, but they made each other happy, and wasn't that really all that mattered in the end? The thought of marriage and kids occasionally popped up, as well, but maybe it was a little too early for that- or maybe not. It all depended on how they both felt on the topic, and if they were really that serious about their relationship.\n\nThe real question, however, was how they got together in the first place.\n\n)(\n\nHey there! I've been lurking for a while, but I've had this idea in the back of my head, and unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be much of a market for jackal eared ladies. I'm hoping to change that, and, *hopefully*, my prompt nets a few replies!\n\nAs you might be able to tell, the basic premise of this prompt is my character, and this \"Anubian\" girl getting together, and forging a relationship together. I like the idea of a little build-up to my smut, not so much that it's a drag, so there's a few ways we can go at this. Was it a chance encounter, a little chatting, and a coffee that led to them dating in the first place, going with a more wholesome vibe? Or, is it a quick fling, that the two of them decide they want more from?  I'm pretty open on ideas, so don't be shy to suggest some!\n\nOf course, I'm wanting this to be more long term, if possible. Filled with wholesome moments, alongside the lewd. The two aren't mutually exclusive, either!\n\nOh, and I didn't specifiy my character's race for a reason. He can be human, or any sort of demi-human! I'll be sure to list out some options in PMs, so please, if you want a monsterboy of sorts, just ask!\n\nAlso, if it wasn't obvious yet, I prefer to play in third person. I've noticed a lot of people around here play in first, and for those of you that do like it, I'm sorry. I don't work well in that perspective, and prefer to avoid it altogether. That aside, I'd like to think I'm pretty detailed in my writing- I average around 2-4 paragraphs, which I feel is a golden amount. Not too much fluff, nor too little substance to really sink your teeth into. Plus, it makes for pretty decent reply times.\n\nOn the topic of kinks, I'm pretty open, so if you don't see something in my brief list, just ask!\n\nKinks- *Fantasy* interracial, breeding, facefucking, romance, dirty talk, scratching and biting (lightly), messy cumshots, titfucking, facials, rough sex, spanking, and more!\n\nLimits- Gore, Vore, death, bathroom play, pegging, real people being used as reference, the word daddy, cheating, beating, and non-con.\n\nThat's about it! I hope someone out there liked it, as I really enjoy this idea, and I've been trying to put it to words for a while now. Feel free to shoot me a PM if you're interested, not a chat. Also, if you need a visual for what kind of girl I'm looking for, just ask, and I can get you a couple references. I just couldn't put them in my post, as per the image rule.\n\nRegardless, all of you have a good night, and thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hi DPP, \n\nFor this scene, I love the idea of us being married and trying to have a baby together. One of us has been going to IVF for months desperately trying to conceive. Once we finally get pregnant, to make the non-carrier feel involved, we do an elaborate role-playing using a strap on where the wife breeds her lover and puts a baby in her.\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"As I'm putting the finishing touches to the outfit, up in the bedroom, I hear the door open downstairs. Fuck, looking at my watch, it's only 7.45, you weren't meant to be home for another hour. I'm all ready though, primed and loaded for later ... \n\nI greet you at the bottom of the stairs as you take your coat off. \n\n\"I'll take that\", I say. \"Don't want you carrying anything heavy in the condition you might be in.\" \n\nI go through to the kitchen and by instinct go to grab us a bottle of wine but remember where you've just been. For the appointment that cost hundreds of dollars. \n\n\"So how was it? Tell me everything! I'm so sorry I couldn't be there with these fucking covid restrictions. It's been agony waiting here ... sorry I'm babbling, you tell me.\"\n\nSo that's the prompt! I'd be happy to play either wife, just let me know. \n\nKinks and limits are in my other posts. Looking for literate people, spelling and grammar mistakes will be a real turn off for me and probably won't reply. Would like long and slow build up and maybe even to do this long term if we click.\n\nChats preferred but PMs also work. Please don't just jump straight into the story, say hi first to see if we click. 1-3 paras at a time with lots of speech and characterisation is my preference. I'm not someone who wants to flesh out every character detail and plot point in advance and for me appearances are not as important as story, so if you're the sort of person who sends character references, probably not the right style. Will also share face pics with people who do the same. \n\n\nPut your star sign in your first message so I know you've read this far. Speak soon ladies xxx",

            "selftext": "Helloo DPP! For a change I actually have alone time and why not throw out some ideas? This is for more extreme no-limit doms, so the fewer limits you have the better! With that all out of the way....\n\nHaving a nice and 'pure' looking girl getting her world rocked by a hobo is always one of my most hottest fantasies! As for how that goes, there's a couple ideas.. \n\n- Kindness out of my heart - This idea would entail Me going up up you and offering some 'help', whether that means I'm all for stripping down and sucking you off, or that you'll have to 'work me up' to it, I'm great with either or! \n\n- Drag me down.. - This idea is more of you taking me whether I like it or not. Groping me, jerking off next to me, hell you can even cum on me before we really get started. ;p This is more for the type that just wants to take total control of my life. \n\n- Your.. check up - This is like a combination of the last two, I'm a nurse and/or a doctor and you're wanting to come in for whatever reason. But unbeknownst to me, when I catch a glimpse of your cock, I let you run the check up.. \u2764 (if you chose this one, I really hope you are limitless) \n\nAnd if you have any other ideas that I haven't mentioned, feel free to tell me in DMs! I would prefer that we move onto another chatform sooner rather then later because reddit has a tendency to not show notifications. (And also I'm only responding to the envelopes, I don't have access to Chat! ^^') With all that said, I look forwards to anyone's response with the idea of their's!~",

But all the outfits I have are a little inappropriate.  Whether its a sun dress or a skirt that is so short it barely covers my pert little ass, a pair of leggings that look like they  are painted on, skimpy tube tops that hardly cover my perky breasts or tiny short shorts   that show the Y of my thong anytime I bend over. \n\nWhere ever I go its only a matter of time before I men  are ogling my tight body in those little outfits.  I have no idea most are taking creep shots with their cell phones to share with friends or post online .\n\nI would love to explore this scene more and would like to discuss who you might be.  Are you gunna follow me around taking sneaky pictures and perhaps even convince me to pose for you at your studio and become the next big star.  Will you be some one who has manipulated me into dressing like a little cock tease and taken advantage of how naive and gullible I am to exploite and use me. Are you someone I know that encourages my fashion sense and helps me buy and pick out outfits.  Or this could even get as dark as where ever I go I almost always get raped and gosh I just dont know why.\n\nI am open for other Ideas and would love to explore this further and set something fun up.  \n\nI prefer at least one or two paragraphs so one liners will be ignored. Picture/link play can also be a gun part of this too.\n\nMy other prompts are open as well \n\nBelow is my kink list and hope to see some envelops soon. Xoxoxo\n\nMy kinks are: hot outfits, manipulation, exploitation, cohesion,  being shown off,  being videoed or taken pictures of, size play, age gaps, large cocks, interracial, deepthroat, atm, dp, gangbangs.\n\nMy Limits: bondage, scat and extreme pain\n\nIdeally I would love to play with someone that would hand pick super cute little outfits for me to wear from my panties to my top and even hair ties and jewelry and everything in between.  Including great descriptions or better yet pics or links of the articles of clothing.  Then show me off out in public or even to your friends. This would of course lead me to being turned into a cock craving cum hungry little slut.  \n\nSend me a message if you are interested and let me know what you are thinking so we can work out this scene further and have some fun.",

            "selftext": "Having just broken up from her previous relationship, my sister-in-law moved in our house until she could find a new place to live and get back on her feet. That is when I started seeing her in a totally different way. I'm not sure if it was because of the recent break-up, but she seemed to be constantly seeking my attention, most of the time in inappropriate ways. Things got hot pretty quickly, and I'm not sure how long we'll be able to hold on before we lose it.\n\nThat's the main idea for this RP. I have the 3 following scenes in mind, but feel free to propose your own too.\n\n-----------------\n\nWith the girlfriend gone for the morning, I was quietly drinking my coffee and reading the newspaper when I heard \"Good morning!\". I took my nose out of the newspaper and was greeted by my sister-in-law, wearing a very sexy black babydoll with a hint of a black g-string visible through the thin fabric. She casually went to make herself a cup of coffee, her butt seductively swinging left and right as she waited for the machine to heat up, seemingly unaware of the effects she was having on me. Multiple questions were going through my head as I continuously checked her out. She's acting so casually... is this what she usually wears to sleep? Is she aware of how much revealing these are?\n\n---------------------\n\nThe air filled with hot steam, I was almost done taking my shower when suddenly my sister-in-law barged in the bathroom, wearing an ample t-shirt and some panties, simply greeting \"Hey!\" and then taking the hairbrush and casually doing her hair. The fact that I was totally naked, water dripping down my muscular body, and only covered by a steamed glass door didn't seem to phase her at all, although I swear that I saw her glancing toward me a few times through the mirror, as if she was waiting for me to come out, fully aware that my towel was out of reach.\n\n----------------------\n\nSince my girlfriend didn't want to do anything intimate, afraid that her sister would hear us, I couldn't take it anymore and decided to take some time to relieve some sexual tension. Laying completely naked on my bed, eyes closed, my hand slowly moving up and down my huge cock, I was completely unaware that my sister-in-law was seeing it all from the slightly opened door. Missing the feeling of a big throbbing cock for so long, it didn't took her too much time before joining me in the bedroom.",

            "selftext": "The financial firm, where she had just got a full-time offer from, shut down due to huge insider trading accusations on the board members, and she was left with no job for no reason of her own. That\u2019s when she got in touch with a friend who suggested her to join \u2018The Girlfriend Experience\u2019. She somehow convinced herself, signed up, and got verified. After a couple of days, she had her first invite, for \u2018drinks\u2019, at his place in upstate New York. The offer promised $1000, and $600 advance for a nice dress and her ride. And of course a generous cash bonus if he enjoyed himself more than expected. She calculated that she could be making more than $2000 over just a weekend. At least five times of what she used to make in a day at her job. She pressed the big green \u2018Accept\u2019, and saw all the instructions she\u2019d be needing to reach out to him.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about him too. He\u2019s a successful doctor at a relatively young age. In fact, a little too young to be finding sugar babies, but socialising around all those rich New York Soho residents has corrupted his mind too, as this is not his first time seeking this type of arrangement. Although no girls in the past have been good enough to make them stay for long time in his life, he still cares for them as humans too. Basically he\u2019s not some misogynist who cares for her only as long as her body is wrapped around his dick.\n\n=====================\n\nNow, that was the setup and characters, and here\u2019s how the story goes:\n\nThey have their first stand, and it turns out better than any of them had expected. She then continues her job search, supported by the money she had made over that weekend. He goes on with his work too, but after some 15-20 day, he offers her another weekend. That turns out a good one too. Now only deprived of emotional balance in their lives, it\u2019s a battle of who confesses their feelings first.\n\n=====================\n\nHere\u2019s how I wanna play it out:\n\nThis story can span over a year of time in their lives when they get to the proposal. We\u2019ll pick 6-7 important stages and convert them into scenes, like first meet, second meet, her birthday, meeting his parents, him returning from his work trip, and finally his birthday when he proposes.\n\n=====================\n\nFind my profile [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/imaginary-girl-8991/comments/qtorp1/fellow_messagers/)",

If you don't have them, but want them, I'd love to do an RP with you about you getting them! How you get them can be up to you. Maybe you have surgery, maybe you come across a genie. Maybe there's a new app. Or maybe (and this is my favorite one) you have someone in your life whose tits you covet. This is especially hot if it's a family member, but it doesn't have to be. And you wake up one morning with the ability to steal them! Finally, you can have the tits of your dreams.\n\nAs for me, I'm happy to play anyone, though I do prefer to play myself. But I can be anyone to you.\n\nOr we could do a cuckquean RP if you prefer, where I'm your long term BF who fucks a girl whos sexier than you with the tits you dream of having.\n\n18+ DM or chat.\n\nKinks: Big tits, big cocks, cumplay, FFM threesomes, expansion, growth, body comparisons\n\nLimits: BDSM, non con, beast, bathroom, feet",

It objectifies women to the most humiliating extend, whilst it's just made for guys to stroke their pathetic dicks to them.  \nDo all these guys deserve to get off on stunning, gorgeous women being pounded by alpha males? Definitely not. Beta boys, virgins and submissives should never touch themselves on their own to this type of videos. Never.  \nTheir porn consumption should be supervised by someone superior and not their stupid horny brains. Especially not normal porn, since we all know watching women above their league is for strong, muscular alpha males. Beta boys should touch themselves to clothed women, normal pictures of girls without nudity whatsoever. Maybe if they behave good, follow all commands they might get to upgrade and see shoulders, legs or other body parts. But don't get ahead of ourselves - of course no cleavage or ass. Maybe after a while of humiliation and teasing some lingerie pics could suffice - but only if a beta behaves very well.  \nLast but not least, there is even an own porn category for beta males. Censored porn. What it does is basically normal porn or naked pictures of girls but with the twist that the hot parts, such as tits, ass or sometimes even more are censored. It's the best way to tease and humiliate a true beta and show them in their place.  \nBut not only that, every single stroke they apply on their small dick should be commanded and not chosen by themselves.

            "selftext": "The ad for the product seems like any other, offering improved sexual performance and somehow a bigger cock. It becomes obvious quickly this new pill isn't like the others, it's not a bunch of herbs or some oil, it claims to physically give you enhancements from the natural world. By popping one of these pills you could have a red hot knotted cock borrowed from a wolf, a heavy flared tube of meat borrowed from a horse or nearly any other enhancements from the animal kingdom. \n\nNow you or your partner, according to this product, can borrow the power of any animal you'd like for a planned night together or surprise them with. \n\nThe colored tablets come with clear instructions and a guide (can be customer ordered or a generic pack) on how to take them safely. If the instructions are followed, you could be giving or receiving a horse cock without having to step into the stable. You could be knotted by your lover without the worry of claws. (Let me know if you looking to follow the instructions)\n\nThis is a new product, quality control won't be perfect and there's no one there to make sure you don't get creative. The bottle makes it clear that you shouldn't take more than the dose prescribed to your body mass and you should NEVER mix the pills. No where on the product dose it cover why one shouldn't, for fear of encouraging customers to experiment in hopes of receiving what they would consider positive results. You obviously could end up with a knotted, flared cock with barbs but you could just as easily end up taking on the appearance of a dog with too much muscle and a not much bigger, yet barbed cock. The bottle never even mentions what would happen if a woman were to take a pill...maybe she'll get to try out doing the fucking for once or maybe she'll just wind up in heat?\n\nHow do you invision using this new, exciting product?\n\nI'm open to playing either side, the one popping the pill or the one receiving the results. I only play male characters. \n\nKinks: big cocks, size difference, age difference, beast, rape, noncon, dubcon, cum play, lots of cum, face fucking, oral, deep penetration, teasing, exhibition, straight, gay, group sex, gang bangs, glory holes, public sex, femboys, tomboys, futa, incest. \n\nDislikes: bimbos, cunnilingus, chastity.\n\nLimits: bathroom anything, extreme violence.",

We typically spend most of the trip together eating, drinking, soaking in the sun, swimming in the pool and sitting on the beach.  We do everything you\u2019re supposed to do on a tropical vacation but we all barely get any alone time.  The only alone time my wife and I get is when we\u2019re in our own hotel room at night, and we always make the most of that time together.  This year however I bought my wife and I a couples massage that\u2019s supposed to be the best there is.  It\u2019s full body, it\u2019s multiple hours, and it\u2019s multiple stations, rooms, and therapists.  We were so excited for our appointment that my wife went too hard with mimosas this morning and now she\u2019s passed out.  The package was very expensive so I offered to give the appointment to my in-laws but my father-in-law has doesn\u2019t want anybody touching him.  I don\u2019t get that, I want as many women touching me as possible at all times.  So the only other option was for my wife\u2019s mom to come with me.  We both love massages, we get along great, and there was no chance our spouses were coming with either one of us.  I happily accepted the offer, glad I didn\u2019t have to waste the money, but I had no idea how intimate this couples spa day in paradise was about to be.  Let\u2019s build the spa and work on the experience together!",

But I've got this pretty big kink for denial based roleplays, and there's nothing that makes me hornier than being denied because my tiny little white dicklet could never make a girl feel as good as a perfect black alpha cock.\r  \n\r  \nThat's the focus of the roleplay I want to do. The plot is pretty simple!\n\r  \nI'm a feminine white guy, somewhere between the ages of 18 to 22. Depending on if you play as my mother or sister; I'll either be living at home, or staying at your apartment on a mini holiday. That's down to your personal preference. We get on pretty well and have a good relationship, for the most part. Maybe we're slightly distant, but neither of us think about it. \n\r  \nIn secret, I'm incredibly deprived and lewd, and I spend a lot of time watching interracial porn. I'm fully aware of what a Queen of Spades is, but it's up to you how much I know specifically about the \"kink\", or in your case, lifestyle.\n\r  \nOne night I notice the tattoo on you. The tattoo can be where you want it to. Naturally, my mind goes a little crazy because if it.\r  \n\r  \nMaybe you notice that I saw it and confront me. Maybe I confront you about it. Again, that's open to discussion!\r  \n\r  \nThe main thing I want out of this roleplay is to be manipulated by you and become your sissy, and hopefully a little slut for black cock too. I want it to mostly focus on our relationship but still have a good few scenes with BBC.\r  \n\r  \nIf you're interested please hit me up.

Being from the good part of town, well known family, big pool in your backyard, private tutoring, you were already set up for almost any job you could dream off once you graduated your parents alma mater. Life was good, always had been and was supposed to be that way going forward. \n\nI was not just from the other side of town, but also from the other side of life. No fancy high school, no college, infamous family at best. We saw each other a couple of times back in high school, because your school wasn't just quite too good to take some grant money for sharing sports facilities with mine. From our few interactions I could also tell the same applied to you and you weren't quite too good for a black guy from across town, unlike most of your classmates. But nothing ever happened. \n\nWhile you went off to college, I started hustling. By now it wasn't quite small time anymore and I had eeked out a decent living, telling some guys when to be where and push done product, rather than taking the risk myself like some petty criminal who wasn't going to move up in this world. \n\nI was mindlessly browsing through Tinder one afternoon, while waiting for a drop, when I saw your profile, recognising you instantly. After a moment of disbelief I swiped right, matching you immediately. That's when I got the idea to use your little infatuation and try to get you to run some product for me. After all, who's going to search you? The fashion police? \n\nPlus there's some other things I had always wanted to do with you.",

In my life, I have always been very submissive and shy but I have also been very lucky as well, since I always ended up dating out-of-my-league girls. The thing is, I always ended up thinking I wasn't enough for them, and this is what led to my cuckolding kink.\n\nToday I'm looking for someone to play either as my previous girlfriends, famous celebrities or fictional characters that we both like or as someone who fucks them in front of me. In either case, you'll get to have all the fun, while I'll just sit there and watch or do humiliating things. I also really like the idea of getting feminized and join as well later in the RP, if you like the idea as well.\n\nIn your first message (either DM or chat requests) let me know something about you, and if you'd like to play the role of the cuckoldress/hotwife or as the bull who'll show me how to fuck a girl. Then make sure to add things to the plot and to tell me about your characters preferences and kinks. If you'd like to include celebrities or characters from any series let me know who your favorites are.",

There's no sense trying to get away - I'm tethered to the post by a leather collar, the chain attached short enough to keep me bent double unless I kneel in the dirt. They like me in this position - it's the third time I've been here this week.  \n\n\n\"Open.\"  \n\n\nThe orc gives the instruction before he even stops thrusting, pulling out of me and walking around to my mouth almost before I can register the command. I obey it immediately and get a mouthful of thick, cunt-slick cock for my trouble, my captor grunting as he clamps my head between mammoth hands to better angle himself down my throat.  \n\n\nIt's not the best start to my summer.  \n\n\nAt 40-odd years of age, I'm young for an elf, barely considered mature enough to perform the duties my status demands. I'm not even old enough to remember our first encounter with this tribe of orcs, though I was barely 30 when the truce began. The orcs, it is known, are little more than beasts - their urges and instincts animal, their culture, such as it is, dedicated to satisfying them. They rarely make war, but they love to take prisoners - and though they will slake their lusts on humans, what they truly love is elves. We are supple, after all, easy to bend but hard to break, perfect receptacles for their vilest desires.  \n\n\nThese orcs surrounded our village a decade ago, when their push for territory took them far south of their usual roaming.  They could have destroyed us, but they chose another path.  \nAnd so the Truce began.  \n\n\n\"Suck better.\"  \n\n\nMy reverie is halted for a moment, as my first captor hilts himself inside me, my nose brushing his belly as he holds me in place. Another green-skin joins him, driving into me from behind, and I wonder if he cares when I scream around his ridiculous girth.  \n\n\nThe Truce is simple. Each summer, six female elves are presented to the orcs, to do with as they might until the season passes. They must be returned unharmed, but anything done to them otherwise is considered just and fair, and the orcs, according to the returning prisoners, are imaginative beasts indeed. For our part, we choose the tributes by lottery, and no elf is immune.  \n\n\nThe orcs do not know I'm a princess yet.  \n\n\nI wonder what they'll do when they find out.\n\n(We can start from here, or from when I first entire my summer of service. Interested in good writing, and creative ideas about what the orcs might do...)",

However, they know that they will be paying in another way.

Nikki is in her mid twenties, blonde hair, and covered in tattoos. The typical look of a dive bartender. She pours them some shots on the house and start to chat them up. Its not long before they invite her to join them on the boat. She shows up at the dock in the morning in a skimpy bikini with her ass hanging out and her iPhone tucked into the bikini bottom strap. She didn't bring anything. The boys are loading their coolers and food on the boat when they see the bartender from the night before. Nikki heads onto the boat, puts on the the boys straw hat, pours a shot and crack open a white claw.\n\nScenario #2\n\nKatie and Alexis two college best friends.

            "selftext": "\nHello! So lately I've been interested in doing an RP set in a world other than our own, whether it be an original fantasy/sci-fi setting or a pre-established world/fandom.\n\nI generally prefer playing as OC's, with these various worlds as basic backdrops. As for kinks, I'm pretty vanilla, but I\u2019m open to anything so long as it DOES NOT involve scat, gore, rape, violence, watersports, incest, or characters who are minors.\n\nSome of my favorite settings, if we are to go the R34 route, include: Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Mass Effect, The Witcher, Dragon Age, Warcraft, \n\nHere are some prompt ideas I have, just to name a couple\n\n*Mass Effect*\n\nA young human male arrives on the Citadel for the very first time, having just secured an entry-level job at Earth\u2019s embassy. While he already has a deep understanding and appreciation for the various alien cultures throughout the galaxy, he has always been most fascinated in that of the asari. While he\u2019s met a few asari here and there while living on earth, he\u2019s never really gotten the chance to interact with one beyond mere small talk. That said, he\u2019s always had a deep...admiration for the Asari. However, despite this attraction, he\u2019s always been rather shy around women, even humans.\n\nMy idea for such a set up would involve this young man meeting and subsequently falling prey to the seduction of an Asari he meets while out at one of the Citadel\u2019s many bars - one with an affinity for human men. They strike up a conversation, which ends with her taking him home for what will surely become the greatest night of his life.\n\n*Witcher (or any fantasy setting)*\n\nIn this scenario I was thinking that I\u2019d take on the role of a young man from a wealthy merchant family, in one of the realm\u2019s more prosperous cities. While out one day, he meets a lovely older, married noblewoman, who, unbeknownst to him, is in the market for a new lover. Alternatively, instead of a noblewoman, she could also be a lowborn peasant, tired of her provincial life as a wife and mother and looking for excitement to fulfill her secret urges.\n\nAnother idea I would love to explore would have this young man fall for the charms of a sorceress or witch, who wishes to satisfy her own needs. We could go in a lot of different directions with this. Note that this could work for just about any fantasy setting.\n\n*Star Wars*\n\nThis is probably the most open-ended setting out of the ones I\u2019ve suggested. Perhaps I am a young sith acolyte in the middle of completing his training, and you an attractive, powerful Sith Lord who has decided to take me under your wing. Or maybe I am a newly knighted Jedi on a diplomatic mission to a planet in the outer rim, sent to negotiate an alliance between their government and the galactic republic shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, and, while there, he meets an attractive young government aid or secretary (or maybe even a high ranking official) who catches his eye. Or, perhaps rather than a diplomatic mission, he is assigned to participate in a top-secret archeological dig on an ancient Sith world, and established an intimate collection with the site\u2019s Twilek, chief archeologist.\n\n\nOf course, since I value reciprocation and compromise, I am willing to hear more fan-settings should you have alternative ideas, but I just wanted to offer those ones in particular as examples. Send me a message if you are interested in playing out one of these scenes, or if you have any similar suggestions!",

            "selftext": "I know we don\u2019t exactly have the. . . \\*best\\* relationship. We never have. After all, we haven\u2019t really talked much since I left home five years ago. Some interaction on Facebook, sometimes I see you liking one of my Instagram posts, and every once in a blue moon we have a phone call. Even if the phone calls usually end with us bickering and picking a fight about something stupid, it still counted as talking. . .right? That\u2019s what I liked to think, anyway. \r  \n\r  \nGrowing up had been hard. You\u2019d had me young, far too young to really know what you were doing. Dad had left pretty early, leaving just the two of us. You\u2019d dated some, but never remarried. You always said it was because you were giving all of your time to me, never really looking after yourself, but I never liked to think about it. It just made me feel guilty about what would come later. See, I was rebellious. I always had been. I hated authority, hated being told what to do, and if we\u2019re being honest, I resented you on some level. You were always busy, always working to keep us afloat, never really had much time for me personally. By the time I was in high school, we hardly even knew each other. I started going out to parties, drinking, sneaking out, all the things rebellious teenagers do. Shit really hit the fan when you came home early one day and found me in bed with one of the cheerleaders from school.\r  \n\r  \nI still remember that fight like it was yesterday. You and I got into a screaming match while I was still naked and the poor girl I\u2019d been sleeping with trying to get dressed as fast as she could, trying to get out of that house. We let out bottled emotions, fighting, arguing, screaming and shouting. I still remember storming out of the house, barely dressed, staying with a friend for a few days, letting things simmer down. They didn\u2019t. We just kept fighting, and fighting, and fighting, until our house was a battleground. Our war only ended a week after my eighteenth birthday, when I left home go to to college. My spiraling descent into discovering my own sexuality only continued from there, really. I knew what I was. I was a whore, and I took pride in that. You didn\u2019t. You hated it. And part of me wondered if you hated \\*me\\*, too.\r  \n\r  \nBut five years have passed since then. I\u2019m twenty three now, graduated and working, having my own life, but I never stopped thinking about you. Not once. Not a day passed by that I didn\u2019t regret storming out, didn\u2019t regret always fighting with you. I wanted you back in my life. I wanted my mom back. And maybe. . . maybe there was something else, too. I was having weird fantasies, weird cravings. Thoughts and feelings and desires that daughters shouldn\u2019t have towards their mother, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Maybe it was some sick, twisted part of me, something fundamentally wrong with me, but I couldn\u2019t deny it, no matter how much I wanted to. \r  \n\r  \nMaybe that\u2019s why I made the call. Maybe that\u2019s why I told you I wanted to come home for a few weeks around Christmas, that I wanted to patch things up. Maybe that was even true. Or maybe it was the other part of me that made me do it. The part that got wet when I imagined the way your lips would feel on mine, your body in my hands, or the way you would taste when my head was between your legs. I didn\u2019t know. \r  \n\r  \nBut I was going to find out.\r  \n\r  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\r  \n\r  \nHello, my interested fellow writers! As you can read from the prompt above, I\u2019m looking to do a literate, long-term romantic rp between a mother and her daughter patching up a rocky relationship. I\u2019m a literate roleplayer that writes multiple paragraphs, enjoys story and context, and writes slowly. If you\u2019re looking for fast-paced lazily written short-term jerk off fests, then I\u2019m just not the partner for you. \r  \n\r  \nSo while I\u2019m primarily looking for a romance, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re gonna be gentle. Oh, no. We can be very, \\*very\\* kinky and rough. I actually prefer that even. My kinks for this include: Incest, Age Gap, Humiliation, Degradation, Mommy Kink, Futa, Strap Ons, Breast Play, Scissoring, Tribbing, Sado-Masochism, BDSM, Romance, Anal, Rimming, Facesitting, and more! My limits are pretty easy: Underage, Bathroom Stuff, Gore, Vore, and hyper stuff. Anything else we can negotiate.\r  \n\r  \nMy character description: Kitten is 24 and 5'7\". Her hair is naturally black, but she dies it half golden blonde, and includes lighter highlights in the darker half, still. She wears dark-make up to bring attention to her pale skin tone, and her pretty angular face is almost never without some form of blush, concealer, or highlight. She dresses in a gothic style, with lots of chokers, piercings, and tight shirts that show off her decently sized chest, about a C cup. Her body is lean and somewhat toned, giving her an athletic look rather than too soft, though she still has curves. She often wears lacey black lingerie along with garter belts and stockings, though her panties are usually crotchless. She has one tattoo, a tramp stamp on her backside hips: 'si\u00f9rsach', the Scottish Gaelic word for Whore, in celtic style lettering. I have a reference for her that can be provided if asked!\r  \n\r  \nYou can make your character, her mother, look however you want! I have pretty much no preference what she looks like or her personality, as long as the backstory can still fit. She could be \u2018straight\u2019 and realize she has feelings for Kitten, be gay since her baby daddy left, bisexual, whatever you want! I want you to like your character, get a good feel for her. I would like to start us with Kitten coming home and their first in-person interaction in years. If you\u2019re interested, please send me a PM (Not a chat) with \u2018Reconnection\u2019 in the subject. Include your kinks, limits, and your character description. What she looks like, her name, her physical stats, all the good stuff! I look forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "\"Ugh!\" Banging sounds rang out from the entrance to our flat as I came home at 1 a.m, frustrated. I made an instant beeline for your room and barged in where I saw you sleeping, but that didn't matter. You were always available for me. You even said so yourself on many occasions. \n\n\"Mindyyyyy. Mindyyyyyy~ wake upppp\" I turned on the lamplight and shook you awake. As your eyes fluttered open I smiled. \"I need a pick me up, it's okay right?\" Without even waiting for your response I had already clambered up to your bed and swung my leg over to the other side of your head. Your vision turned black as your face disappeared into my dress between my legs. Your mouth instantly made warm by my touch. I let out a light shuddering gasp as your tongue flitted out and started to pamper my womanhood.\n\n\"So my date. Oh my god this guy. *Mmmf* I have no idea why I even use tinder. First *ahh* he took me to some little kids superhero movie. *hauuu* Like. Hello. Look at me.\" I said gesturing to my little black dress embroidered with sequins. \"Do I look like the type of girl that *ouh* watches that garbage? And then, then he *oh gosh* took me to some cheap little burrito place.\" Both hands reached down and my fingers coursed through your hair, massaging your scalp with my long nails. \"Oh right there Mindy. That's good. Right there.\" My hips started to buck, moving in tune with your licks.\n\n\"And then he had the *aaaaauuhhh* audacity to say 'do you wanna come back to my place?' *fhuuuu* Like, no mister. I'm not some cheap little slut that lets you fuck her for a burrito. *Nnnnh* He was hot, and I was feeling horny, but I wasn't going to fuck him after *that*.\" I had been gradually getting wetter and wetter the whole time but now it was like a flood that overflowed all over your lips and started to dribble down your jaw. \"Hey Mindy, focus. You know I don't like it when it gets all messy. You'd better lick it all up Missy. Mmmf, yes, just like that, drink it all up. Good girl.\" I closed my eyes and lost myself in pleasure for a moment. My hips naturally began to bounce harder and faster. My fingers started to claw at your scalp as I felt myself getting closer.\n\n\"Oh god I'm almost there. Almost...there. I'm gonna cum so fucking hard. I'm gonna squirt in your mouth. Oh god, why are you so good at this? *Fuuu huuuu Fuuckkkkkkkk*\" With one final bounce of my hips I finally went over the edge and started to cum. The flood of wetness turned into a veritable ocean as I squirted all over your mouth and lips. But you weren't a stranger to my excessive wetness. I heard a steady *gulp...gulp...gulp...gulp* as you drank down every last drop. It turned me on so much to know that you did that for me. \n\nFinally after a minute or so my orgasm began to die down, but your tongue was incessantly moving, trying to clean up every last speck of my wetness. I did oh so love to be cleaned. I let you pamper my pussy for another minute or so before I got up, leaving your tongue licking at the air. \"Whew. That was so refreshing.\" And just like that I was gone. Not even a thank you or an atta girl. After all, that's just how good a 'friend' you were.\n\n------------------\n\nSo the general gist of the RP is that we would be 'Friends'. I would be 'straight' in this relationship but at certain times where I'm feeling perhaps a bit frustrated or maybe just a little horny I would use your character's mouth. In this story you would be the lesbian, and maybe even have this *massive* crush on me. On more than one occasion you had offered but I never really had any interest until I got drunk one night and saw what your mouth could really do. After that I had gotten pretty hooked to your tongue, but still tried to maintain my 'straight' status.\n\nAs you can probably gather from my name I like playing the 'Pillow Princess' a girl that likes to be sexually pleasured, but does not like to return the favor. In fact having my partner be denied orgasms is one of my biggest kinks. I'd like the story to play out in a way that has your character craving this dynamic. Loving the fact that she has finally been allowed to lick my pussy, while intensely needy about her own pleasure, but happy to fore-go it for my sake. Maybe even build up a type of dom/sub relationship where she becomes a denied tongue slut and me her mistress. \n\nI write in roughly 2-3 paragraphs, first person, past tense, and prefer a partner with the same style. \n\nI'd love to hear what other ideas you may have for this RP and look forward to seeing those lovely orange envelopes!",

They knew I was one of the few guys on campus with a cunt, with a shaved, pretty cunt. I wasn't aware of the rules you were going to put in place, and for the first few weeks I fought it. I fought being the free use toy of the house. Being pulled onto a cock as the guys played video games, having my throat used for cockwarming and having a cunt full of cum almost all the time.\n\nAt parties I'm put in a room to the side, free to use by the guests. Beer gets poured in my pussy, at one point a cup full of beer was put in my pussy and people tried tossing ping pong balls as a form of beer pong (Cunt Pong). After a month and a half I loved it.\n\nI went to classes full of whatever various things were shoved in me (ping pong balls, a can of beer, a jar, etc) to ensure I was gaping when I got back to the frat house.\n\nSometimes I'd even wake up with a cock pulsing, filling my cunt or ass with hot, sticky cum. \n\nI've been turned into a toy.\n\n(I'd love for you to play various guys in the house who use me! Scenes can very in length, you can also play a singular guy who wants me to be his--permanently. Whether romantically or just sexually can be discussed. I'm also very happy to have you play multiple guys for a group scene!\n\nDespite how I wrote the prompt out, I *heavily* prefer third person for roleplay. \n\nMy limits are: Being misgendered, general transphobia, smegma, raunch, gore, toilet play.\n\nMy kinks are: breeding, object insertion, fisting, free use, somnophilia, pregnancy dirty talk, tit sucking, lactation, casual use, choking, throatpies, messy sex, gaping pussies and more! Please ask me about *any* kink.\n\nI'm very open to feminine words for body parts, so don't worry about that! Pussy, cunt, boypussy, boycunt, tits, breasts, boobs, are all welcome!\n\nI have a reference photo I can send if asked!)",

You decide to rest the limits and finally live out some more dominant fantasies you\u2019d never do with another *real* person. \n\n2) Your boyfriend confesses his fantasy of being shrunk when the technology becomes commercially available. You agree, and we explore what new options we have (this might be better if you prefer a gentler approach).\n\nOf course, I\u2019d love to build a more personalized scenario/background together! \n\nAll my other prompts are always open. \n\nPlease include your name, age, and gender in your first message.

I recently finished it and I loved the dynamic between the two and I was thinking of kinda recreating it but adding our own little spins to it. Youd tease me a lot and slowly wed build up romantic feelings or something like that. I dont want to jump straight into anything sexual. Im looking for someone thats preferably a switch but either way is fine. I can top just as well as I can bottom. We can start just like they did in the anime, where she was a total bully to him at first or maybe just work towards it like first you just tease me but then it turns to more later? Idk whatever you think is best. You can be as harsh or nice as you want, it doesnt matter to me. K want this to be more long term, itd be cool to get to know eachother and stuff as time goes on. My kinks are feet, anal, body worship, humiliation, face sitting/face fuck, non con, and more I just cant think of much else right now. My limits are scat, piss and underage. Send me a chat and maybe we can move to discord or something, if not thats okay too. Send me your name and your kinks. See you!",

            "selftext": "(Envelopes/Messages Please! 18+ Only!)\n\nIt\u2019s taken a lot of effort to protect my virginity. On the one side have been my conservative parents and their extreme sheltering, years of Catholic schooling/guilt, and intensive internet monitoring, on the other have been my raging hormones. I\u2019ve always been boy-crazy, and just standing near a man I\u2019m attracted to can make me fantasize about sex and lose my concentration, though I\u2019d never admit that.\n\nMy name is Olivia, I\u2019m 19, a freshman in college, I\u2019m 4\u201911\u201d, 103 pounds, have blonde hair, and I do my best to hide my 36C breasts.\n\nYou\u2019re my father\u2019s boss, the owner of a large law firm that my father works at. You\u2019re in your 40s, 6\u20195\u201d tall, muscular, recently divorced with three kids, and have a dominating and powerful presence.\n\nMy Irish-Catholic family kept me very sheltered and didn\u2019t allow me to date, and sent me to all-girls Catholic schools. I graduated in the Spring and recently started at a big Catholic college.\n\nMy father had kept the family financial situation to himself, but it was becoming clear that my university costs were hitting hard, and his job with you didn\u2019t seem so secure. You owned one of only two of the law firm in town that operates in what my Dad specialized in, and the last one fired him, so there was no where else he could go. \n\nSitting around the dinner table one night, my father brought up that his boss, you, had seen a picture of me from when I started college on my dad\u2019s desk, and you asked about me. You explained that your secretary just quit, and then you offered (or demanded?) that I start an internship with you for the next two months. \n\nMy Dad clearly was embarrassed and a little humiliated about his only daughter basically becoming his boss\u2019s personal assistant, but he said I needed to do it. I guessed he thought it would help him keep his job, but he tried to have more pride than that, and explained that the internship would be paid, and our family needed the money.\n\nThe next morning my Mom helped me dress up in the attire your office required. I wore my silver crucifix with my work attire.\n\nI felt weird starting this internship, but I knew I had to do it. That first day, I went into the office with my Dad. He took me to your office and knocked on your door.\n\n\u201cUmm, Mr. Armstrong, my daughter Olivia is here to start her internship.\u201d He hesitantly said.\n\nJust then we see your huge frame rise, in outline against the completely frosted glass of your office, as you approached the door.\n\nI gulped but you introduced yourself confidently and warmly, and explained my duties at the secretary station outside your office. I was to bring you coffee and lunch and manage your calendar. I would take my laptop home after work to manage your calendar at night. \n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d I replied obediently.\n\nI was blushing at you, my blue eyes lost staring at your attractive face, my stomach getting butterflies as your muscular body towered over me, as you charmingly explained to me how you liked your coffee, and where you kept your ties if I needed to get you one.\n\n\u201cUmm, okay sir.\u201d I said, my brain feeling foggy as intense lovey-dovey feelings toward you coursed through me.\n\nThe week started simply and I performed my tasks well. At night at home, I realized my laptop was the first computer I\u2019ve had without parental controls and monitoring, and I started to use it to look at, well, forbidden content.\n\nMy curiosity went a bit wild and I can finally lookup all the things I\u2019ve heard about that I\u2019ve been mostly ignorant about.\n\nMy searches have been things like:\n\n\u201cDoes losing your virginity hurt?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo older men like college girls?\u201d\n\n\u201cAverage penis size\u201d\n\n\u201cSex instruction video\u201d \n\nTwo days in, you bring my Dad into your office and yell at him angrily for 15 minutes straight, sending him back to his desk with his tail between his legs. I could hear every word - as you berated him, I felt bad for him, but as you yelled, I could also feel a tingling between my legs, and afterwards when I went to the bathroom, I realized my panties were wet.\n\nThat night I start searching and get even bolder. My romantic feelings, fear of pregnancy, and hormones turning into keystrokes:\n\n\u201cIs it normal to get wet when my boss is angry?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat to do if I\u2019m in love with my boss\u201d\n\n\u201cWould an older man marry a college girl?\u201d \n\n\u201cHow to give a guy a blowjob\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you get pregnant the first time you have sex?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoss having sex with intern video\u201d\n\nI\u2019m exploring this all for hours until about midnight, without knowing that my computer activity is being monitored in real-time, and you can see my searches and browsing history. \n\nI don\u2019t even notice the small blue LED light next to the laptop camera.\n\nBy midnight, I\u2019ve frantically fingered myself to an explosive climax, my first to porn, while watching the video of the boss bending his intern over his desk and cumming inside her bare.\n\nAfter my orgasm, I think to myself: I like the fantasy of having sex with you, but I don\u2019t actually want to have a husband 25 years older than me, right? A husband who is my Dad\u2019s boss? My parents and my friends would be ashamed of me. I\u2019m glad I can have my fantasy and not act on it.\n\nAt 9AM the next morning, the day of the company\u2019s Holiday party, I hand your coffee, made just the way you like it.\n\n\u201cGood Morning Mr. Armstrong! Here\u2019s your coffee!\u201d I say smiling, thinking back to my secret masturbation the night before.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI want your character to dominate me, and ultimately knock me up, and make me your obedient, submissive wife to breed. Please SLOWLY escalate things, from talk, to touch, to say a handjob, perhaps giving me assignments like sending you nude selfies, maybe telling me I need to do this for my Dad to keep his job. Please don\u2019t ever publicly humiliate me in a sexual way (privately is fine).\n\nKinks: blackmail, dub-con, non-con, CMNF, romance, domestication, outfit control, impregnation, breeding, manipulation, texting/phone play, age difference, height difference, first time.\n\nLimits: gore, groups, writing for my character.",

It was going to be a pool party with a little bit of weed and a lot a bit of alcohol, some of my mom's friends are a bit extreme and cruised in with some more intense party favors; coke and molly, everyone loved it. Before the party began though she needed some help and she called her best friend, (your mom) to come help while also asking me if I could help; I texted you, telling you your mom was coming over early to help settup and asked you to come over to chill and flirt and possibly get lucky some of the milfs coming over later tonight.\n\nAfter setting up and chilling for a bit the part comes, a ravenous group of mature ladies showing up, desperate to unwind and have fun, the two of us have fun getting felt up by these busty moms and have ourselves some dirty fun with one of the rolling milfs who tried to take us both in her mouth. A few husbands and boyfriends stopped by and had some fun with these fun-loving girls as well, cocaine was getting railed off hard dicks as often as wine corked were popping. After that the party went by pretty quick and all who remained were the two of us and our moms. \n\nSo i'd like to start things from there, with a couple of bisexual buddies getting fucked up with their moms and eventually all fucking each-other stupid.\n\nWe'll both be roleplaying as one male and female duo. I'll be in control of a mother and son pairing while playing the son in first person and the mother in third; ideally you'd be in first person for your son character and third for your mother character as well, but if it's a dealbreaker we can discuss.\n\nPlease send me a message including the names of your characters and a physical description (or ref pic).

You are a new contestant on the popular adults only television game show \"Slut Life.\"\nFor the next year, you will be living in an apartment provided by us along with the other contestants. All of your actions will be monitored and broadcasted constantly to a universal audience. At the end of the year, you will be rewarded with whatever you've chosen from the provided list. Breaking any rules will result in punitive action, up to and including the revocation of your reward. \"\n\n*Groggy and very confused, I stare off into the direction the voice came from and try to comprehend what the hell I've gotten myself into.*\n\n\n\n**Hello!** Recently I've been inspired by the Slut Life CYOA, and I would like to try doing something similar. A quick summary of it would be that Slut Life is a reality show broadcast to the entire universe. During the course of the show a contestant is transported to a remote planet and must perform various sexual tasks for an ever changing group of \"Owners\". There are various traits and ordeals that can be forced on the contestant ranging from being forced to sleep outside all the way to full body modification and mind control.\n\nThis is getting kinda wordy so I'll try to wrap it up quickly. I'm looking for someone who would be able to either play as a sort of GM, dictating the scenarios and ordeals I'm put through. Or possibly someone who would like to play as an owner(s) and force me to do their bidding. We can use the CYOA as a guideline or come up with our own rule and conditions. This prompt works well with Rule 34 characters as well.\n\nI'm a Sub and My kinks are: Non-Con, Dub-Con, Blackmail, Cheating, Outercourse, Impregnation, Excessive Cum, Large Cocks, Mind Control, Mind Break/Corruption, Dice Games, Age Gap, Genderbending and various things in between. I'm also comfortable playing as a real life person if you have anyone in mind. My limits are: Scat, Gore, Water Sports, Excessive Violence, and anything else with similar themes.\n\nI also do not use chat, so I will only be replying to messages.\n\nIf you are interested at all please let me know! I can't wait to start playing around with you!",

            "selftext": "They say the key to doing well at the casino is just confidence. Or at least, that's what my friends told me when they managed to convince me to go. I didn't have a lot of disposable income at this point in my life, but they told me I didn't have to gamble much, even if at all. They just wanted me there to have a good time with, maybe have a few drinks. I didn't have any other plans, so what the hell? No point in turning down what could be a fun night. I got dressed up in a short, sparkly dress, did my hair and makeup, and set out to at least look nice, if nothing else.\n\nAbout halfway through the night, and most of my friends have spent their time gambling and drinking with people they've met, and I've mostly been resigned to the corner of the table, watching over their shoulders. I didn't have enough money to do anything really fun here, but my friends kept egging me on to do something.\n\nSo, I bought into the table with more money than I was willing to spend for the night, a poker game with a few people, including you. I had never played before, and it just ended up as you and me. And when you end up winning, finding out I don't exactly have the means to pay you back, you decide to take your payment another way.\n\n---\n\nHi! I'm Maddie and I'm looking for a dominant woman to play this prompt out with! There's a few ways we can go about this, with you deciding to take my straight up, or you could make me work off my payments to you however you decide. There's also the added twist of who you could be, whether you're a friend that's coerced me into playing or just a random stranger that lucks her way into this prize.\n\nMy kinks are BDSM, TPE, humiliation, degradation, exhibitionism, punishments, bondage, spankings, outfit control, ENF, CFNF, domestic tasks, orgasm control, petplay, anal, sex toys, MD/lg, being a camgirl, being showed off/whored out. Limits are bathroom play, guys, blood, animals, incest, chldren.\n\nPrefer PM's over chats, other prompts in my post history are up for grabs as well! If you have any changes you want to make to the prompt, let me know!",

            "selftext": "You and I were best friends throughout high school. And I mean like, completely inseparable. While most kids were making friends through sports, or band, or some other club, we were just... us. A pair of nerds, without basically anyone else, who found each other through video games and comic books, and never really found anyone else.\n\nIt was never a romantic thing. Sure, I crushed on you at first, but I knew that like every other guy you had your sights set on a certain kind of girl. I wasn't sure exactly what kind of girl it was, but I knew it wasn't me. Skinny as a rail, with no fashion sense or really any grace at all, I wasn't exactly a \"catch.\" So we were friends, and pretty much just friends, but we were so close that any \"relationship\" would have felt like a chore.\n\nAnd then, of course, I went off to college. You stayed home, and promised we'd still be us. But after just a single year, it's felt like we've drifted already. We started off by texting every day, then every other day, then, well... who knows? You've probably moved onto new friends, or changed somehow.\n\nI've changed, too. But let's just say that it's... superficial. I'm still shy, still weird, still basically friendless, even at school. It's just that my body is different. Uh, way different.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHello! My idea for this is that we were best friends in high school, who have drifted apart since I left for college. I'm coming back for the summer, and although I'm the same shy nerd I always was, my body has matured past the point of recognition. And who knows, maybe it's just started growing!\n\nThis is for fans of big boobs, big butts, and curves on curves. I'm looking for something detailed, slow burning, and creative! And since I'm not always online, understand that I tend to go for longer form writing. If that works, message me!\n\nMy kinks include: sizeplay, expansion and transformation, cumplay, outfits and dressup, rough stuff, name-calling, public, voyeur, name-calling, and good writers. I'm NOT into violence, animals, bathroom stuff. Looking forward to hearing from you!",

I have very few limits so I think this could turn into a really fun RP. Maybe we meet and you willingly become my Sugar Baby, maybe it's more of dub-con or even non-con.

Waking up to looking down and seeing a perky pair of tits. A physique that is out of this world. Having drinks bought for them and being fawned over by tons of people.\n\nWell I\u2019m hoping to try it out tonight. The thought is either by magic or just in a dream I wake up as a woman. Having my thoughts and drive as a man. Still wanting women and to experience myself with a woman but with different parts. \n\n\nI know this is a bit of adifferent prompt that only a few may want to dabble in. So here is calling out to the women who want to give a guy their first lesbian experience and teach me about my new body.\n\nIf you\u2019re at all interested shoot me a message so we can work out the details. At this point it\u2019s more of a whim and not sure if there will be much interest.\n\nKinks: lesbian, vibrators, strap on, sensual, etc\n\nLimits: underage, beast, toilet, gore",

Making me drink cum and piss. Waterboarding me. And so much more.\n\nAnd of course you\u2019ll be a racist, misogynist bastard. Women like me should never have climbed the ladder. Women like me don\u2019t deserve to enjoy the upper class life and do well at work. I deserve to be on my knees, naked except for a collar and leash, doing whatever you want, and eventually bred like the fucktoy I am.\n\nSounds good? Turns you on? Let\u2019s chat about it.\n\nMy limits are gore, shit, blood, permanent markings/mutilation, and armpit/feet stuff.\n\nMy dealbreaker for a chat partner is horrible responses, so please make sure you\u2019re coherent and able to balance between kink/reality before we chat.\n\nDrop me an intro and if I like you, we might chat.",

Horny, hot, and unabashedly perverted. Explore what really gets us going when it comes to the rougher side of things.  Perhaps even work out a scenario that we come up with that we agree on, preferably something more realistic and grounded. \n\nMy limits are fairly reasonable (no blood, toilet stuff, vomit, anything illegal, etc.), but some other kinks I can definitely accommodate if you so wish to include them. Everything from anal, to bondage, to outfits, and beyond. I do what aftercare I can as well ;) \n\nIf you\u2019re down, feel free to PM me (**don\u2019t use Chat**) with your limits, and we can get down to business as hard or soft as you\u2019d like.",

You pick up your pace. The footsteps behind you speed up. You spare a glance back and see a tall, lean man catching up to you. It should be nothing to worry about, but it triggers some animal part of your brain and you speed up. The footsteps close in. Soon you\u2019re sprinting through the woods, breathless. For a moment you think you\u2019re going to get away...but you feel hands close around your waist. It\u2019s too late now. You try to struggle but there\u2019s no fighting this. You\u2019re dragged away into the woods to be used....\n\nI know this is a little weird but I\u2019m not looking for rp, I\u2019m just looking to chat.

            "selftext": "I think porn in the 90s absolutely ruined a generation of guys by setting the expectation that women should be completely smooth and shaved. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that (at all!) if that's what you prefer. But, I've talked to a few women who have told me something along the lines of, \"my guy won't go down on me if I don't trim or shave.\"\n\nThat makes me really sad, since I really do love a nice, fully, hairy (yummy, sensuous, musky) bush. The more wild and unkempt, the better. Just the warmth and the feeling of hair against my nose and lips. And, knowing that, \"this is a woman, not just a girl.\"\n\nTo take it a step further, I also find hairy armpits on a woman very attractive, in kind of a \"hippie chick\" sort of way. In fact, a few years ago, there was a college girl walking down the side, cute, shortish blonde hair, with a sleeveless shirt, a bag slung over her shoulder, and she clearly didn't shave her armpits.\n\nAnd, I thought, \"OMG, she's absolutely the cutest thing! I totally want to just pick her up and cuddle her!\" That's a swoon right there. :-)\n\nBut, in any case... If you're one of those lovely women who enjoys being natural, send me a PM! I'd love to chat with you, and hear about how you decided to stay natural, what the response from girls/guys have been, and anything else you'd like to talk about.\n\nSome of my other kinks/fantasies include anal, pegging, fisting, toys, object insertion, cum, and watersports to name a few! And I would enjoy hearing about yours! No limits, and no judgement!",

She is the celeb in her photos, she isn't catfishing, she really is a celeb with a filthy mind, and after getting to know you, she wants you to help with her dirty fantasies.\n\nMy favourite celebs include Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Emma Watson, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner, Pokimane and more.

Maybe he expects you to earn money in a place where you barely speak the language. Whatever will you do?\r  \n\r  \n\\- in trouble with the cops.

            "selftext": "Are you tired of searching long and hard to find a role play prompt that fits your particular mood at the moment, only to have to search again as your desires and interests evolve? Are you looking for a partner that is flexible, sexually open minded, and willing to switch gears at any moment? Do you have fantasies and kinks that you feel you can\u2019t share with others but you\u2019re dying to explore with someone? If so, this may be for you. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a partner for chats, realistic role plays, and overall flirty and kinky exploration. The psychological aspect of this is almost as important to me as the physical. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for someone who I can connect with on a personal level. Someone who I know shares similar interests and kinks as me, rather than just some fantastical character. \n\nHere\u2018a one topic to get us started, and some further scenarios that we can also dive in to. \n\nPlease note that this list is a sampling and definitely not all-inclusive of my interests:\n\n- You are my long-term girlfriend or wife who finds herself bored with the day-to-day routine of our relationship. We\u2019ve been together for a long time, mean the world to each other, but the passion has slipped away from our sex life. It\u2019s almost as if we\u2019ve become roommates rather than each other\u2019s lover.\n\nTo bring passion back in to our sex life, we decide to open the door to a weekend of free-use and servitude (free use, rough sex, cum play, others). \n\nThere were aspects of this early on in our relationship but we never truly explored it. By nature, you\u2019ve always tended to be more submissive in the bedroom. This time, however, you want to go all in. We decide that anything goes. Your body is mine for 72 hours, however I want. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s for things we\u2019ve never done before - there literally is almost no boundary that cannot be crossed. Over the course of the weekend, all of the following are explored - facefucking, free use including sleeping, facials, cum play, cum covered fucking, ropes and bondage, rough sex, spanking, public play and much more. Let\u2019s find out all of the depraved things we end up doing to one another during our wild weekend of no limits. \n\nOther topics that we can explore are:\n\n- Siblings that help one another overcome a difficult situation in their lives and find that there\u2019s no better love (incest, psychology, passion, other)\n\n- Co-workers that travel on an out of town business trip together and find themselves tempted by an incessant proposal that can\u2019t be turned down (hot wife, cheating, rough sex, exhibitionism, other)\n\n- A couple where both individuals are switch and explore the dynamics of power exchange (rough sex, pegging, orgasm control, other)\n\nThis could be a short term or a long term situation. Ideally, we\u2019d find many commonalities that would allow for this to evolve in to a long term online \u201cpartnership\u201d and create several different scenarios of our own. \n\nWe\u2019d be, for one another, that person you can turn to when you\u2019re bored. Or horny. Or bored and horny. A person who understands your fetishes and kinks. A person who doesn\u2019t judge you. A person who is willing to push the envelope and discuss topics perhaps of interest but where no experience lies. \n\nI\u2019m very kink friendly and open minded sexually. \n\nA sampling of my kinks: mutual oral, mutual anal (pegging), cum play, rough sex, name calling, facials, cheating, hot wife, cream pies, free use, and more. \n\nAbout me: 35, m, 6\u20193\u201d, former college athlete, brown hair, green eyes. \n\nShoot me a message if you\u2019re interested and let\u2019s chat. \n\nMatt",

Today was home workout day and it was that special time again. Most boys would be super excited to have some fun alone time with their girlfriend but I\u2019m sitting on the couch feeling nervous while you get ready.\n\n\u201cBabe..? Do we have to do another workout today? Please, baby I\u2019m sore from yesterday a-and I can\u2019t hardly sit-\u201c\n\nThe bedroom door opens, and you\u2019re standing in front of me fixing me with a stern look- \u201cShut up.\u201d It\u2019s all you say, and I go quiet. With the waive of your finger I turn around and let you embrace me from behind, your strong buff muscles holding my stomach, your powerful hand firmly around my throat. I squirm in your arms being so small and scrawny compared to you, but you know I absolutely love it. We wrestle for the next hour.. or rather you squeeze me and put me in all number of submission holds while I beg for air and to be let go. All the wedgies and spankings you give me don\u2019t seem necessary, but it makes my dick absolutely throb. You own me, and when we finish I always snuggle and thank you for owning me. It\u2019s what I need even if I say it\u2019s not..\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nHi DPP, I have another Muscle girl, tiny bf prompt. We don\u2019t have to do exactly what\u2019s in the prompt but anything similar. I\u2019m really into hardcore humiliation stuff so anything goes really!\n\n**Kinks**: being overpowered, being choked, facesitting rimming/ass licking (absolutely anything where I\u2019m worshipping your ass will drive me crazy so this is a must), being spanked, being wedgied (another fav), and fingered, pegging, letting me eat your pussy out for hours while you do other things like read/watch TV, letting me fuck you with my chubby cock as a reward for being good, and really anything bully related you can think of.\n\nSome optional stuff- I do like being diapered but that\u2019s not necessary. Also into petplay and being collared. If we do cuck stuff please let me be involved at least afterward c: I\u2019m more partial to cheating than full on denial. Also if you\u2019re possessive and only want me to yourself with no thirds that\u2019s absolutely ok too!",

            "selftext": "Growing up wasn\u2019t much fun when you were the chubby kid, being teased for your weight and looks has a way of either cratering your confidence or the pressure making you shine like a diamond as you prove everyone wrong. Luckily, you were a diamond and you took like any young woman took to Instagram to flaunt it. Your parents freaked out the moment they discovered your post revealing your smooth stomach and not to mention the fact that you weren\u2019t wearing a bra in such a flimsy top; but even their scorn was rich as it meant that even they couldn\u2019t deny the appeal you had. The rush of confidence produced a high that you thought you would never come down from, you had spent the summer of your senior year of high school working out and dieting to become this sexy young woman and it didn\u2019t hurt that you retained some amazing curves that made all the skinny girls jealous. What was rich was all the \u2018likes\u2019 from boys that wouldn\u2019t have given you the time of day, last year. They commented about how hot you were and slid into your DM\u2019s asking for dates. All the new attention was great, but there was one \u2018like\u2019 that made your heart sore as your biggest crush of all time showed his approval for the transformation you undertook.\n\nI\u2019ve always been in your life, your father\u2019s best friend and former business partner. Lately, you haven\u2019t seen much of me; just following my travels through my social media posts and hearing your father complain under his breath about how I was off on another trip or had closed another deal that would have been life changing for your family. It\u2019s not that life was hard, it was just that any success that I had, ate at your father due to the reason we never worked together anymore, we had moved past it but your father sold me his half of the company after finding out that I had an affair with your mother, after you were born. It took a lot to earn back his trust, but the fact that I paid him twice the company\u2019s worth to buy his shares helped. At the time I looked like a fool for throwing money away as a way to apologize for breaking his trust, but at least it bought your family a new home and was going to pay for your college. Though with your father out of the way, I was able to take our company in a new direction and with the tech boom and development of social media; I had made my money back twice over in two years since the company had become mine and the money hadn\u2019t stopped coming since then.\n\nI had always tried to be a positive influence in your life, even at a young age you had proven to be wise beyond your years and took to subjects that most kids wouldn\u2019t touch. Though it caused you to be labeled a \u2018nerd\u2019 and become the butt of jokes growing up, anytime I came around I made sure to lift you up and take an interest in what you were doing. This, of course, led to a crush and in turn helped spur your transformation as while you would never admit it; wanted me to see you as a woman that could be desired and not just have friendly talks with. I even had to admit that your picture was a big surprise when I first saw it, not to mention the fact that you looked just like your mother at that age. I \u2018liked\u2019 it and stored the image in the back of my head where the thought of you began to grow.\n\nYou had seen my latest post about coming back to the states after a trip from Thailand; of course I was one of your favorite follows as you loved to imagine being on my travels with me and being in the photos that I posted; even though you knew I already had a girlfriend barely older than you. What really excited you was that \u2018stateside\u2019 meant I would be home and home meant close to you. You had sent me a message, teasing me and asking about an 18th birthday present that I should be bringing you as it was already two months late. To your surprise I sent a message back, though just a short one that left a lot up to your imagination.\n\nOf course I have a present for you. Though would you like to meet me for dinner tomorrow night. I would love to talk to you about an opportunity involving your future.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t help but be elated, meeting me for dinner in a private invite that didn\u2019t involve your parents. Was this a date? You hadn\u2019t been on a date, but if you were to go on one you wanted it to be with a man like me. Your mind raced as you spent time trying to find out if your parents knew or just what this \u2018opportunity\u2019 could be. The message that I sent came with a link to the restaurant where I had made reservations for us. It was in an upscale part of town, which while your family had some money, you never got to spend a lot of time in. It was where all the real money was at and you felt a bit nervous even getting an invite to such a place. Knowing this is what you wanted, you were going to make sure that you impressed me from the moment you walked in.\n\nYou got dressed in a low cut and baggy sweater, one that used to hide your body but could now be used to show off your cleavage and that hung low enough that you could use it as a dress with a very short skirt. Of course, you wrapped up a bit more so that your parents wouldn\u2019t suspect a thing, in case they caught you sneaking out. The entire drive you had butterflies in your stomach, thinking about what the night might have in store. You pulled up to the restaurant and were greeted before being led to the table where you saw me standing to greet you. My dark grey suit clung to my body and the white button up shirt had the top two buttons undone to expose just a bit of my chest hair underneath. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look amazing?\u201d I say, before giving you a hug and a kiss on the cheek before letting you take your seat across from me, where you find a drink waiting for you.\n\n(Ok, so that\u2019s the base idea, if you like what I have so far. I am looking for a partner that can help build and create in this world. I hope you enjoyed the read and if you message me, I will try to get back to you as soon as I can with a response. Just be aware that I work nights and it\u2019s a 12 hour shift, so it might not be the fastest reply. But I love to roleplay on my days off.)",

            "selftext": "I have a rather niche kink I\u2019ve been aching to play out. It\u2019s a giant fetish, specifically, I\u2019d like to be shrunk and have a guy find me and use me as a sex toy. Obviously this scenario requires a fair amount of suspension of disbelief but I\u2019ve had decent success with it before. Also, as an aside (alliteration!) I\u2019d prefer it if my partners were (or at least played) older, like 40+. \n\nAs for being shrunk, I\u2019ve got a scenario I\u2019ve been brainstorming. Basically, my ex-girlfriend was bitter over our breakup. So, using her powers as a witch she shrinks me and casts a curse on me, meaning that once I\u2019ve shrunk I end up somewhere rather unfortunate for me such as:\n\nEnding up trapped in the dresser drawer of my exgirlfriend\u2019s single dad, tiny and waiting for him to come from work for the day and find me. Only instead of getting me help, he decides to keep me. \n\nOr I end up in the hands of the creepy professor, who had me sit in the first row of his class and was always trying his best to get me to stay late to help him. I always managed to give an excuse but now I was all his. \n\nHell, maybe we go completely fantastical and I fall through a magic portal, landing in a world full of giant men and women. I ended up somewhere humiliating like the floor of an (outhouse if fantasy themed, a bar bathroom if more modern) and you\u2019re the first giant to stumble across me. \n\nOr it could go more humiliating, maybe instead the curse transports me into the flesh light of some horny loser who could never get a real girl. Well, now he has me so that\u2019s no longer an issue. \n\nMaybe I end up in the house of the man I housesit. He was planning on another trip this weekend to try and get back into the dating game, but now has decided to stay in for the night with me for company. \n\nLastly, bit of a rule 34 twist: The spell works in weird ways and instead of shrinking me outright, I\u2019m turned into a living figure from Marvel/DC/Star Wars and trapped in the basement of a nerd who collects them. \n\nIf none of these work for you, or you want to tweak them, send me your own ideas too. The more humiliating place you find your new shrunken toy the better! \n\nAs for my size, I was thinking around 4-6\u201d tall, small enough to smuggle in a pocket (or some place more fun). If this interests you at all send me a message and we can try to work something out.\n\n(ps feel free to take a look at my other prompts if this doesn\u2019t strike your interest)\n\nKinks: Cock worship, watersports, pet play, cum play, massive loads, sweat/musk, humiliation. \n\nLimits: incest, scat, gore.",

            "selftext": "\n\nWe have lived together for more than a year. Since covid my company has me working from home. I spend lots of time just playing around, i decide to clear up space on my computer that we share. As I'm going through the files i find one that's pretty big, when I look at it, find lots of pictures of you. Some your clothed some your naked, some your clothed, some your playing with toys. Then i see the pictures with a user name on reddit. I go look at this and i see you have been posting your nudes and all sorts of things. I type in the email and apparently you had the password saved as it autofilled. I open your account and when i look at your messages i see all this roleplays that you have done, i see the kinky stuff that you always act embarrassed when i suggest it. I find one where the story was about the live in boyfriend flipped the switch in himself and became very dominant, and the GF secretly loved every bit even when he made her cry. You confess to this stranger that you wish your RL would take you and own you, and if that didnt happen, you might have to find the right guy or girl to do that for you. That last part surprised me but i smile as i prowl your messages and see you talked to girls just as slutty and sexily. I copy all the pictures to a flash drive and then i set upon making my plans for the night to change your life...............\r  \n\r  \nIn this we would decide do you want him harsh and making you a slave? or would u like to be taken care of as a sweet little kitty but still used hard? let me know this could go any number of ways. I don't mind playing multiple characters and hope to have a partner that doesn't mind it either. Hope to see ya soon.\r  \n\r  \n\r\nMy kinks are Dom, spanking, cheating, risky, group play (orgy or MFM, and FFM), public, incest, humiliation, degradation, sexual slavery, body mod (Tats and piercings), raceplay in moderation, and many many more. Pretty much if its not in my limits then its probably good, so try me.\r  \n\r  \nLimits: Underage, scat, gore,snuff.",

In front of you is my large, thick and throbbing hard dick which is pointed directly towards you, being held in place by you as your soft hand is gripping onto the base of my cock holding it still.\n\n\"I know, just helping me out right?\" I say in response to you, referring back to the bullshit excuse I went along with after you offered to help get me off as a good friend a few months ago. Ever since then we regularly hang out, you telling your girlfriend it's to play Xbox with me but in reality you've been ending up on your knees every time.\n\nWithout even needing any encouragement these days I smile at you whilst watching you lean forward slightly and very slowly twirl your soft pink tongue around my large and bulbous cock head, leaving a wet trail of saliva from your tongue all over it as you treat my dick like a giant lollypop. My entire cock throbs in response to the feeling of your tongue against it too, causing it to twitch inside your grasp. \"Taste good?\" I ask you, a question you hated answering at the beginning since you thought it sounded gay to answer, these days you always end up nodding your head enthusiastically to it.\n\n---\n\nHey DPP, feel free to either jump in and continue on where I left it or shoot me a message and we can discuss details further if you prefer. I have a preference for more feminine/girly partners to, so please keep that in mind too.\n\nAll that I ask is you write the same amount of length/detail and use PMs, I don't use reddit chat at all. Character description or Kinks/Limits will get my attention.\n\n**Kinks** - Anal, Facials, Long drawn out blowjobs, teasing, hot dogging, grinding, sexuality questioning, edging, size comparison, sex toys, creampies, rimming, social media, incest, age gaps, assplay, cumplay, feminization, sissies, fembois, traps, twinks.\n\n**Limits** - BDSM, Bondage, rape, scat, vomit, animals.",

And thank you!) If you're reading this post right now, you're someone who should take the survey! We want to hear from you, whether you've been here for 1 week, 5 months, or 10 years. We want to hear from you if you lurk, if you only respond and never interact publically with the sub. We would love to hear from as many people as possible! \n\nThis year's survey is about 60, mostly single-answer, questions; depending on your responses you may not see every question, as some might not apply to you. It probably won't take you more than 5-10 minutes to fill out. However there are also a few free-form response questions if you want to share your thoughts with us in full. :) \n\nThere is more info in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/r55yno/mod_please_take_our_user_survey/) if you're curious about the whys and the wherefores. **Any questions or comments about the survey should be directed to that post, not this one.** \n\n*This is a scheduled post. It will sail across the New feed about once or twice a day until the survey is closed.*",

He pinches my nipples and makes me tell him how good we look together.

            "selftext": "Back in high school, I was always the good, quiet Asian girl, excelling in my classes, hanging out with my shy, nerdy friends, and never dating or even imagining that anyone would ever be interested in asking me out. I didn't even go to my prom because no one asked me, and I was too embarrassed by the idea of showing up without a date.\n\nThat all changed when I got to college and met you, though. You were pretty crude the first time you propositioned me, telling me how much you liked Asian girls, and I was both offended and intrigued by your shameless confidence. I said no, and you accepted that, but a few weeks later you came back and asked me out properly, which I accepted.\n\nOn our second date I accepted your invitation to spent the night with you, and you were so sweet and gentle as you took my virginity, holding me and stroking my hair as I clung to you afterwards, my emotions a mess of delight, shame, and confusion.\n\nAfter that, our relationship got a lot more intense. One time you slapped me on the ass while we were on our way to bed, and the way my whole body reacted told you instantly that I'd love being treated a bit rougher. We started to experiment, and you discovered how much I love being spanked, scolded, taking your cum on my face, and especially my fetish for being talked down to for being Asian now that I knew I could trust you and that you weren't *just* fetishizing me for my race.\n\nWe've been together for a year now, and it's almost Christmas. My family don't celebrate it, so we're talking about spending the holiday with your family, which is terrifying- you're my first boyfriend, and now I might be meeting your parents! I just hope they like me...\n\n***\n\nIf this scene appeals to you, send me a DM, but no chats please! It's very important to me that this scene be a romance first and kinky second, so if you're not interested in the romantic angle, this won't be for you!",

I want the tension of two recently single adults who've spent the better part of their lives alongside each other, and when they're confronted with another situation where they're left to fend for themselves, a relationship blossoms. \n\nWould you like some cheating to happen before they become partners? Sure thing.\nDo you love incest? Why not a brother and sister pair.\nAre we stuck in a raging storm and find no better use for our time than getting drunk and talking about the silly prospect of love?\nDo we share a dorm at the college we go to together, and one night we return from a party desperate for some cuddling and affection?\nDid one of us recently go through trauma that requires a mental massage best provided by the gentle hands of none other than our best friend? \n\nWhile this idea can be fleshed out in multiple different paths, a simmering romance tale is nothing without some good sex.\n**As for kinks,** my absolute favorites are gentle D/s, DD/lg, petplay, aftercare, romance, clothed sex and exhibitionism. I do have many more I enjoy but we can discuss the intricacies over PMs.\n**For limits:** underage, blood/gore, noncon and degradation come to mind. \n\nThis is also an RP which strikes a personal note, so if you'd simply like to chat about that, I'm your guy.\nI cannot wait to hear from you, but please contact me over messages rather than chat.\nHave a great day/night everyone, and thanks for reading!",

Rather than the usual \u201clet\u2019s do such and such scene\u201d in which I\u2019m this character you\u2019re that and we are using text to describe our actions. In this Roleplay we will each be playing a character yes but these character will be using whatever app we use be it Redditor whatever else. so we are not describing actions we are roleplaying having this conversation on whatever app!\n\nNow I\u2019m kinda open on what that is but I do have a scenario in mind {see below} in character intros preferred but feel free to start ooc and if you ever need to say anything out of character do so {in squiggly brackets}\n\nNow I\u2019m fine to just include text, use real images of us use real photos that we find or even drawn stuff.\nI personally have no major limits for the Rp part but if you want actual pictures of me doing certain things I do.\n\nSo the concept I want to try is this\nYou are a bully in your school/college whatever, one of the most popular kids who gets whatever he wants. One day one of your regular victims gives you this kik/Reddit and tells you it\u2019s someone who wants to teach you a lesson, possibly their father/older brother up to you if you want to know that. However they won\u2019t be teaching you any lessons you\u2019ll be teaching them to submit to a real man~\nThis can include trading; just sexting text stuff really open on it just throw me a message here. hope to see you boys soon",

I\u2019m into anyone that can tickle and tease or even torture my kinks to make me (and them) moan.  I love the fantasy of living with an older woman or sadistic couple who secretly change me into a live-in fucktoy. Dressing me, decorating me, piercing me and tying me and making me beg and moan then I\u2019d have to go to my \u201cnormal\u201d job the next day pretending that I\u2019m that same boring person they\u2019ve come to know.\n\nThis is something that while I haven\u2019t specifically lived out, I have been in a Domme/sub relationship and am looking to further my kinky exploration of the lifestyle.\n\nWhat I\u2019m seeking is a woman who has a desire for a sub like me to either talk or role play the idea of me either living in her house and having to submit to your every desire no matter how intense, and then hide in my ordinary life, or perhaps some variation there of.\n\nI do have a kink list here:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ahBPSSR.png\n\nI\u2019m open to discussing the aspects we each desire for this. You don\u2019t have to be significantly older, but I do prefer either mentally or experiential maturity.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested or feel that you may have a direction you\u2019d like to play out with a kink loving but secret submissive please reach out!",

Unfortunately, you\u2019ve fallen on the wrong side of that particular statement, as you wake up to a splitting headache and an aching body. \n\nThe note delicately written out on the sheet in front of you explains the situation well. You\u2019ve been\u2026 \u201cimplanted\u201d is the word *they* use, although there\u2019s little inkling of who *they* are. Complicated technology capable of curing uncountable diseases and bettering the human race has been put to a better use in your head, where they will provide live footage to *them*, let them to contact you non verbally, and allow them to suitable chastise you for falling out of line. The goal? To complete the \u201cSlut Games\u201d, a unique challenge in which you will be provided with tasks and requests to fill out on behalf of your well paying audience. Succeed, and you will earn points towards your eventual freedom. Fail, and you\u2019ll be given \u201cpenalty tasks\u201d which cannot be avoided, to ensure you behave next time around.\n\nBut hey, you can get anything if you pay enough. Want your old life back?\n\nLet\u2019s see if you can handle the costs!\n\nI\u2019d love to play out this story in more of a corrupted life style, focusing more on how this challenge would affect your characters normal routine than anything else. I\u2019m imagining a world in which your character, who for this example is a loving housewife (although that can be changed), will try her best to keep her life on track, caring for her husband, children and job despite the constant challenges thrown her way. From parent teacher interviews to trips to the mall, things are going to get a lot more enjoyable, for her viewers at least\u2026\n\nKink wise I\u2019m down to go as dark as you\u2019d like, focusing heavily on cheating, control and consequences. I\u2019m playing this out under the assumption there will be very really and heavy results for your characters actions, and your job is to minimize the damage, as completely avoiding it is nigh impossible. In particular I\u2019d love to cause conflict and internal angst, be it by driving wedges between yourself and your loved ones through your actions, by causing you to betray morals and vows, or by doing things that have long term consequences, like tattoos.\n\nFor the men I imagine you being made to pursue, I doubt they\u2019ll be the cream of society. Bullies, thugs and assholes, the type you\u2019d never touch before. If you have any particular kinks or scenarios you want to add feel free to ask, I don\u2019t judge! Just make sure to tell me what your favourite ice cream flavour is so I know you\u2019ve read this far!",

Up for chatting and learning a bit about one another, as well as developing/brainstorming different scenarios. All but willing to bring plenty of banter back and more if we connect. Some of my kinks include interracial(duh), rough and/or forced sex, oral, throatfucking, public, facials, free use, exhibitionism, bdsm elements, blackmail, costumes/lingerie, ripped clothes, non/dub-con etc. I want to explore aspects of interracial as well as hear your thoughts and feeling and use that to create something real. A RP that takes little bits of pieces of kinks, fantasies, fears and uses them as fuel to further accentuate the words we write, delving deeper and deeper and deeper...well you get the point.**\n\n---\n\n\n\n* Parents never approved? Are they lowkey or high key racist? Potential to remove you from the will if they caught you professing your love for black cock while being pounded from behind? The underlying reason you're all but willing to make your black book literal? Well lucky for you I can play that vindictive side.\n\n\n* Curiosity got you checking out blacked porn because your bestie won't shut up about her first black cock? Well hey, you aren't the first one and you won't be the last!\n\n\n* Already got your spade tattoo or just joined the black world order to serve, and offer up all your hot friends to the almighty BBC? A spokesperson of \"once you go black..\"? Well I could always use a maid to clean up my messes.\n\n\n* Your city suffering from a lack of BBC? Call me the milkman because I always deliver.\n\n\n* Someone ate all the chocolate from your Neapolitan ice cream and you have an oral fixation? Put me in coach! \n\n\n* Black guys scare the shit out of you but that's why you like them?   Well shit, I can not smile while I respond back to your messages if you like. \n\n\n* Doing a project and can't find your ruler? You could have just asked me, I'm easy to use. Easily accessible and a variety of ways to put me at the right length.\n\n\n* Got a type? Need that dominant, masculine, rough stud to make you wonder why you're smiling so much when your pussy is sore from letting him have his way while you have to gingerly walk around your workplace? Or maybe you're having reoccurring dreams of a thug and his gang taking liberties with your body. Trying to find out why that hood dick hit different? Well why didn't you say so, I'll get my durag even though I'm just using it to get waves!\n\n\n* Don't want to be stuck sucking small dick ~~this summer~~ forever ? Ready to lose that gag reflex? Need a cock bigger than your future? Just sign here and here.\n\n* One of those girls that wears black all the time? I think at this point you may as well have it in you so that you're completely matching.\n\n* Need your friendly neighborhood black man to give you your free weekly facial? I offer myself as the sacrifice to be on neighborhood watch.\n\n* Cuffing szn? Give me...one second..ahh there we go, you're officially in a relationship with my bed. I'll see you when I get back. Oh you didn't know? This is what they meant by working from home.\n\n* Ancient historians and symbologists claim that the female equivalent to the classic male request \u201csit on my face\u201d is \u201cshove that black cock down my throat.\u201d What, you don\u2019t believe me? Fine, fine let\u2019s try it and then you can tell me after if you agree. \n\n* Need that big cock revenge selfie to show that you're over them but really need a coc- I mean shoulder to cry on? I'm here for you and can provide you the cock filter you need. We can go through as many takes as you want until we get it just perfect!\n\n\n\n---\n**Have other prompts I'd love to play and can link if you want to see them. Always down for chatting or late night conversation and seeing where it takes us, thanks.**",

Despite how bad she treats him, he tries not to do anything that will upset her. Ever. Your character is one of her best friends, but even you notice how she treats her boyfriend. You and my character bump into each other at the mall while shopping for Christmas gifts. We decide to stick together and help each other look, all while realizing we have a lot in common. There is a lot of unspoken tension between us and our brief friendship is desperate to grow into something more. \n\n2. FAMOUS CELEBRITY X WANNABE ACTOR. My character is studying acting in some classes and auditioning on the daily, while yours has a career that has already taken off and is getting bigger and bigger every day. We meet at one of your movie premieres, where my character awkwardly introduces himself. Despite how well we get along, your character feels torn due to the fact that I am sort of a fan. You\u2019re unsure how kindly your publicists would react to our relationship.\n\n-\n\nI\u2019m in the mood for a more story driven plot tonight. Something that\u2019s equally wholesome as it is dramatic, with characters who are lots of fun to write and explore. \n\nWhich prompt do you find most exciting? Do you have other ideas either for one of these plots or something else entirely? Send me a chat or a DM and let\u2019s discuss!",

            "selftext": "Hi there, ladies and enbies of DPP, its ya girl Sarah back again with another prompt!  \nSome basic housekeeping/info first before we get to the prompt itself:  \nI am a college student at a large university in a large city in the midwestern US. My timezone is CST (GMT-5), and I roleplay sporadically (i.e. there may be one or two days where I have lots of free time and reply back and forth several times in a day, there may be a span off several days when I am unable/uninterested in RPing, but my general average is around 1 or 2 decent replies per day) this is about what you should expect, and likewise this RP should be relatively long-term.\n\n  \nThis was originally written for FutaRP and so with a futanari partner in mind opposite me (because breeding/impregnation kink/having a baby \"the old fashioned way\" is super hot for me, but totally not a deal breaker), but dont feell like you have an obligation to play that kind of character, either.  I am 100% happy to play opposite another ciswoman (as long as you top and enjoy strapon play)\n\n  \n**Send me PMs, not chats. I do not RP on any platform other than Reddit PMs**. I'm a lesbian, so I'm only interested in women and femme-presenting enbies. If you're a guy, go ahead and shoot your shot I guess, but don't tell me and try your best to pretend to be a girl, it makes me more comfortable. I know most of you will probably eventually make it clear you're dudes in one way or another but if you don't act like a dickhead and do a passable job of pretending/convincing me you're not a man, I probably won't have an issue.  \nI'm not asking for novels, but I am asking for full, multi-line responses in proper, understandable english. I'm not an English teacher, but English is not my second language, so a bunch of weird spellings and incorrect use of the language confuses me and makes it hard for me to communicate. Please respect that (and honestly, if I can do it, you who speak English as your first and potentially only language, can do it too).  \nWhat I am looking for out of this RP/in a partner:  \n**Fluff:** I'm looking for some sickly-sweet, rot-your-teeth-out from the inside lovey-dovey fluff. Kissing, cuddling, holding hands, supportive words/texts/etc. Our characters will already be well in an already well-established romantic relationship, already have told each other \"i love you\", all that shit.  \n**Romance:** pretty self-explanatory, but so many people bitch and moan and \"why haven't we fucked yet\". I definitely want this to have a heavy level of kink, etc but I do not feel comfortable having the kind of dirty, kinky, rough, pornographic type of sex I generally enjoy with people I am not in love with/who is not in love with me/etc. Even in RP. So I want this RP to focus heavily on the romance side of things: going out on dates, holding hands, kissing, hugging, etc.  \n**Slice-of-Life:** Again, pretty straight forward. It doesn't have to be anything fancy or crazy, just us like...living our lives. Maybe planning a wedding or something. Going out to bars/restaurants, hanging out with our friends and family, maybe some low-level external conflict via contact with some less-than-stellar people who make an issue about us being a same-sex couple or something, but overall mostly happy and without too much drama\n\n**Family:** I also like to incorporate other characters, usually family (and also friends) in these RPs as they're a great way to add drama, spice up the plot, or really just have some fun, cutesy fluffy scenes where everyone is together and nice and loves each other and all that. \n\nAnyway, now, onto the prompts! I will try to make the ideas engaging, but relatively short in order to make this not be novel-length. I will, however, provide some links where relevant to see my writing style/a more flushed out story prompt/etc. Now, TO THE PROMPT MOBILE! (1960's-era batman music plays in the background) \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**No Reservations**\n\nOriginal prompt can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/nktuds/f4futa_no_reservations_longterm_romance_plotheavy/). Basically, the idea is that I'm a hot-shot young chef on the scene in (whatever city we decide) with a brand new restaurant that is one of the hottest out there. I'm also brown and gay. You are one of my employees (a waitress or bartender, most likely) and also, secretly, my girlfriend and the love of my life. In this RP we'd focus on our relationship and how to \"out\" ourselves/our relationship at work whilst avoiding the ethical pitfalls so that: 1. i can keep my restaurant, 2. you can keep your job, and 3. we can be openly together. This would probably also have some family drama/stuff. \n\n**I'm in Lesbians with You/Best Friends**\n\nOriginal prompt can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/q0o7a5/f4ffu_im_in_lesbians_with_you_longterm_fluffy/https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/q0o7a5/f4ffu_im_in_lesbians_with_you_longterm_fluffy/). Basically, the idea with this one is pretty simple, and I think pretty lovely and sweet. We're best friends and have been for most of our lives. We grew up a few houses down from each other and were in the same classes for most of our school careers. We stayed friends and close all the way through college. During your year abroad,, we started to grow apart, and I got depressed and one day, after drinking too much, I FaceTimed you and drunkenly admitted my feelings to you, and the rest, as they say, is history. You proposed to me a few days ago, and now our families and friends are coming over for a nice (holiday?) dinner at our place, where we can tell them the good news and finally make it official \n\n**Rachel Arazi has Two Mommies** \n\nThis one doesn't have a previous prompt. Its based loosely off a (cishet) fanfic of a show I like I read a while ago. Basically the premise is that I am a strong, single, independent woman and I don't \\*need\\* a partner. I'm not wealthy or anything but I'm lucky enough to make due with the best I can. Especially because I have my family to help. I also have a very smart and rambunctious daughter (the source of her existence can be discussed in PM) and no one to share the joys (and problems/work/sorrows) of parenthood with. For some reason, I have to come up with a fake-serious-girlfriend for some family and/or work event and...essentially, long story short is your character will be my daughter's day care teacher who is fun,, and around the same age as me, and we get on well enough (maybe not a \"friend\" as such given how little we interact, but you get the idea) and one thing leads to another and she comes to the event as my \"(fake) girlfriend/fiancee\" but it becomes really real, really quickly and...of course there will be plenty of kinky sex and all that and plenty of romance, but I also want this one to have a bit of a family vibe too it, focusing a bit on my daughter getting a new second mommy, ya know? I thought it could be fun and cute if done properly. \n\n**The Start of Something Wonderful**\n\nOriginal post can he found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ovaph0/fff4fu_the_start_of_something_wonderful_fluffy/). TL;DR: I meet a cute girl who is into girls outside my building, we start dating, and now she's asked me to marry her. I'm looking for something essentially slice of life, as we go through our day(s) and play out the little real-world things. I imagine there to of course be some levels of drama (otherwise, where is the story) but relatively minor and manageable, and never internal to our characters' relationship, always external. Very \"Us vs The World\" sort of thing. I have lots and lots of ideas of what these could be, and they may vary depending on the scenario, but I'd happy to discuss your ideas for those (and any/everything else related to these) in PMs before we start.\n\n**Mail Order Bride**\n\nA play on the \"mail order bride\" concept, except in this one the idea I have is that instead of like, a regular mail order bride/matchmaking type service, we meet on a completely unrelated, non-sexual part of the internet. Like some kind of nerdy message board or something, and we become very fast friends. Before we know it we're practically bonded at the DM/hip, and before we know it we're basically essentially girlfriends-without-the-title without evven really realising it, and then one day...poof, here i come to you as a \"mail order bride\" sort of thing, I guess. I know its not super fleshed out or detailed, but that's what I got. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, if you like anything you see here and want to maybe chat and see about playing out one of these, let me know :) Send me an orange envelope and I'm sure we'll be able to figure out something super fun for both of us. Looking forward to hearing from you :3",

            "selftext": "I know she's a size queen, so I thought I had everything she wanted naturally. Sure, having a fat eight inches was great until she found that guy with nine inches...\n\nSo, we talked, like a couple should. Turns out he wasn't the only one she'd slept with while we'd been dating. There were several that had cocks either longer or thicker than mine. (It didn't even occur to me at the time that there were likely many others who were similar sizes that didn't get mentioned.)\n\nSo... after our talk, I got my first pump. With it, I could get some pretty significant gains, but there were only temporary. We had fun, but I knew she wasn't satisfied.\n\nSoon, I got my first permanent enhancement. A little more length and a lot more girth. She was satisfied for a bit, but it still took a lot to make her cum. It wasn't long before I got my second enhancement for just a little more.\n\nStill, the following week I caught her with her ten inch friend and she confessed he wasn't the biggest. I was heartbroken. Even though I was just about as big as these guys, but she still cheated. Sure those guys had huge muscles and probably way more stamina --but she was *my* gf! That counts for something right?\n\nThat's when I started taking pills. Cialis in the morning, Viagra at night. I was huge and slowly stretching bigger.\n\nSure, I got headaches and was painfully hard for way too long, but we were having sex again and a lot of it.\n\nSlowly, it tapered off again. I didn't even talk to her this time, just went straight for another enhancement....\n\n\n------\n\n....so who are you? My gf? the guys she fucks? a friend of mine who's concerned or maybe wants to comfort me?\n\nI'm curious to play a scenario where I end up with some huge, enhanced cock on my slim frame. Despite my massive endowment, my gf keeps finding reasons to cheat on me. Hell, maybe I've over done it and I get doomed to a life of being *too* big while watching my gf get fucked by large but comparatively reasonably sized cocks.\n\nI love size play, big dicks (and boobs, and butts), cheating, whatever this weird reverse cuckold situation is, and more. I'm game for expansion themes, but nothing extreme. Drug play, voyeurism, and dub con are on the table too. Just no gore, bathroom, or underage.",

            "selftext": "When the Leash Laws passed and women became property, all adult women were given to the eldest man in their household. Most of the time, this was husbands and fathers. Sometimes, it was landlords, or roommates. If a woman owned her home and lived without a man, she would be sent to her father or another family member - failing that, she'd be seized by the government.\n\nYour mothers assumed they'd be taken away, put in some public service program, or sent to the pound to eventually be put down. But what they didn't realize is that their son, the gross, unemployed loser taking his third gap year in a row, is an eligible owner.\n\nSome may think this is a better fate than being dehumanized and forgotten by the government, but those people who say that have never met you. An avid consumer of absolutely disgusting porn, you now has the full power to play out all of you darkest fantasies. And you're basically set for life, now, with the pensions from the government for losing your providers. So their life looks like a 24/7 rapefest.\n\nAlso: your sister, maybe?\n\nKinks for this include mindbreak, drugs, puke/piss/scat/smegma/other gross stuff, nosehooks, heels, pigplay, porn addiction, orgasm control, age gaps, rimming, facefucking, degradation, incest, rape, huge cocks and loads, extreme pain and bondage, mutilation, snuff, misogyny, gore, bestiality, body mods, and pretty much anything else you can think of!",

Getting the rather cumbersome uniform that i'd be expected to wear at all times.\n\nThe first was to be expected, a maid uniform in a classical style, long sleeves, a dress of nearly ankle length, head dress and an apron reaching from the shoulders to nearly the hem of the dress. Including white tights and black mary-janes with a slight raised heel.\n\nHowever what was more were the 'accesories' that the estate also expected to be worn at all times. Starting with a metal collar with a nametag stating your place of employment, two small electrodes on the inside ready to delivery swift punishment at a moment's notice to add on to the threats of corporal punishment for higher infractions.\n\nA chastity belt worn at all times, securely locked and worn even during off periods without exception.\n\nAnd finally, to prevent running and forcing the made to take her time and walk slowly, with the added benefit of every step notifying the people in the house of her position, ankle cuffs around her legs to hobble her steps, even in the heels.\n\nAre you a lord or a lady of an estate that would require such a uniform?\n\nLooking for more of a chat than any sort of roleplay with this one.",

            "selftext": "***18+ Roles and partners only.***\r  \n\r  \nHello there, I'm going to try my best to be concise and keep on point, but if I end up rambling a little just know it's out of a strong passion and desire for this sort of scene.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nI love, LOVE the effect big cocks have on some women, it's such a primal thing at the core, yet there are so many layers which make it so enticing to fantasise over. It's so ingrained within our psychology that we can barely explain to ourselves why it's so arousing, yet the sight of a gigantic fat throbbing slab of manhood is enough to captivate and cause women around the world to do things they would never normally even consider doing. Even if you yourself have never been in such a position I'm sure you've known of others who have or might've read stories about such things. Loving loyal wives and girlfriends, strong independent career focused or young na\u00efve good girls, you don't need to be a slut or size queen for such desires to invoke powerful feelings of lust inside of you. Have you ever seen an image, gif or porn clip that revealed a dick so massive and monstrous that it defied all reason? to see women struggle to even wrap their hands or lips around its majestic girth, to watch it slide so deep that it bottoms out with more inches still to give? to stretch holes so wide it would surely be uncomfortable yet the women taking it portray expressions of abnormal bliss? unfathomable sounds, moans/groans and screams of uncontrollable levels, bodies writhing and spasming, twitching from the slightest movement. Able to force orgasms so effortlessly and consistently it'll make any women succumb.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nI want to play a scene that isn't just about the how and why we're having sex but the effects a huge cock can have on the body and daily life of a women, my goal isn't simply to fuck you but to thoroughly break you In mind and body. There's nothing hotter to me than seeing a good wife so entranced by such strong feelings of pleasure and desire that she becomes the opposite, late to pick her kids up from school just so she could get pounded raw in the backseat of another mans car. The strong independent needs no man career women, dropping to her knees at the snap of fingers and blowing his cock like it's her sole desire. The once na\u00efve good girl cheating on her high school romance to experience sex that'll make her eyes roll back and drool. The self proclaimed slut who talked big, biting off more than she can chew and getting put in her place begging and screaming helplessly how this monster is too much for her to handle. I don't care who you are, how we met, or why we're doing this, only that I get to force your descent into mindless lust and ecstasy. This can be about an Asian getting her first BWC or white girl's first BBC or it could be about actual monsters, demons or aliens. I expect this to be short term at first with the potential to be long term if we click well, We could start with you already succumbing to this powerful piece of meat only to go back and explain how we got there or we could start at the very beginning though I don't want to spend 10+ paragraphs on the build up, hence the framing this as short term until we know we wanna flesh it out more and keep playing together. I also have a strong preference for Dub-con, I want this to be an encounter of desire, a \"I shouldn't but...\" sort of reluctance, the kind of cock that'll make you take the day off work just to get railed by it, that'll make you lie to your husband or partner, that'll push your friends and family aside just to grovel on your knees while it's girth is slapping and throbbing against your face. I want to humiliate and dominate you until you can't escape. Hit me up in DM's and let's figure out the how's and whys or we can even just chat.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nKinks: Massive cocks (I usually prefer realistically extreme sizes, like 12 inches max but we can go a bit beyond that if you wish to really play up what a monster it is) Cock worship, rough/hardcore/degrading sex with things like slapping, choking, hair pulling, name calling, spitting, being man handled etc as some obvious ones. Double/triple penetration, gang bangs, pet play, dub-con(Big plus if we can make it dubious, I'm not against non-con I just find it way hotter when it's more reluctant but not full on struggling.) bestiality, mind break, Raceplay Breeding/impregnation (Though not into the idea of playing out actual pregnancy and such.) plenty others I might've failed to list.\r  \n\r  \nLimits: Blood/gore, bathroom and watersport stuff.",

            "selftext": "\n\nHey everyone.  I\u2019m back with another prompt that I\u2019ve reworked from the ground up because I always seem to find the amazing prompts days after the person has found their partner and isn\u2019t looking for more.  I\u2019d like to write a story with someone that focuses on an unusual romantic pairing.  Well, the pairing isn\u2019t unusual.  It\u2019s the romance that\u2019s unexpected.  It would be in our modern world, with a subtle fantasy kick.  \n\nThat kick would be you.  There aren\u2019t elves or orcs or anything else running around (Not that anyone knows about at least.) but there is at least one succubus.  That succubus would be you.  You\u2019d have your own set of powers that we could discuss. (I have some suggestions.)  That being said; I don\u2019t want you to be all powerful.  There will be certain things you can do and certain things you can\u2019t.  \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about characters.  Literally any of this is up for discussion, especially your character.  I would be a  man who thinks he is happy with his life, but really he's just stagnant. You would in turn play a succubus who believes she has seen all there is to humanity. She's a bit jaded and on the hunt, but something about the man she finds is different. \n\nOf course, I would be the normal human in our relationship. My name would be Adam and I'd be fairly normal in almost every way. I'm generally good-natured, but I don't really buy into the spiritual or supernatural world. Having never seen any proof of their existence, I just labeled them as fairy tail and superstition. I knew a few people in college who were into it, but it just seemed like a way to pass the time instead of actual belief. \n\nI'm writing this next part as my character looking back to the beginning of our relationship. Maybe it's a special day for us and I'm trying to piece together how this all started.\n\n---\n\nI was single then, and honestly, I thought I was happy. I had a decent 9 to 5 job, a decent apartment with a short commute, and I had a small group of close friends that I enjoyed spending time with. I'd had a couple of rocky relationships and a couple of good ones that just didn't stand the test of time. My life wasn't perfect, but it was good. I really thought that was all I ever wanted.\n\nIt turns out that's not what happiness is. That's being content. That's refusing to ask for more out of fear that what you already have will be lost. It's the path to a slow death in mediocrity. But there was something else inside me. Something that was screaming out for more. A part of me that had been forced deep down in myself and it was begging for excitement; begging for the unusual and extraordinary to happen. I just didn't take the time to hear it. \n\n(From here on I'm going to be describing your character a bit, but if you think you would have acted differently, or you would like your appearance to be different, feel free to change it up. We're going to be working together after all.) \n\nI wouldn't hear that voice, but you would. You've wandered this earth for hundreds of years, taking your fill and moving on. You moved from life to life, never being the same person for more than 5 years or so. You'd had lovers, you'd had men who would fight and even die for you. There were men who would leave their spouses and all they had gained in their lives for the chance at one more night with you. You've even had a handful of women confess their sapphic desires in times where such things would be less than acceptable. Looking back, I'm sure there are even a few people who spent their final years cursing you and lusting for you at the same time. \n\nYou've seen this world and its people. You knew who we were. You knew how to twist us and mold us for your pleasure. You knew everything about us pitiful humans. You once told me that even you were surprised at what happened next. \n\nWe met at a street corner. It was 8:35 and I was holding a paper cup of coffee waiting for the street crossing. I wasn't sure why the coffee seemed important, but I still remember the way it tasted that morning. I can almost feel that cup in my hand. You walked up beside me. Not unexpected. There were 8 other people also waiting for the crosswalk. I think I smelled you before I saw you. Citrus with a smooth hint of vanilla to balance it. It brought me out of my morning funk way quicker than the coffee would have. \nWhen I looked to my left I saw you for the first time. You had Raven black hair that fell straight down to the small of your back. It contrasted well with your pale skin. I think I smiled when I noticed your cheeks and button nose were rose-red; flushed from the cold. You wore a light coat that covered your features but still showed that there was something inside, waiting to be found by those brave enough. \n\nAs I stared, I felt someone bump into me from behind. The crosswalk had turned green, but I was too distracted to notice. As I stumbled forward, I dropped my coffee and that's the first time I heard that sweet and terrible laugh of yours. You knew I was staring. You had heard the voice inside me screaming. You were going to bring it to the surface. \n\nI tried to wipe the spilled coffee off my pants when I turned to find that you were still standing at the crosswalk. Everyone else had moved on with their day, but you stood in the same place with a gentle smirk on your lips. I stood there embarrassed at both my staring and at making a fool of myself. You introduced yourself and offered to replace my coffee. \n\nI didn't know that I was walking right into your trap. You didn't know that I was going to be your last conquest. \n\n---\n\nIf any of this tingled at your creative (or any other) juices, let me know.  I\u2019ll be happy to discuss all this and we can get a story started. Please let me know your kinks, limits and anything else you'd like to see happen or change about what I have here.",

If its still up, I'm still interested, and you can feel free to message me about it\n\n************************\n\nWe finally did it.  We fucked up the planet so bad that it will be uninhabitable for our kids.  We have maybe 30 years left before humanity as we know it will become extinct.\n\nThat is... until *SCIENCE* stepped in, and this time, a few of the world's leaders listened to them.\n\nAll of the world's governments began pooling resources and gathering volunteers--volunteers in their sexual prime and capable of repopulating the Earth.  None of the volunteers knew exactly what they were signing up for, however.\n\nThe main goal of the project was to genetically engineer a new species of man that would be capable of surviving outside the lab.  Once a specific specimen was chosen, more would be created.  Those people would then be set the task of repopulating the Earth.\n\nWho says the science and the Bible can't get along?\n\nThe experiments themselves have met with varying degrees of success. \n Some, like the green-skinned brunette called Subject 27, has chlorophyll in her skin so that she can survive on sunlight.  It apparently feels so good, the scientists can't get her to keep her clothes on.  Subject 13 was a big, hulking brute of a man, designed to survive in the harshest conditions and impregnate as many women as possible.  Unfortunately his balls are so swollen after a few hours of no sexual activity that he can barely walk.  Subject 42 is a dainty little woman who survives on sexual fluids for nourishment, but she's so ravenous she kept attacking the scientists--and the data suggests she would be incapable of procreating just because she would always swallow the cum.  Subjects 60-69 were libido experiments, men and women alike, and now they are like animals in heat, constantly masturbating or pouncing on anything that moves.\n\nThere are 250 test subjects in the first wave, with another 750 soon to follow in waves of 250 each.\n\nWill humanity find the key to its survival?  Or, will scientists just create a bunch of genetically modified sexual freaks?\n\n*************************\n\n**Limits:** Nothing underaged, no animals, no biological incest, no gore, and no bathroom stuff.",

I want all of your delicious fluids. Same with shit. I also love the idea of is going in our clothes, or going where we shouldn't. The idea of me drenched in your juices...\n\nArmpits: I find them very arousing. Especially if they're hairy and/or sweaty. I want to taste all of you.\n\nBody hair: I love a hairy girl! The more hair, the better! Ass, bush, armpits, legs... I love it all.\n\nSmell/stink: Tying back to the others, I love the pungent smell of a filthy women. Week worn dirty panties, cunt reeking of piss and cum, sweaty ass... I crave it.\n\nFinally, diving into Taboo roleplay of incest or beastiality is the cherry on top. This is just an example. I love anything creative or strange. I'd prefer",
