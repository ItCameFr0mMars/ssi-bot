            "selftext": "His large hand gripped the root of her hair as he pulled it back, the raw power of his body thrusting against her slender frame as his hand pulled her hair back was a sight of pure ecstasy. Her moans fill the room as the sounds of their body rigorously thrusting together creating a soundtrack of her desires and his. His fat cock split her tight pussy apart as it slips inside her over and over again, the look on her face was clearly painted in orgasms as she looses count the amount of times she came on his cock tonight.\n\n\"That's it slut! Take daddy's big fat cock! You are such a whore for daddy's cock aren't you!\" His words groan loudly in her ear as his large hand spanks her ass hard leaving a red imprint \"AHHHH! YEsss yess yess fuck fuckkk yess daddy yesssss!\" Her moans coincided with another orgasm that rips through her body. \"That's it slut! Cum on my married cock!\" He groans as he does not stop fucking her. Her mind goes numb as another orgasm builds inside her as a man more than twice her age fucks her like a slut.\n\n\"That's it slide your pussy on my cock like a good cocksleeve, fuck yourself on my cock, impale your tight holes like the desperate whore you are, earn that orgasm\" his words groan as he controls her with a makeshift leash of his belt wrapped around her neck pulling it back controlling her pace, make her fuck herself on his cock.\n\nThose are like a small scenes of what could entail. The use of the word \"daddy\" is not mandatory, I merely added for the whole \"girls with daddy issues\" trope so no worries if you wish to not include it. I would however like your character to be very hung, married, and in his mid 40s and above while my character would be between 21-25, age gap is mandatory.\n\nPossible scenes:\n\nTinder - This is rather basic but still has its charms. Basically tinder swipe scenario and we meet up etc. Tell me what in your profile draws you to me, tell me what in my profile draws me to you.\n\nWaitress - You and your wife are out on a date night, I am your server for the night. So how did it end up with me blowing you in the bathroom while you wife waited for desert.\n\nYour Boss's daughter - This would not be a revenge thing for my character's father being a \"bad boss\" this is merely something that you find hot, fucking your boss's daughter. What better way to fuck with him than to use his daughter like a cheap whore.\n\nThe spy - Think of the type of woman who would most likely be a spy, someone from a broken home with no familial support. Why not exploit her weakness and dominate her for information, turning the tables on her instead.\n\nDisneyland - I could be someone who is a fellow patron or someone who is a Disney princess. You would approach me, maybe even subtly feel me up, and you would end up fucking me for the weekend behind your family's back.\n\nFlight Attendant - You are on the flight in which I am the attendant, you decide to fuck your way into a free upgrade into first class then use me for the duration of your stay in a foreign country.\n\nThe Police Chief's Daughter - This one is similar to the boss's daughter prompt but with the exception of you using her to skirt the law. It could be speeding tickets, or could be keeping the cops away from your illegal activities.\n\nThe Mall - You are there with your wife, how do you make your move on me. This would be more along the lines of groping and finger fucking and maybe a hand job/blowjob but very discreet.\n\nVacation - You are on vacation with your wife and kids, you use me as a fucktoy to blow off some steam.\n\nThese are merely idea, if you have other fun scenarios do let me know I love hearing about it. This scenario would start from the day we met and the days/weeks that follows depending on the scenario. I am open to mixing a few of those scenarios with me playing multiple characters so we could mix some shorter scene ones with a longer main plot scenario. I am open to both short term and long term but discussion of the prompt is required either way. \n\nI just love the idea of being dominated by someone and turned into a sexually submissive slut by him. There would be elements of power, control, lust, and conquest. I would like your character to dominate me for more than just sex, i.e. money, power, access. I want there to be toy play such as dildos, gags, etc. I would like an element of training i.e. you making me blow you with my hands behind my back and stuff. I love rough sex like hair pulling, ass spanking, tit spanking, light choking, and being railed hard and long. Wordplay is very important therefore dirty talk is a high priority. Finally as a nice icing on top I love being made to do kinky degrading acts to earn sexual pleasure. Raceplay is an added kink, I have a weakness for BWC. I do enjoy a findom element (i.e. you using me for money) do let me know if that is something you are into. Dildo training is really fun as well so if you are up for that would be really great :)\n\nLimits are as follows. There should be no family related stuff. Not going to tolerate any form of rape, anger, hate, violence or intimidation, use your charm and wits to get me into bed. No bodily fluids with the exception of cum. No group sex, breeding or pregnancy related kinks. No animals. Not into any romantic angles either.\n\nOnto what I am looking for in a partner. **I am looking for detailed roleplay partners only**. I don't need a full novel in response but there should be a couple of paragraphs at least per reply. I am looking for those who are into discussing and building a scenario together before we begin. **I am looking for someone with ideas of their own to share. I do not want an introduction of yourself as it is irrelevant to the scenario. In your detailed response please include a few ideas of kinky degrading acts you wish to incorporate in the scenario as well as who is your character it would help me see how your brain ticks**. Thank you. :)",

            "selftext": "**PMs Only**\n\nHi there! Today is one of my rare lazy evenings and I felt like spending it chatting with some fun strangers about the good things in life, i.e. racy RPs, steamy fantasies, and fun kinks. I just got myself ready for the evening and poured my first glass of wine to nurture before the stary velvet embraces me for the evening. I\u2019m looking to shed the weary yoke of everyday life and perhaps find a kindred spirit who is also in search of some social and steamy messaging tonight.\n\nRight off the bat, I\u2019m mostly interested in the realm of chatting about fiction and fun right now. I am not in the mood for something overly elaborate/intense like a fully-fledged RP, nor directly sexting. However, I would enjoy talking about fantasies, RP ideas, and so on. We could also talk a bit about our past experiences and the small and big things that excite us to no end. Or we could play some chat game that is of your fancy. I am open to suggestions!\n\nWhat I look for in you is someone who can keep a conversation going and is interested in writing about their own fantasies and desires as well as dive into someone else\u2019s. Single sentence and passive responses are not for me. That is not to say every response should be multi-paragraph extravaganza. There can be too much of a good thing at a time. But I prefer some meat on the bones when messaging. Some breathing room between responses is better if that means we can get a conversation with some substance going. Quality over frequency and volume so to speak.\n\nI have spent quite some time doing sexy make-believe over the year, so my tastes, or at least tolerances, are quite broad. You will rarely have to worry about shocking me with your turn-ons, and I\u2019m generally very open. There are things I might not be into, but that is mostly on a case by case basis so it is hard to elaborate on. However, my hard limits are: breath play, bathroom play, incest and heavy violence. Most heavy misogyny- and racist-based fantasies are usually not in my wheelhouse either.\n\nIf chatting freely isn\u2019t your style, then we could start off by trading some questions back and forth, as a game. One I have done before is trading 3 questions at a time, and the other person picks two to answer honestly, and the third is stent back to the asker. Or if you have some other game or topic you would prefer to break the ice with, I am open to suggestions :)\n\nIf this kind of conversation sounds interesting to you, I encourage you to send me a [message]( https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=FemaleFascination)! Hopefully we are a good match, and regardless I wish you all the best!\n\n/J",

I am a fairly social and open boy, I have a good social life and hang out with a lot of guys and am pretty extroverted, however I am terrible with women. I am also a rowdy teenager. I have been called a loose cannon. I am always getting into trouble at school, always loud, boisterous, doing stupid fun things giving me a terrible reputation. However those who know me know that I am fairly tame deep down. Everyone knows I have issues with my parents, especially my mother. You can be an older lady, one who knows the wild side but also knows what goes on behind the scenes. You decide to kill 2 birds with one stone and help me out with my inexperience and my issues by taking a motherly role and teaching me to be great in bed !\n\n  \nIf you are interested in playing these out, talking dirty and sexting, or just answering a curious young man's questions and guiding him, please don't hesitate to reach out to me ! If you want, I am also open to hearing your ideas too !",

There was no boost in crime or anything, in fact I had became quite popular with the other families, with mothers and daughters spending hours with me, leaving each time looking extremely satisfied.\n\nAnd while you didn't like spreading gossip, did anyone else notice Anne-Marie got a new tattoo on her neck of a Spade with a Q in it, what's that all about?\n\nMaybe it's time you introduced yourself to the nice Black Man next door.\n\n++++++++\n\nPretty basic raceplay prompt. While I have said that the neighbours have all fallen for me, I'm open yo having you be the first one instead.\n\nAs for who you are, I've left it vague, but I do think it could be fun if you had a family, with either a husband that gets cucked or you're a lesbian who just can't resist a BBC when it's infront of you.\n\nI have a load of kinks for this including raceplay, Black supremacy, BBC worship, tattoos and piercings, cumplay, facials, collars, petplay and so much more.

You and some of the other moms in the neighborhood would clutch your pearls and shake your heads while gossiping about what a bad apple I was. The book clubs, PTA meetings, yoga classes were an excuse for the milfs of the neighborhood to basically talk shit and try to figure out how to get me off their kids case. Being twenty now, I should have moved on, gotten a job and stopped harassing people. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for you) I just decided to continue my favorite pastime: bullying the fuck out of everyone and anyone I came in contact with.\n\nWhat finally drives you to confront me? Maybe I knocked up your sons cute little Christian girlfriend and ruined his future with her, maybe it was some kind of physical altercation where your son ended up in a cast? Whatever the incident is, you won\u2019t make it far into our conversation without noticing how attracted to me you are. Soon nothing is going to matter except the warmth between your legs. You\u2019ve been neglected by your limp dick hubby for too long and it\u2019s about time you got your brains fucked out the way you\u2019ve secretly been craving. Fuck your family... this bully dick is just too addicting. Who cares if they eventually find out? Who cares if you end up pregnant again? You\u2019d do anything your hung stud wanted you to do.\n\n\nLooking for a self righteous milf who can\u2019t control her urges when confronting her sons long time bully.

My girlfriend and I spent a week sunbathing, eating and drinking. One evening we had got back to the hotel and didn\u2019t fuck as she was tired so just went to bed. About 20 minutes later, I heard the familiar sound of a bed creaking from the room above, then the headboard from the bed knocking against the wall. As the session continued the woman started moaning, softly at first, then louder and louder. Eventually the pounding was so hard, I thought the bed was going to come through the ceiling. During all this, my girlfriend was \u2018asleep\u2019. The next morning when the couple started up again, albeit much quieter, my girlfriend  rolled her eyes\u2026got me thinking if she was actually asleep that night. Later, when we were by the pool, she took her bikini top off for the first time, and that night told me to fuck her harder. Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t get the thoughts of the couple above us out of my head and wasn\u2019t able to last long enough to give my gf the pounding she was looking for.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my story, happy to take questions and chat about your experiences too!\n\nX",

            "selftext": "**I'm going to make it very clear right away \u2013 if you're racist, I have zero interest in writing with you. None. If you are looking for violent/aggressive raceplay and a roleplay glorifying racism, I will not want to write it. Thank you! - Also, please send a private message, I do not check chats.**\n\n*I'm here for white men who are ass-men!*\n\nI can't get enough of white men, honestly. Growing up in America, I was immediately drawn to them. Was it because I grew up seeing handsome white men on television and in all media? Maybe! But it doesn't matter. I love white men, even though I have to suffer teasing remarks to my friends about me always crushing on white men, but I can't help it!\n\nI'll give you a few reasons why.\n\nThe first... Is the big cultural difference. Yes, I wear a hijab... Most of the time. Shh, it's a secret. I'll get into that later! But I am very reserved and shy. I grew up with a religious family and I've been known as nothing short of a very good girl. I like to make my parents proud...Which might be why my attraction and meetings with men outside my race is a secret. Oops. It's very taboo, isn't it? You don't even have to know me and you probably assume I wouldn't want to talk to you, or be interested in chatting up a conversation. I'm dressed so modestly in my hijab, but damn if my clothes aren't incredibly snug to my curvy form, especially when it comes to how big my ass is.\n\nWith me being religious, I do want to save my virginity for my future husband. It makes me feel less guilty about my attraction and... my needs. It's easy. I use my my mouth and my ass. That's right! It's not only for Christian girls who love Jesus! The loophole also applies here. So, anal sex is the way to go. I'll do just about everything *except* vaginal because I'm saving myself. \n\nMy hijab. I don't know what it is, but it drives men *wild* when they find out I'm interested in them, and yet I'm supposed to be this conservative, religious good girl. When I sneak out to bars or clubs from time to time, I usually go without my hijab for obvious reasons. I don't want to be recognized, and I'm not intending on seeing these men again or marrying them, right? So why not? It's much easier and I feel like guilty when I'm out of my city with losing my hijab for an evening, but there is... Something hotter to me about fooling around with a man while wearing it.\n\nI love the difference in our skin tone! I have lovely brown skin, and I love the sight of my hand on a white chest or arm... Or cock. I love pointing it out, or having a white man talk about how he loves my brown body. Hearing how pretty I look taking his white cock between my pouty lips, or how my big brown butt was made for white cock. That's the kind of raceplay I like. Where it's in appreciation, and how our contrasts are celebrated \u2013 you can do and enjoy raceplay without being racist. Yay!\n\nA lot of white men are obsessed with my ass. I have a nice figure, but it's almost cruel to have me be 'off-limits' in a sense while having such a big, round butt. I love catching a man staring at my ass, or seeing the pure shock in their face when I tell them I'd love for them to fuck my little asshole, too. They don't expect it, and that's half the fun! They usually think it'll be a blowjob or a handjob before I'm gone, but I get such a thrill from telling them my butt is for them to fuck. \n\nSo, yeah... Enough about all that. I'll roleplay about anything. Here are some ideas.\n\nHook-ups. Based from above, want to roleplay as my hook-up? Let's do it! Be someone from school, someone in my neighborhood, a friend's older brother, a TA, officer, etc. I'm open to ideas. Want to find me on Tinder when I make an account solely for hooking up? Easy!\n\nPornstars. Everyone is obsessed with Arab girls in porn, why not embrace it? I'd love to play the hijab wearing, stacked pornstar (who is actually an arab girl and not posing! Keep it authentic!) who is on the bang-bus or simply in a cheesy porn scene. Let's have fun with it!\n\nSuperheroes. Yeah, I'm going there! I mean, I said I loved seeing white men on television and such, right? Why not a superhero opposite of a hijab-wearing heroine? Or villainess, or civillian! Anything! \n\nCelebrities - Growing up, they've been plastered everywhere. Movies, shows, sports, magazines. I can't help but be a fangirl of white celebrities. There's so many I enjoy! Like Chris Evans, Hemsworth and Henry Cavill! Having them pound a big brown butt of a modest girl would be fun, wouldn't it? Am I an assistant? A fangirl? A secret hook-up?\n\nMy kinks are raceplay, light humiliation/teasing, men who love ass, rimming (giving/receiving), deepthroat, facefucking, dirty talk and more! Please send me a message and not a chat request. Let me know your kinks and which idea you like! I am solely here to roleplay, please do not offer anything other than writing a scene with me. Thanks and happy hunting!",

            "selftext": "So here's the way I start almost all my fantasies in my head :)\r  \n\r  \n*Mom and Dad always taught me that it's good to help out around the house. Of course every well-raised girl knows that! I turned 18 months ago, and we decided instead of going to college I'm going to stay around at home for at least another year, so now I'm going to start helping out like a real woman. Mom can't ALWAYS be around to give Daddy what he enjoys, and even when she's around, sometimes she's busy or tired! And even if she wasn't, it's no secret that daddies like a little variety and enjoy the special sweet tightness of a daughter's pussy or bottom. It's not weird or pervy; lots of girls do it, and I know at least a few of my friends do it for their dads too. I mean, why wouldn't they?*\r  \n\r  \nIn this prompt I have a hankering to be casually and critically objectified by you and Mom, perhaps with a sister alongside me (I don't mind playing most of all the female characters in this). The idea being that you and Mom will have me take off my clothes one item at a time, and discuss how you feel about me and how you look forward to using me (you'll be using me, not mom). This isn't a humiliation roleplay; I expect you'll be appreciative, although I'm a little on the chubby and curvy side so you don't have to tiptoe around the fact that I'm fat in certain places. This is kind of a precursor to a scene where you'd be fucking me, maybe it's Mom's idea to get me comfortable with the idea of Dad using me for sex. After she invites me into your room, she'll tug your cock as the two of you sit on the bed and talk about how you anticipate groping my boobs or making my big butt jiggle. Touching is also fine!\r  \n\r  \nI don't ordinarily care about reference pics, but this is one scene where they'd be more or less fine, so feel free to use one if you'd like. I am a big girl, so don't make me out to be skinny. I'm redheaded with freckles and really pale skin. I expect you're basically a dad body type, and this part's important -\r  \n\r  \nPLEASE don't try to make me out to be horny or slutty. I can be cheerful, nervous, or bratty and pouty, but the sex is going to be about pleasing you, with ideally zero emphasis on pleasing me. You don't have to be mean, just entitled.",

An almost perfect evening for a 20 something young professional who is a huge nerd and had nothing better to do on his weekends.  It would have only been made better had I girl to spend it with.  But as a solitary and introverted geek, I am between awkward relationships.\n\nSo, here I am, passed out on my couch in my living room when a strong knock at the door rouses me from my stupor.  It could be 6am or 1 in the afternoon, I have no way of figuring it out without checking, and frankly I don\u2019t care.\n\nStumbling to my feet I open the door and am blinded by the beautiful bright day beyond.  \u201cYes?\u201d I ask, \u201ccan I help you?\u201d Before even realizing who is standing there.\n\n\u201cGood morning, sir\u2026\u201d you say with a chipper voice. Pushing past me before I can respond.  \n\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d is all I can reply.  Once you\u2019re inside the apartment my eyes adjust and I am cut off as I truly see you.\n\nTall, thick, curvaceous, dressed in tight booty shorts and a crop top that says **Milfy Maids** which barely covers your large tits.  You\u2019re holding a bucket with cleaning supplies and you\u2019ve already started bending down deep as you begin pickup my living room.  \u201cI think you\u2019ve got the wrong place.\u201d  I stammer as my eyes fall on your late, round ass stretching your shorts to their limit\u2026\u201dl didn\u2019t order a maid service.\u201d  My considerable cock is already hard in my athletic shorts as I watch your jiggly body drop low and shake with each piece of trash you pick up.\n\nWere you an actual maid or a stripper?  You seem intent on actually cleaning, but you are definitely putting on a show.   When you hear my weak protest, You stand and turn to look at me.  \n\nPutting your hands on your hips looking at me with a smile of confusion.  \u201cOf course you did silly!\u201d You push a piece of paper in my face that has all of my info on it.  \u201cPlatinum package!  Paid in full plus tip!  Very generous.\u201d  The last word oozing an appreciative lust.  You move closer and practically shove your tits in my face, your body pressing into my cock but talking to me as if you have no idea you\u2019re molesting my hardon.  \u201cI\u2019m here to do *anything* you need from me.  Anting at all.  All\u2026weekend\u2026long.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI think you get the idea.  Mysterious milf maid shows up eager to clean and \u201cservice\u201d a younger guy who has no memory of hiring her as a maid or for any other reason.\n\nPlease introduce yourself and chat before we start jumping in.\n\nNon-white milfs who like white bois go to the front of the line.\n\nBig titty goths and / or pawgs also get special consideration.",

We're all human and we all have urges, wants, and desires. Oftentimes for me, when horny brain turns on I am very willing and able to do things that regular-brained me would scoff at.\n\nSo that's what I'm looking for. I want to know your urges, wants, and desires. Have any kinks you've never talked to anyone about? Is there a fantasy you have that you wish you could do in real life? Heck, maybe you've already lived out a deep fantasy and just want to share that story. If any of these describes you, I'd love to chat!\n\nI'll start off with myself. Before horny brain turns on, I'm pretty turned off by the idea of anything near or around my butt. Once it turns on, I can't get enough of it. Lots of masculine men would think that anything in your butt makes you gay, but I beg to differ. I've never felt a pleasure so great than something poking my prostate repeatedly. It leads to an unforgettable orgasm....Anyway though, horny brain has taken me to places where I was once willing to send a random redditor pictures at their request of me in fairly compromising positions with my fingers or a toy in my ass. Regular brained me is disgusted by it, horny brained me wants to know if I can go further. My regular brain is absolutely embarrassed by what my horny brain wants and that is totally okay. Honestly, it's pretty hot...\n\nBut anyway, I'm looking to chat with anyone and everyone as long as you identify as female. Share with me your kinks, your limits, and we can take it from there. We can just chat, we can RP, whatever you'd like. Horny brain is on and that's where we're headed!",

So  let's talk about our love for sexy  and slutty outfits as we cum the day/night away.\n\nI'm Looking for someone more on the petite/slim to average side. Not a requirement but short hair is my weakness lol. My libido is ridiculous, so if yours is too... that would be perfect. Other than that, please be easy going and down to earth. Not looking for anyone rude or stuck up. Just a nice and laid back sex chat. Maturity is definitely important.\n\nSome other sexual interests include oral, public, anal, teasing, creampies, lingerie, slutty outfits, clothed sex, outercourse, outdoors sex, teasing, light bondage, orgasm denial, mutual masturbation...and the list goes on. I'm pretty open and willing to try/talk about most things.Please be able to type more than a few words or a single sentence.",

            "selftext": "we had met online and in person, but this was our first time in a private space. i knocked on the unfamiliar door and upon being invited in (by a loud voice coming from the kitchen) i noticed that surprisingly the house looked lived in. it wasn't some bachelor pad, but had actual chairs around the kitchen table and a few kitchen appliances like a waffle maker and blender which were both being used at the time.\r  \n\r  \n\"yes, i'd love one\" i said upon the offer of some kind of drink. i requested no pineapple so mine made the first trip around the blender. i was tasting and pulling out waffles and it was a sweet moment. we ate, drank some more, watched part of a movie and had more drinks. i started to suspect my drinks were stronger than normal but i figured it was my anxiety, so we just kept watching and cuddling. eventually i stumbled on my way to the kitchen, but was caught and eased back to the couch. then cuddles turned into groping but my resistance was futile. i mumbled and pushed a bit but the touches and kisses were so romantic, i couldn't help but enjoy.\r  \n\r  \ni realized i was drifting off to sleep so i asked if i could just close my eyes. \"that couch is so uncomfortable, you'll wake up sore there. let me carry you upstairs\" and i was whisked away, laid down, and i thought i would be tucked in to bed for the afternoon. i didn't know that straps would be attached to me instead of an extra pillow. i tried to resist but by now i could barely keep eyes open and i had no strength or coordination. when i was helpless and being touched my body betrayed me. my sets of lips were speaking two different requests and only the moistness indicating \"don't stop\" seemed to matter. i passed out several times but woke up in forced pleasure each time.\r  \n\r  \nfinally i woke up for good my arms were free and my nose was filled with the smell of what i learned were kababs on an indoor grill. i cleaned up and dressed and hesitantly walked down the steps. i didn't remember a lot, okay i didn't remember much at all, but was greeted as if nothing unusual happened. i could have dreamed the whole thing but i was sure it happened.\r  \n\r  \n\"does medium well sound okay to you?\"\r  \n\r  \ni snapped out of my thoughts and didn't know whether to trust myself.\n\nooc - looking for a continuation of this day, a next chapter so to speak, or anything related to it. i'm good with short back and forth chats or longer messages. i don't want to put limits on anyone especially since this is my first story on here. thank you all",

I'd love to hear you're interests in your favorite fandoms and the characters you'd like to transform.\n\nI'm only interested in those who also love the transformation kink. So please send me a message over DM's and we can discuss at length and maybe even RP eventually (don't send over reddit chat, I don't use it)\n\nKinks: Humiliation, degradation, forced transformation, dub con, , cock sucking, mind break, mind control, reality warping. IQ loss, voice change, silly, uglification, muscle growth, masculinization, race change, (I'm also open to a lot of other kinks if they can play into my main kinks, the only exceptions being my limits.)\n\nLimits: Violence, Gore, Vore, Rimming, Toilet stuff, and possibly some other things",

I don\u2019t want to embarrass him obviously, but I also have a lot of choice words for that jerk bully!\n\nSincerely, \nLin\n\n\u2014\n\nHey ladies, \n\nUpdate on the bully situation, that jerk got his hands on my sons phone and sent me some messages.  I\u2019m a bit at a loss at what to respond to him.  He said my sons a loser and a wimp, so that\u2019s bad.  But he also sent me a selfie, and he\u2019s got *perfectly* chiseled abs.  Like\u2026 oh my god.. I mean.. \n\nSorry, anyway, I\u2019m sending this message to gather your wisdom and take a poll.  Please advise what I should respond to this jerk with.  \n\nSincerely, \nLin",

            "selftext": "We've all considered it, right? It's not just me.... *right??*\n\n.\n\nI'll be watching my favorite show, or playing my favorite game, enjoying the fun, diverse, unique cast of characters, when suddenly the thought pops into my head and then refuses to leave - *I wonder how her lips would feel wrapped around my cock.*\n\nWell, if you too have ever wondered about the oral prowess of your favorite heroine, villainess, or nondescript side character(s), now's your chance to explore that very question! I've listed a few general ideas as starters; none of these are binding and I'm more than happy to discuss and brainstorm any other ideas you might have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Mass Effect - The Stowaway:** The crew of the Normandy received a distress signal from an isolated mining outpost in the Aethon Cluster. They hurry to respond, only to arrive and find it abandoned. After they've left, though, they discover some unexpected cargo in the form of an escapee, who fled the outpost by stowing away on the Normandy. This prompt would explore the relationship between this stowaway and one (or more) member of Shepard's squad - or perhaps even Shepard herself!\n* **Dragon Age - a Wicked Grace wager**: When they're not out saving Thedas, the Inquisitor and his companions like to enjoy a game of Wicked Grace here and there. It's a good way to unwind, an easy game to drink along to, and despite barely even knowing how to play, the Inquisitor somehow always manages to come out on top. Well, why not raise the stakes a little? Loser spends the next round under the table, servicing the Inquisitor until someone else loses to take her place.\n* **Life is Strange - Straying Lovers:** Since reuniting in Arcadia Bay, Max and Chloe have been by each others' side nonstop. So much so that a relationship blossoms between the two childhood friends. But despite this, one of them eventually starts to crave something that the other can't provide for her. This would involve either Max or Chloe (we can discuss which) slowly giving in to her desire to cheat on the other, and we could even explore what happens when the other finds out.\n* **Overwatch - I don't play Overwatch:** I'll be honest, I've literally never played this game and have almost no desire to do so. But the porn is *fantastic,* no? I feel as if I've consumed enough animated and voice-acted porn of the Overwatch characters that I know them personally. Anyways, if you want to discuss a scenario involving these women, I adore their character designs, so I'm all ears.\n\nI'd also love to include characters from **any of the following series, or hear any other ideas you have**: Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Nier Automata, Zootopia, Overwatch, Cyberpunk 2077, Dishonored, Borderlands, the Outer Worlds, Life is Strange, Fallout 4, The Witcher 3, Animal Crossing, XCOM, Halo, Skyrim, and probably a bunch more I haven't thought of.\n\n.\n\nIf this idea appeals to you at all please shoot me a message! I'd love to spend some time chatting and working out all the specifics before we jump into a roleplay. **Please make an effort when you send a first message**; as long as I don't feel like this is a one-sided conversation we will get along swimmingly! Kinks and limits are below, bonus points if we have the bold ones in common.\n\nKinks: blowjobs, **facefucking**, oral, ball sucking, cum, **cumplay**, **cum eating/drinking**, gokkun, rimming, condom play, bondage, **humiliation**, **furries**, monster girls, trans girls, **rule 34**, cosplay/outfit play, hentai, outercourse, clothed sex, **public play**, **cuckqueaning/reverse NTR**, breast/body envy, maledom, femdom, harems, perverted girls, **casual play**, **free use**, inexperience\n\nLimits: bathroom stuff, blood/guro, futanari, raceplay. misogyny-play, ddlg, extreme sizeplay. **Note**: my character **must** be the only man in the scene (including any bystanders). If this is a deal-breaker, I understand.",

Not in any sexual attraction sort of way, but I guess it's more the feeling of constantly comparing myself to him. There are definitely some unique feelings and experiences that have sprung up from this that I'm still working through, so I figure if anyone out there is interested in discussing this or just the topic of size comparisons in general, I'd be happy to chat more about it with you.

Mr Smith barely got to fuck his wife anymore, because when he asked he\u2019d always get struck down with the \u201cI\u2019m too busy\u201d bullshit. So on his 40th birthday, she gave him the best birthday present he could ever ask for. She \u201cnegotiated\u201d with the CEO (sucked his dick every day for a month) and was able to get them one entire year off in paid vacation. With extensive planning, she chartered a glamorous trip all round the world, every continent, many countries everything. Now that sounds nice but here\u2019s the real kicker: every location, they would go out together and find a beautiful young local girl, and bring her back to their hotel to have a threesome. From enjoying a hot day of passionate sex with a brown skinned barefoot island girl in their beach cabana to finding a cute busty Italian daughter of a farmer  in the countryside, they would meet her, have sex with them during their visit and leave her impregnated with their phone number to send checks to support the child. They had never had children, so they could make up for the time lost by having Mr smith spread his seed far and wide, to innocent naive girls worldwide. \nDm me to roleplay this scenario",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm in the mood for a League of Legends themed roleplay. I can be ANY champ you want, but I have some preferences. Of course, if I'm gonna be Warwick or Nasus I'll have the appropriate canine sex attributes, this pretty much is the same for any champion that has an animal appearance. You can also be whoever you want, but I have some ideas and preferences on this too.\r  \n\r  \nThresh/Senna: This would be an abuse/humiliation/noncon type of roleplay, involving some BDSM too. It would be set in the prison of Thresh, not long after he captured Senna.\r  \n\r  \nThresh/Kalista: Set in the Shadow Isles, there's always been some flirting between Thresh and Kalista, and one day they go one step further. This roleplay would involve some BDSM too (chains of Thresh), but not much abuse and humiliation. Would be more of a passionate relationship between the two, but with Thresh still being sadistic.\r  \n\r  \nHecarim/Sona or Soraka: Set in the jungle of the Summoner's Rift, Sona adventures too deep in the enemy lines to ward and gets ganked by Hecarim. Not much about kinks here, she gets mounted my Hecarim until he is satisfied and she is full of cum.\r  \n\r  \nNasus or Warwick/Soraka: Same as the one before, Soraka goes too deep into the jungle and gets ganked. With this roleplay I'd like to go heavy on the interactions between Nasus/Warwick and Soraka, meaning that she will be completely broken at the end.\r  \n\r  \nPantheon/Leona: The kinkiest and more perverted of all rps I have in mind. This would have no limits, so abuse, humiliation, public, watersports, facefuck, anal, and much more, here you have full freedom too. This roleplay would be set in one of the temples of Mount Targon.\r  \n\r  \nRakan/Xayah: The vanilla couple! This is for those who want a simple, vanilla sex roleplay. This would be set in a remote village in Ionia.\r  \n\r  \nSett/Xayah: This would be a cheating rp, or maybe with Rakan being a cuck.\r  \n\r  \nGangplank/Miss Fortune: Set on a ship or at Bilgewater, this roleplay would be a \"love/hate\" relation, where there's not a dom and a sub, but both try to take control of the other in any way possible.\r  \n\r  \nKindred: This would be Lamb and Wolf mating, I can play as beast Wolf or anthro, but prefer beast.\r  \n\r  \nThese are some of my ideas, but I also like other champions like Jinx, Vi, Cait, Kaisa, Akali.\r  \n\r  \nSome of my favorite kinks at the moment are rough sex, domination, facefuck, musk, watersports, excessive cum, dirty talk. name calling, public and risky sex, but I have many more.\r  \n\r  \nLimits: Scat, vomit, gore, vore.",

            "selftext": "I'm Claudia and right now I'm just looking for some roleplay buddies. I'm in the EST timezone, and I'm very Bisexual. I'm into lots of different types of roleplay (mostly smut.) I can play multiple characters, I can play male or female, but I lean towards being a sub. I usually roleplay in first person but exceptions can be made.\n\nUsually on DPP when I see harem related posts it's always with one man, and a few lovely women for him to feast on. Tonight I want to do the opposite, I want a harem of men for me to mess around with, bouncing around between them and having a good ole time. This is more slice-of-life, and I'd like you to play all of the men.\n\nThe three of you have been long time friends, always so close knit. After college you decided to stick together, even working in different fields you've found a nice house to share, and things are good. The three of you came to a decision, since you share a home, why not share a girlfriend? Someone bubbly, energetic, cute, a communal girlfriend if you will. \n\nThat was where I came in. It's been a couple of months since I moved in, dating all of you is a blast so far. It's a chilly Friday afternoon, fresh snow outside covering the yard. For now I have the house to myself, and I'm working up a big dinner for everyone. The hearth is burning nice and warm, and some of you guys should be coming home soon.\n\nSo, if this little idea hits the spot for you, shoot a message!. If you have some idea of your own, even better! Come into my PMs and let's create the world's greatest harem. Let me know your favorite sex position on your first message :)",

            "selftext": "I know this is quite niche, but hey, what else is reddit for? Basically, I'm addicted to feet. Like, I'll drop down and worship them on a bus addicted. And frankly, it has only been made worse by ebony queen's and white Goddesses. They're dark, bronzen soles accentuated by light nail polish-just thinking about it makes me drool~then there\u2019s those  ivory soles to force me further into my addiction! Just replace your race in place of the prompts below~\n\nOf course, that's just the premise. If your white, I'd never say no to worshipping your feet either! Or, you know, just don't tell me what you are~Anyways, I have several ideas for how to begin. Each vary in the kinks involved; some feature heavy elements of blackmail and catching me in the act, while others are more consensual and loving. Regardless, I'm sure we'll figure something out~\n\nPrompt 1: Co-ed teammates!\n\nIsn't college just wonderful? No one here knows about my foot fetish anymore. Sure, it's tough moving half-way across the country, but I'd do anything not to be labeled a foot addict. I even decided to join an intramural co-ed team to get in shape! At least, that was the plan. Until I saw you. Watching your glistening feet change everyday, hearing you giggle with your friends about pedicures...I couldn't take it! Surely, just sneaking in late after a game to \"inspect\" your locker couldn't hurt? (spoiler: it will!)\n\nPrompt 2: Seducing MILF!\n\nThis one is for the more mature-loving foot addicts-like myself-who have always dreamed of an ebony MILF seducing them with her chocolate soles. Maybe I'm a neighbor, your child's friend, or a spying, devious pervert across the street. Perhaps you decipher my foot fetish instantly and immediately start turning me into a vanilla foot slut, or you relish in watching me crumble at your seducing toes. I left this a bit more broad due to the versatility that being a MILF entails~\n\nPrompt 3: A loving time\n\nFeet can also be a beautiful, intimate thing. Perhaps were lovers and you've known about my fetish for a long time. It's become quite normal for a bit of teasing in public, and then loving, gentle foot worship in bed. While I slowly fuck you, feeling your feet in my face, the warmth from our bodies bonding us ever closer~or maybe we've been married for awhile, complete with kids. Normal sex has just gotten too boring. It doesn't really get the same rise out of us, if you know what I mean. So, we experiment with...feet (and any other kinks you think would spice up a married couples life!)\n\nNow, for kinks and limits. There's a lot, so be warned~\n\nKinks: Chastity, Body worship (feet, armpits, ect), ass/pussy worship, Futa, feminization, bimbofication, IQ Loss, scent play, blackmail, recording, corruption, spit play, body modifcation, toys, bestiality, pegging, and nose/anal hooks! Anything not listed in my limits can most definitely be discussed, so don't be shy!\n\nLimits: Scat, vore, gore, excessive expansion, and shrinking, \n\nWhew, that was a lot. But don't be overwhelmed! I'm sure we'll be able to figure something out. After all, who doesn't love a foot queen?~",

            "selftext": "\"Ooo! Huh! Move your hips like that...YES!!! FUCK LIKE THAT!!!!\" Throughout the house, Lyla's voice resonated, and it wasn't a bother to anyone, since they weren't home. The strawberry blonde girl locked her ankles around Jian's neck as he fiercely thrusted over and over. It'd be insensitive to say that this interaction was routine or calloused or simply what happened at ten a.m. every day, but frankly it WAS what happened around eleven in the morning.\n\n \"Wow..That was..amazing..\" Lyla layed down staring at the ceiling while Jian was huffing and puffing his breaths, coated in sweat. A smile was stretched across his face, and for a second, he felt like life couldn't get better than this.\n\n\"So..very good..\" The poor guy was a bit self-conscious every time he spoke in front of his roommates, since it wasn't his first language, but if there was anyone to give him clemency for his verbal shortcomings, it would be them. Having moved here only two months ago with hardly any money and a faint grasp of the English language, Jian was given a blessing to land a house with three sorority girls looking for just a \"little\" bit of extra income. After all, the landlord was a bit belligerent, and none of the three girls wanted to relive  the first year there where he was bold...\n\n  Lyla's phone chimed with the name 'Chelsea'. At the book store, Chelsea tucked a band of dark hair behind her ear and impatiently waited for her girlfriend to respond, but looking at the clock in front of her, she realized that it wouldn't be for another hour before she responded. \"Damn.\" She sipped her coffee from a paper cup, and for just a minute, her mind wandered back to what her beloved was experiencing. It wasn't a stretch, since it was only last night that she experienced the same thing. Who'd have thunk that he would have turned two die-hard lesbians with one night of tequila?\n\n  Jian lied there, until the familiar smell hit his nose. \"Ah! Eh...bacon?\" Daphne indeed was frying bacon and had a grits on the way. The southern dream was a bit of the housekeeper, but her crowning quality was her cooking, and she loved it. Her long blonde ringlets framed not only her beautiful face, but her gorgeous body. She already texted her boyfriend with another excuse to stay home today. It was a work in progress to break it to him, that she may be in love again...\n\n (Hi! So this story is a bit race-heavy, but I hope it doesn't offend anybody. It revolves around a household with a new roommate that came from the east. After a heavy night of drinking, they challenged him to try and beat the stereotype of what Asian guys are packing and...well it astonished everyone. Since then, he's been able to build rapport with his friends that sadly are already taken in one capacity or another. Two were lesbian roommates that enjoy his company time to time, and one was committed to a good man, but who could pass up such a great flavor of sex? How this story develops is up for interpretation. Will he eventually dissolve the ties of his friends and build a harem, or maybe he gets a job elsewhere that moves him up quickly? There is a lot to work with, and I hope it hits the spot.

I couldn\u2019t resist you. We would meet in hotels. Sometimes you\u2019d sneak inside my office, even inside my house, stuffing my thick married cock down your throat and gagging on me while my wife is sound asleep, lightly snoring in the other room.\n\nI made you my sugar baby and you knew I\u2019d give anything for you. Sometimes you would ask to wear her wedding ring while you fingered yourself. I\u2019d watch the glistening gold and diamonds go in and out of your tight pussy. You even wanted me to shower you with cum dressed in her lingerie.  And I thought it was incredibly hot when you changed your hair to her style and you wanted me to call you by her name while I plowed deep into you. \n\nBut then you started dressing like her. Picking up her mannerisms, her tastes, her way of being. You opened up a credit card on my account but in her name. You purchased the same car as her. Started hanging out with her friends. Sleeping with her ex lovers so you could taste everything that she has had. And when I come home to find you in bed with her, her mouth moaning between your legs, I have no idea how to react. \n\nWould love to chat about this scenario or any derivative. Not so much into role playing but love organic chats where we both can bounce ideas off one another and get something pleasurable out if it. I\u2019m not looking for a sugar baby in real life- only want to chat about these fantasies. \n\nKinks include: blowjobs, cock worshiping, cum and more cum, cumplay, lingerie, findom, sugar babies, cheating, being cheated on, role reversals and open minded people. \n\nLimits: blood, death, poop, animals and illegal acts. \n\nAdults 18 and older only.

But there are two things you don't have, not yet. You don't have a perfect queen to rule by your side, and you don't have the perfect heir to take over after you. But luckily, you know just where to find both. Once upon a time, when you were younger, you met a beautiful princess, her name was Charlotte, she had long red curls and the brightest green eyes, and it was love from first sight-at least for you. She thought that at most, you'd only make a good friend, and so, she told you that she didn't want you. She married a peasant boy,made him a prince, and you went back home. Now, you're back, you've conquered her kingdom, and the fates of her and her husband are in your hands. And you really need that heir soon.\r  \n\r  \n(Main kink is breeding and pregnancy, but I'm up for most other things, as long as those are included. Please message me with a starter.

She wanted to be worshiped in these outfits and she knows that is my fetish.  She showed me picture after picture of herself in more and more compromising positions, until she leaned in and whispered \u201cI\u2019ve got one of the pieces in my car, I can slip it on for you if you\u2019d like\u201d\n\nI\u2019m smitten and I want to see her in this outfit, I\u2019d love to talk with you all about it.

I live in an NYC high rise with my girlfriend and work as a photographer for a magazine. She\u2019s a waitress and part time model\u2014 5\u20197, inked, with big tits, a tight ass, and much more\u2026\n\nWe\u2019ve never been super close but you\u2019re hoping to get an internship somewhere and wanted to eventually ask me for connections. When you show up, I open the door in a robe and you catch a glimpse of her standing in the background, completely naked.\n\nWhat happens next is up to you. My kinklist is in my profile but I\u2019d love to explore incest, a threesome with a girl with a cock, and some fun play that involves anal, dp, deepthroat, lots of cum, etc. \n\nI\u2019ll emphasize that my gf is only a bottom when fucking with me but the rest is fair game.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a reference pic for your character and what you want us to look like.

            "selftext": "Svetlana grew up in a calm and charming town in the heart of America. Both her parents got to the US a few months before she was born and that lead to her having an American and a Russian nationality. Inside her household she\u2019d always speak Russian with her family which led to her still having somewhat of a Russian accent unless she tried her hardest to hide it.\r  \n\r  \nShe was always one that liked sports, she felt that it was an escape of reality and at the same time it wouldn\u2019t be nowhere as difficult as going to school, that\u2019s without mentioning that with sports you have physical rewards that you can see in the mirror or trophies.\r  \n\r  \nThe most difficult part for her was going to school, she simply didn\u2019t like it, she did have a few friends, she wasn\u2019t lonely but that doesn\u2019t mean that she enjoyed any class whatsoever. Homework felt like a chore that she would postpone whenever she had the chance to, until the very last minute.\r  \n\r  \nThings didn\u2019t change when she graduated, she managed to get through the pain of High School and after deciding to take two years to explore the country she had a big question that she needed to answer from her parents: What would she do now?\r  \n\r  \nThe answer wasn\u2019t simple, she didn\u2019t like to think about going to college or university nor did she enjoy working so much. There\u2019s no way someone would hire her, with her resum\u00e9 that wouldn\u2019t jump out of the page.\r  \n\r  \nBut luckily for her she had one thing going for her, thanks to her mother\u2019s genes and her loves for sports she had a body that many would die for and she realized that when she was visiting every city.\r  \n\r  \nShe heard about older, much older men that would put her dad in the \u201cyoung\u201d category and much richer men that would be ready to put the money in order to have someone like her with them, that\u2019s why she started to go to fancy parties although she could barely afford them and soon enough she had a few offers on the table.\r  \n\r  \nMillionaires from all walks of life offered her any range of things, from a marriage that would put her in their will up to a concrete contract with enough zero\u2019s on it that would put an average man\u2019s salary to shame.\r  \n\r  \nWho is the man that she should go for? How old is he? What does he offer her? Does he want to keep her to himself or is he going to share her with his 40 year old son or his adult grandchildren?\r  \n\r  \nI can share more of what I have in mind for this but I want to hear your ideas and thoughts as well!\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t specify much about my character and the reason for that is because I have a few potential references for her.\r  \n\r  \nPlease do not bother to send me a message if it\u2019s to send me a one-liner or something alike. I like detail and writing, therefor it only makes sense that I demand the same of my partner(s).\r  \n\r  \nKinks: cumflation, facefucking, semi-public sex, anal, risky sex, breeding, being shared, casual sex, breastfeeding, age gaps, free-use, ignored sex,\u2026\r  \n\r  \nLimits: anything too violent, heavy pain, death, underage, BDSM, watersports,\u2026",

            "selftext": "I love forced transformation scenarios especially ones that focus on the mental resulting in full identity loss, forgetting who they were and becoming something the old self may have resented or hated.\n\n\u200b\n\nGaslighting magic has recently become my new favorite method of transformation, where you say something that isnt true, funneling your reality altering powers into it to make changes to memories, appearance, quirks and personality slowly whittling away at the persons identity until they are something completely different. I love physical changes too, be it huge fake bimbo features, or muscle growth, weight gain, uglification or even more extreme, freakish changes im all on board save for inanimate TF.\n\n\u200b\n\nI really want to focus on a short term plot where your character be it out of revenge, resentment or spite, seeks my character out to change them completely. I really love the back and forth nature of this style of play as you change physical and mental features one after another, making my character question their own reality until eventually they wont even remember who they were. Bonus points if you even make them forget their old name, change their voice and then convince them it was always that way. The more creative the better from changing memories that may create new personality quirks, kinks or beliefs, or memories that may result in physical changes.\n\n\u200b\n\nOne scene im particularly craving right now is an actor/voice actor arriving at a studio for a new role and as they begin recording the lines you manipulate and change them. maybe you request they use a specific voice but then you change their voice so they're no longer good at voice acting or force them being able to only hold a certain pitch or make their voice specifically high pitched and annoying and when they realize they can't perform any other voice you make them question if they were ever any good and continue to change more and more about them, by they end they may even think theyre there for a completely different reason with no memory of who they used to be, the world is your oyster in this instance.\n\n\u200b\n\nIt doesn't have to be a voice acting scene, it could be that you just tracked them down somewhere or it's an interview of some kind, that's just a particular craving I've had recently and i'd love to build on that one specifically but it could be casting for something else as well, or a personalized interview or a fan greet somewhere or perhaps you're just some deranged fan and you come straight to their house.\n\n\u200b\n\nCelebrities im down to play\n\n\u200b\n\nEmma Watson, Laura Bailey, Erika Ishii, Peyton List,  Marisha Ray, Elliot Page, Jaime Clayton, Laverne Cox, Erin Kellyman, Amy Acker, Gwyneth Paltrow, Chloe Grace Moretz, Kelly Marie Tran, Katee Sackhoff, Maya Hawke, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner, Hayley Atwell, Tomi Lahren, AOC\n\n\u200b\n\nKinks: forced transformations, personal humiliation, orientation play, iq loss, bimbofication, futafication, cock growth, breast growth, body alterations, muscle growth, weight gain, uglification, sweat, body hair, gender transformation, age progression, fake tits, racial transformation, stereotype transformation, voice change, name/identity change, FtM, clown, goof, monster/beast/anthro, Exaggerated changes, hyper fake features, cock sucking\n\n\u200b\n\nLimits: gore, vore, toilet play, pregnancy, feet, inanimate transformation",

            "selftext": "Every institution has its societies \n\nOxford has the Piers Gaveston Society, known for its rampant use of narcotics, public copulation and privacy. \n\nThen there's the Bullingdon Club, famed for producing many future politicians and causing untold amounts of damage to local businesses on their notorious excursions. \n\nCambridge has the Ferretz, a Society of drunkards who enjoy stripping naked and covering themselves in hot sauce, as well as consuming their poison of choice through prophylactics. \n\nWhat these societies all have in common is that they are usually the exclusive haunt of the rich, and the male. \n\nI was neither of those things. \n\nI was attending Cambford on a scholarship programme for disadvantaged geniuses (if I do say so myself), and it was made clear right away that I didn't fit in. \n\nEveryone who's mummy and daddy had paid for them to attend one of the most prestigious universities in the world were privately educated, with cut-glass accents and razor-sharp wits. They spent lavishly, on brunches, on clothes, on nights-out, on phones and laptops. \n\nI dressed in jeans and a hoodie, and I used a second-hand laptop held together with duct tape and prayers. \n\nThe ostracisation began almost immediately. I was left out of group chats, snubbed at club tryouts, sometimes \"mistaken\" for a cleaning lady and casually handed rubbish and wrappers to dispose of. \n\nThere was one group of girls in particular who I noticed. There was seemingly nothing linking them all. They were of all ethnicities and sizes (though all beautiful and young), doing different subjects and living all over town. \n\nThe number of the group would change from time to time. Over the course of the year, I would see one or two faces disappearing for months, only to return like nothing had happened. \n\nI assumed such absences would be noted by the University, but there seemed to be no repercussions for such regular disappearances. \n\nI found out what was going on one cold night in December in my second year. \n\nChristmas break was coming up, the decorations lining the streets and snow flakes drifting in the wind. \n\nI'd been at the library all day, and had only decided to return to my accommodation after glancing up and seeing that the sun had long since set. Walking alone at night was never a good idea, so I packed up and headed home. \n\nOn the way, I saw them. They were all bundled up against the weather in long coats, walking in a pack. Pedestrians parted around them without thinking about it, as if their aura of smugness and wealth was like a forcefield. \n\nWell, fuck that. \n\nI didnt move. I continued on my path, curious to see what would happen if one of the bitches didn't get their way. \n\nThe answer, as it turns out, was a collision that sent me tumbling to the cold ground, falling limbs intertwined with the girl I'd been trying to face down. \n\nHer friends extricated the pair of us, whispering harsh insults to me as they hoisted the girl up. Her coat had come undone, revealing an odd dress underneath. It definitely wasn't a modern fashion, and it looked vaguely Greek, like a toga but with more jewelry. \n\nBefore I could get a better look, the girl fastened her coat, fixed me with a withering stare that she'd probably inherited from her mother, and stormed off as fast as her little legs would carry her. The rest of the pack had gotten surprisingly far, and come to think of it they were all walking rather quickly, like they had somewhere to be. \n\nI brushed myself off, making a mental note not to attempt to stare down a bitch again, when I noticed something lying on the ground. \n\nIt was the girl's purse. \n\nI scooped it up before someone else took it, sheltering against a shop window to examine the contents. \n\nPhoto ID, drivers licence for a Philippa Hammond, a few credit cards for banks I was too poor to have even heard of, and around \u00a3500 in cash. \n\nI'll be honest, in that moment, the thought of just taking it did cross my mind. \u00a3500 was probably pocket money to this Philippa girl. I doubted she'd miss it. \n\nBut that stern voice that sounded oddly like mum resounded through my head. I thought of it as my moral compass, and the needle was spinning like crazy right now. \n\n\"Fine.\", I grumbled to myself, stuffing the purse into my hoodie before racing after the pack. \n\nI rounded the corner just in time to see the girls disappearing down a side street, and when I caught up with where they'd been I saw that they were heading inside one of the enormous Georgian mansions that lined University Square. \n\nI was just in time to see the door swung shut behind them, and I cursed under my breath. I was already getting odd looks for being in this part of town, so I jogged up to the door and knocked, hoping to get this over with before I was arrested for loitering, or some other fabricated crime that rich people used to keep people like me out of their neighbourhoods. \n\nNo reply. \n\n\"Fuck!\". \n\nI tried the handle but the door was locked. As were all the windows on the front of the house. A side passage presumably led the garden, and a servants' entrance was dimly lit by a fire escape sign. \n\n\"That seems more my speed.\", I muttered, and slipped into the small alleyway. \n\nLocked, again. \n\nI was just about to give up when a bulb flickered on below me, illuminating my sneakered feet in golden light. \n\nI crouched, and realised that there was a window set low into the\u00a0 wall, giving me a view of a basement. Wine racks lined the walls, but the centre of the room was spacious, furnished with couches and low tables ringed around a central stone.... well, altar is probably the best word for it, but I didnt understand why it would be there. \n\nIt was an odd mix of casual luxury and a morgue, but I didnt have time to look any further because people were flooding into the room. \n\nIt was the girls! They'd discarded their coats, revealing them all to be wearing those odd togas, like a uniform. \n\nOne of them, a tall girl I knew to be called Samantha, wore a black toga, which contrasted nicely against her pale skin. She situated herself in the centre of the room, and every other girl looked to her, as if she was in charge of this little gathering. \n\nShe spoke, but her words were muffled by the pane of glass separating us. When she finished speaking, a shadow dislodged itself from the wall and stepped into the light, making me jump in fright. \n\nIt wasn't a shadow at all, just a very dark, very large man garbed in a pair of black shorts, the colour matching Samantha's toga. \n\nHe was very distracting. He loomed over Samantha, so he must have been close to 6\"5, and he seemed to be made of muscle. He was so dark as to almost appear blue, and the shorts he wore were tight and left nothing to the imagination. His bulge was sizeable, and every eye in the room was on him. \n\nSamantha handed him a pipe connected to a cylinder she held, and the man took a puff from it. Plumes of dark smoke filled the basement, shrouding it in black for a moment before the fog receded. \n\nWhat it left behind almost made me faint. \n\nThe man, already huge, was now gigantic. His head brushed against the ceiling, and he was wider across as Samantha was tall. His dark skin seemed to shine, and every muscle on his body had swelled to inhuman proportions, including his package. It had torn through the shorts, flopping down against his powerful thigh like a sleeping cobra. I estimated it to be about 2 feet long, and as thick as my neck, perched atop balls the size of watermelons. \n\nAround him, every girl fell to her knees and bowed. Some hands drifted beneath their robes, and I could tell that some of the girls were moaning. \n\nThe man, no, the _beast_ picked up Samantha as though she weighed nothing at all and slammed her down on the altar, tearing her toga from her body in one easy rip. \n\nShe seemed like a doll compared to him, and just as fragile. Any right-minded woman would have been terrified, as I was, but Samantha just smiled. She cupped the Beast's cheek and stroked it gently, apparently oblivious to the rising serpent between his legs. \n\nShe brought her mouth up to his and they kissed, sparking an explosion of lust all around them. Girls discarded their robes, bringing out bottles of champagne and beginning to caress one another. A few took puffs from the pipe, and began a frenzied dance of passion, grabbing the nearest girl and bending her over until she was a screaming, cumming mess. \n\nThe whole scene was wrong, so wrong. But I couldn't look away. \n\nIn the centre of it all, Samantha was sat astride the beast, rubbing his now 27 inch cock against her cunt. She laid it across her belly, and giggled when it poked between her breasts. \n\nThere was no way it should have been able to fit inside of her. It should have torn her in two. But Samantha grabbed a bottle of champagne, poured it over the obscene member, and began to slide it into her cunt. \n\nAt that point, I looked away. That was enough to break the spell, and I realised that I was freezing and starving. Fuck returning the purse if it meant having to walk in on that..... that...... \n\nWhatever that was. \n\nI stumbled to my feet and ran, brushing past well-dressed couples returning from the theatre and late-night shopping trips. I didnt stop running until I was safe in my little flat, pressed firmly against the door as if the beast was on the other side, waiting to be let in. \n\nJanet, my roommate, emerged from her room in her pyjamas, rubbing sleep out of her eye. She blinked at the state of me, and frowned. \n\n\"Kara? What is it?\". \n\nI didn't answer. I couldn't answer. My mind was still in that basement, watching that lewd scene of debauchery and perversion. \n\nIt couldn't have been real. And yet.... a part of me wished it was. Because a part of me wasn't repulsed by what I'd seen. A part of me wanted in. \n\nAnd it was that part that won out. \n\n***** \n\nHi guys! \n\nAnother rather long one for you, but as anyone who knows my work will tell you, I like them long. And thick. And bla- \n\nAnyway, I hoped you liked that. Please excuse any errors or mistakes as I just sort of vomited it onto my keyboard in a stream of consciousness, and I'm too tired to proof-read my work. What am I, a published author? \n\n(I wish) \n\nThis story would focus on Kara, a poor student who's managed to get a scholarship to Cambford, one of the most prestigious universities in the world. Whilst there, she accidentally spies on a secret society during one of their illicit meetings, and finds herself drawn into a world of sex, lust, perversion and, of course because it's me, black cock worship. \n\nThis society is centred around Masfatah, an ancient African fertility God (that I made up) who briefly possesses a willing male conduit so he can fuck and put his seed into willing female receptacles, slowly raising an army of superior men and women so he can return and conquer the earth. \n\nSo yeah, a bit more high-stakes than the Chess Society. Or maybe it isn't, I've never played chess. \n\nWe would follow Kara as she tries to gain entry to this society, maybe secretly attending one of their masked events and worming her way into the group by proving herself to Masfatah. His approval of her may spark a jealousy between her and Samantha, the high priestess of this Society who sees Kara as a threat to her position. \n\nSo, lots to enjoy! \n\nIf this sounds like fun to you, then please send me a message. I am looking for a good writer who can provide detail, and ideally you'd have as few limits as possible, preferably none. \n\nHit me up!",

            "selftext": "This is going to be about more or less sweet, sometimes even loving and always consensual encounters. Don't say you haven't been warned.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSociety has evolved since AI has taken over all governing, from the municipal level all the way up to the UN. With politics being handled rationally and in a far-sighted manner for the first time in the history of mankind, economy started blooming worldwide. This was consolidated by the radical reorganisation of work and employment. The manufacturing industries have almost completely switched from human workforce to robots. With labour costs radically axed down the states were able to ensure a decent standard of living and accommodation for every citizen. With no one needing to work competitiveness and envy soon started to disappear. Of course this doesn't mean everybody is idle and nobody worked. Most folks switched to the service sector pursuing something they are really happy with. I for one have a small \"Seed2Blunt\" business with my girlfriend growing flowers. We often visit our local residence for the elderly and provide them with prerolled blunts and flowers. It's a service to society that makes us happy. And them, of course. Nobody frowns upon my low level occupation, just as no one frowns upon the businessmen and women running those huge robotised factories earning much more money. We're equal. People respect each other. Racism is eradicated, it just stopped existing with the advent of equality. What started in Scandinavia quickly spread over the Western World, India, China, then all of Asia and Africa. Maybe the best thing about this is religions heading south really, really hard. Catholicism is down to a one man show in a shack outside Rome. Islam is reduced to a source for stereotypical memes. Like being married to more than one woman or sexually interacting with relatives. Same with the Mormons. Most of the Free Churches have become hippie cults propagating the exact opposite of what they used to preach. The Church of Scientology is rumoured to have committed collective suicide during the transition phase, but that's something the UN won't be disclosing for the next 42 years. Anyway, this doesn't belong here.  \n\nSo basically the world has become some kind of happy hippie lala-land. Sure, global warming has come a long way, but at least it's under control. And people have adapted. Besides, it helps my agricultural endeavour. Climate change is now merely a question of clothing accordingly. Although in a business environment shirt and tie have been retained, trousers have long since been replaced by skirts and bermudas no matter your gender. Even the Kiwi Walk Shorts had their revival. Classy, look 'em up. In a casual environment just wear little clothing and wear light clothing. Wear loose clothing. Let the fresh breeze tickle your senses. And your nipples, ~~if~~ it's appropriate.  \nAlso municipal areas have been restructured from scratch with lots small parks, fountains and a plethora of plants. Some stretches of what once were main streets have been converted to pools, flanked by grass and trees, populated by folk who push all kinds of vending carts. These measures not only helped keep the cities cooler, it also motivated people to keep their environment clean. Which, of course, makes perfect sense. You don't want to litter a place you enjoy. And also there's no need to litter a park with kleenex when there's enough water to clean your hands. Or your tummy.  \n&amp;nbsp;    \n\nInevitably, all of these changes ultimately culminated in an erosion of what once was known as \"morals\". People literally became more and more \"shameless\".  \nThe concept of \"shame\" is almost extinct, pushed back into its refuge circling around some things bathroom and some dermatological conditions (you see, society isn't perfect, but we're on a good way).   Said businessmen for example. Often can they be seen celebrating a deal with a good cigar in their mouths, a glass of whiskey in one hand and their other hand leisurely stroking their pricks. Or, after a few more drinks, the other guys' pricks. Why would anybody object? They don't mean to and the *are not* harassing anybody. The waitress for example. Yes, she might roll her eyes because \"not the boys and their same old crap again\". Yet she doesn't object. Live and let live. Or she might push her sore feet into some of the guys' lap and have him give them a proper massage to revive her toes and soles. This way all parties benefit. This is how society works. Be nice. It's really that simple.  \nWhy would I be angry at a pair of girls rolling around purring, giggling and moaning while eating out  their arses on one of my newly sown parcels? With some of my girlfriends flowers tucked behind their ears! Be nice. You can negotiate. They sure have something to offer. Maybe they operate a tiny bakery and produce the fucking. best. bread. in. town.  \nBe sensible.  \nYes, this is a free world, but that doesn't mean you shove your genitals into the pilot's face when she's on approach. Ask the steward to help you out and do it in a timely fashion. Catch the pilot post debriefing and then show your appreciation for the smooth landing. Or just outright tell her you find her hot and need her to soothe that throbbing piece of warm flesh under your skirt.  \nDon't yell at the couple noisily fucking across the street. You might be the next to be noisily fucking and you are totally entitled to do so. The third revision of the Charter of Human Rights says so. Or you might as well join that couple, it's not that hard. If they object for some reason you could still relieve yourself while watching them. Or just relieve yourself right now and thank them for the aural support tomorrow.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;  \nI hope I could make clear what I'm up to with this.  \nThis is a world of casual sex. A free for all where everybody *enjoys* **consensual** encounters. A world where potentially everything is on the table, as long as it is, well, consensual. Which makes it somewhat hard to name kinks (maybe the main kink is finding out how far we would go). Definite hard limits are scat, gore, vore, impregnation/breeding, humiliation/degradation and basically everything noncon. Also bestiality, underage, incest, celebs. Anal to mouth, yuck! Everything else is negotiable and/or depending on dynamics and our characters ability to seduce the other into performing acts of dubious morals.   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo who are you? My girlfriend, the flower girl? One of her customers? A random encounter? Some kind of authority monitoring and evaluating measures to uphold public order? Has your character been sleeping under a rock for some decades and is now struggling to cope with this utopian cesspool? Hell, you might even be a Futanari gender studies master from outer space studying society on Terra.  \nI really don't care.  \nJust be comfortable with her, be kinda nice and we'll get along.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nHope to hear from you soon!  \n&amp;nbsp;\nGern auch auf deutsch, just don't use reddit chat.  \n[Kink list](https://imgur.com/KzewUgg), FWIW.",

            "selftext": "When they go out, Ben and Allie look like a pretty conventional couple - a tall, masculine, outgoing boyfriend and a petite, adorable, soft-spoken girlfriend. When they're back at home, and Ben is struggling not to cum too quickly as he rides Allie's massive cock, well... then there's a slightly less conventional vibe. But neither of them has worried about convention for quite some time. They're perfectly happy with their arrangement, and even comfortable enough to speak openly about it with friends.\n\nOf course, it wasn't always that way! I want to go back to a time before Ben and Allie got together and they were just two regular college roommates, when Ben had never even considered being with a non-cis woman and Allie was still going by Alex even as she started to transition in private. My general thought is that Ben will have had his suspicions for a while. He'll notice that Alex has seemed different in lots of subtle ways, putting off feminine vibes for reasons that are hard to pin down at first. Maybe something more concrete, like seeing that Alex his clearly growing breasts, will prompt him to finally ask.\n\nIn terms of their dynamic, I imagine that Allie will be on the shy and submissive side, but also be a natural top. Ben will be more confident and more traditionally masculine in most ways, and he'll probably assume he's a top at first, but will discover that he actually prefers to be the bottom. I think it's a fun way of playing around with gender roles and expectations. Plus I just think it's really hot when a guy cums from getting fucked by his hung trans partner.\n\nThis is definitely a long-term sort of thing, but I do hope to keep the pacing reasonable. I imagine the events of the story spanning at least several months, so it will be important to fast-forward at times rather than writing out every single day. Please include some ideas in your response! For the characters, for their dynamic, for scenes that might take place, etc. I've left things fairly open-ended so there's room for brainstorming. :)\n\n*****\n\nKinks: Affection, teasing and edging, outercourse (such as titfucking), measuring, bulges (and the difficulties that come with them), body worship (in both directions), romance, flirting, anal / pegging, trans / futa, lots of cum and precum, flaccid play, breasts and butts and other curves (both big and small), self-sucking / autofellatio, various outfits and clothed sex, oral (both directions), reversals of sex and gender expectations, toys, parity (both partners getting lots of pleasure, regardless of dominant or submissive preferences), humor and silliness, size differences / comparisons / measuring, slice of life\n\nLimits: Abuse and cruelty, pain, bathroom stuff, more or less the usual\n\nI also have a [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/9iIltW4.png) if you want more detail.\n\nLooking forward to some orange envelopes! Messages only, please. Chat notifications have never worked for me, so I probably won't see anything sent that way.",

From the latex clothes, the constant bondage, the different punishments I make for you. \n\nSo I've got two or three ways in mind on how we could do this. A slice of life of you as my latex submissive spouse and me as your hard working meek and short on the outside but strict, assertive, and loving dom on the inside. Or maybe we start with me slowly turning you into a sub latex housewife. Or we could work together to make a fun plot. Maybe going to a kinky resort that doubles as a training academy for you? Or maybe we find a dominant to make us both housewife/pets submissives to them.\n\nIf interested put your favorite food and color in the heading of the dm.\n\nMy kinks: Worldbuilding, Headshaves, latex, ponyplay, petplay, bodywriting, wet and messy, breeding, piercings, feminization, love, fancy but restricting outfits, romance, veiling, tpe, forced outfit control, diet control, consent, tight bondage, adventure!, teases and edges, chastity, orgasm control, humiliation, kind misogyny, degrading speech, breath play, machine bondage, covered in layers, limited movement, diet control, sci-fi or fantasy additions to the bondage, tattoos, armbinders, collars, treated as a prize, and gags.",

Your mind is so active and your body so full of hormones you can't help but day dream and think about what might happen with him. Is it his control and power over you that makes him so hot or the fact that he is an older attractive man. We both know that this crush is a bit more then harmless and that you spent alot more time thinking about him when you were alone in bed at night.....\n\nIf this sparks your brain and gets you all foggy and hot them come hit me up and I'm sure we can explore your thoughts a bit more.

There's something so entertaining, so fun, so human about sharing things with another person. We each gain a person to bounce ideas off of and a new perspective that can lead to so much more. There's nothing quite like that thrill when you meet someone with whom you match so well and are able to talk for hours.\n\nBut it's so much more than *just* about the smut. It's forging a real connection with somebody, establishing a friendship where you can chat and share things with one another on a regular casual basis. That's my goal here, and I hope you're interested.\n\nBut this is DPP so this prompt should have some kind of foundation, huh? Well it can really be anything, we just need to meet and share our interests with one another, but I'll start. For writing my favorite types of roleplays are D&amp;D-esque adventures, usually I do the DMing, but not always. The freedom to explore a world, interact with NPCs, acquire loot and items, all with a dash of NSFW fun that you'd never find a real D&amp;D table. Coming up in second place would be a variety of R34 charcters that I'd be interested in seeing in all manner of situations, some favorites are: World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Genshin Impact, Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Fate/Grand Order, Pokemon, and more.\n\nSo, if any of that sounds like fun, and you're looking for a friend, shoot me a DM. I'll most likely direct you to my Discord, it's my preference. Thanks for reading and hope to hear from you soon.\n\n(Looking for women, not men playing women, sorry.)",

A lack of it will most definitely get you sorted into the \"no\" pile.  \n\nWhen it comes to what I'm looking for specifically, I have a variety of scenes I enjoy a lot and would love to play out. I won't go into too much detail here, since I enjoy building these scenarios together, rather than just sticking to whatever I've thought of initially.  \n\nBrothers stuck at home - this one is pretty straightforward as probably will be all the others, two brothers home alone, fucking, crossdressing, stroking eachother and maybe even involving a family pet or two. (this can obviously work with a brother-sister setup as well, tho I much prefer having two bothers involved)\n\nCucking type beat - Very simple, the usual hot woman, unattractive, pathetic creep man setup. As far as cuckolding goes, I prefer it to be extremely malicious and not caring whatsoever. If I'm going to get cucked, I want to feel like my character would be weeping in the fetal position by the end. \n\nBarnyard fuckery - Two partners filming REPULSIVE porn at a farm, both consenting, preferably, tho I love the idea of forcefully involving someone who isn't.\n\n------  \n\nThese three prompts should generally give you an idea of what I enjoy, but here's my list of kinks and limits as well. Don't let my prompts limit you, though, as long as it's filthy and fits the general kink-vibe, I can guarantee I'll be all over it! \n\nKinks: degradation, humiliation, all forms of abuse, noncon, scat, piss, vomit, smegma, large amounts of cum, preggo, incest, filming, exhibitionism, heavy beatings, willing subs, defiant subs turned willing, slavery, petplay, beast, ass play, light gore (as in, some blood, but don't expect guts to be spilling), fisting, insertions, and many more! \n\nLimits: diapers, any kind of furry shit (like inflation and such) \n\nFeel free to hit me up in either PMs or chat, both are fine by me!",

            "selftext": "Group sex is super hot of course, but the only thing that makes it hotter is sharing a girl your love with a friend you really close with! I mean what better way to do a friend a favour: letting them cum balls deep in a girl you\u2019re really fond of? Or better yet, cumming inside her together simultaneously? I can think of so many girls off the top of my head I\u2019d absolutely love to watch get ploughed! And there\u2019s so much to the kink than just the sex: knowing that someone you like has been penetrated by a friend just sounds so hot! Another aspect of sharing girls I love is double penetration: I think close friends can\u2019t get any closer than pressing their dicks against eachother to fit into the same right hole! It\u2019s a bit taboo, but just so exciting! \n\nI\u2019ve always loved that particular dynamic of having a friend to talk about and share lewd things with. I love discussing hentai and talking about the girls I love most, and being able to do that with someone who finds it equally as exciting has been something I\u2019ve always loved about close friendships! I\u2019m hoping to bond over not only talking about my favourite girls with you, but also hearing about the ones you\u2019ve come to love as well! If you\u2019re also a fan of JRPGs, anime, and 2D smut in general then I\u2019d really love to talk about it all with you! \n\nI\u2019m interested in most kinks that aren\u2019t anything extreme like scat, gore and vore. I\u2019m hoping to meet someone who\u2019s equally as talkative so we can discuss scenarios and situations that we\u2019d love to find ourselves in, and introduce eachother to new ideas too (emphasis on the discussion aspect, as I really want this to be a two way exchange to really make our ideas exciting to share!). I\u2019m also hoping to forge a friendship alongside talking about lewd things too, so the more wholesome the better! Can\u2019t wait to meet you guys!",

            "selftext": "Hello there. I'm NP and this post is obviously directed to all of the cucks, sissies, betas, feminines, twinks, bottoms and femboys who want someone to take care of them, to completely dominate them and to make them cum a lot. \n\nIn this role play you can obviously play whatever type of character do you want, you can even olay as yourself and write in 1st person (I can obviously write in 3rd person as well). You can be an assertive, maybe shy or even bratty, it's totally fine with me since at the end of the day we all know what's gonna happen if you behave like a bad boy with me. \n\nMy character is gonna be Edward. He's a pretty big man, he's 6'2. He has short undercut black hair, deep green eyes and a very handsome face. His body is very attractive as well, he has a lean but musuclar physique, few tattoo on his back and two piercings on his ears and one on the tip of his thick cock. He's personality is quite cocky, he's a very confident person. He is rude to strangers and although he doesn't let it see to anyone he's a pretty kind and soft person to those that he cares about. \n\nThere are few main kinks that I want to be included in the roleplay, the rest is up to you.\n\nI'm really into size comparisons/size difference. I'm not just talking about the body size, but also our dick sizes. I really love seeing a way smaller dicklet next to mine, a more feminine, small, soft and adorable dick. I just love small dicks, the way they way those small dicks hang on those grape size balls is just perfect. I want to just put mine on it with nonchalant, crushing it without even noticing it since mine is much more heavier than your baby dick. \n\nI'm also really into cuckolding. I know lots of you cute baby dick boys love being cucked, and I love cucking you cuties too, but I also love cucking someone with you. Have you ever thought about how does to feels? Being wanted by your partner/ex partner while you're being completely owner by a manlier man... I know lots of you might be into that stuff. Obviously I also into cucking you, maybe having sex with your sister, mother, girlfriend, best friend or sissy brother, I'm totally into it. \n\nMy last main kink is orgasm control and denial. That speaks for itself, I don't really think I should explain how it works. I like giving that and receiving that, I love shaking out of despair and helplessness while my assertive power bottom controls my orgasm, but also love making my bottoms shake and make them thrust into the air helplessly, wanting to cum after hours of edging. \n\nThat's it, I'm finally done with my main kinks. I hope they're not too weird hahahaha.\n\nTalking about the plot, the story where we are gonna roleplay, I'm totally okay with everything that looks fun, exciting and interesting. I'm okay with something fantasy, futuristic and normal slice of life. I have quite few prompts that I wanna play, but we can decide about it together later. For now I would just want you to send me in the chat or in the PM your character, kinks and maybe even a plot you wanna play. I'm mainly searching for a long term rp partner, someone that maybe can write english well (and not good). I'm looking forward to it, beta boys. Can't wait to play with you cute dicklets and your tight sissy asses.\n\nKinks for those who search:\nsph, spe, ruined orgasm, control orgasm, public sex, hidden sex, rough sex, gay, femboy, sissy, size difference, size comparison, anal, cuckolding.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m looking for a romantic roleplay, all genders welcome. \n\n\u2014\nReally, I\u2019m looking for anything romantic, a scenario where two people have a strong love for one another. This can be a totally original plot, or even pull from pop culture. For example, maybe we\u2019re two detectives on the force, like in Brooklyn 99. Or, we\u2019re millionaire and assistant like Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. I\u2019m familiar with a lot of different references so feel free to ask. The only area I\u2019m not familiar with is anime, so bear that in mind. \n\nA basic start could be a \u201cmorning after\u201d situation. Two people (strangers or not) wake up together in bed after a wild night out. Who are they? How did they get here? There\u2019s a lot of different possibilities! \n\nAnother start could be a classic meet cute. We could be two people who meet by chance, and feel an unexplainable pull to one another. It\u2019s cheesy, I know, but nevertheless fun! \n\nWe don\u2019t have to use that start however. If you have an idea, great! I\u2019d love to collaborate and build on it. I also have a few starters in mind that I can share if the above doesn\u2019t work for you. \n\u2014\n\n**Feel free to bring your kinks! However, I just ask that sex is not our main focus please. I would love to spend time on backstory and world making, as well as details and romance. It\u2019s fun to have a slice of life type of scenario going on.**\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of the \u201cfirst comes love, then comes marriage, then comes so-and-so with a baby carriage\u201d long term for roleplay. If that\u2019s not your style, no worries! It\u2019s optional. \n\n**When you message, let me know what your character is like, any details you\u2019d like to include/questions you have, and your favorite movie. Note that I only respond to responses that are longer than three sentences**\n\nOnly PM, no chat please!!!!!",

Tell me all about your love for balls. What are your favourite testicles? Low hanging? Hairless? Imagine yourself in front of my fictional character. His balls are exactly your preference. What do you do? How do you please them? They are heavy, full, dripping with precum, waiting on your welcoming mouth to devour them.\n\nPicture references, gifs, links are welcome &lt;3\n\nIf you want to exchange ideas, PM or Reddit Chat :)\n\nKinks: mainly ball worship, but also creampies, cum play, ahegao face, blowjobs, ...\n\n-----\n\nWe will chat about how to service and please the balls. Your favourite way of caring for testicles. I will be providing my view from the opposite side, past experiences, favourite ways, ...\n\nI like to keep my balls shaved. They are pretty bulbous and heavy. As such, my sack is hanging low. Although it tends to rise and tighten quickly when I'm about to bust a fat load. It's okay if you prefer hairy, but I keep mine hairless.\n\nI like to use toys for additional pleasure as well. For example cock and ball rings really enhance the experience. The balls are tightened, firm and easy to access for you.\n\nThe best way of pleasing such a heavy ballsack is to start kissing it from the underside. It simply feels great. The tickling in my nads and excitement as your breath calms my sack... Lick your way up and make sure to get it all nice and wet. Don't shy away from using your hands too! Always grab the sack firmly. If you like it rough, I might try to choke you with my heavy ballsack filling your mouth.",

            "selftext": "**((See below for tldr of plot - super short explanation: interested in ballbusting plot, possible incest. Open to other stuff. Enjoy!**\n\n**Also, this is a fantasy RP by an adult and for other adults!))**\n\nIt was something of a puzzle to me why you so enjoyed our routine TV-watching sessions together, but it was still a routine ritual of our relationship. Shamelessly, I took the practice as an opportunity to ogle you from across the room, hoping that, your attention fixed on the TV, you wouldn't notice my glances (sometimes bordering on stares) scanning up and down your body on the couch. There were a few times when it seemed that you almost caught me, but I assured myself that I was completely subtle, totally unnoticed. I turn my attention back to the TV, my attention only vaguely following the plot of whatever show we're watching...\n\nI perk up, however, at the scene on screen: our main character, the heroine, approaches a man seductively, flaunting her accentuated curves for him, enthralling him until his defenses are down... placing her hands on his shoulders, she gives him a seductive wink before delivering a hard knee to his nuts, dropping him to his knees. With a teasing giggle, she leaves him groaning in pain. I cringe a bit at the scene, but you burst out with a chuckle, apparently amused by my silence.\n\n\"What, don't find it funny?\" you ask with characteristic sarcasm. \"Feeling a bit of sympathy?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" I respond, bewildered. \"No, it's just stupid.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" you reply with genuine curiosity.\n\n\"I mean, I think the whole meme of nut-shots is silly,\" I explain. \"It's just a dumb joke, and I don't get it. Getting hit in the balls doesn't actually hurt much at all.\"\n\nNot that I would know. I'd never even been kicked in the nuts before. Well, there was that one time... when we were both younger, you lightly tapped me there by accident during a game - barely any contact at all. Nonetheless, I had convinced myself that I had survived a kick to the balls with no pain at all - either I just had balls or steel, or the whole thing is just a lie! I assured myself that this was just a running joke that girls thought was funny and guys played along with, maybe for sympathy. Part of being man was being invulnerable, and I wanted to put up an air of manly invulnerability, not just to impress you, but for a sense of security.\n\n\"Oh really...?\" you ask, now with less-than-genuine curiosity... more like skepticism. \"And you're so sure of this because...?\"\n\n\"Well, I uh...\" I stumble for words, suddenly becoming more self-conscious. \"It just doesn't. I don't know - I know my own body.\"\n\n\"How confident are you then?\" you ask, leaning forward. \"I'm not sure I believe you.\"\n\nAnd it was in that moment that I realized, with a tremor of fear, that I had made a mistake...\n\n***\n\n**Hey, /r/dirtypenpals! John here (on a new account)! So, I'm interested in an RP centered on ballbusting, but I'm open to including all sorts of other possibilities as well! This isn't the only possible prompt I'd be up for (open to ideas, and have some others of my own), but it's a fun one I'd like to play with. My biggest kinks, apart from ballbusting (just what it sounds like, if you haven't figured it out - I love the pain, humiliation, and vulnerability of having my nuts kicked, kneed, squeezed, slapped, or just threatened), are teasing, edging, femdom (generally mild femdom, but open to just about anything), and incest (brother-sister especially!). I usually prefer at least semi-realistic RPs, with plenty of dialogue and description of our characters thoughts, and with things escalating slowly over time. Good banter and teasing is generally worth more than immediate action.\n\nAnyway, if you're interested, send me a PM! I'll be active much of tonight, but I check on routinely and am always open to setting something up and continuing long-term. Hit me up!**",

Who or what she is exactly doesn\u2019t really matter. No one remembers meeting her, and she affects genders differently.\nFor women the affect is mostly physical. Over the days/weeks after meeting, their bodies change to be more\u2026 for lack of a better term \u2018fertile.\u2019 A fuller bust, wider hips, etc. Nothing too extreme, but definitely noticeable.\nFor men, the affects are psychological. They leave with an overpowering need to breed, to the point where it overcomes any other concerns. They don\u2019t care who they\u2019re fucking or where, they just need to spread their genes, preferably in a taboo manner. Maybe a father taking his collage age daughter as he sees her step out of the shower, or maybe a sister is complaining to her brother that her tops just don\u2019t seem to fit anymore, only for him to rip the clothes from her body and pin her to the wall, etc. I\u2019m happy to hear pairing suggestions/situations.\nEdit: one I\u2019m rather interested in right now is a professional, office worker daughter coming to visit her dad for the weekend, and you can probably guess where that leads\nHow strong that mental spell is is something we can discuss too. Maybe it came from nowhere, or maybe it just amplified hidden desires. What\u2019s important is that once the deed is down it wears off, so our poor pair have to live with the consequences.\nSo yeah, I think that\u2019s it. Looking forward to hearing from you!\nLimits include: bathroom stuff, excessive violence, underage, etc.\nDm me here!",

Whatever horror movie you think you can pull off, I'm ears to listen to and tweak if I don't like it. Whether it's Hostel, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, Cabin in the Woods, any other horror movie if you want to pitch them.\n\nAs a general rule I think Nightmare on Elm Street is going to be the most difficult to pull off, but if you're really eager to give it a shot I'll listen.\n\nI am looking for someone creative to play against who is willing to play as the killer in this game.\n\nI'm not really looking for rape necessarily, depending on the movie you choose maybe there's a way to fit something in there, but broadly speaking this is just a whole bunch of pretty girls getting butchered.\n\nThat doesn't mean there isn't a sexual element to it, in general I would like a twist on the format to kind of suit a bit of a molestation/humiliation kink. I'm not looking for them to be raped one by one, but something that adds a slight molestation/groping/spanking/whatever element to it might be fun.\n\nSo as an example: If we were using the movie Hostel as our reference point, it would be just like the film Hostel, but the clientele would be more specifically targeted, where the victims are all women, and the clients are all men, more notably, misogynistic men who hate and despise beautiful women, and so when they enter the room with the girl, they would naturally be inclined to play with them a little bit...groping them, stripping them, humiliating them, etc...before doing whatever they're going to do.\n\nDifferent spins like that for all of the different worlds.\n\nI don't play over PM so don't bother, and I don't play over KIK or any of those programs, just looking for reddit pms please.",

For those of you keeping score at home, I am 6'2\", 220lbs, short brown hair, hazel eyes, broad shoulders, and still in decent shape for an old dude.\n\nI am searching for a smart, funny, confident woman to get to know better. I am not looking to meet in person, just to have a good time here on the interwebs.\n\nI do enjoy roleplaying, and am happy to discuss potential roles with you. I tend to lean on the vanilla side, but do have an open mind, so let me know what you like!\n\nAnd to get the conversation started, here are a couple of random questions to break the ice. I look forward to your responses!\n\n1. What is your favorite season, and why?\n\n2. What is a sexual fantasy you have been able to fulfill?\n\n3. Name three people, living or dead, you would want to have dinner with.\n\n4. What is your go-to bathing suit for a day at the beach and/or pool? Bonus points if you provide a link!\n\nI sincerely hope to hear from you!\n\nCheers,\n\nMark",

Perhaps the difference is that I'm a classic man; not a guy.\n\nMaybe that's why I enjoy the things I do. A woman in high heels, a pencil skirt, and lipstick (as 90% of my posts here show). But the flip side of that coin, of enjoying an experienced woman, is the girl. The girl you induct into womanhood.\n\nEvery time I'm on the street (or was on the street, back in the halcyon days when people saw one another) and see a woman in heels -- I think of what she'd look like on her back, those same heels on my shoulders. But when I see a girl in chucks -- Chuck Taylor converses, for those not in the know -- I think almost the same thing. Almost. I think of her on her knees in front of me, those shoes splayed out behind her; I think of what she'd look like in that classic plaid skirt and her hair up, of letting her know what I like. And what I expect. Perhaps that, too, is classic; men want a woman who knows what she's doing as well as her little sister, a girl completely inexperienced who can be shaped. Molded. Trained.\n\nI'm really not much for RP, but I have found some delightful chat partners of late...so if you have a pair of chucks in your closet or three and are interested in thirty-something bearded men with a slightly dominant streak and a ring on their finger...let's chat. In your subject line, let me know the color of your favorite chucks, and how old they are.",

Prodigious with whip and flogger alike, you skillfully tied up men and women with intricate knots, bending their bodies into beautifully bound shapes. By the end of it they would all quiver and beg for mercy, all while you collected a hefty fee from it all.\n\nYour latest client came in the form of an unmarked manila envelope. A large amount of cash, and a piece of paper with an address written on it. An unusual, and certainly suspicious request, but discretion was part of your job. You packed your usual 'gear' in a black bag and headed downtown, to a warehouse where your client was waiting.\n\nBehind a rusted chain link fence and a broken padlock you entered the building. An empty, concrete building with pillars and chains greeted you. Before you could call out, a hood was thrown over your head, arms grabbing you from behind.\n\n\"I've got you now, bitch.\"\n\n*Later...*\n\nThe hood is finally taken off. Blood rushes to your head as you dangle helplessly upside down. Your wrists are bound together behind your back, your legs spread wide and shackled to a metal bar that is chained to a ceiling beam.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nLocal dominatrix gets a taste of her own medicine. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/LUnr25h.png",

Experiences you wish to share or talk about in regards to an encounter you've had with the bigger size are welcomed as well. Could be that you're married and have only been able to stick to your fantasies, wishing to know what you missed out on? If perhaps you made a mistake vowing to a lesser man or missed your chance at something bigger. Whether you've had experiences or none yet we can share a chat about it.\n\nWe can talk about it in different ways; the struggles, first time experience, concerns and questions you may have but never gotten to ask them. Conversation doesn't necessarily have to be sexual as it can also be to fufil your curiousity or insight. Please title your message with a \"nickname\" you'd give a larger cock to know you've read this far. We can go back and forth with fantasies, questions, ideas or curiousities you have. Maybe you're curious what it's like to have one or the problems that comes with having it. Let your mind run wild.\n\nSome of my experiences and topics I've shared are these:\n\nHave had my ups &amp; downs, with my first girlfriend our relationship was well but our sexual relationship basically stopped at the tip. It was a learning experience for both of us least to say. Have had some encounters with married women whom were curious about size long after sealing the deal with their husbands, wondering if they had missed their chance once &amp; for all or what it would have been like. A blessing as a curse as can be said. A lot of times I'm asked if it runs in the family or if there are other features that correlate to it. If I've used it to my advantage or ran into problems because it's it.\n\nWhichever the case I'm sure we can build together a prompt &amp; scene with shared interests or chat about the topic.",

            "selftext": "At long last, the dragon-tyrant lies dead at the bottom of his moat, and as the smoke clears, so does the way to the tower, at the top of which is your prize - the long-imprisoned, long-suffering price, kidnapped from the kingdom, and for whose return you're sure to be granted a generous reward by the happy royal parents. And who knows - perhaps romance will blossom, like in the fairy tales, and your reward will be even greater! Or so you think, as you sheathe your sword and trudge up the stairs to retrieve me.\n\nOf course, the fairy stories never detail just how annoying royal hostages can be after you rescue them. You've had your great adventure and you've slayed your dragon, but now you need to deal with the whiny diva of a prince that you're tasked with escorting back home. You've battled through fire to build your legacy as a saviour of the kingdom... but can you get through this bs?\n\n\\---\n\nSo! This is intended to be a relatively light-hearted and fun take on the princess-in-the-tower trope, with role reversal elements, such that it's a dudesel-in-distress plot. The brave knight, having successfully gotten this far, finds that her quarry is an eye-rolling difficult travel partner, and hilarity ensues. And perhaps romance ensues as well!\n\nThere are obviously some good/funny light femdom themes that could be explored, which I'm open enough to. But it could also be played other ways - happy to fill out/discuss details. :)",

While I am a switch, when I chat I tend to lean more dominant, but I'll adapt to whatever you're comfortable with. \n\nKinkwise I love everything, from tame things like making out and cumplay, all the way down to animals, transformation, rapeplay. It can be hard to know what to put in your first message so just tell me a kink you're into or a subject you wanna chat about.\n\n I know lots of curious guys browse this subreddit, I was bicurious at one point so don't be afraid to come say hi, I don't bite unless you ask nicely :)\n\n Please use Reddit PMs when you message and I hope to hear from you soon :D",

Now I'm back to hopefully find some fun women who'd love to play out an idea I used to post in the past. \r  \n\r  \nThis is mainly for those who are fans of cheating and sneaking around. The idea is that I would play your boyfriend's best friend, someone he has known for years and grown up with. When you started to date him, at first you hated that I was always hanging out with him. But then, things started to change a little bit. Your hatred for me always being around kind of turned into something more. \r  \n\r  \nYou started to notice me and it was obvious I was doing the same. We'd check each other out when we'd all hang out in the basement of the house, watching football or playing video games. Even when we all went out for lunch or dinner, we kind of made it habit to sit across from each other all the time. \r  \n\r  \nIt even got to the point that when we weren't hanging out, we'd be texting each other. But of course your boyfriend wasn't suspicious of anything and just saw us texting each other as friends. At least, that's how it was at first. \r  \n\r  \nOur texts started to get a little more personal and a little more risky.\r  \n\r  \nYou'd send me pictures of yourself in the morning, asking how you looked, what outfit you should wear, things like that. There was obvious flirting between the two of us when we'd text. But of course, I was your boyfriend's best friend. \r  \n\r  \nBut then, things happened. \r  \n\r  \n...\r  \n\r  \nAnd from there, we will start and write out roleplay of what happens between the two of us. \r  \n\r  \nSome of my favorite kinks are anal, oral, spanking, creampies, first time with black cock, and cock worshipping. Of course there's many more kinks I enjoy too. \r  \n\r  \nLimits are simple. No bathroom stuff and no bondage.\r  \n\r  \nSo, feel free to message me if you're looking for a black man tonight.",

All of the cops were sluts for Big Black Cock, it didn't matter on the age of the cop, or how long they had been working, all of them would do anything to please their black masters, with it quickly becoming a ritual for them all to get tattoos to brand them as a Queen of Spades. \n\nAnd due to this remaining a secret, the government was quick to implement a new rule for all departments - replace any men working there with women, and to see how crime would disappear over night.\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\nSo a pretty loose idea, which I mainly just wrote down to try and get it to form together in my head. But the basic plot is that a city has its police force replaced with White Women, who are just a few steps away from doing whatever their new masters say.\n\nAs for your character, I'm up for either having you being part of the very first department, or joining one that has already fallen for BBC and finding yourself being dragged in. Or we could even have it involved the whole police force. Perhaps even turning the Precinct into a Church for BBC\n\nKinks for this are black supremacy, tattoos, collars, forced bi, cock worship, body worship, fat shaming, name calling, piercings, cumplay, raceplay, petplay, humiliation, degradation, and so much more. I'm up for basically anything just say it and I'll see about fitting it in. \n\nJust message me if you're interested",

I'm looking for a man who can appreciate the original lonely farmer's daughter.  Are you ready to plow my furrows and sow your wild oats?  Then just hit me up.  Olympians need not apply!*\n\nImagine for a moment, if you will, that the gods and goddesses of myth and legend were all real.  All still out there, all living their lives the same as they ever did -- just having adapted to the modern world.  Perhaps a little more subtle these days -- after all, you don't hear many news stories about people being turned into spiders -- but still themselves.  The only difference is that after so many centuries of gods sleeping around and creating little demigods all over the place... well, a lot of the goddesses have gotten fed up with it.  And so, having utilized the recent creation of legal divorce, they've turned to modern technology to remedy their issues.\n\n*Freyja -- Blonde-haired, blue-eyed bombshell is tired of looking for her (ex!-) husband who's never around.  Seeking a man who can properly appreciate the company of the goddess of love, sex, and beauty.  I promise that if you're what I'm looking for, I'll make sure you understand just why those are my domains...*\n\nEnter \"Golden Apple\".  A dating app for goddesses tired of the selfish attitude of their male counterparts, who have decided to look to humanity to have their needs met.  Rumors spread online about the program, of course, but only those deemed worthy would be allowed to access it, having the app appear on their phones as if by, well, magic.  \n\n*Amaterasu -- Queen of the gods, ancestor of the Imperial Family, Lady of the Sun.  After all these centuries alone, I need a gentleman who's handsome, honorable and loyal to be this queen's king.  So if you're ready to see the light, come see me!  I'll be waiting for you...*\n\nWhich brings us to here and now, with me staring in bewilderment at my home screen.  The last thing I'd expected when I woke up this morning was to see a new icon on my phone -- that little golden apple gleaming expectantly, waiting for me to open it up.  Taking a deep breath, I reached down and clicked the icon, taking my first steps into a whole new world of divine pleasure...\n\n---------------------------\n\nHey, all!  I'm back with a new RP, inspired by a CYOA I stumbled across some time ago.  Our hero has been selected for a dating service matching single goddesses with worthy mortals, looking to bring together couples from different realms that might never have otherwise had the chance to meet.  Can romance bloom between a mortal man and a literal goddess?  (I mean, that's the whole point of the prompt, so yes!)  Some knowledge of mythology will be needed, but I'm not planning on getting super in-depth -- just a general idea of personality and myths would be good!\n\nI prefer to do a longer-term RP, and to have some buildup before getting to the actual smut. I am on Eastern time, and I can generally post at least once a day. I do tend towards longer replies, at least two or three paragraphs in length. I can do either first- or third-person perspective, depending on my partner's preference. And I only play on Reddit PM -- no chat or Discord, sorry!  (Seriously, if you send me a chat message, I will **not** reply!)\n\nAnd lastly, I'll be away from the keyboard for a while after posting this. So if you see this later and it's not marked \"closed\"? Then I'm still looking for a partner! Feel free to take your time in your response!\n\n* Kinks: Romance, story development, longing looks and sighs, makeouts, shy soft touches, oral (giving/receiving/69), dirty talk, mutual pleasuring, willful women/goddesses who're looking for a balanced partnership, risky sex/creampies, women in costume or lingerie (especially stockings and garters), light bondage, orgasm teasing/denial, cuddling, affectionate banter\n* Limits: Scat, piss, other non-sexual bodily fluids, blood or violence beyond spanking and light hair pulling, non-con, transformation, text-speak, ignoring proper grammar usage, letting the gods get away with being dicks",

            "selftext": "You were that cute girl that my friend knew, joining us on a camping trip one weekend. You knew her from when she lived a town over, the two of you never falling out of touch. She was so excited to introduce you to us, and after meeting you, I was glad she brought you. After a night of drinking, only the two of us were left awake. I watched you pull a popsicle from the cooler, the way you easily stuck the entire length down your soft, wet throat was impressive. Maybe it was the alcohol, but I had to find out just how well you could throat my cock.\n\nYou kept giving me those eyes while you sucked on your popsicle. Your mouth cool and moist. It wasn't long before you were on your knees in front of me. My cock buried deep down your throat, the coolness of the popsicle creating a wonderful contrast to the warmth of your throat. I had to stand up, both hands on the sides of your head. The way you let me fuck your face relentlessly was impressive. Your gags, the way your eyes watered, the thick layer of saliva coating my cock. Everything about the experience was incredible. You showed me that night that you were the true deepthroat Princess. I came deep into your throat, your soft lips swallowing up the rest of my hot seed. You had fully satisfied me better than any girl before you. I invited you to stay the night in my trailer with me. After that rough face fucking, it was the least I could do.\n\nI woke up the next morning to your head bobbing down the length. Your throat was my alarm clock, as I woke up, both hands found the back of your head. Pushing you down the length before jets of thick cum shot down your throat. \"Good morning.\" I said with a smile, seeing how satisfied you were with the morning deep throat quickie. After getting dressed, we exchanged numbers and then you snuck off to our friends trailer. Telling her you had gone for a morning hike.\n\nI knew you had moved to town, but I hadn't heard from you all week. Needless to say, I was met with a welcome surprise when I looked at my phone to see you had texted the following Friday. It simply read, \"Hey :)\" just seeing that text let me know this weekend would be incredible. I was quick to text you back. \"Hey, any plans this weekend?\" Excited about the thought of being alone with you, not having to worry about the noise.\n\n(I would love to talk a bit a flesh this out a little more with you. See what two creative minds can come up with. If this isn't your thing, feel free to check out my past prompts, as they are always open.\n\nKinks: Blowjobs, Facials, Anal, titty fucking, semi public/could get caught, some rough, lifting you during sex, spanking, slutty outfits, dirty talk, flirting, tension, push up bra and thong look, and more.)",

            "selftext": "\"Listen, I know she looked nothing like you, was wearing clothes you would never even think about wearing, acted in a totally opposite way from how you act, and yes, I called her a different name entirely, but she's just you from a different universe, okay? That's not cheating. Like, if you were hooking up with a clone of me, that wouldn't be cheating. Or if you fucked a past or future version of me, that wouldn't be cheating. This is the same thing, right? \n\n\"And *yes*, it was necessary to do it, come on! You're being ungrateful to what I just did. Seriously, is it so hard to believe that the fate of multiple universes rested on me slamming my cock into her ass, something you've never let me do, over and over until we were both crying out for each other? Seems like bog-standard heroism to me.\n\n\"Ugh, you're being unreasonable, honey. Listen, this whole arrangement is going to last for just a little while longer while we ensure our loud, frequent, rough sex is stabilizing the universe... or whatever. Then, when she heads back to her universe, I'll be right here for you again. Until then, I'll be busy saving reality itself. C'mon, doesn't your selfless boyfriend deserve a thanks for that?\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, with all the various comic book and sci-fi franchises dealing with the multiverse as the next big thing, I figured I'd write up a prompt riffing on the silly concept. However, the exact manner in which we riff on this together depends on which of the two potential paths you'd want for this roleplay:\n\n1. The cheating boyfriend and the other woman are completely bullshitting, which is sort of the intent of the initial dialogue here, and we follow them as they tell increasingly complicated and dumb explanations for how what they're doing is (a) completely necessary and (b) not cheating.\n\n2. A dumb *and fun* scenario would be that they're actually telling the truth! Perhaps the lucky boyfriend needs to be taken throughout the multiverse to fuck a bunch of wildly different versions of his girlfriend, and yes, that's *definitely* still cheating. Who knows how long the poor girl has before he decides to ditch her for an alternate version of herself?\n\nIf you're open to a prompt based around cheating and flimsy excuses for why it's *actually not cheating, excuse you*, then send me a PM, and we can work something out together!",

            "selftext": "\nI am 18+ and every person and character involved with this rp must also be 18+ \n\nLooking for a switch girl for this rp \n\nA new wave of corruption has started to spread around the world. Some see it as a curse but the corrupted see it only as a blessing once convinced. Girls around the world are becoming were-futas and were-sluts, spending a majority of their time while transformed breeding and spreading their corruption.\n\n(I am looking for me to play all the were-futas as well as some occasional were-sluts with my partner taking the victims and remaining were-sluts). \n\nBoth were-futas and were-sluts appear like normal girls in their normal state, however on certain nights, once aroused enough, or even if it\u2019s been long enough since they\u2019ve had sex, they show their true state, usually triggered by a strong orgasm during the change. Whether originally straight, lesbian or even bi, corrupted girls craved only pussy and were-futa cock. They also both gain the ability to release arousing pheromones from their pussy to arouse nearby females.\n\nWere-futas have glowing red eyes and gain the ability to grow one or more cocks or even tentacles from their pussy. They spend most of their time either with their pack of were-sluts or searching for girls to corrupt into were-sluts. Their cum is extremely potent and their sexual endurance is incredible, being able to impregnate any girl through even oral or anal sex and being able to continue for hours on end once started. Some were-futas are even able to turn other parts of their bodies like their tongue, nipples, or fingers into cocks and tentacles to fuck extra sluts and produce more cum.\n\nWere-sluts have glowing blue eyes and become extremely flexible, allowing for easy penetration of multiple holes at a time in various positions. Perfected for fertility can be impregnated through oral and anal sex as well as normal insemination. Their pussies act as a source of food for the corrupted with meals consisting of were-sluts being eaten out and were-sluts also being able to use futa cum for food too. Most were-sluts aim to serve the futa or slut that created them, whether that be by fucking them or finding more girls to corrupt with them. \n\nOutside of rare cases were-futas can only create were-sluts from their victims and were-futas can only be created by were-sluts (though most were-sluts simply submit to the futa that created them and only seek out girls to turn into were-futas when their futa abandons them or goes missing)\n\nSome others ideas I had that could be used as possible variations, additions, or even focuses are\n-Girls infecting/corrupting girls that they didn\u2019t intend because the curse was too strong or girls intentionally corrupting themselves and others because they\u2019re that slutty/horny\n-some sort of parasite or artifact that would be inserted into a girl\u2019s pussy to infect them or turn them into a were-futa\n-kinky cults revolving around worshiping were-futas and were-sluts as well as turning members into them voluntarily, potentially revolving around female celebs and pornstars.\n-corruption working it\u2019s way into everyday life and people\u2019s jobs (a were-futa nurse/doctor corrupting patients at a fertility clinic, a were-futa/slut counselor at a college for troubled girls corrupting her vulnerable students, or a were-futa cop corrupting inmates at her prison for example)\n\nI\u2019m also open to infections being possible by either an infected girl squirting or a were-futa cumming on a girls face/tits/skin in general to infect. I am also open to suggestions or ideas on details for the corruption in terms of what it does and other ways it can be spread\n\nI am open to most kinks and flexible on my own. Open to including stuff like watersports, raceplay, and eggs/ovioposition as well if you\u2019re interested. I am also of course open to including celebs/pornstars as well as potentially doing this in a rule 34/fandom settings. I do not want male characters involved in the rp however.\n\nDm me and we can discuss/start",

I figure I'd note this as people seem to mistake my interest.*\n\n[\"Such a nice girl!\"]\n\nYou've been the good girl for your entire life. Always seen by everyone as something of a pleasant person and one that many people consider to be the goody-goody two-shoes homebody that would never do anything even morally questionable. \n\nAlways the good student, always the good worker, good friend, good daughter. The statement drones in your head again and again, often leading to being left out of parties or events that you've always wanted to try. The men you've always wanted to date leading you to back off out of fear of twisting public opinion of yourself.\n\nSure, that nerd shit is fine and good. Writing blog posts about what characters you like, playing video games with friends, tabletop roleplaying as a bard, and cosplaying at events for the fun of it was the most \"active\" you appeared to be. \n\nYou have friends, but really you've never had a lot. At least Adrian has been there for years, a nice guy you met when very young who's grown up... handsomely. Small crush, but you know not to press it.\n\nSince for as long as you can remember, you've never had a moment of letting your hair down and showing someone, anyone, who you really are.\n\n________\n\n[The Other Side]\n\nYou... have urges. You feel like what a succubus would, constantly horny and never satisfied, almost as if it sustains you. Doesn't matter where you are, the urges can sometimes overwhelm you, leading you to have to backtrack out of potentially getting *caught*, but luckily you can awkwardly backpedal out of the situation.\n\nYou've had a particular social media account for as long as you were legal. A smut account where you post pictures of yourself and the toys you have, where those toys go as often as you see fit, and even have went as far as to start a livestream and OnlyFans. It was never about the money or fame, but... a way to get off and to have fun. Wearing sexy outfits and variations of cosplay you wore to events feeling good and sort of confident in it. \n\nSure, if anyone heard they'd warp their entire outlook of you. If they knew what you did and what you do, that persona you keep up would fall apart. Maybe that's what makes it all so much more hot to you, the idea that if someone discovered you'd be fucked socially.\n\nAnyway, it's not like they'd find out, right? It's... not like you need a real dick...\n\nRight?\n\n__________\n\n[The Problem]\n\nYou've finally hit the breaking point. That point where you feel the toys losing their luster and even recording it losing all power. Your brain seems to be saying \"Been there, done that, and now you need a human touch.\"\n\nIt wasn't until a few weeks passing where you started to notice changes. Getting short with people, getting irritated at small things, and having a few ask if you were feeling well. Every week getting worse and worse, with more people acknowledging you were different somehow.\n\nThe weirdest change wasn't until recently... \n\nAdrian came over, normal day, normal hangout. You were... flirting with him, as much as he was not comfortable, his lack of comfort was almost a turn on in itself. You see his gazes when you bend over to pick up a purposefully dropped item. Your dirty jokes becoming a bit more clear it wasn't just a small \"joke\". You knew you wanted him, but you were only a confirmation away from pouncing.....\n\nThen he went home, leaving you to figure out how exactly you get him to figure out you want to be friends with benefits without throwing it all away.\n\n_______________\n\n[Who is Adrian?]\n\nAdrian Andrews is a 6'3\" white guy with dark hair that goes to his shoulders, clean shaven, and a body that surprises you in all regards as if he worked out a bit more he could get interesting results. Generally wears almost a common ensemble of shirts, jacket, and jeans with minor alterations with weather. Does his attire change drastically? No. He does have glasses, though those disappear a lot.\n\nAn Awkward nerd such as yourself, you've known him forever. Previously mentioned a crush of sorts, but it's unknown if it's mutual. Hell, you've even wondered if he was straight entirely. Regardless, he's terrible with women and dating, such as even hitting on girls as cosplay events only to fail hard. Was it how he asked? Who knows! (It probably was that)\n\nRumors from others are he's \"gifted\" below the belt, but how they'd know that was... weird so they might just be joking. Who knows!\n\nSexually, he's impossible to read without side jokes or comments sarcastically thrown around. You can't make him for a dominant take charge guy or submissive who is absolutely into forward women. Switch maybe? Who the hell knows.\n\nOnce you \"reveal\" yourself, he does still hold back, but if you guide his hand, you might make him figure out real quick. Do you like teasing him? He will seem to love it more than you'd think. Do you occasionally take charge only to occasionally nudge him to take charge himself? Is his kinky ideas sometimes leaving you both acting on them for fun? Maybe he hides a lot more below the surface waiting to be explored by a close friend! \n\n________________\n\n[Who are you?]\n\nWho are you though, really? A petite lady who is below average in height, but just the right size for... other things? A tomboy that maybe did a bit more athletics than usual, unaware of the lusting glares of others? A borderline amazonian giant who detests snu-snu jokes (but secretly loves them)? A buxom bombshell that many thought was a dud, only to really be a borderline nuke? Average Jane who's really hiding more than meets the eye? I can continue, but really this is open ended. (I'm personally not a fan of, please don't take this as an insult, BBW sorts. Apologies for anyone who's wishing for this. If anything Mei from OW is my limit if anyone gets the reference.)\n\nPersonally, race doesn't matter. I love skin tones clashing and can get behind anyone and everyone. ;)\n\nDoes your style match your real personality or are you dressed like a generic good religious girl? Goth, punk, or absolutely fear the idea of a hot topic in all but video game shirts? A slob who barely qualifies outfits with a category beyond, \"It fits somewhat and is here.\" Do you wear cutesy dresses or high fashion?\n\nFeel free to add your own twist or spin, I set a basic idea and admittedly sort of shoehorned the concept, if we're both cool then fuck it, right?\n______________\n\n[Additional Info]\n\nBig apologies to how much is here and that I wrote a fucking wall of text as well as to anyone who reads this, but I like stories and don't want to just \"big dick and tiddy girl with the sex.\" Long-term plots with drama, character growth, and dynamics are my favorite, even if we add some darker themes such as cheating which personally I'd rather Adrian not be who cheats. (Sorry)\n\nA GM sort of deal is also cool, but I'm not personally looking to be the GM, as much as that sounds lazy of me. It's admittedly due to many flaky partners when I've done it in the past 'cause they wanted quick \"cum and go\" sort of deals.\n\nBIG KINK NOTE: I do like playing inexperienced, but gets \"taught\" even if it's that ol' cliche of either being natural at something. Hell, I'm even cool if it's somewhat mutual. Exploring can be fun.\n\nKinks I'm into personally, but not required, are: Outfit/uniform play (Think anything from cosplay, lingerie, generic sexy outfits, to slut wear), sex toys/toy play, anal, ass play, titfucking, breast play, cock worship, rough sex, light bondage, oral, facefucking, makeup, MFF threesomes (Femboys can be replaced as well, with strong exceptions for only this kink. Sorry guys.), exhibitionism, photograph/video play, dirty talk, clothed sex, femdom, online/cyber play, power exchange, mating press, full nelson, punishments/rewards, aftercare, cuddling, magic play, body transformation, switch dynamic (Read as, yes, dominant does exist, but if long-term please... I like both), handcuffs, praise, masturbation (Mutual, in a voyeur context, or otherwise), piercings, raceplay, age gap (No one under 18. I prefer being younger tbh), teasing, accents/foreign languages, pronebone, sneaky/risky (as in getting caught by someone) sex.\n\nOccasional: choking, spanking, humiliation, breeding.\n\nIf more appear, I do ask for forgiveness as I do like to explore so some may change as I get more interested in some or remember rare ones I don't encounter that I am a fan of. Mention some of yours to compare and I can try to give an answer.\n\nNot interested: Blood, scat, watersports, hardcore BDSM, hardcore sex, vore, gore, bathing, latex/leather play.\n\nI prefer 3rd person and around a paragraph responses, not picky on being 100% exact, but close enough is the idea.\n\nPM if interested and if you are interested in going to another place to RP, such as discord or the like.\n\n[Note: Oh, right, these are characters and writing for fun? No need to take it seriously beyond respecting we both do things away from writing. Just as long as we both continue, maybe we could have a fun story.]",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI\u2019m looking to play out a first-person, long term roleplay with someone interested in total submission. If actions like getting on your knees for a man, getting collared, or being put on all fours while being spanked make you dripping wet, then I believe this prompt is for you. If you crave being dominated, and becoming someone else\u2019s property for them to do with as they please, then again\u2026 this prompt is for you. So, let\u2019s get right into this\u2026\n\nIn this roleplay, you\u2019ll obviously be playing as Kendall Jenner, as outlined by the title. Now, onto what I\u2019d like to do with you? Well, I not only want to humiliate, degrade, and ruin your spoiled life, but I want to get you to submit\u2026 I want to make you mine. Whether it be through charming flirting, an appeal to your inner desires, or something more physical like a kidnapping or brute force, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll eventually submit to your new lives\u2026 your only purpose being that of serving my every need.\n\nNow who would I be? Well, who else but the city\u2019s playboy billionaire. After all, I had both the means and the skills to break whoever I wanted, and my eyes were set on taming a bratty diva like you next.\n\nYou\u2019d soon no longer be a beloved celebrity, but a slut eager to please. No longer a revered member of Hollywood\u2019s finest, but a sex slave for me to do with as I please. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019d eventually love your new life as well. Maybe you end up loving it so much that you\u2019d encourage me to dominate and own the rest of your family as well? Or how about your model friends?\n\nNow, how your react to your new situation is up to you. Will you secretly love how I treat you since the start, or will you resist, forcing me to put you in your place? One thing is clear though, through my application of masterful techniques regarding the ability to cause unforeseen levels of pleasure and inflict unbearable pain, I\u2019d have you on your knees soon enough. Maybe I\u2019d decide to turn you into an obedient painslut if you keep disobeying? Moreover, through my manipulative skills, I\u2019d slowly toy with your mind as I corrupt you, lowering your guard as I bring out your submissive side. It won\u2019t be long before you\u2019re on all fours, begging me to use all three of your holes\u2026\n\nKinks: Male dom, dirty talk, rough sex, Master/ Slave, creampie, analpie, collar and leash, non/dub con turned con, spanking, hair pulling, choking, slapping, high heels, toys, outfit control, being called Master, corruption, breeding, bondage, punishment, anal, cock worship, facials, facefuck, deepthroat, throatpies, sexual training, orgasm control, bending you over/ all fours, good plot, manhandling, public sex, risky sex, humiliation, degradation, mindbreak, celebs, harem\n\nLimits: watersports, scat, gore, futa\n\nFinally, I\u2019m looking for a detailed, literate partner willing to write around 2+ paragraphs per response. I\u2019m also open to playing this out through reddit PM\u2019s, kik, or discord, so let me know what you prefer.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon! Please try and make an effort with your opening message, it helps out a lot. I look forward to playing this out with you\u2026 after all, you\u2019ll soon be mine ;)",

We sat around in a circle starting with innocent questions of course, eventually the questions got riskier with every turn until eventually one of our friends asked you 'truth or dare'. Nerves were high and all I could think about was what were you willing to do? Especially with everyone there. \"\n\nI used to read erotic Truth or Dare stories but eventually there weren't very many good ones left to read. So why not make one with me?\n\nThis RP is mostly going to be a group scenario and so jumping characters or describing what other characters do is something that we will both have to do which can be a lot of typing. I'd say probably no more than two other couples there because any more and the attention would likely shift from our own characters to the others. We cna tak about what the other characters may look like or I can just make them up and we just move along, I'm fine with either. Preferably we are related somehow b/s, cousin/cousin etc, but not required. So how about it? Wanna find out what the group ends up doing?\n\nKinks: incest, cnc, cheating, coersion, non consent into consent, rough sex, swinging, cucking",

            "selftext": "Thanks for clicking on my post! Don't let the title fool you, I am a domme-leaning switch. Feel free to take a peak at my [kink list](https://i.imgur.com/umJEjlZ.png) to see if we'd be a good match sexually. I've deliberately omitted sexual details from these prompts as I prefer to find some common ground in our sexual interests and go from there.\n\nToday I have four prompts for you. Three are very flexible and fairly open ended long-term roleplays, whilst the last is a simple femdom scenario. Before we get into the fun stuff, though, I have a few things to get out of the way.\n\nWhile I don't mind picking up the odd additional character in the third person when the story requires, I like to write my own characters in the first person perspective, and I'd strongly prefer if you'd do the same. I'm not looking to GM for anyone, and I'm not looking for you to GM for me. For long-term scenarios especially, I enjoy building sexual tension and desire between our two characters, and find that more satisfying when it's written in first person.\n\nMy reply lengths tend to average around 2-4 paragraphs, including dialogue, actions, thoughts and feelings.  If you're after a quick back and forth than this probably isn't the post for you. I generally expect someone to give back the effort that I put in. If you're someone that typically prefers 4+ paragraphs I am willing to do my best to match your effort, however, please know I am not incredibly experienced with consistently writing that much per response.\n\nI don't like using face claims, playing as a specific person or character or being given specific physical or personality traits. You will have full autonomy over your character and I would like the same.\n\nThe chat feature and I aren't on good terms, so please use the direct messaging feature. I don't expect a novel in your first message, but please give me something to work with. If you haven't at the very least indicated which prompt you're interested in and opened up a conversation I may not respond. If you're willing to switch to Discord please let me know. I **strongly** prefer to roleplay there\n\nThe fun stuff:\n\n&gt;***The bounty hunter and the fugitive:*** *You\u2019re on the run, trying to escape the consequences for a crime that you did or did not commit. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t even a crime, perhaps you were just unfortunate enough to unknowingly anger the wrong people. The exact reason for the attractive bounty placed upon you didn\u2019t matter to me.  Bringing your head back had a good price, bringing you back alive had an even better one. How will things develop between us when we spend so much time alone on my small ship?*\n\nThis prompt is for those who enjoy their smut packaged up in a juicy plot-driven roleplay that allows for a high level of world building. When I say I'd like a sci-fi setting for this roleplay, I really do mean the broader definition of the genre. We could create a whole galaxy to explore filled with a variety of alien races, or, a dystopian city that draws upon the cyberpunk genre. Yes, the scenario described above is rather bare bones at the moment. I intended it to be more of a suggestion; a starting point for us to mould, add to and tweak until we're satisfied. It's also worth noting I am not completely married to the exact roles I've mentioned. I believe something along the lines of a mercenary or a private investigator would work just as well for what I'm after. I\u2019m also willing to swop the roles, if that\u2019s what you\u2019d prefer. Regardless of the exact roles and the reasons for our characters meeting, I would like said meeting to be tied up in the overall narrative. I'm picturing one of our characters inadvertently dragging the other into some kind of conspiracy or cover-up, but again, I'm flexible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Finding comfort in the apocalypse:*** *it\u2019s the end of the world, and survival has brought out the worst in people. In an unlikely scenario, we\u2019re thrown together. Perhaps one of us is captured by the other\u2019s group, and they help the captured person escape. Perhaps we\u2019ve both been captured by the same people, and we need to escape together. Unfortunately, trust is in short supply these days. Can we manage to fund some in each other?*\n\nSimilar to the first scenario in the sense that this does require some discussion and world building before we jump in. I'd prefer for our characters to be complete strangers in the roleplay as I enjoy the tension created by mistrust. However, I'm not entirely opposed to us being familiar with each other in some way if you have something in mind you feel would be more interesting to explore. I'm happy for this to be rather realistic and explore some darker themes. With that in mind, I'd like to avoid any sort of slavery or non-con scenarios taking place between our two characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Incest with a sci-fi twist:*** *We work as scavengers searching the outer corners of space for shipwrecks, scrapping them for parts to sell. While we see people when we make port, we spend most of our time on our ship together.. and lately it's been getting rather small.*\n\nThis one is fairly simple. Less of a focus on world building and more of a focus on developing the tension of a growing taboo relationship. Father/mother and daughter is my preferred pairing for this roleplay, though I'm open to siblings as well. If you like the idea but aren't a fan of blood-related incest, any other caretaker dynamic or friend of the family could work. (This is also my favorite prompt for taking the submissive role)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Home invasion gone wrong*** ***(..or right, depending on your perspective):*** *You break into my house, expecting nobody to be home. The plan was to steal a couple of valuables and promptly get out. Unfortunately for you, you're rather new to this breaking and entering business. You're a tad incompetent and haven't been subtle with your planning. I've been expecting this for a few days now and am ready to teach you a lesson*\n\nObviously some non-con/dub-con is to be expected in this scenario. I would, however, prefer that it transitions into more of a consensual scenario that you clearly enjoy. I'm open to making this a long-term thing if it goes well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***A bonus one for anyone that read this far:*** *Your own idea!*\n\nIf you've read my post and think you have a good idea of what I'm after, I'm happy to read any prompts you have up your sleeve",

I have always been curious about groupsex and earlier this year plunged into it with an older MF couple. \n\nIt was such a fun experience and awoke in me a new plane of sexual pleasure that I didn\u2019t think was possible to experience. Probably the most erotic act we did was double penetration. I was inside my FWBs pussy while her husband fucked her ass. The sensations produced from both of our hard cocks rubbing inside of her were magical. It didn\u2019t take long until we could feel our shafts building with pleasure that erupted into two massive orgasms each. She kept riding us until all of us were fully satisfied.   \n\nI\u2019d love to chat with women who are interested in DP or group play! Please send an introduction. Specifically I am interested in hearing about how long you\u2019ve had this fantasy, the closest you\u2019ve ever gotten to being with two men, and if you\u2019ve told your partner about it.

I don't how it got started but I have a hard spot for older women. One time I found myself jacking off to one of my teachers. But it got harder to handle after high school when I started getting horny around my mom's three close friends. They were more than just women to me and I couldn't maintain myself. \n\nI've even spent time with each one. Maybe watching them undress, sunbathing, or go off when they think no one's watching. I understood each one the more I was with them. \n\nOne is insecure about her body but is totally submissive. Maybe thicker than a Snicker and sensitive to the touch. And her body is in need of affection.\n\nThe second, a total mistress, loves punishing most guys who stare at her curvy, possibly hourglass body for too long. She gets off thinking about being in control, maybe in some hot lingerie or a corset in sexy heels. Maybe a fiery redhead with matching dark red lipstick and nails or shiny dark hair and just loves being on top. She might be hesitant at first but will really want to punish me after I tell her the dirty things I do thinking of all three of them.\n\nThe last one has a total wild side. She's not getting any so she has a collection of toys but she wants the real thing. Should have a nice ass.\n\nNo one else could know what I was planning, I didn't want them getting the wrong idea if people knew I was constantly horny. No chance was I gonna let Mom know about any of this. I realized I had just finished my university exams early and had plenty of time over the summer to have some hot and heavy fun.\n\nI knew what I had to do. This was gonna be the hottest break ever! I had to fuck Mom's friends because I couldn't stand being pent up like this. So I looked up which of Mom's friends was the closest to us and drove up there.\n\nWhen I reached the first one, she was excited to see me. We got situated and she asked why I stopped by. I tell her I finish exams early and have more time than I thought. Then, inching closer, I lay it all out for her. I tell her I've been having these intense feelings and I've been hot for her and her friends. I know you're all older but I find that just so alluring and tempting. You tell me 'Your mom wouldn't want this.'\n\n'That's why she's not going to know anything about it.'\n\nNow which of these hot milfs is first? We can discuss names, too. Alexis, Rachel, Chrissy, Nikki, Jan, Amy, Robin are just examples. For my name, examples would be Leon, Mark, Eric or Chris.\n\nKinks are mom bod, milf, curvy, legs and thighs, heels, foot play, fishnets, lingerie, body worship, thigh highs, dress up, big ass, face sitting, interracial (ask me about if interested), light femdom, age gap (I can play as young as you want me), home wrecking, cheating, bbw, passionate, rough, teasing, seducing, grinding, smothering, groping, non/dub con, toys, licking, shower sex, any room in the house, risk being seen and multiple women.\n\nPM or chat works. Also, check to see all my other prompts if interested.",

The model Christian woman that stands by her husband and helps raise up a lovely picture perfect family.  Surely such a woman is above thinking of stepping outside of it all.  Surely such a woman would never have a secret stash of sex toys that she uses when her husband is at the church office, moaning while watching her favorite porn sites or maybe even sending clips to her secret lovers.  Surely such a woman would be above having an OnlyFans, loving that men subscribe to her account as she shows off the body that she works hard on for a man that is not able to truly appreciate it.  And surely such a woman is completely faithful to her husband\u2026there is no way that she loves bringing other men over into her marriage bed, pulling her ring off while enjoying the feeling of multiple men filling her unprotected pussy, enjoying being as sexual as she once was before getting married. \n\nDo you believe that it is even possible that such ladies exist out there? \ud83d\ude08\n\nThis can either be a chat about the trials and tribulations (and of course naughty pleasures) of a woman living this sort of life. We could also build a roleplay with me being a man that helps you in your road to depravity.  I could also play multiple men.\n\nKinks I would love to explore are corruption, incest, bisexual, toys, age difference, gangbangs, breeding, race play, and anything else that makes you tingle!

            "selftext": "The Lich King defeated, but at what cost? The most fanatical of his followers, mad alchemists, completed his final orders -- a hidden and apocalyptic contingency -- without hesitation. A plague was released upon the world. A disease to end all diseases. The mortal races and their empires crumbled. There was no magic or natural remedy to curb its spread or control its symptoms. Entire cities and bloodlines, the living and the undead, eradicated in a matter of days. Not even the dragonflights could escape its potent effects, thousands expiring in the shadow of Wyrmrest Temple.\r  \n\r  \nBut some survived. Tyrande Whisperwind, stalwart servant of Elune. Sylvanas Windrunner, vengeful Banshee Queen of the Forsaken. Ysera and Alexstrasza, broodmothers and sisters of the green and red dragonflight. Jaina Proudmoore, archmage of the Kirin Tor. Sally Whitemane, zealot of the Scarlet Crusade. Heroes to some and villains to others. Now, though, they are without their armies. Azeroth is dead, and so too its politics and animosities.\r  \n\r  \nSo too was there another. A male human, a mercenary, left to explore the wastes of the Eastern Kingdoms as a vagabond. No more contracts or bards or ale to share with other sellswords.\r  \n\r  \nWhat happens, then, when he encounters these women of renown on his travels?\r  \n\r  \n\\[Hi, folks! Thanks for reading so far. As you can tell, I'd like a lady writer to join me in exploring a post-apocalyptic Warcraft universe. The primary purpose of this prompt is to write smut, obviously, so there will be quite a bit of fucking. The more the merrier, too! An ideal candidate would be willing to play multiple of the above listed characters.\r  \n\r  \nI am comfortable discussing kinks and all that as the situation arises. My hard nos are scat, gore, death, toilet, etc. As there aren't too many people left on the planet, breeding/pregnancy risk is a must!\r  \n\r  \nIf you would like to propose an OC, feel free to do so! I am also willing to incorporate other notable NPCs or races not really around during the Wrath timeline -- worgen, goblins, pandaren, etc.\r  \n\r  \nPlease open a chat or send me a message if interested. Cheers!\\]",

            "selftext": "So I (26 female) am in an open relationship with my partner and I went to meet a guy(27) from tinder for coffee. We had a great time talking over coffee until the cafe closed so we went to sit in my car. We chatted a bit more until he leaned over and kissed me. We made out for about ten minutes with some touching then he told me he was really turned on.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have a place to go as we couldn\u2019t go to one another\u2019s places so I thought of a boardwalk parking lot we could go to to mess around. It was a rainy foggy night so when we got to the boardwalk, the parking lot was pretty empty. We parked and started kissing and touching each other again.\n\nHe pulled my shirt up and took my bra off and then put his hand in my pants rubbing and fingering me as he played with my tits. I was rubbing his cock through his pants I could feel how hard it was. I undid his pants and slid them down to get his cock out. I gave him a hand job for a few minutes as we played around but then I pulled away from his kiss and leaned over to his side of the car and started sucking his cock his hand on the top of my head guiding me up and down.\n\nAfter a few minutes he pulled me up and told me he wanted to fuck me so we moved into the back seat. With know one still around in the parking lot he pulled down my pants and thong and with no condom he put his rock hard cock in me. I was so wet it was really exciting I haven\u2019t had sex in a car in over ten years. He fucked me hard for about 10 minutes and then all of a sudden a car backed in across from us.\n\nIt was foggy so I doubted they could see us but that was enough to start giving him trouble staying hard so we moved back into the front seat where I sucked his cock for a bit and finally finished him off with a hand job his cum running down my fingers. I could tell by the look on his face it felt really good.\n\nHe forgot his belt in my car so we plan to meet again! It was a very fun and exciting night. I went home and told my partner about the night he loves hearing about my adventures.",
