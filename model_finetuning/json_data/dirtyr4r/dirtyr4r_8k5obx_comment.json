So if you are here after you can't see your post, check to see if you followed the criteria regarding the location.\n\n---\n\n&gt; ####**Okay I agree my post did not have a location and it was removed, now what should I do? I wanna post again with my location!**\n&gt; \nExcellent question. Go ahead and post again but keep in mind that since this is breaking the 12 hour rule, the Mod-Bot will **automatically** remove it again. When that happens, you may send us a modmail asking us to manually re-approve the post. Please be aware that there may or may not be a delay between you sending a modail and us approving it. \n\n-\n&gt;####**Hey I put in USA/Europe/UK etc as my country but it still got removed? What the heck?**\n&gt;         \n&gt;See the point above we say general region like a state or city. USA/Europe/UK etc is way too big and generic of a location. Trust us when we say you will get more responses when you use a city or region like New York/London/Paris/California/Minnesota/Texas.\n    \n\n\n\n-\n\n\n***\n\n#Now for the rest of the rules and some information\n\n\n\n#SELLING\nSelling posts are not allowed on r/dirtyr4r. If you want to sell, please head over to r/sexsells. Posts regarding selling will be removed.\n\nIf you do interact with an OP who tells you that he/she is selling, please screenshot it and send us a Mod Mail so that we may take action.\n\n#JOIN THE DIRTYR4R CHAT!\nAs some of you may have realized, we quietly introduced a dirtyr4r chat a little while ago. This is a chat based system that allows users to cam up and interact with other dr4r's. It's a fantastic and dynamic way to meet new people! Too shy to cam? No worries, it's still as fun. Click here to check it out right away!\n\n#FREQUENCY OF POSTS\n12 hours is the minimum amount of time between posts. Posting more often will result in your post being removed and subsequently may result in a ban. Deleting your posts and reposting will be considered as a violation of this rule. Furthermore, ban evaders will be reported to Reddit admins.\n\n#RESPECT THE PRIVACY OF OTHERS\nFrom the sidebar\n\n&gt; Someone to trade kinky pics of **yourself** with\n\nDo not ask for or share content of other people. This includes but not limited to rating/sharing/tributing content of SO's/family members/friends. All such posts will be removed and the OP banned right away. Users reported for doing so within personal PMs, alongside proof will be banned as well.\n\n#GENDER TAGS\nPlease remember to tag your post titles correctly so that it doesn't get user reports.\n\n#SAFETY FIRST!\nMeeting someone IRL after you made a post? Remember to stay safe! Check out some match.com tips on how to have a successful date.\n\nNot all dates happen in person, some can take place within PM's and/or other messaging services. Be smart and avoid sharing personal information right off the bat. Furthermore, check your profile history to ensure you have not shared any personal information in the past that may be traceable to your IRL self. Keep in mind that holds true for both parties; someone refusing to send a picture of themselves does not always mean they are catfishing.\n\nIf you do encounter a problematic PM hit that report button and block that user. Send the mods a PM with a screenshot so that we can take action against troublemakers.\n\nPlease report violations to any of these rules either via Mod Mail or by hitting the report button underneath a post.\n\n\n\n#COMMENTING ETIQUITTE\n\nThere is absolutely no reason for you to comment things like \"PM\", \"Check your Inbox\", \"PM me\" on posts. If you've sent a message, great! Now just sit back, relax and enjoy because the other user has received a notification. In fact it is less likely that they will even talk to you now. \"If I see that you are repeatedly spamming this I will be giving out temp bans with possibilities of perma bans as well\" - u/ScrewYourDriver. \n\n\n***\n***\n###Are you active here and have suggestions or requests?

How could it be faked?!\". In fact the person who sent it to you will try to convince you as well. \"I just sent you a live pic, I am real!\", \"How can I be fake if I sent you a live pic?\"\n\n\nWell I'll tell you how. Modified Kik apps exist. These apps have whatever code there is in the app that allows you to send **gallery images as \"live camera\" images.**. \n\n\nI am also aware that some KIK clients allow the user to prevent pictures they sent from being saved or from being forwarded. So if you see that you can't save the picture or that the forward option is not available, think about this. Saving a picture will be useful and I will be covering why so shortly as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
