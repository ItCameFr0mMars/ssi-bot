The thing is, my virginity isn't something I'm ashamed of, or something I'm desperate to change. It just is what it is, and posting here pretending that isn't the case (ie 'please, please take my virginity from me' or 'ey girl, your family hasn't got enough fingers to count the women I've been with') isn't an honest, or effective way of going about it.\n\nI wanna find someone I can have a fun intimate time with, who knows what my situation is. Not to hire the solution to my 'problem', or get some easy notches on the bedpost. As my situation shows, that's just not what I'm about. I'd rather a quality 60 seconds than pushing to work up to a lackluster 10 minutes.\n\nThanks though man, it's definitely something to think about. ",

Happened to every last one of us and he who says different is a fucking liar. The length will be the disappointing part. Everything else will be euphoric and surreal. \n\nTo keep this short, the other important thing is that you\u2019re going to want to catch feelings for whoever you lose your virginity to. It\u2019s imperative you don\u2019t give into those feelings. IF there\u2019s something there, let it develop naturally. If not, enjoy the ride while it lasts because there will be others. \n\nAs I proofread what I wrote, it genuinely feels like I\u2019m talking to my virgin self.

            "body": "&gt; There's merit in what you're saying, but I can't say I agree.\n\n\nI'm happy you're open to considering other point of views. \n\n\n&gt; If I wanted to rid myself of my virginity, I would have done so by now; like you say it's not difficult hiring someone. The thing is, my virginity isn't something I'm ashamed of, or something I'm desperate to change. It just is what it is, and posting here pretending that isn't the case (ie 'please, please take my virginity from me' or 'ey girl, your family hasn't got enough fingers to count the women I've been with') isn't an honest, or effective way of going about it.\n\n\nThere's nothing to be ashamed of and I've never implied it was.  Being a whore and a man is a very, very, very very difficult thing to be. It's easier being a woman and a whore. So men, really take pride in that because of the difficulty of it all.  Some show boat because it's a thing they like, and a sample of those men are liars.   My point of it all, is the following:\n\n1. You need to use it, or you loose it.  Not literally, but your testosterone will deplete.  If you're not masturbating that is.  If you are already masturbating then you will be in a T deficit. Try no fap in that case.  Which will help you biochemically to regain confidence.  Masturbation is an interesting beast to tackle.  You can't do too much of it or you'll suffer from GAD or lethargy.  If you don't do it enough, you'll likely plateau and then loose that level of T.  \n2. In my opinion, you really just need to take risks. That's why you need to get it over with.  I'm not saying your virginity isn't valuable.  It's highly regarded as a trophy for some in religious or cultural settings.  But if you're living your life already as is and you're pretty stable.  Then there's absolutely no reason to NOT do it.  Even if it is hiring someone. When and if you do, don't just hire some rando woman.  Find yourself a high quality escort that charges at minimum 2,000 for 2 hours. It's steep, but they are wonderful to be around and usually have recent STD checks with documentation to back it up.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; I wanna find someone I can have a fun intimate time with, who knows what my situation is. Not to hire the solution to my 'problem', or get some easy notches on the bedpost. As my situation shows, that's just not what I'm about. I'd rather a quality 60 seconds than pushing to work up to a lackluster 10 minutes.\n\n\nIt's not a 'problem'. It's more of an experience you need to get over with if you're so inclined.  You're no longer a broke teenager looking to sneak into a strip club.  There's an idea!  Go to a strip club!  Find a way to ease into the situation and touch a woman's body for once. See if that does anything for you. \n\nAgain, it's not about notches anywhere.  It's not about time.  Like I said, it's too late in the game to be embarrassed about 60 seconds.  In fact, **be greedy** and get your nut in the first time.  I wish I had someone  to tell that to me before my first time.  It was such a disaster for me and it traumatized me for years. \n\n\n&gt; Thanks though man, it's definitely something to think about. \n\n",
