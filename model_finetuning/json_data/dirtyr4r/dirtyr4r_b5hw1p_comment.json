Hearing your story, maybe one day I will share it with the person I know - if it feels appropriate - and help them feel less alone or resentful, if ever again they need that.\n\nDamn I'm self-conscious how serious my post sounds but okay whatever.\n\nHave you tried somatic body work? Or physical therapy? Those things seem to be helping my friend.\n\nI myself am a M who has a lot of difficulties connecting to sex. I don't fully understand myself but I'm on that healing journey, finally. Often times I'm not feeling it, but I feel very lucky when I get to be with someone who appreciates how giving I am, that I love being giving, that doesn't make me feel wrong but just normal.\n\nOf course, I can't, nor do I ever intend to, equate my struggle to yours (or those of some of the people I know). I know that, and I hope I didn't offend you or mislead you by saying any of that.\n\nI guess I'm telling you this because your post gives me hope and strength, not even just for me but for the people I know.\n\n I know it sounds silly but thank you for posting, and again I'm sorry for your struggle (sometimes talk like \"sorry\" is cheap, but whatever). \n\n If it means anything I think you have a gift for writing and self-expression because it's the kind of thing and thoughts that people, at least me and these other commenters, are ready to listen to.  I don't know, I guess if it's any other consolation, I feel like you have a lot to say, and I hope that many people read what you wrote, and I hope that me and all of us can help spread messages like these ourselves, whether they're mine or someone else's.\n\nAnywho, enjoy your night or something!",

I really struggle about where the \"self-expression\" belongs for reasons like -will I come off attention seeking? -play victim? -oversharing? -a turnoff -etc etc. depending on the platform. Like I mentioned in this post, go through my years of Reddit history and you won't see it mentioned prior. I have mentioned it a couple times on social media, but a lot of my circle isn't particularly into hearing about pussy problems (I am guessing; I come from a conservative background). I struggle with to what extent it belongs on a dating profile. Whereas my relationship status is front and center along with a kink disclaimer (we won't mesh if you're vanilla), should I be clarifying my touch-ability ASAP? Especially since I do have the odd day once every couple of months when stars align and all the sudden a cock slides in just fine? I really have been debating this, especially as I've started more sex writers online that are really doing a great job spreading awareness. Since I seem to be okay at writing, should I be using that support the community of people affected by this? Lately I am leaning towards being more vocal because it is sad someone might be ashamed of a condition just because of where it geographically occurs on the body. Something to keep thinking about.\n\nI am starting physical therapy soon, I was actually supposed to start in October but then I moved, got busy, and put it on the backburner. It caught up to me though so I literally have an appointment with a specialist this week.\n\nI just want to say your empathy is so so so wonderful, and I don't think any struggle should be discounted pain or not.\n\nAlso, you sound like a great friend. I don't think I've told more than one directly about my issues.",

            "body": "God the amount of questions you're raising... I'll probably have to bring this up to the person I know. The anxiety they get about dating, about casual sex, if things are worth it, what they should say, about feeling like they're a sexual person trapped in a body that's not on the same page. I don't want to give too much about them, of course that's their journey, but hearing them talk about it and not having much to compare it to, it means a lot.\n\nI imagine it's good to tell people your touch-ability upfront. I'm not sure when either but the best answer is probably whatever makes you feel good, whether that's immediately, a little into first conversations, or in the bedroom. I'm exploring these things myself, that sex, but especially penetrative sex, is hard for me, and I don't want to disappoint girls who were expecting that right away. I'm still learning this myself... god it's so much easier said than done! But I feel, not so much prouder of what I am, but just fine with it, zen about it, realizing that I have to be if I want to heal. I honestly feel bad for the girls I've been with, with whom I haven't \"gotten it up.\" I hope they don't take it personally. I hope they know it's me, not them. It's cliche but it's true. I guess I don't think they would think that but honestly who knows.\n\nI guess some people don't like hearing about obstacles involving health. I don't see a lot of people write about people with aliments of any kind. I'm not a Lena Dunham worshipper (but I love Girls...) but I remember reading people's reviews of her newest show where Jennifer Garner's character plays someone with endometriosis. People talked about her not being redeemable, and I was like, could that be the point? It made me, I don't know, sad. I didn't like the show but I wasn't about to pan her on that front. Still I realize that people each have their own struggles and we only have so much energy to give towards someone else's hardship. At some point I gotta be like fuck that I want to be selfish and just watch something funny and pointless or something.\n\nThank you for your response, it continues to make my night a better night. \n\nI don't know I hope you continue to be vocal. You don't sound like someone who's playing a victim or oversharing. You don't sound like you have an ego about it. Of course everyone is proud of what they've overcome but isn't there some degree that that, a \"ego,\" is totally normal or even healthy?\n\nThe fact that you would even try to tell me my struggle shouldn't be discounted, I don't know, I think that kind of proves you're not expressing yourself just to be self-serving, or even if you were, to some degree, it would just be to a normal degree, like anybody else who is their own person, who has struggles and stuff.\n\nThat's funny about physical therapy and i'm happy to hear you have it lined up. Weird to have this kind of conversation on a public internet forum but I guess that's where it starts. You feel like a good friend too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
