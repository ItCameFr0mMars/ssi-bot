Sunnyvale to be more specific, but I'd love to try and set something up!\n\nFirst initial is C, I'm in a continued FWB situation, we're totally open and actually kind of looking for another that might be into playing with us. \n\nYou seem like a personality that would match mine, pretty chill and open to things and not looking to get too crazy right up front which is nice\n\nMy last little tangent thought was about how funny it is now that I'm older the chores I hated are the ones I enjoy now (like folding clothes)  and the others have changed too, but doing the dishes is still trash haha.\n\nRight now looking for something more along the lines of just fucking and hanging out but more is always an option to me if the feelings are there!\n\nI'm totally fine with your non-monogamy as I will be doing the same and I'm really glad you want to prove cleanliness haha. Not something most are worried about for some reason...\n\nI know it's a long post, think I hit most of your points there! If theres anything else you want to know or that i missed please let me know!! Have a good one \ud83d\ude0a",
