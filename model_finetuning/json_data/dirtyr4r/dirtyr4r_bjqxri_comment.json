            "body": "Hey, Rach!\n\nSaw your post just then on /r/dirtyr4r and as a teacher and someone in Australia AND someone who's been on both sides of this teacher-student attraction I figured you might be interested in my replies ;)\n\nI guess for some context, I am a 25M.\n\nSo here goes! \n\n\n**What age groups do you teach?**\n\nI'm teaching student in Year 10 to Year 12 so between ages of 15 and 19 years old.\n\n\n**Does your school have a uniform policy and if so what is the uniform?**\n\nWe do have a school uniform! Like most schools, you can choose between shorts or pants or skirts and a shirt and a jumper or a blazer or a dress.\n\n\n**Do you ever find yourself attracted to some of your students?**\n\nMmm not sure if I should be saying this but yes haha. I guess after being told constantly not to partake in extra-curricular behavior with your students it's hard to openly say yes but yes I do find some of my students rather attractive. \n\n**Why are you attracted to them?**\n\nTo be honest, because some of them just look so good. With some it's their personalities and they are people I would definitely considering asking out if they weren't my students.\n \n**What year level/age group does the attraction start and end?**\n\nI'd say it would be around the Year 10/11 mark for me predominantly. I feel like that's generally when people are mature enough. Until then most kids are frankly too immature for my liking.\n\n\n**Is there a particular number of students you find yourself attracted to more?**\n\nYou're going to have to rephrase this one for me :P\n \n**Does the school uniform make them more attractive or less attractive?**\n\nOh man. I can easily say more attractive. Just something about girls in uniforms that really gets me going.\n\n**Is there any one thing that you find very attractive?**\n\nI definitely find girls that are doing sports quite attractive. Then there's also the tights and skirts. Tbh, it's a small thing but, when one of my students is holding her pen and is biting / holding the end in between her lips. That is so distracting!\n\n**Does behaviour (polite, innocent, ect) make you attracted to them?**\n\nYeah it does. I guess everyone like niceness and this is bound to be a factor but also just *how* someone is being polite. Some girls are very nice in general but others act nice or innocent or try to charm me into being more attentive to them.\n\n\n**Do you have favourite and does this make your work biased? ** Yeah I guess it does make me more biased. I mean, those girls would have my attention anyway because they do put in the effort but they also know how to make me talk and pay attention so I guess it's okay :P\n\n\n**What part of the uniform do you like best (skirt, shirt, stockings, socks, shoes ect)?**\n\nI'd have to say the skirt. I'm sure you can imagine why.\n\n**Do you stare?*\n\nI have caught myself staring a few times. Sometimes it just can't be helped to be honest.  \n \n**Do you get boners during class or school times because of your students?**\n\nYeah and it has caused a few moments where I could get up from my desk because of it.\n\n**Did you ever jerk off to your students and if so how often?**\n\nMmm not exactly on a regular basis but there have been days where throughout the day I've just seen things which have added up to make me do it.\n\n**Do you have pictures of them?**\n\nMaybe of one student but they might not be very appropriate ;) I have been asked by a few students to add them on Snapchat, Insta or Facebook but yeah it's probably for the best that I don't :P\n\nWhat about you?\n\nWhat are you into? What is it about teachers that gets you going?\n\nHave you ever taken any steps towards doing anything with a teacher?\n\nAnd do you want to keep talking here or elsewhere? I guess you're not my student so I won't say so if you want to go move to Snapchat or such.\n\nAnywho! Looking forward to hearing from ya! :)",
