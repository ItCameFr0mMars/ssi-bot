            "body": "I agree that cheating is not okay when you are in a relationship that is meant to be monogamous. To that end it is probably worth bringing up. However, I would be careful of accusing him directly if you aren't *100%* sure that he's cheating on you. Rather you should communicate your concerns to him. Any reasonable person would understand why you have concerns and should address them. Communication is key. I know that you said that he brushed you off before, but bringing your concerns up again in a way that lets him know that you are being serious is your best bet. The alternative is that you keep feeling like this until there is a physical confrontation between some or all of the individuals involved or until you just leave him or he leaves you. Best bet is to talk.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that *if* he *is* cheating on you there is little that you can do to control him or force him to not cheat on you. Coming from someone who was cheated on in a long term relationship, trust me when I say that if that's the case I know how badly it sucks. But if you did find out that he was cheating for sure and you could convince him to stop cheating on you somehow would you really trust him afterwards or would you constantly be looking over your shoulder expecting him to mess up again? I'd like to point out again that this is all assuming that you talk to him and find out that he is in fact cheating since as of now it seems still possible that he isn't (not saying you should trust him blindly, but it's definitely possible).",

Even if you are being hysterical and completely jealous and insecure, if your fiance loves you, you should be able to have a conversation which ends in steps to relieve the discomfort. If he cannot do that, you have no hope as a couple.\n\nBut, that requires you honestly talk about the situation and agree on means to solve the situation.\n\nPersonally, I think finding your fiance on the couch, in underwear, being too cozy, is enough to warrant suspicion. Finding her panties everywhere is a strong indication she has no respect for you. I would also say it is a fairly decent signal she and your fiance are having sex everywhere and she is leaving them as messages, conscious or subconscious saying \"it don't matter if you guys are attached, I can have him when I want\". \n\nOne thing is clear here and that is you and your fiance don't have a good enough relationship to talk this through and work it out. That, to me, is a pretty clear signal you are not close enough to have honest discussions before hitting the \"boiling point\", which is not a good signal for this relationship as a marriage. I am guessing you give in all the time? \n\nIf you are serious about saving your relationship, you need to set boundaries. They can be something little to start, like \"Thursdays are our date night, not OUR date night\". Or a bigger discussion about discomfort and having him back you up on some rules \"leave your panties in your room,\" etc. If he is unwilling, you are probably doomed. If his approach is belittling or he does not want to talk at all, you are doomed.\n\nI hope you don't feel this is mean, but you need to nip this in the bud quickly based on your story. If I knew all sides, I might say you were being unreasonable, but there is definitely a boundary problem EVEN IF nothing else is happening. Currently, the signs suggest it is not just boundaries that are the problem.",
