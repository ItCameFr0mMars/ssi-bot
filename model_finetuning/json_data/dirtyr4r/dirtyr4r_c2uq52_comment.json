Learning to accept yourself is probably the hardest thing to do, especially if you feel like you're on the outside.\n\nI'm not telling you not to do this, but getting other people to tell you how to dress and how to behave this early in your life can end up being a slippery slope, so please think about it carefully?\n\nI gave up a lot of myself to make people happy at your age, and it is without a doubt the single biggest regret of my life. Luckily I've managed to reclaim a lot of me over the years since, but it hasn't been easy and I still haven't got it all back.\n\nI wish you every luck in your path forward.",
