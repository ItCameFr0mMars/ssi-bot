            "body": "Hey your post is old but I had some thoughts I'd like to share. I hope they bring you comfort. \n\nI'm going to start off by saying I think you did the right thing by ending things. \n\nWhen I was in high school, I remember conversations with my friend Christian. Sad as it is, we didn't have to date long before finding girls with large body image issues. Sometimes Absolutely stunning girls who thought they were hideous. We patted each other on the back because we were going to shower them with compliments. We thought if we told them they were pretty enough times, they might believe it. It didn't work. Not at all. Probably made it worse. The only person who could convince them is themself. \n\nIf I'm reading it correctly, it seems like you did the right thing. You encouraged and pushed someone to go further. What it seems to me occured is that he started to use you as his own sense of security. Instead of learning to validate himself he started to use you for constant validation. I think you should be proud of yourself that you noticed something wasn't right and ended things. \n\nWe all need validation sometimes but on our journeys of finding self validation. Because sometimes there jsut won't be someone around to call you pretty. \n\nNow I don't have a small penis. Im pretty sure I'm about as average as they come, but I 100 percent understand his fixation. It's an aspect of toxic masculinity which stems from porn. I grew up constantly thinking I was too small and worried about my size, or wishing I was bigger. Turns out I'm the perfect size. Turns out most girls don't want a monster cock. Some do. Most don't. \n\nMy roommate in college had a giant dick, like huge and it honestly caused more problems. Were there people who sought him out because of it? Sure. But there were also plenty of partners of his that like simply were too small. \n\nIn fact I'm average, and ive run into issues of being too big for girls who have smaller vulvas. Porn told me as a kid I want a girl to be as tight as possible and as man to have a giant cock. Turns out it sucks accidently tearing your girlfriend because she is so small. I doubt sex would have occured at all if I was any bigger. \n\nWhat I'm saying it's a toxic idea a lot of young males have. I remember listening to boys talking about measuring. I was lucky and broke out of that spell but it seems your poor Tom Holland got really stuck on it. \n\nI started writing a lot more about body issues and masculinity and I realized it was more for me than you so I deleted it. \n\nMy overall point is I hope I made clear where I think his insecurity came from. I think you are valid and made good choices. And im sorry he let it grow between you two. I think it's something only he can truly fix for himself. \n\nI hope my stupidly long message was of some help and not pretentious or anything. Best of luck my friend. :)",
