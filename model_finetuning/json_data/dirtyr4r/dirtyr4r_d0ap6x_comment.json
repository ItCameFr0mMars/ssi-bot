Otherwise known as the 'man does what woman wants without woman having to say anything because she'll stop \"submitting\" if his actions don't match her entirely subjective standards for a good dom' relationship.\n\nIt's shocking how a couple of really crappy books and movies could set into motion a cultural shift where basically every unmarried woman decides they want a guy that gets off on doing whatever gets them off and treating them however they want to be treated (solely because it's what the guy wants to do) and that wanting that makes them submissive. You know, I'd like for a woman to get off by doing all the things to get me off and treat me how I'd like her to treat me without ever having to say anything, too. If I expected that in a relationship it wouldn't make me submissive, it would make me narcissistic.",

Maybe you should start by asking that before you jump into assumptions. Let me help - I've always had a hard time enjoying sex because of past sexual trauma. Recently I learned that I'm not actually broken and can enjoy it just as much as anyone. The dom/sub relationship is appealing because I've never experienced that level of trust or intimacy with a man in my life. Giving myself completely to someone else is something I would love to feel comfortable enough to do. And before you jump there, no I dont have daddy issues. People like you are the reason it feels unsafe (culturally) for people to express their sexual desires. You might learn something if you remove yourself from that high horse \ud83d\ude18",

            "body": "Well for starters, it didn't take that long to write. I am truly sorry that you experienced sexual trauma, but it doesn't have any bearing on what I said. Given that you live in a modern Western nation, you actually can't give yourself completely to someone else because you can't surrender your right withdraw yourself at any time if that's what you want to do. Therefore, what you're talking about is \"giving yourself\" to a person as long as they do things that make you want to continue \"giving yourself\" them and don't do things that make you want to end that arrangement. Since your \"giving yourself to them\" is having them call all the shots, their role in the relationship is necessarily to keep you happy and your role is to passively be kept happy by them until they fail at keeping you happy and you decide to withdraw yourself from the arrangement. If you could surrender your right to withdraw from a relationship that you weren't happy in then I doubt that you would want to and I would be seriously concerned for you if you did.\n\nI never thought you had daddy issues. The thought never even entered my mind. I never suspected there was anything wrong with you. All you did buy into a trend that requires what would otherwise be a stunning lack of self-awareness. That's a pretty easy thing for people to do, especially when buying into the trend involves something that allows you to think someone else giving you what you want is just the way they should act if they're worth your time. You don't have to have emotional damage to fall into shit like that. Most of the time you just have to do is not think about it too hard and be socially exposed to other people who accept it.\n\nI don't know why you think people like me make it feel unsafe (culturally) to express their sexual desires. I didn't say anything about your sexual desires and I don't even have a clue what they are. Wanting to be in a relationship with someone where all you do is sit back and grade how well they meet your subjective expectations doesn't have anything to do with sex.\n\nYou could do the same thing with a voluntary relationship where someone who cooks all your meals, they tell you when to eat, and you're free to end the arrangement at any time. You are submitting your diet completely to them. As long as they continue cooking the kinds of food you find acceptable, giving you portions you find acceptable, and serve it at times you find acceptable you'll continue submitting your diet to them. And why does the cook do this agree to this? Why, obviously because the kind of person you want around would want to cook the kinds of food you want, give it to you in the portions you want, and deliver it to you when you want it. That's the same thing and it has nothing to do with sex.",

I have always loved it, there\u2019s always a safe word in place for when something hurts too much and always a hard no that the sub can say. I used to \u201cwalk\u201d my little girl late at night outside with only her panties and bra on with toys inserted. I lead her around a block on a leash. I was extremely turned on by it as she was as well. The thrill of being caught and seen excited her. There\u2019s a lot you can do under the Dom/Sub role for sure, if you have a partner or don\u2019t yet feel free to reach out I would happily show you a few things or even just give you some thoughts of what you might like under the Dom/sub category since it\u2019s such an expansive kink.",

A little about me: older handsome well-built widower with insatiable desires, located in lower Michigan. Married 30+years, when it came to sex/making love there was never a dull moment. Not looking to add another notch to my bed post or slip from bed to bed, but rather make friends with a like-minded female that is missing that spark in her life and truly desires the companionship of an older experienced man.  Would love to chat and see where it takes us.",
