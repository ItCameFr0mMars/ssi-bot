            "body": "A very honest and accurate explanation of how this particular man works. \n\n      I smell like Armani Code. I'm smart as well. I possess what's called \"command presence\". Reading people has never been an issue for me. I'm 6' 225, wide shoulders. Many women are intimidated by me because I'm unconcerned what they may think of me, just as many exude a \"fuck me\" air without even realizing it. I think you're probably of the latter persuasion where your body can betray your domestic and professional sensibilities. Once upon a time I capatalized on this knowledge at every turn. \n     A woman's clit isn't between her legs, it's between her ears. What she wants is to conspire with a lover who will slowly bring her to heal. For example, if you don't know what Armani Code smells like I have you stop by the mall on your way home. You spray it on a sample card and I have you put in a zip lock bag. I then tell you to get it out and take a long, lingering inhale of it right before I have you masturbate. The smell, the act of being told to aquire it along with you willfully complying all now connected to your own orgasm ties a little memory knot in your head. \n     As things progress, so do the demands. Each time you comply you become aroused. Further and deeper you go. Demanding an outfit is what you may want but not me. I want compliance, I need to know you're willing to obey. \n     As time passes your boring life melts away, you realize how dead inside you once were. Your orgasms soon become married to all the other little memory knots now in your mind and you can't ever imagine how you lived so complacently before. Life before was average and dull, now you've got an existence that has meaning, that connects not only your body but your private thoughts as well. I send meaningful song titles for you to listen to such as \"Secret Garden\" by Bruce Springsteen. Again you smell the now familiar and sexually connected odor of my cologne and with your mind slipping ever deeper your desire burns that much hotter. I tell you to watch 9 1/2 weeks. I have you send me letters so private that they'd destroy you if they ever got out simply because that's how this works. I need you to be vulnerable and exposed and you want it to. You're aroused beyond belief by it all.\n     You're no longer the wife, neither are you the professional you once identified as. You've had a part of you touched in a way you've never had touched before and now there's no going back. Ever constant are your thoughts about what was or perhaps may be asked of you next. You find yourself constantly distracted with thoughts that over ride all others. You want more.\n      You want to be told what to wear but you're not there yet. There's much work to be done first.  For now all you can do is inhale that all too familiar odor as you bring yourself to another mind shattering  orgasm, desperate to know what's next.\n\n\n\nIf you were only looking for a dick pic, sorry for fucking up your post. ;  )",
