            "body": "&gt; What the hell is Brexit?\n\nThat's the problem, no one knows exactly what constitutes Brexit.\n\nSome time ago David Cameron decided it would be a jolly nice idea if he asked all of us if we wanted to stay in the European Union. His real motivation for doing this was to shut up members of his own party who wanted to leave the EU and making life awkward for him. He believed that a referendum would return a No result and therefore end disputes in the Conservative party.\n\nHowever, as you know a Yes vote was returned. The reasons for this are:\n\n1. many people thought it would be fun to vote against the government as a protest vote and didn't think it would succeed.\n1. another group of people thought that too many immigrants (European and from the rest of the world) were taking our jobs, and we'd be better off controlling immigration and preventing Freedom of Movement.\n1. another group of people claimed we would be financially better off (up to \u00a3350 million a week) be leaving the EU.\n1. another group of people believed that we could trade with anyone we liked outside the EU and our import/ export balance of trade would be better.\n\nWhen the vote came in the following happened\n\n1. the people who voted against for a laugh/protest suddenly realised that they'd landed the UK in the sh1t\n1. the people who didn't want the immigrants suddenly found out all our crops were picked by the low paid immigrants they hated and all our low quality jobs which no one wanted were done by them too\n1. the people who thought we would be better off didn't realise we raked in a lot of money from the EU and our financial industry in particular relied on it. Our steel and motor industry is also heavily EU dependent and now its getting screwed.\n1. The people who thought we could trade elsewhere have looked on a map and noticed that all the other countries are a long way away and expensive to export to. And they've found having import/export duties and legislation barriers with your nearest neighbours is not a good idea.\n1. Everyone has discovered that no one knows what Brexit is exactly. Should we have no deal, some sort of customs union, a Norway model, a Swiss Model, a Canada model etc. All of these have various pluses and minuses.\n\nThe result of this is that for the last few years, English politics has consisted of people knowing what they don't want to do, but not getting enough support for what they do want to do. As a result we're stuck.\n\nIf that's clear enough, come to dinner with me.",
