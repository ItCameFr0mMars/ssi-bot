It was ended with Kennedys assassination in 63.\n\nCan i rant about communist infiltration and how women have no role in the military?\n\nCan i view you solely as the future mother of my children?\n\nCan we go to church to forgive our sins from just minutes before?\n\nI have zero patience for liberalism or feminism or any backwards ass ideology.\n\nThe sr71 blackbird was invented in the 50s and i see no evidence hunanity has ever evolved further.\n\nI want my idealistic woman to be just that. A woman. A woman i devote my life to, but a woman none the less. Willing to sacrifice my life to protect you, but you must wear dresses solely.\n\nGod i hate communists.\n\nA little over thirty, a little bit on the tall side, trying to love jesus, a 50s girl might help.",
