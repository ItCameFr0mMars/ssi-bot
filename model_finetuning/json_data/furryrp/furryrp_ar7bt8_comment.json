I've been a part of the community for quite some time and have had my fair share of short and long roleplays, but I've been looking for a long, story-oriented partner for a long while. If your interested, my kik is sexhound1 and my telegram is Luka Kastrid. I understand the name says something about my description style, but as you know, the rp portion of the furry fandom isn't exactly \"story friendly\". If we get together, I promise you a descriptive, heartwarming, romantic and sexual experience of whatever you desire. Thank you for taking your time to read my inquiry. Best of luck if you chose not to contact me ^^",
