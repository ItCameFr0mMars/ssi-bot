            "body": "Some roleplaying tips:\n...........\n\n[Impressions]\n\n#1: How you present yourself could be important, especially if the person you're approaching is someone you've never spoken to before. First impressions leave a lasting effect. For example, don't just waltz onto their public post and go grabs your boobs or spanks your ass, or even grab your dick etc. Unless you really want to come off as a desperate and thirsty pre-teen, don't do it. Chances are they'll never acknowledge you. Ever.\n\n#2: This is something I see often. But don't comment rp or rp?? or rp rp rp? , on a lot of their posts repeatedly. If they're not responding, it's either because they're busy, not interested, or are too scared to tell you that they're not interested, or something else. Do not continuously harrass them. Respect their personal space, please.\n\n#3: Don't throw hissy fits if they reject you on a roleplay. Seriously. You'll just give the impression that you're immature.\n\n#4: Curb those freaking nosebleed comments. You can do better!\n\n[Replies]\n\n#1:  If your partner don't deliver a reply to the roleplay every 15 minutes or so, don't freak! They have real life to attend to and other people to talk to as well. Unless you're their special someone (even there, please don't be too controlling), I don't see why they should give you their undivided attention all the time.\n\n#2: If you're the one who's not replying on purpose and won't be doing so for awhile, please notify them of the reason, even if it's simply because you lost interest in the roleplay or have hit a writer's block. Don't keep them hanging unless it's something unavoidable like sudden internet loss.\n\n#3: Other reasons could be that they weren't notified of the reply: especially on Google where notifications are always tripping or being hidden under spam. In that case, recommenting every few days or so could help as a reminder.\n\n#4: They could have simply forgotten about it, especially if it has been a few days or if they have a number of roleplays going on. In that case, #3 is probably what's best applicable here.\n\n.................\n\n[Actual Roleplay Replies]\n\n#1: I can't stress this enough, but one-liners or one-word replies are B O R I N G. Unless you're looking for a very simple and casual roleplay, that level isn't going to sit well with many roleplayers. Don't comment kisses you and finish it there. Expand on it. What else are you doing?\n\n(I don't normally write in first person, but this is the best I could do at short notice:)\n\nFor example: Not being able to hold myself back any longer, I pin you down onto the soft surface of the carpet on my bedroom floor, my hands gripping your wrists with strength I didn't know I had until now. My eyes flame with the passion and adoration I have for you, can't you see it? Before you had a chance to protest or push me away, I decided to assert my dominance. I kiss you then. Your lips are petal-soft and sweet, such a precious and unique texture. I broke the kiss for a split second, but only to whisper my intentions to your ear.\n\"You're making me hungry for more. I've made up my mind, I'm not going to stop until I make you mine.~\"\n\nSee what I did there?\nTry describing the surroundings, what other parts of your body are in action.\n\nAnother reply can be instead of writing shoots you with a gun , it can be expanded into something like, I grew furious with the current situation. You were getting on my nerves and I'm not going to stand by and let you endanger innocent lives. The weight of my handgun grew more noticable in my back-pocket. It was the only chance I had of getting out of here alive, I knew that now. I kept my gaze focused on you the entire time my hand crept back there and palmed the gun. The smooth metal felt cold on my skin, but I was driven to do this. I had no choice. Then, before I could change my mind, have mercy on you, I aimed the muzzle towards you and pulled the trigger, an ear-splitting bang resounding around the compound.\nUnlike the first example, these two replies end at the same event: the character shooting the other. One reply is straight to the point, the other explaining more in depth about what the character is feeling and experiencing. I wouldn't call this a necessity, but it could help if you're trying to get the bigger picture to what's going on.\n\n#2: Appropriate grammar is important, depending on the person you're role playing with. I'm not saying you should be on an award-winning author's level, but try to put some effort into your replies.\n\nExample 1:\ndo not do this see what i mean there is not a single punctuation mark or anything to signify that a sentence has ended or another had begun it is kind of difficult to follow and overall a little bit of a headache so please make an effort to make sense of what youre trying to get a across okay this applies to actions as well make it clear whether a person is thinking or talking or if theyre doing something make it clear that you actually care about the replies youre delivering\n\nExample 2:\nDun du dis or uz txt tlk bcuz it dunt luk nce 4 da 1 whos reading dis n they cud git tired of rplying 2 u\n(Okay, this is an exaggeration. But excessive use of text talk can unmotivate your partner.)\n\nWell... that's all I have for now. I don't know if this will help or not, but if it's of some use, then that's great!",
