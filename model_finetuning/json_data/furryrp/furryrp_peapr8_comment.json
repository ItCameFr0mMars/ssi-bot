I hope you\u2019ll forgive me littering you\u2019re post with such a lengthy message, but truth be told theres simply no way I could resist darling. Though can I truly be blamed? When one lays their eyes upon a goddess, it\u2019s only natural they shower her in worship no? Truth be told, I\u2019m nothing anywhere near the submissive boy toy type you\u2019re clearly after, though it\u2019s times like these when stared down by such motherly eyes that I wonder if how the other half lives might be the way to go. Heh, but to be completely honest little one, I\u2019d much rather see that confident motherly gaze contort into a look of unbridled pleasure brought about by my skillful paws handling every gorgeous inch of you . . . Though I\u2019ll gladly admit that such a pipe dream seems unlikely, I won\u2019t apologize for it! After all, to be completely and utterly rejected by a goddess is far superior to having never heard from her at all~",

Perhaps the muscle head stereotype is a bit more accurate than I thought \ud83d\udc94 If you do happen to use a service like kik or telegram, I\u2019d love to hit you up! If not however . . .
