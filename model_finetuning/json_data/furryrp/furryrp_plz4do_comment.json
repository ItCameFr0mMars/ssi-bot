            "body": "Hey darlin, before I waste both our times and send you a long literate intro, I do want to mention that I exclusively play as an anthro character. However, if you were to be a furry MILF and I were to play as the massive muscle gut scalie I usually play as, I think we could still make your plot of species tension work out excellently! Though if you\u2019re dead set on a human son, I understand . . . Though I\u2019ll be honest, no human could possibly handle you the way I could. Firm, powerful hands gripping that meaty ass of yours to throw you up against the wall, pin those thick juicy thighs up against your chest, and seamlessly power fucking each of your tight needy little holes into a gaping cum soaked mess the way only a superior scalie specimen can ~ \nNot to mention taking every opportunity to show my ownership over you behind my moron of a fathers back. Slapping a collar around your neck, tattooing \u2018Croc Owned Slut\u2019 over that phat ass of yours, and even branding my initials into your soon to be swollen and cum filled belly . . . Need I say more? If you\u2019re interested love, you can either respond to me here or message me at yiff.daddy.xp on Kik. I think the two of us could have plenty of dirty, wicked fun together ~",
