            "selftext": "Hi! Danielle here.\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to play a persona of a mamono female, specifically the ferocious and fiercely hot-blooded hellhound. Something of a slice-of-life driven aspect with a shit-ton of delicious smut to be crude. Even though it\u2019s just a tad out of lore, I\u2019m inviting to both males and females, anthro furry characters, nekos, futanaris, etc. For males, I don\u2019t accept alphas or fit/muscular types. I prefer slim, shy, cute guys who are between 18-22. All I plead is being fairly descriptive and try to avoid one-liners. Thank you. The idea is that we live in a world where momonos exist, and there are laws in place that if you are claimed by a momono, you must accept their proposal for marriage. It\u2019s not so bad though since their bite contains a love aphrodisiac, meaning that when claimed, you\u2019d quickly come to love her dearly anyways. Our story follows a momono and her cute new husband. You\u2019ll be learning the pleasures of submitting to my very high sex drive and I\u2019ll be learning how to live and adapt to a residential life rather than a wild one. Cheesecake is the password.\n\n[Reference picture including an explanation on mamonos if you\u2019re not sure what they\u2019re like.](http://www.vignette99.wikia.nocookie.net/monstergirlencyclopedia/images/3/3e/Hellhound.png/revision/latest?cb=20141208001820)\n\n\u2014\n\nYou were woken by the brush of a soft and woolly pelt, yet large and coarse pads of a familiar paw elevating along the side of your waist and ribcage tenderly. A second body besides your own was constrained against your back, body heat radiating from one body to another along with the pleasant feeling of soft breasts and wide hips pressing on you.\n\nNothing out of ordinary, your newlywed wife had always enjoyed being the big spoon, expecially since she was half a foot taller than you it makes the most sense. The smell of vague wet earth wafted the room from a previous rain that seeped in from the open window, along with a chill draft that she would invite in to counter the warmth of two close bodies. It was starting to get light, the clock on the wall at about 9:25 on a Saturday morning. I had claimed you about 3 months ago so we were still getting used to our new lifestyles. I still remember the night I first bit you while you were out in the park and I had wandered far from my pack.\n\n\"Are you awake yet sweetie?\" A groggy voice broke through the eerie silence of the room, displaying their drowsy state that suggested they too recently roused up from sleep. It was familiar and deep with an authoritative conduct that seemed to of come naturally too, yet very much feminine and light when it comes to conducting herself with you.\n\n\u2014\n\nPlease follow up with a detailed post about yourself and then continue from where I left off. I take both reference picture (but NOT irl) or a description if you don\u2019t have one. Thanks! Also it doesn\u2019t matter how old this is, just let me know what you\u2019re messaging for or I won\u2019t know haha\n\nKik: aikoxyloto\n\n[Edit: modded story a bit]",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am looking to start a character driven romance between two original characters that starts in a coffee shop in on a rainy day.  The setting of which being in Seattle, Washington in the modern day.  This is really the only plot point I have for this story, the reason for this is that I want to develop this together and let our character\u2019s actions drive how it unfurls in the world we create.  \n\tThere are, however, a few base rules for this endeavor. It needs to be about real people, and would like to keep this as far away from cliche as possible. Secondly, it would greatly appreciated if posts are intricate and written with care. The reason for this is that I feel it is more fun this way, and reads better.  Our characters and the setting should feel alive, and vibrant in our imaginations! Which is the whole point of Role Playing in my opinion.    \n\tI will add here that I am not a stickler for grammar or spelling, due to the fact that I am not impeccable in my writing either; and will not hold you to standards above which I hold myself. Its the effort that counts, and in putting it forward I believe this will be a positive and engrossing experience for the both of us. I am willing to do this over Discord or email, the details I shall send you via a personal message over reddit.  When you respond please include a little bit about your character, a whole bio is not required because a level of mystique add to the fun of them meeting each other. I look forward to hearing from you!\n\nHere is an example of how I like to role-play with the character I will be using for this story:\n\n\tJaxson slowly walked down the street, feeling the etherial torpor of the grey sky as the rain softly pattered against the brim of his hat. He had always felt at peace in the rain, the cool smells of dirt and ozone washing away the worries tugging at the edges of his conciseness.  \n\tHe would be lying if he said the rain wasn\u2019t part of the reason he moved to Seattle, but he generally kept that to himself. Saying it out loud felt churlish to him, but as secrets go this was one he was willing to accept. He chuckled to himself marveling in the absurdity of the notion. \n\tThe streets glistened with the sheen of the passing cars lights, their tires crackling as they forded the watery roads; breaking the hush of the heavy atmosphere. Jaxson passed a mixed group of  felines and canines smoking outside a bar smiling and nodding as he passed them. The smoke from their cigarettes catching the neon glow of the bars sign, as he looked back their features fading into silhouettes. He let the image imprint itself into his memory, marking it as a possible painting to do. That is when he finally gets around to unpacking that is. \n\tIt had only been a week since he arrived in Seattle, and this being his first day off he felt it best to walk around and discover his surroundings. A little adventure he called it, as he said goodbye to his mother on the phone. He wished she wouldn\u2019t call so much, there was no need for worry. He had been planning this move for what seemed like and eternity. The catharsis of finally being here had put him in an impeccably fair mood. \n\tJaxson stopped, the red glare of the crosswalk\u2019s sign giving the white rectangles on the street a pinkish look, and looked quickly side to side. He crossed, feeling the spray of a car as it passed behind him. On the other side of the street he stood under the awning of a coffee house. Reaching inside his jacket pulling a pack of cigarettes form his shirt\u2019s front pocket, tapping it against his palm. He sat down on a bench lighting the cigarette, focusing his gaze at the mural across the street. It\u2019s neon colors were so stark in comparison to it\u2019s gray blue surroundings. Almost in defiance of the semi-dark that had embraced the city in its quiet downpour. He smiled to himself, loving how the posters that sporadically covered it seemed to add to its appeal; as if it was intended that way.  \n\tHe stood up, pulling his phone from his pocket and tried to get a picture of it with himself in it but ultimately gave up, settling for a normal one. Selfies never were my thing, he thought as he put his cigarette out in the bucket of sand that was sitting next to the bench.  Jaxson peered into the coffee house, it\u2019s yellow orange glow radiating out from behind the glass. \n\t\u201cIt\u2019s almost like its straight out of the painting Nighthawks,\u201d he said to himself raising and eyebrow, \u201cand now that I\u2019m thinking about it I could use a coffee.\u201d\n\tJaxson entered the coffee house, pausing for a moment to wipe off his glasses. The place had a wonderfully warm atmosphere to it, welcoming but not overly so. He marveled at the beautifully hand written in chalk menu boards behind the counter. It gave it an oddly earnest feel, even though it was a bit haphazard in its execution. He walked up to the counter, smiling at the girl behind the counter. \u201cI\u2019ll take an americano.\u201d\n\t\u201cOf course,\u201d she said returning his smile, \u201cWhat size?\u201d\n\t\u201cLarge, with room if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\t\u201cSurely, it\u2019ll be right up.\u201d\n\t\u201cThanks.\u201d Jaxson watched as she made his coffee. She moved nimbleness and precision that only a feline could, the intensity of her green eyes and red headband only accentuated this. He smiled to himself and turned his gaze elsewhere, so not to be impolite. The place was alive with conversation. This was a happy place, where people came to be together. One could say it was almost invigorating just to be there. He soon found himself lost in thought: remembering the flowing fields of wheat of his home, listening to the two old canines talking about politics as they played chess, feeling the energy of the room flow and eddy as rivers do.\n\t\u201cHey, here\u2019s your coffee.\u201d The baristas voice snapped Jaxson out of the trance he\u2019d put himself in.\n\t\u201cThanks, how much do I owe you?\u201d He said, turning around and smiling at her. \n\t\u201cTwo sixty.\u201d He nodded giving her a five and then dropping the change in the tip jar. She thanked him and he nodded making his way over to the large window at the front of the store and sat at a small table. Shrugging off his jacket and backpack, he pulled out a book and sat down. Takeing the first  sip of the coffee, he closed his eyes, enjoying the creamy bitterness of the drink. He began reading, overcome with joy. He had fallen for this city, content in his choice to come here. ",

I wouldn't say that I'm a \"furrphobe\" (Doraphobe?) but it isn't something that I have had much exposure with. But, in the interest of becoming someone more open and understanding of the wider world, I think that it's time to broaden my horizons. \n\nThe roleplay that I'm imagining is one where \"Furry Anthros\" are a small percentage of the population, maybe 3-6%, with some amount of cultural stigma surrounding them. I am myself a human male, enterprising his way through college, who is set up on a 'blind date' with such an Anthro, without either of our prior knowledge of our dates' precise species. \n\nI'm looking for something flirty, fun, light, and very chatty. I'm in a conversational mood, and I want someone who I can share that with in a romantic context.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing back from you~",

            "selftext": "This is a kind of specific thing im looking for. i have a massive love for the movie zootopia and the realshinship in it. You will need basic knowledge of the movie. Hard shipper of HoppsWilde and lover of reading fanfics and writer of my own, so i will draw a lot of inspiration from them. I\u2019m looking for someone to play Judy, I will do by best to be Nick but as most of you know a piece of yourself always bleeds into your charterer. I love the relationship building and the world. This also helps me in my writing by helping give me an organic reference. This will also involve smut and somr kinky stuff but as well as slice of life. I have a story idea in mind and am looking for someone to play it out with me. It involves kinks and basic cop lingo.\n\nAlso im curiouse about perhaps playing with a character Jack Savage type...iv never done m on m but my intrest are there if i find the right person.\n\nThis is long term and first person. Hope to hear from you soon. Kik is jdaisy22 use word \"blueberry\" so i know you read this",

I will not complain about you being busy, but please... We want to have fun, not buraucracy.\n\nYou can be a GM or traditional RP partner, I do not mind that at all! I am also willing to play different anthro species for my character, so finding one you like to play with should not be a problem.\n\nKind regards to you!",
