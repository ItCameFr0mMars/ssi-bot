            "selftext": "Here we go again!\n\n'ello everyone! \n\nThis is going to get a bit long because I want to make sure you know what I'm looking for and what I don't want. :) Sorry if I come off as a bit restrictive, but I've had lots of people contact me in the past who didn't quite get that \"I don't do that kink\" means I absolutely won't do it. Please be sure to read through the whole thing. If I hate something you love or love something you hate, we're probably not right for each other.\n\nI'm currently experiencing a bit of an RP drought, and I'm going to need some help stuffing that hole. Pun intended. First things first: I'm located in Europe. Partners from other continents are absolutely fine, but it would be great if we could **schedule** our rps somewhat to make sure we're both here. Also, I'm looking for a **reliable** partner. If something comes up and you can't make it to an agreed RP time, do let me know. If you hate something in the RP that we can fix, do let me know. If we're not good together and you want to stop playing, do let me know. We're reasonable adults, and whatever's going on, we can talk about it.\n\nI love story. I love smut. I need both. I'm not doing quick fucks, and I'm not doing weeks of RP without a single shag. A 50/50 ratio is usually agreeable. Please make sure that we share this view before replying.\n\nI'm okay with **any kind of gender pairing,** but I do prefer mixing it up. Maybe we can populate our original world (no fandoms, please, bit of creativity here!) with several characters each and play straight couples, gay men, lesbians, futas and all that stuff. If you have a strong preference for one or two genders, I'm sure we can still figure something out.\n\nAlright, **kink requirements!** Apart from grammar, punctuation and a decent one-, two- or three-paragraph post length, there's the following, structured in neat little categories for easy reference:\n\n**Favourites - I need those!**\n\n* **Cumshots.** Clean fur is nice, cum-covered fur is nicer! Depending on the setting, I'm okay with both realistic and unrealistic amounts of cum.\n\n* **Romance.** Maybe the relationship starts with a one-night stand, but there **is** a relationship. I want our characters to fall in love.\n\n* **Kissing.** I like kissing a lot, both in the NSFW part of our RP and in the story part. It's what makes romance romance in my opinion, and I do like a well-described kiss every now and then.\n\n* **Dirty Talk and Moans.** Please don't be too quiet when we shag. Sounds can be as enticing as physical sensations, smells and tastes.\n\n* **Favourite species:** Wolves, lynxes, red pandas.\n\n**Yes - I like those and generally want to include them, but if you don't like any of them, that's fine.**\n\n* **Slapping, biting, scratching.** I like it rough and passionate. If your characters don't, that's alright.\n\n* **Public sex, clothed sex, quickies.**\n\n* **Slightly chubby, slightly muscular, slightly tall and slightly short characters:** I don't like most extremes, but I do like variety in body types. That includes cock and breast sizes, of course!\n\n* **Multiple characters.** Maybe a friend joins in, maybe there's a love triangle... I'm okay with one player playing multiple characters at the same time.\n\n\n* **Species I like too:** Some breeds of cats and dogs (the domesticated kind), lizards without wings, horses without wings, female pandas, opossums, weasels, mouses... Anything that's not on the No List (further below) usually works out.\n\n**Maybe - Those depend on context, and I don't really want them in every play. If you don't like any of them, that's completely fine, because I'm totally okay leaving them out!**\n\n* **Watersports.** Can be hot sometimes, but it's not my main kink in any way.\n\n* **Sibling incest, particularly twins.** Surprise my character by showing up as two people when he expected one! Or let me be your brother or sister.\n\n* **Saliva play.** In a heated fuck, things can get messy. Messy kisses, messy blowjobs, bit of extra lube for a handjob or wet rimming. I'm down for that.\n\n**No - I'm not doing those!**\n\n* **Scat and Vomit are definitely on the no list!**\n\n* **Dom/Sub, Bondage, Torture, Violence.** I'm fine with violence in the plot section, of course, but our eRP will be full of love and equality, even when it's rough. No BDSM stuff. I'm adamant there. Don't contact me with \"Maybe a bit of tying you to the bed post, that's not really BDSM\" messages. Blindfolds are sometimes okay, but I'm not into master and pet stuff.\n\n* **Vore, Growth, Transformation, Tentacles.**\n\n* **Species I definitely don't want to play:** Frogs and toads, bovines, centaurs, flying dragons or anything that's a lot taller or shorter than a 'normal' anthro; no bestiality/ferals. No bats. No fish or other water creatures.**\n\n\nOkay! You made it through the kink list. Have a cookie! There's one more list coming up, namely scenario ideas. **Those are not all the ideas I have, and we can of course integrate your ideas!** Just to give you an idea of what's possible.\n\nI do **not** do fantasy or medieval. I RPed in WoW for seven years, and I'm sick of the whole \"no electricity, lots of lore, lots of races\" stuff.\n\n* **Urban Fantasy:** Probably my favourite setting. This doesn't necessarily mean vampires and werewolves, even though the literature world apparently thinks that. It could be magic users and normal people in a modern world, either getting along nicely or hating each other's guts.\n\n* **Slice of Life:** Just a normal modern world with furries instead of people. More of a focus on everyday activities instead of an over-arching plot with a villain and lots of action.\n\n* **Near future:** Ten or twenty years from now, with either an urban fantasy or slice of life touch to it. Technological gadgets, maybe a bit of spaces stuff, generally just somewhere between modern day and sci-fi.\n\n* **Sci-fi** is possible if it's done well. We'd have to take a look at each other's definition of sci-fi there.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAnd that's it! Congratulations, you've made it. Before you go (and hopefully drop me a private message telling me you want to play with me!), one more thing: Sometimes I've got a lot of time, sometimes not so much. This is a long-term thing, but not a \"for hours every day\" thing. Sometimes that can happen, but don't count on never doing anything else again. I enjoy playing a lot when I have the time, but depending on my schedule and your time zone, it doesn't always work.\n\nHave a great day!",

            "selftext": "Afternoon Everyone,\n\n\nI'm Finian, an anthro Sugar Glider who is seeking either a new roleplay group, or role play partners.  My character has a fairly involved background which I wouldn't mind incorporating, but I am easy going and can fashion a background for virtually any roleplay context.    \n\n\nI am interested in adult orientated roleplay, but that doesn't mean I'm looking exclusively for sexual escapades.  A healthy balance of story, erotica, and world building is most welcome.  This character enjoys wandering the world when given the chance, and lives for new *interesting* experiences.  He is slim, somewhat attractive, and hilariously meek.\n\n\nI am looking to conduct the RP over discord or email, as those mechanisms allow for detailed responses.  Any species and gender are welcome.  Preferably something long term, as I would like to add new life experiences to my characters background if possible.\n\n\nPlease **Reddit PM* me to exchange contact information.\n\n\n[NSFW Character Reference - FA](http://www.furaffinity.net/view/26011075/)\n\n\nMy characters background (should you choose to use it):\n\n\n&gt;Originally Finian had no last name. People in his commune had no family names, and instead identified themselves using a given name (Finian), and stating the community they originated from (ne Mistral). Thus he would have been called Finian ne Mistral when speaking to people outside of his circle. He took the last name Wren after becoming a part of his mates cackle.\n\n\n&gt;Finian started life in a commune, where all the children grew up assuming all other children were brother and sister, and everyone else were elders/parents within the community. No child would know which elders were their parents, and instead treated everyone older with the same respect as one would give their biological parents. Mating would not occur from within the commune, but instead be between other neighboring communes.\n\n\n&gt;Finian isn't entirely sure of his age, but he assumes it was somewhere between 3 and 4 decades earlier. The commune didn't place much value on accurate record keeping, or history.  The commune was made up of various species (both predators and prey) which had mutually decided to give up individual family lines, and to instead live as a single (large) family unit. They were an agrarian society where all members lived as vegetarians (even predator species).\n\n\n&gt;Some years prior, Finian had left his commune/community due to wanderlust. After spending a great deal of time exploring his known world, he ended up arriving in one of the great predator slums existing in the ruins of old cities. In his first days exploring in the slums, he ended up being beaten (and worse) by scavenging rats. A hyena, Breah, found his body and took him back to her squat. he now lives in a small supply closet she has given him as his own space.  Originally he had taken various odd jobs; things such as book keeping, cooking, etc. These days he's confined to a small area around Breah's squat. He collects possibly valuable debris, but he primarily takes care of the squat (housekeeping, cooking, etc). He can read the old world languages and sometimes reads stories of the world that came before to Breah.",

            "selftext": "The Furry Arena is just that, an arena for furries. You can walk in with your fursona and fight someone else's fursona in gladiator combat for the amusement of the people and your own glory. Within the arena's walls, death is no longer so fatal, with all fighters being revived by a mysterious magic once a victor is declared.\n\nWhen not fighting, the RP takes on a slice of life sort of thing as is centered around a community of furries living together in a town built around the arena. Both grizzled fighters and pacifist audiences are welcome. Tourism is steadily growing, so even if you no longer fight, you can partake purely in a heaping slice of town life.\n\nNote: This is a server for experienced roleplayers. A simple RP test given on entry. We only accept people that can consistently type out paragraph posts. If you're an experienced roleplayer who wants to RP with other experienced roleplayers, this is the server for you.\n\nTo join, just click on the link: https://discord.gg/cMXYnQf",

Don't get me wrong, I like my yiff, but I find its much more rewarding with character development and story behind it.\n\nI have one specific idea that I've been absolutely itching to play out. I'm looking to roleplay a zombie apocalypse. In this world, the population of the planet is 95% humans, 5% anthros. The virus strikes suddenly, as it usually does, and the world is thrown into chaos. While both humans and anthros can be infected, only humans will return as undead after succumbing to the infection. Our characters can be.. anything! We don't have to know each other, actually I prefer that our characters don't know each other prior to meeting, and we can develop a bond through chaos and near-death experiences!\n\nMy fursona is a grey wolf, with deep blue markings. He is 6 ft 2, and fairly well built, but by no means a body builder. I will be happy to provide a reference photo upon request, and real photos after we've talked for a little while.\n\nI'm happy to carry out this RP on either Kik or Discord! Shoot me a message here and I will be happy to give you my info, or send me yours and I'll contact you! Take care.",

            "selftext": "(This prompt will be open for a long time!)\n\nHi there!\n\nI've been into anthro roleplaying a lot lately, and today I'd like to try a different kind! In this roleplay I want you to play as an anthro animal male with me playing as two human women.\n\nYour character would be younger, at 18 years old, while the women would be 30+\n\nI want this to be a fun and light hearted roleplay, so no dark themes. The main kink of this will be that the animal has two cocks, which of course can be used for a lot of fun with the women, like double penetration on one girl, two cocks in one hole, fucking both girls at the same time etc.I prefer the focus to be on the hetero stuff, though of course the girls will be involved a little bit with each other when needed :)\n\nI'm open for interesting locations as well, like meeting on a vacation or if you have any fun ideas :) \n\n* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, ageplay, threesomes, large cocks(not extreme though), light hearted roleplaying\n* **Limits:** Toilet stuff, impregnation, dark themes, non-con, violence, pegging\n\nSo, if you're interested in trying this out, please send a response and answer the following things:\n\n* A little bit about what you're into\n* Your thoughts on the prompt and theme\n* What of my kinks you like\n* What kinks you like to add(that don't conflict with my limits)\n* What limits you have\n\nPlease take some time to read the prompt through and come up with a response. I'll be in through the day, so there's no hurry to be the first to respond. I prefer a response addressing the prompt over a low effort one-liner :)\n\n*Love, Emelie*",
