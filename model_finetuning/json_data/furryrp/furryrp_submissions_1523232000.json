I would enjoy having someone who is dedicated and passionate about creating new characters and scenarios to play out. \n\nI would like someone who is tired of the same old slice of life stuff and likes to think outside the box. I mean, RPs are a way to do stuff that you can't do in real life? Why RP about real life. To me, it seems like a waste. But, that's just me. \n\nHere's a list of all my kinks and nos: https://www.f-list.net/c/libra%20bethelon/\n\nMy RPs are between a couple of sentences long to a couple of paragraphs long. I'm all about the details when it comes to RPs, I would like it if my partner also enjoys painting a picture with words. \n\nIf you made it this far great! Why all the weird requests? Simple, I'm looking for someone that is as imaginative as I am, also could help me with my artistic muse.\n\nIf you're interested, please PM me. \n",

            "selftext": "Hello,\nI am Vivianne Savengard, one of the founding members of the original skype rp group know as Steampunk canterlot. Getting away from the tire-fire that is Skype has allowed us to expand our group from one than just the main rp channel.\n\nThe rp currently has a few channels,\n\nOne: Steampunk Canterlot\nThe main rp where 90% of the focus goes to. It has a \"sfw\" and a \"NSFW\" channel that can both be used. \n\nSnippet from Welcome channel.\n\n\"Canterlot. It's a city built on magic and brass gears. But times have changed, allowing for a new revolution. Folk from all walks of life, all shapes, sizes and species flow into this architectural time capsule. Technology has progressed along with the rest of the world, of course, so citizens enjoy all the modern comforts like televisions, and motor cars, and that great invention: The Internetwork. The \"Elite\" of this bustling metropolis live in the highest part of the mountain the city was built on, comprised almost entirely of racist snobs. The world we look at, however, is a little lower down, in a spur of the Middle District. This particular spur is on what is known as the \"Upper-Middle Artery\", as certain folk from Upper choose to shop there for the relatively lower prices and fewer riff-raff than can be seen in other middle sub-districts.\"\n\nThis rp channel allows people to play pretty much anything they want. From a bog standard human to a large shark woman who is as tall as a building. Mostly anything will be welcomed to be played!!\n\nThe second public channel is our Pokemon Roleplay. We haven't started this one off yet, but it seems to be heading in an Anthro pokemon route. If that interests you.\n\nWe also have the WTF is going on? channel, which you can ask for clarity for anything in the rps.\n\nFinally, the rules set forward by the god of the channel -\n\n\"First off, no godmode. Reality warpers are fine within reason, but if there's like two or more in a scene, it may encourage people to leave. \"Reality warper\" in this case refers to anything from a character afflicted by a mild case of cartoon-physics, to the use of a kiss as though it were a physical object, to using some chalk to draw a doorway in order to leave a room. More extreme things should preferably be avoided entirely\n\nSecond, the nature of the RP. As much as everyone seems to be packing heat, character-on-character violence is discouraged, unless it's discussed prior in PMs. On another note, sex scenes should stay away from the main chat, as much as the city's laws are incredibly lax on what is or is not public indecency. (Law makers who are exhibitionists, yo.) You can either use bedroom door philosophy, e.g. \"They went off on their own to do the do\" or take it to the nsfw chat, which is more open to explicit content. Can even go into PMs if you're so inclined.\n\nThird, roles. We have some of those. When a person joins, they'll be given the Lurker role, which prohibits them from posting in the RP channels. Once they've posted a character description in #character-chat the role will be removed, and they can join the RP as that character. Be advised that some peoples' reference images may contain nudity in that channel.\n\nFourth, disruptive users. We haven't had any, and I'd like to keep it that way. If one does come along, myself, Viv or Reaper can remove them. If you believe that you were unfairly removed, message me and I'll review the decision in my own time. Even if I was the one who removed you I might be willing to review. Should your removal be overturned and you immediately start being a pest again when you rejoin, you will not be permitted to return.\n\nFifth, general don't be a dick. I don't want this to be like a hugbox or an echo chamber or whatever, but that doesn't give you the right to shit on someone's tastes. Also don't be a perv to the 3d grils in here. Being a girl on the internet is hard enough without being told tits or GTFO. That said, if you happen to be a 3d gril, I have zero qualms about you verifying your femininity\"\n\nThe Lurker Role also exists for anyone who'd like to read the rps, but has no interest in rping them.\n\nIf you do not have a character, there are plenty of Master character designers who can help build up someone for you to play.\n\nIf you somehow made it this far then feel free to ping me at VivianneSavengard#2088 and I shall reply to you ASAP. Happy Roleplaying.",
