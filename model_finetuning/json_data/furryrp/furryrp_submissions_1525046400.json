A planet, one that is nearly identical to earth... But it's inhabitants are different. Like animals, but bipedal. And primal. They have a language, currency, daily life, but no advanced weapons or tools. The takeover is easy. \n\nThe roleplay takes place 5 years into the colonization, I (or you, I play either gender.) play a high ranking Human officer, who has the privilege of picking out an Anthro to take as a wife, toy, etc. Depending on her behavior. You (or, again, me, depending on your preference.) play a female of the tribes, young, bright, submissive or dominant, your choice. \n\nPlease, have the reading level of at least a 16 year old. Most people on Reddit act like/are 12. I post in paragraphs, or in small bursts, depending on how the scene is going, and I read over my text to avoid errors.\n\nIf you can keep up, we can talk. swash#5139",
