            "selftext": "Bringing back this character since I did get a few bites on my last RP prompt so I'm hoping that I can repeat the success here. Its another slow-build slice-of-life/romance RP but instead of being a marine, the character is a corgi badass sassy bounty hunter with you being able to post as little or as much as you want when it comes to sending back your replies. Once again, I'm looking for somebody to RP with me over Skype and I'm not here for people trying to convince me to get another application. Skype is what I got and it is what I am using. Once again, I'm in the Eastern Time Zone and USUALLY I am up from 3 PM to 6 AM most days. Probably just a bit more active in the afternoon/evening. All that I ask is that for the love of God, you DON'T leave me waiting for 10 minutes if you have to do something else. Give me a hint that you got to go away from the computer. This is his backstory, but you don't have to follow it exactly its just there to give you an idea.\n\n*****\n\nJames Conway, known either as Jim, Jimmy, or Ace, is a cardigan Welsh corgi with an attitude. Formerly a member of the \"Seven Swords\" mercenary group, this treasure and bounty hunting corgi is a force to be reckoned with. Despite his diminutive stature, he's a tough SOB with close to ten years of experience in being a mercenary and a bounty hunter. \n\nJames was born in Glasgow, Scotland, but moved at a very young age to London, and grew up on the banks of the Thames. From a very young age the corgi has determined that he wanted to be part of the SAS, but when he finally came of age to join the military, he was turned down because of his odd birth defect of his long arms. \n\nThe rejection was brutal for James, and caused the corgi to fall into some bad habits, as well as to wander fairly aimlessly for a year, eventually winding up in Somalia as part of a local warlord's forces. His lifelong dedication to trying to get him into the military has made him a very proficient fighter and gunman, and he was soon picked up by a well known mercenary outfit, The \"Seven Swords\". \n\nAs part of the Seven Swords, Jimmy excelled in combat. He's seen combat operations in most of Africa, the middle east, Ukraine, Brazil, and Mexico. Skill wise, he's on equal standing with most tier 1 operators from the best. He is a master of Muy Thai, Judo, and Krav Maga. He specializes in CQB combat in urban settings, and is well known for taking two pistols over an AR in many scenarios. \n\nHowever, James eventually retired from the Seven Swords when he found a treasure map. He now is a treasure and bounty hunter, as well as a solo mercenary. \n\nHe stands at 1.52 meters, or 5' exact. His fur is tan and creme, and his eyes are amber. He was born with an odd defect that made his arms longer in proportion than the rest of his body, a characteristic possibly formed from the 1/4 GSD in his blood. He has a scar on his nose, and his unit's emblem tattooed on his left arm. \n\nWhile the British pup can take a joke, you should only joke about his stature or his long arms if you are a very close friend, and even there you'll be treading in thin ice. \n\nSex wise, this pup is straight. He likes to be the dominant in a relationship, a result of slight shame about his short stature and his time as a platoon leader. He's well hung for his size, though, and has proven to have an almost insatiable desire.\n\n*****\n\nIf you are interested, you can either comment, send me a message or add me at amazee_dayzee. Hope to find someone who WON'T disappear for long stretches of time.\n",
