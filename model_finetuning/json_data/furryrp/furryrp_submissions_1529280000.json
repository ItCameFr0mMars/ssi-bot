            "selftext": "Welcome one and all to the grand re-opening of Crescent Island.\nAfter being closed for renovations the resort is once again opened and as such the owner and operator, Akia, has sent invitations completely at random all over the world. Those willing to redeem their all expense paid trip to the island will find themselves in one of the most luxurious resorts on a completely uncharted island which has been kept secret for years.  \n\nFirst a little information about the island.\n\nCrescent Island got its name from the shape, little surprise there.  The island is shaped like a crescent moon, along the inside is the beautiful sandy beach, and from the middle the outer curves are lush jungles just waiting to be explored.  Private little huts span out along the island, some right on the beach, others closer to the lush jungles, but in the middle of them all is the main resort building. Each guest is given a key to their own private hut, inside they will find a bedroom, a small kitchen space, and a bathroom.  The main entrance to the resort\u2019s central building faces the ocean, when entering guests will find a reception desk to their left.  To the right of the entrance is a small series of steps that lead up to an elevated lounge, on one side is the bar, on the other side are a series of armchairs and couches for socializing with a fireplace on the outer wall. On the far side across from the bar is a piano that sits against a slightly curved wall.  Immediately after the reception desk is a large heavy door that lead\u2019s to Akia\u2019s office, the door is always locked and guests who manage to find a way beyond said door will be punished, regardless of weather or not they are discovered. Further down the main hallway guests will find a full gym, a catered dining hall, game rooms, and a small movie theater just below ground. In the far back of the resort is an indoor pool for the rare stormy rainy days when guests cannot safely swim in the ocean.  \nDeeper in the jungle are several lagoons for guests to discover hidden away and not marked on any map. Should they be found the guests will find each has it\u2019s own unique traits. \nBlue Lagoon: The perfect water of the blue lagoon is always a few degrees below body temperature making it a pleasant swim for guests, however certain properties of the water will cause guests to feel themselves growing more aroused than normal. It is not advised to swim in these waters unless you are willing to indulge in such desires with whoever may join in (it is important to note that this description is for theme only to lend to creative roleplay and is not intended as a device to trick or force people into ERP)\nRed Lagoon: the warm waters of the red lagoon are similar to that of a natural hot spring due to the lagoon\u2019s proximity to the island\u2019s volcano. The water of the red lagoon is incredibly rich in minerals that are not only good for the skin but have a rejuvenating effect on those who soak in them.  Guests who wish to relax and those who are sore from too much physical activity find soaking in the waters can even heal some wounds.  Be warned small monkeys play around the red lagoon and may try to steal food and alcohol.\nYellow Lagoon: The yellow lagoon is an odd one, with cold water that seems unnatural for the tropical island. The yellow lagoon is popular for guests who like to refresh themselves in a cooler bath.  All around the yellow lagoon are strange trees that hang over the water, their branches grow a bizarre yellow fruit the size of an avocado. The skin of the fruit is a bright yellow and the whole thing is edible with a flavor that turns from sour to sweet.  Consuming the fruit can cause a state of euphoria and/or relaxation similar to alcohol as well as inducing sleep in larger amounts.\nBlack Lagoon: the survival instinct in all living beings prevents guests from finding the black lagoon. Its purpose is a secret and will be revealed in time to those who explore the island and learn its secrets\n\nPink Lagoon: the pink lagoon does not always exist, and when it does it doesn\u2019t always exist in the same place twice. Entering the pink lagoon will cause someone to become afflicted with a random outcome revealed by an admin. There are 100 different outcomes and almost all of them are undesirable, but funny to those unaffected.  All effects are temporary ending in 24 hours.\n\nRules\n1)\tKeep OOC in the OOC chat and RP in the RP\n2)\tThis is primarily a sexual roleplay, if you do not like seeing sexual actions played in public this chat is not for you\n3)\tAs this is a sexual roleplay we ask everyone who joins be 18+ \n4)\tPlaying a character who is clearly a child is not allowed\n5)\tHave some form of animated PFP when you join. Real pfps seem to kill the vibe for a lot of people\n6)\tIF YOU DO NOT HAVE CONSENT FROM SOMEONE DO NOT TRY TO FORCE THEM INTO SEXUAL RP\n7)\tRule 6 also applies to guilt trips and begging, no one is entitled to anything from anyone\n8)\tTake any extreme kinks that others may not be comfortable with to private, ifyou are not sure, ask in the OOC or ask an admin\n9)\tThere are no cliffs to sit at dramatically or corners to mope in. such melodramatic attention seeking behavior will lead to removal\n10)\tThere is a three (3) line minimum in the rp. If you cannot roleplay with that much length then you will be warned and ultimately removed\n11)\tRead number 6 again. Just humor me, people seem to forget it first.\n12)\tIf you have an issue with anything please PM an admin\n13)\tIf you are roleplaying with someone and want to transition your scene in private do so by inviting them back to your hut. This keeps the roleplay feeling more natural as a whole to other players\n14)\tWhile this group started as a furry group you do not HAVE to have a furry character. Just have an animated ref and you\u2019re good\n15)\tNo weapons on the island. Its needless and makes no sense for the setting its idiotic I have to add this as a rule yet here we are\n16)\tNo special powers, IF you play a supernatural/otherworldy being and wish to make a case for being allowed some degree of extranatural ability you may message Akia and make a case for it provided it adds to quality roleplay. Otherwise no\n17)\tAfter you have read these rules please message Akia at \u201ctheennuiyousee\u201d (online now) or roxi at \u201channahthegeekynerd\u201d (will be online much later/early morning) to be added and say \u201cYes mister fox (\u201cyes pretty lady\u201d if messaging roxi) I read rule 6 and I promise not to be a creep\u201d",

I'm looking to create some depth for my characters.  c:  I have a bunch, you can choose whichever one(s) you like best.\n\nI'm looking for sfw experiences, though nsfw suggestions are ok (i.e. steamy situations and romantic relationships; I mostly want the RP to focus on sfw content, though).\n\nI am interested in a casual roleplay.  I prefer to roleplay on Discord.  I might not be able to RP very often, maybe a few times a week?  I'm looking for something pretty relaxed and not too intense.   \n\nAlso if anyone has a group or site that would fit my preference, please let me know!  One-on-one RP is just fine, but I would absolutely love a group or server to join.  c:\n\nThanks so much for reading! ",
