While I am mostly looking for female partners, I'm totally just as open to femboys/girly boys to be his trainer.\n\nI'd very much prefer long term but can work with short term! Also heavily prefer third person perspective since that's what I'm the most used to, but again, can work with first or second.\n\nSo some ideas to get the thought rolling!\n\n**Arcanine got a massive.. What?**: Yes, it's rumors that have been traveling around ever since that big pokemon was discovered and often keeps spreading thanks to the ones that manages to get a hold of a male one. But the rumors about Arcanine having a massive piece of swinging meat was no lies.. But how did you find that out? Did your Growlithe you had since you were a kid finally decide to evolve? Did one of your friends have an Arcanine? Did you find one in the wild? The possibilities are all over the place!\n\n**Evolution!:** Ever since you started your adventure to become the best and catch 'em all, the one Pokemon that had been with you since the beginning was your Growlithe. You chose him out of the Pokemons shown to you by the professor and you never looked back. But now it decided to evolve! Only.. It doesn't quite look like the Growlithe you remember. Your Growlithe had been very small, the runt of the litter but happy and cheerful and always up up to play games. And sure, you knew Arcanine were quite a large pokemon.. But this was something else! Your Growlithe had turned into a skyscraper of a Pokemon, added a ton of weight in pure muscles, now looking down at you rather than up.. And what's that between it's legs..?\n\nJust two short simple ideas, but I'm open to all ideas so don't be shy!\n\nFor kinks i have this handy kink list [https://i.imgur.com/s03XKrI.png](https://i.imgur.com/s03XKrI.png) just keep in mind that it's made for human characters in general and not furry ones, so some kinks might look out of place for this particular post!\n\nLimits are the usual. Gore, filth, blood, vomit etc etc.\n\nAnd that's the end of my post.. So hit me up if you want a giant Arcanine to fool around with!",

            "selftext": "So I had a few jumping off points, that we can explore. Basic kinks include feral, incest, mutual body worship, being in heat, kissing, prefer mammals, and am a switch. We can include any you are interested in our RP. Here are my starting ideas that we can alter together.\n\n- Feral X Anthro: I go out to pick up a pet, though this world is a bit different and despite being kept as pets, ferals are totally sapient and capable of consensual relations. The pet can be mundane to fantastical depending on what you want to be. \n\n- Family Reunion: We are cousins who were close when we were younger but grew apart as we got older. Now we are both college aged, and having a family reunion. We decide to have a few drinks and hang out in my room, while the rest of the family goes out to the venue the party is being held. Its a big family, and most won't notice if we are missing for a few hours. Roles are open to gender and species, but i'd like us to be the same or at least similiar species for this. \n\n-Pound Princess: Sort of like the first entry, but it is anthro-on-anthro and this time I'm the one being taken in as a pet. I was thinking we could go full dystopia, and the poor anthros who get in trouble get put in the pound to be adopted as pets for the rich.\n\n- Were-Furries: It usually skipped a generation which is why mom and dad weren't affected, but we were. To be specific you (My older sibling) were at first, and you were sent to live in a remote house our family owned. But, one night around my 19th birthday, I began to turn, it wasn't a permenant transformation but I became an anthro animal person just like you (Same or different species because it is supernatural) so eventually I get sent to live with you. Little do our parents know that I am in fact in heat, something humans wouldn't notice, but you could smell for miles. After exchanging formalities with our parents, you give me a big lingering hug... and smell my pheromones as they leave. ",

He is listed as a Spire Wolf. The paperwork says his name is Silver. (apparently your boss is very creative with names....) it also lists some of the tests you have to preform to get knowledge on this new species, some of them makes you blush while the last one makes you wince.\n\nYou are to start off with basic anatomy study, and take various samples ;), (you can have as much fun with the tests as you want, be creative)\n\nYou walk into your office and see various equipment and harnesses for you to use for your tests, apparently no expense has been spared, finally in the corner of the room you see the little guy contained in a cage looking scared..\n\n(No toilet play (Scat/pee), no gore (except blood samples and the last test), no vomit, no snuff, and no rape. He's a pup be humane ;))\n\n(My fetishes include: penis milking (via machine), orgasm denial and 'size' teasing (he's a pup, he's gonna be small))\n\n(Finally we come to the last test, this is ENTIRELY OPTIONAL, you have to pop (crush/w.e) -one- of the pups balls and see if it affects anything, such as his ability to cum/stay hard/ or his volume of cum)\n\nKik (for copy/paste) DDivine121",
