My character is a 26/F/Orca (I can change species, which is fine if we want to try something different) and as by my title, I am looking for dominant males. By dominant, I mean males who will rip her clothes off and fuck her into a broken drooling mess with her snatch and ass spurting out the males thick hot musky cum. (Bit of a slut). Males that treat her like nothing more than a place to empty their balls into, whether that be her two holes or throat, and I especially enjoy males who are good at dirty talking/degradation. Maybe even getting her heavily pregnant, depending on your kinks. I do have a preference for males whose characters are chubby but that is optional, just nothing too thin or lean. NO underaged, and please be literate and post well, I like good chunk posts to read and respond to, makes it a lot more fun. Message me for my Kik. I also use telegram and discord.",

            "selftext": "Interested in an exotic vacation to a relaxing island with a touch of mystery? Crescent island is for you! With a setting built to cater to both those looking for an element of plot as well as those who just want to play around. \n\nHaving built a resort on an uninhabited island, the resort owner Akia has sent invitations all over the world. Those accept the invitation\u2019s promise of fun in the sun will find themselves almost immediately transported away to an exotic island kept secret for years. \n\nFirst a little information about the island. Crescent Island got its name from the shape, little surprise there. The island is shaped like a crescent moon, along the inside is the beautiful sandy beach, and from the middle the outer curves are lush jungles just waiting to be explored. Private little huts span out along the island, some right on the beach, others closer to the lush jungles, but in the middle of them all is the main resort building. \n\nEach guest arrives on the island with no idea how they or their luggage got there finding their invitation has turned into a key to their own personal hut, inside they will find a bedroom, a small kitchen space, and a bathroom. \n\nThe main entrance to the resort\u2019s central building faces the ocean, when entering guests will find a reception desk to their left. To the right of the entrance is a small series of steps that lead up to an elevated lounge, on one side is the bar, on the other side are a series of armchairs and couches for socializing with a fireplace on the outer wall. On the far side across from the bar is a piano that sits against a slightly curved wall. \n\nImmediately after the reception desk is a large heavy door that lead\u2019s to Akia\u2019s office, the door is always locked and guests who manage to find a way beyond said door will be punished in some way, regardless of whether they are discovered or not. Further down the main hallway guests will find a full gym, a catered dining hall, game rooms, and a small movie theater just below ground. In the far back of the resort is an indoor pool for the rare stormy rainy days when guests cannot safely swim in the ocean. The resort is staffed by a full retinue of bland forgettable waiters, cooks, bartenders etc who should be treaded like the rest of the setting. Something to be interacted with as an offhanded comment.\n\nDeeper in the jungle are several lagoons for guests to discover hidden away and not marked on any map. Should they be found the guests will find each has it\u2019s own unique traits. \n\n-Blue Lagoon: The perfect water of the blue lagoon is always a few degrees below body temperature making it a pleasant swim for guests, however certain properties of the water will cause guests to feel themselves growing aroused and willing to perform acts they normally would not. It is not advised to swim in these waters unless you are willing to indulge in such desires with whoever may join in (it is important to note that this description is for theme only to lend to creative roleplay and is not intended as a device to trick or force people into ERP) \n\n-Red Lagoon: the warm waters of the red lagoon are similar to that of a natural hot spring due to the lagoon\u2019s proximity to the island\u2019s volcano. The water of the red lagoon is incredibly rich in minerals that are not only good for the skin but have a rejuvenating effect on those who soak in them. Guests who wish to relax and those who are sore from too much physical activity find soaking in the waters can even heal some wounds. Be warned small monkeys play around the red lagoon and may try to steal food and alcohol. \n\n-Yellow Lagoon: The yellow lagoon is an odd one, with cold water that seems unnatural for the tropical island. The yellow lagoon is popular for guests who like to refresh themselves in a cooler bath. All around the yellow lagoon are strange trees that hang over the water, their branches grow a bizarre yellow fruit the size of an avocado. The skin of the fruit is a bright yellow and the whole thing is edible with a flavor that turns from sour to sweet. Consuming the fruit can cause a state of euphoria and/or relaxation similar to alcohol as well as inducing sleep in larger amounts.\n\n-Green Lagoon: The green lagoon is one of the most serene peaceful places on the island. The water matches your body temperature, the vines and flowers around it somehow block out all external sound and the sunlight that manages to reach through the canopy is a low ambient green color that aids in relaxation. Perfect for relaxation, meditation, and other activities that require mental focus.\n\n-Black Lagoon: the survival instinct in all living beings prevents guests from finding the black lagoon. Its purpose is a secret and will be revealed in time to those who explore the island and learn its secrets \n\n-Pink Lagoon: the pink lagoon does not always exist, and when it does it doesn\u2019t always exist in the same place twice. Entering the pink lagoon will cause someone to become afflicted with a random outcome revealed by an admin. There are 100 different outcomes and almost all of them are undesirable, but funny to those unaffected. All effects are temporary ending in 24 hours unless otherwise stated. \n\nRules \n\n1) Keep OOC in the OOC chat and RP in the RP \n\n2) This is primarily a sexual roleplay, if you do not like seeing sexual actions played in public this chat is not for you \n\n3) As this is a sexual roleplay we ask everyone who joins be 18+ \n\n4) Playing a character who is clearly a child is not allowed \n\n5) Have some form of animated PFP when you join. Real pfps seem to kill the vibe for a lot of people \n\n6) IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CONSENT FROM SOMEONE DO NOT TRY TO FORCE THEM INTO SEXUAL RP \n\n7) Rule 6 also applies to guilt trips and begging, no one is entitled to anything from anyone \n\n8) Take any extreme kinks that others may not be comfortable with to private, ifyou are not sure, ask in the OOC or ask an admin \n\n9) There are no cliffs to sit at dramatically or corners to mope in. such melodramatic attention seeking behavior will lead to removal \n\n10) There is a three (3) line minimum in the rp. If you cannot roleplay with that much length then you will be warned and ultimately removed \n\n11) Read number 6 again. Just humor me, people seem to forget it first. \n\n12) If you have an issue with anything please PM an admin \n\n13) If you are roleplaying with someone and want to transition your scene in private do so by inviting them back to your hut. This keeps the roleplay feeling more natural as a whole to other players \n\n14) While this group started as a furry group you do not HAVE to have a furry character. Just have an animated ref and you\u2019re good \n\n15) No weapons on the island. Its needless and makes no sense for the setting its idiotic I have to add this as a rule yet here we are \n\n16) No special powers, IF you play a supernatural/otherworldy being and wish to make a case for being allowed some degree of extranatural ability you may message Akia and make a case for it provided it adds to quality roleplay. Otherwise no \n\n17) please adhere to basic courtesy and ask permission to PM people. Do not use this group as a PM hub\n\n18) Inactivity is based on the Roleplay and those who do not roleplay will be removed during inactivity sweeps\n\n19) once you read the rules message an admin on kik saying \u201cyes I read rule 6 and promise not to be a creep. Currently active admins are Theennuiyousee and DullahanDreaming",

            "selftext": "You see me, a 21 year old straight white girl, out with my boyfriend. Maybe I'm shopping or just walking around, it doesn't matter. Maybe you're my friend, my coworker, a complete stranger, it doesn't matter. You're going to have me, you're going to make me yours regardless of whether or not I enjoy it. \n\nYou're going to pull me off into a side room, follow me home, convince me to stop by your place, anything to get me alone. As my boyfriend wonders where I disappeared to, you're going to crush your lips onto mine. As he texts my phone, you're going to shove my face in your ass. As he calls, you're going to wipe your feet across my face. When he calls again, you'll make me answer, watching me struggle to stay quiet as your lips move down my body. Will I be a willing or reluctant participant? Will I be forced completely? Message me and find out.\n\n____\n\nHeya, I'm Kayla! I run a discord centered around RP and chatting of all types, clean, lewd, weird, the works. We support voice chat and pic sharing as well. Currently we're at a little over 250 members with an abhorrent amount of channels to support everyone, but I'm always looking for new members (as long as you're somewhat competent).\n\nWhile it isn't an kink specific server, almost every kink is an accepted and widely used kink and there's even custom kink channels if that's something you're into.\n\nI myself mostly play with other girls, but everyone is invited to join. At the moment there are no kinks that are off limits, just try to keep the weirder ones out of any out of character chats.\n\nIf you decide to check it out, do stick around for a bit before leaving. Like, don't look at the welcome channel and leave 2 seconds later because no one immediately wanted to play with you. Be patient, we're all human.\n\nAnywho, message me for the link!",
