            "selftext": "Here we go again!\n\n'ello everyone! \n\nThis is going to get a bit long because I want to make sure you know what I'm looking for and what I don't want. :) Sorry if I come off as a bit restrictive, but I've had lots of people contact me in the past who didn't quite get that \"I don't do that kink\" means I absolutely won't do it. Please be sure to read through the whole thing. If I hate something you love or love something you hate, we're probably not right for each other.\n\nI'm currently experiencing a bit of an RP drought, and I'm going to need some help stuffing that hole. Pun intended. First things first: I'm located in Europe. Partners from other continents are absolutely fine, but it would be great if we could **schedule** our rps somewhat to make sure we're both here. Also, I'm looking for a **reliable** partner. If something comes up and you can't make it to an agreed RP time, do let me know. If you hate something in the RP that we can fix, do let me know. If we're not good together and you want to stop playing, do let me know. We're reasonable adults, and whatever's going on, we can talk about it.\n\nI love story. I love smut. I need both. I'm not doing quick fucks, and I'm not doing weeks of RP without a single shag. A 50/50 ratio is usually agreeable. Please make sure that we share this view before replying.\n\nI'm okay with **any kind of gender pairing,** but I do prefer mixing it up. Maybe we can populate our original world (no fandoms, please, bit of creativity here!) with several characters each and play straight couples, gay men, lesbians, futas and all that stuff. If you have a strong preference for one or two genders, I'm sure we can still figure something out.\n\nAlright, **kink requirements!** Apart from grammar, punctuation and a decent one-, two- or three-paragraph post length, there's the following, structured in neat little categories for easy reference:\n\n**Favourites - I need those!**\n\n* **Cumshots.** Clean fur is nice, cum-covered fur is nicer! Depending on the setting, I'm okay with both realistic and unrealistic amounts of cum.\n\n* **Romance.** Maybe the relationship starts with a one-night stand, but there **is** a relationship. I want our characters to fall in love.\n\n* **Kissing.** I like kissing a lot, both in the NSFW part of our RP and in the story part. It's what makes romance romance in my opinion, and I do like a well-described kiss every now and then.\n\n* **Dirty Talk and Moans.** Please don't be too quiet when we shag. Sounds can be as enticing as physical sensations, smells and tastes.\n\n* **Favourite species:** Wolves, lynxes, red pandas.\n\n**Yes - I like those and generally want to include them, but if you don't like any of them, that's fine.**\n\n* **Slapping, biting, scratching.** I like it rough and passionate. If your characters don't, that's alright.\n\n* **Public sex, clothed sex, quickies.**\n\n* **Slightly chubby, slightly muscular, slightly tall and slightly short characters:** I don't like most extremes, but I do like variety in body types. That includes cock and breast sizes, of course!\n\n* **Multiple characters.** Maybe a friend joins in, maybe there's a love triangle... I'm okay with one player playing multiple characters at the same time.\n\n\n* **Species I like too:** Some breeds of cats and dogs (the domesticated kind), lizards without wings, horses without wings, female pandas, opossums, weasels, mouses... Anything that's not on the No List (further below) usually works out.\n\n**Maybe - Those depend on context, and I don't really want them in every play. If you don't like any of them, that's completely fine, because I'm totally okay leaving them out!**\n\n* **Watersports.** Can be hot sometimes, but it's not my main kink in any way.\n\n* **Sibling incest, particularly twins.** Surprise my character by showing up as two people when he expected one! Or let me be your brother or sister.\n\n* **Saliva play.** In a heated fuck, things can get messy. Messy kisses, messy blowjobs, bit of extra lube for a handjob or wet rimming. I'm down for that.\n\n**No - I'm not doing those!**\n\n* **Scat and Vomit are definitely on the no list!**\n\n* **Dom/Sub, Bondage, Torture, Violence.** I'm fine with violence in the plot section, of course, but our eRP will be full of love and equality, even when it's rough. No BDSM stuff. I'm adamant there. Don't contact me with \"Maybe a bit of tying you to the bed post, that's not really BDSM\" messages. Blindfolds are sometimes okay, but I'm not into master and pet stuff.\n\n* **Vore, Growth, Transformation, Tentacles.**\n\n* **Species I definitely don't want to play:** Frogs and toads, bovines, centaurs, flying dragons or anything that's a lot taller or shorter than a 'normal' anthro; no bestiality/ferals. No bats. No fish or other water creatures.**\n\n\nOkay! You made it through the kink list. Have a cookie! There's one more list coming up, namely scenario ideas. **Those are not all the ideas I have, and we can of course integrate your ideas!** Just to give you an idea of what's possible.\n\nI do **not** do fantasy or medieval. I RPed in WoW for seven years, and I'm sick of the whole \"no electricity, lots of lore, lots of races\" stuff.\n\n* **Urban Fantasy:** Probably my favourite setting. This doesn't necessarily mean vampires and werewolves, even though the literature world apparently thinks that. It could be magic users and normal people in a modern world, either getting along nicely or hating each other's guts.\n\n* **Slice of Life:** Just a normal modern world with furries instead of people. More of a focus on everyday activities instead of an over-arching plot with a villain and lots of action.\n\n* **Near future:** Ten or twenty years from now, with either an urban fantasy or slice of life touch to it. Technological gadgets, maybe a bit of spaces stuff, generally just somewhere between modern day and sci-fi.\n\n* **Sci-fi** is possible if it's done well. We'd have to take a look at each other's definition of sci-fi there.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAnd that's it! Congratulations, you've made it. Before you go (and hopefully drop me a private message telling me you want to play with me!), one more thing: Sometimes I've got a lot of time, sometimes not so much. This is a long-term thing, but not a \"for hours every day\" thing. Sometimes that can happen, but don't count on never doing anything else again. I enjoy playing a lot when I have the time, but depending on my schedule and your time zone, it doesn't always work.\n\nHave a great day!",

Your character can be strong and/or clever, forcing my otherwise average character into submission one way or another. If you want a one-shot, then everything goes quick and it ends there. If not, we can make the pace slower and end up going through the path of romance as my character accepts her new self and comes to love your guy.\n\n**I do not want:** To be turned into a futa/herm/femboy, you want someone else for that. IC Femdoms are also undesired, sorry but I tried it before and it never works. Scat, gore, etc., also if in doubt ask. I hardly have any refs myself, so if you really want that you are welcome to bring some for me to pick from - otherwise I am fine with just text.\n\nIf you think our preferences match send me a PM and we'll talk, there a lot of different ways to play this out!",

I love righteous fucking power metal, classic fantasy literature, tabletop gaming, my family, shredding on my guitar, classic modern horror movies, and you. You might have seen me around with my band (we're not really famous yet, but we'll get there some day), at the Friendly Local Game Store, or less glamorously lifting heavy stuff as the only guy working at the local Hobby Lobby.\n\nI'm about 5'10\" (tall for a human but there's a good chance I'm shorter than you; one of my exes used to call me \"smol boi luv\"), kinda slim and toned, with green eyes and shoulder-length blond hair matching the long soul-patch on my chin.\n\nHumans and non-humans (particularly furries and monsters) live side by side, and as a result racism has fallen to the wayside in favor of discrimination based on species. Non-humans live as second-class citizens in many countries, if not legally then at least socially. Dating between humans and furries is often a taboo subject, the way interracial relationships have been for much of American history. \n\nYou and I however tend to forget about all of that when we're together. At least, we do when we're not in the bedroom, incorporating it into our dirty talk. Aside from how adorable and pettable you are, my other favorite thing about dating you is when you go into heat, making your sex drive go wild and turning you into my personal sex toy for a few days every month.\n\nHow did we meet? What do we see in each other? What's our relationship like? Will we start from the beginning with how we met, with our first date, or start after the first few weeks the morning after one of our dates?\n__________________\n**Kinks:** Furries, dub-con, free-use, dirty talk, slutty outfits, exhibition/voyeurism, light bondage, romance (the kinkster kind, not vanilla), pet play, cumplay, marathon sex, D/s Power play, toys, interracial themes, begging, cheating, rough sex, sleep play, cum play, pregnancy risk, Partners who have some idea of who their character is, rule 34, interaction, character development, cheesy sitcom plots.\n\n**Limits:** Blood, injury, bathroom stuff.",

Me and a good friend are looking for somebody else, who has multiple OC's/fursonas, to use to come roleplay with us on Discord in a small RP group that we're looking to re-make. Both me and my friend have a whole cast of fursonas/OC's each, and having more than one fursona would make things a lot less complicated. We will not be using all of our OC's/fursonas at the same time, though.  \n  \nWe're located in the EST and CST timezones and looking for somebody preferably within our time zones as we RP rather frequently, usually later in the day and at night. We're open to all pairings, whether it's M/M, M/F, F/F etc. We also have no problems with intersex characters, either. Not all of our roleplays are constantly smutty, and we often keep it vanilla with the kinks.  \n  \nWe do have limitations when it comes to kinks and those that are off-limits to us are: scat, watersports, diapers, babyfur, std's, micro/macro, musk, vomit, bloodplay, nullification/castration. We both respect the boundaries of people's kinks and wish our boundaries were respected as well.  \n  \nWe also use a slightly different roleplay style to make it easier to tell what character is doing what action in a group. I'll have an example of our RP style below using two of our fursonas/OC's, so you can see what we do.  \n  \n(Ezier) *sits down at the bar, and waves the bartender over* Hey, can I get a shot of vodka?\n(Iffin) Sure thing. *sets down the mug I was just cleaning, then pours a shot of vodka for the newly arrived dragon*  \n  \nIf you are interested in doing a RP with me and my friend, please contact me and I'll give you a link to the Discord server. If you do want more info, please feel free to contact me!",

            "selftext": "**Hey my fellow RPers!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n\n***I got permission to use this format from a previous RPer who quit***",
