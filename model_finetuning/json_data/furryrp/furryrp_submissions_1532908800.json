I have been RPing for ( wow its already been that long?) 6 years and the few people I used to RP with have, well, grown up and moved on. I'm still good friends with most of them but I'm looking for someone that still has the time and creative energy to RP. When It comes to the RP its self im really not too picky. Like I said, I have been doing this for a very long time and have done all different types of RP. On that note, I am looking for something serious, Something that will have content and not just meaningless sex... I want a story in my RP. At the end of the day this is more of a chance to meet someone new and maybe take my mind off my depression and talk. My Kik is dcbeast22 and my Telegram is Andrew the Furry. Feel free to PM me on either one, I am active about 90% of the time so no need to fear that. Look forward to talking to you soon. :3",

            "selftext": "Been through a drought recently and I'm hoping that some people might be a bit more comfortable playing this character for me rather than the previous I had because this one doesn't have a restrictive backstory. Once again, the RP will be a slow-build slice-of-life and romance RP with a character I had planned out but I need someone willing to execute him. It will be a causal roleplay which means you can post as much or as little as you want. I really only do roleplaying over Skype because my computer has problems with other applications. In the Eastern Time Zone but USUALLY I'm on from about 9AM to 12AM (midnight) though that may be subject to change and I will let you know. The only thing you need to do is be willing to add more of a personality to him and then he is officially yours. Here is a rough outline. I only ask of people interested that they do twi things for me which might be too much but we'll see. One is that you bear with me when we are doing the RP. I suck at pacing and while it might get boring because all they are doing is talking and not doing much other than that I will get to having them go out on dates and stuff and not just being a boring talking RP. The other thing that I ask is that you just don't disappear on me with no explanation or ignore me and get all passive aggressive because you don't like the RP. If you have an issue, please talk to me or let me know. I will understand. I hate people who think its fun to disappear and not give me any heads up of what's happening. I need to know when you can be free again or if you can RP anytime soon. I will understand your problems. I'm not as big of a loser as people THINK I am (but I will concede that I am one).\n\nName: Scott Sumpter\n\nAge: 23\n\nAppearance: Black furred wolf that is a wall of muscle basically. Though not big to the point of it being disturbing. He has black hair on his head, brown eyes, a white shirt that shows off his frame, green jeans with a belt and combat boots. He also has a tattoo of a marine corps eagle on his right arm.\n\nPersonality: Was a class clown but other blanks can be filled in by YOU\n\nCar: He drives red 1998 Chevrolet S-10 with a leather interior\n\nMy Skype which unfortunately is the only messenger I am abe to run efficiently on my slow-ass year old computer is amazee\\_dayzee.\n\nOr post here or send me a PM saying you wanna try it and I will add you to my Skype.\n\nI look forward to meet with all interested parties!",
