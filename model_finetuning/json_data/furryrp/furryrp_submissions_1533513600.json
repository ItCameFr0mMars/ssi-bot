            "selftext": "**Hey my fellow RPers!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",
