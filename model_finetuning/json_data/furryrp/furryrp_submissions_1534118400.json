            "selftext": "Hi everyone, token human guy Ravi here, full name Ravindra Wolfgang Amadeus Romulus Lebowski. I love righteous fucking power metal, classic fantasy literature, tabletop gaming, my family, shredding on my guitar, classic modern horror movies, and you. You might have seen me around with my band (we're not really famous yet, but we'll get there some day), at the Friendly Local Game Store, or less glamorously lifting heavy stuff as the only guy working at the local Hobby Lobby.\n\nI'm about 5'10\" (tall for a human but there's a good chance I'm shorter than you; one of my exes used to call me \"smol boi luv\"), kinda slim and toned, with green eyes and shoulder-length blond hair matching the long soul-patch on my chin.\n\nHumans and non-humans (particularly furries and monsters) live side by side, and as a result racism has fallen to the wayside in favor of discrimination based on species. Non-humans live as second-class citizens in many countries, if not legally then at least socially. Dating between humans and furries is often a taboo subject, the way interracial relationships have been for much of American history. \n\nYou and I however tend to forget about all of that when we're together. At least, we do when we're not in the bedroom, incorporating it into our dirty talk. Aside from how adorable and pettable you are, my other favorite thing about dating you is when you go into heat, making your sex drive go wild and turning you into my personal sex toy for a few days every month.\n\nHow did we meet? What do we see in each other? What's our relationship like? Will we start from the beginning with how we met, with our first date, or start after the first few weeks the morning after one of our dates?\n__________________\n**Kinks:** Furries, dub-con, free-use, dirty talk, slutty outfits, exhibition/voyeurism, light bondage, romance (the kinkster kind, not vanilla), pet play, cumplay, marathon sex, D/s Power play, toys, interracial themes, begging, cheating, rough sex, sleep play, cum play, pregnancy risk, Partners who have some idea of who their character is, rule 34, interaction, character development, cheesy sitcom plots.\n\n**Limits:** Blood, injury, bathroom stuff.",

            "selftext": "Here we go again!\n\n'ello everyone! \n\nThis is going to get a bit long because I want to make sure you know what I'm looking for and what I don't want. :) Sorry if I come off as a bit restrictive, but I've had lots of people contact me in the past who didn't quite get that \"I don't do that kink\" means I absolutely won't do it. Please be sure to read through the whole thing. If I hate something you love or love something you hate, we're probably not right for each other.\n\nI'm currently experiencing a bit of an RP drought, and I'm going to need some help stuffing that hole. Pun intended. First things first: I'm located in Europe. Partners from other continents are absolutely fine, but it would be great if we could **schedule** our rps somewhat to make sure we're both here. Also, I'm looking for a **reliable** partner. If something comes up and you can't make it to an agreed RP time, do let me know. If you hate something in the RP that we can fix, do let me know. If we're not good together and you want to stop playing, do let me know. We're reasonable adults, and whatever's going on, we can talk about it.\n\nI love story. I love smut. I need both. I'm not doing quick fucks, and I'm not doing weeks of RP without a single shag. A 50/50 ratio is usually agreeable. Please make sure that we share this view before replying.\n\nI'm okay with **any kind of gender pairing,** but I do prefer mixing it up. Maybe we can populate our original world (no fandoms, please, bit of creativity here!) with several characters each and play straight couples, gay men, lesbians, futas and all that stuff. If you have a strong preference for one or two genders, I'm sure we can still figure something out.\n\nAlright, **kink requirements!** Apart from grammar, punctuation and a decent one-, two- or three-paragraph post length, there's the following, structured in neat little categories for easy reference:\n\n**Favourites - I need those!**\n\n* **Cumshots.** Clean fur is nice, cum-covered fur is nicer! Depending on the setting, I'm okay with both realistic and unrealistic amounts of cum.\n\n* **Romance.** Maybe the relationship starts with a one-night stand, but there **is** a relationship. I want our characters to fall in love.\n\n* **Kissing.** I like kissing a lot, both in the NSFW part of our RP and in the story part. It's what makes romance romance in my opinion, and I do like a well-described kiss every now and then.\n\n* **Dirty Talk and Moans.** Please don't be too quiet when we shag. Sounds can be as enticing as physical sensations, smells and tastes.\n\n* **Favourite species:** Wolves, lynxes, red pandas.\n\n**Yes - I like those and generally want to include them, but if you don't like any of them, that's fine.**\n\n* **Slapping, biting, scratching.** I like it rough and passionate. If your characters don't, that's alright.\n\n* **Public sex, clothed sex, quickies.**\n\n* **Slightly chubby, slightly muscular, slightly tall and slightly short characters:** I don't like most extremes, but I do like variety in body types. That includes cock and breast sizes, of course!\n\n* **Multiple characters.** Maybe a friend joins in, maybe there's a love triangle... I'm okay with one player playing multiple characters at the same time.\n\n\n* **Species I like too:** Some breeds of cats and dogs (the domesticated kind), lizards without wings, horses without wings, female pandas, opossums, weasels, mouses... Anything that's not on the No List (further below) usually works out.\n\n**Maybe - Those depend on context, and I don't really want them in every play. If you don't like any of them, that's completely fine, because I'm totally okay leaving them out!**\n\n* **Watersports.** Can be hot sometimes, but it's not my main kink in any way.\n\n* **Sibling incest, particularly twins.** Surprise my character by showing up as two people when he expected one! Or let me be your brother or sister.\n\n* **Saliva play.** In a heated fuck, things can get messy. Messy kisses, messy blowjobs, bit of extra lube for a handjob or wet rimming. I'm down for that.\n\n**No - I'm not doing those!**\n\n* **Scat and Vomit are definitely on the no list!**\n\n* **Dom/Sub, Bondage, Torture, Violence.** I'm fine with violence in the plot section, of course, but our eRP will be full of love and equality, even when it's rough. No BDSM stuff. I'm adamant there. Don't contact me with \"Maybe a bit of tying you to the bed post, that's not really BDSM\" messages. Blindfolds are sometimes okay, but I'm not into master and pet stuff.\n\n* **Vore, Growth, Transformation, Tentacles.**\n\n* **Species I definitely don't want to play:** Frogs and toads, bovines, centaurs, flying dragons or anything that's a lot taller or shorter than a 'normal' anthro; no bestiality/ferals. No bats. No fish or other water creatures.**\n\n\nOkay! You made it through the kink list. Have a cookie! There's one more list coming up, namely scenario ideas. **Those are not all the ideas I have, and we can of course integrate your ideas!** Just to give you an idea of what's possible.\n\nI do **not** do fantasy or medieval. I RPed in WoW for seven years, and I'm sick of the whole \"no electricity, lots of lore, lots of races\" stuff.\n\n* **Urban Fantasy:** Probably my favourite setting. This doesn't necessarily mean vampires and werewolves, even though the literature world apparently thinks that. It could be magic users and normal people in a modern world, either getting along nicely or hating each other's guts.\n\n* **Slice of Life:** Just a normal modern world with furries instead of people. More of a focus on everyday activities instead of an over-arching plot with a villain and lots of action.\n\n* **Near future:** Ten or twenty years from now, with either an urban fantasy or slice of life touch to it. Technological gadgets, maybe a bit of spaces stuff, generally just somewhere between modern day and sci-fi.\n\n* **Sci-fi** is possible if it's done well. We'd have to take a look at each other's definition of sci-fi there.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAnd that's it! Congratulations, you've made it. Before you go (and hopefully drop me a private message telling me you want to play with me!), one more thing: Sometimes I've got a lot of time, sometimes not so much. This is a long-term thing, but not a \"for hours every day\" thing. Sometimes that can happen, but don't count on never doing anything else again. I enjoy playing a lot when I have the time, but depending on my schedule and your time zone, it doesn't always work.\n\nHave a great day!",

How do you get there? Well it all starts with that little silver invitation you received, the shiny envelope with nothing but your name on it.  Inside there was a letter if you recall, asking if you would like to enjoy a tropical paradise away from your day to day worries.  As soon as you thought the words that you would like to go, you found yourself whisked away as if by magic, appearing in the middle of a hallway at the resort with a key in the hand where your invitation was and your luggage nicely packed next to you. Sure you may have questions but for now you may as well enjoy a free vacation!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n First a little information about the island. Crescent Island got its name from the shape, little surprise there. The island is shaped like a crescent moon, along the inside is the beautiful sandy beach, and from the middle the outer curves are lush jungles just waiting to be explored. Private little huts span out along the island, some right on the beach, others closer to the vibrant forest, but in the middle of them all is the main resort building. \nEach guest is given a key to their own private hut, inside they will find a bedroom, a small kitchen space, and a bathroom. The main entrance to the resort\u2019s central building faces the ocean, when entering guests will find a reception desk to their left. To the right of the entrance is a small series of steps that lead up to an elevated lounge, on one side is the bar, on the other side are a series of armchairs and couches for socializing with a fireplace on the outer wall. On the far side across from the bar is a piano that sits against a slightly curved wall. \nImmediately after the reception desk is a large heavy door that lead\u2019s to Akia\u2019s office, the door is always locked and guests who manage to find a way beyond said door will be punished in some way shape or form, regardless of weather or not they are discovered. Further down the main hallway guests will find a full gym, a catered dining hall, game rooms, and a small movie theater just below ground. In the far back of the resort is an indoor pool for the rare stormy rainy days when guests cannot safely swim in the ocean. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeep in the jungle at the ends of various hidden trails are several lagoons for guests to discover hidden away and not marked on any map. Should they be found the guests will find each has it\u2019s own unique traits. \nBlue Lagoon: The perfect water of the blue lagoon is always a few degrees below body temperature making it a pleasant swim for guests, however certain properties of the water will cause guests to feel themselves growing more aroused than normal. It is not advised to swim in these waters unless you are willing to indulge in such desires with whoever may join in (it is important to note that this description is for theme only to lend to creative roleplay and is not intended as a device to trick or force people into ERP)\n \nRed Lagoon: the warm waters of the red lagoon are similar to that of a natural hot spring due to the lagoon\u2019s proximity to the island\u2019s volcano. The water of the red lagoon is incredibly rich in minerals that are not only good for the skin but have a rejuvenating effect on those who soak in them. Guests who wish to relax and those who are sore from too much physical activity find soaking in the waters can even heal some wounds. Be warned small monkeys play around the red lagoon and may try to steal food and alcohol. \n\nYellow Lagoon: The yellow lagoon is an odd one, with cold water that seems unnatural for the tropical island. The yellow lagoon is popular for guests who like to refresh themselves in a cooler bath. All around the yellow lagoon are strange trees that hang over the water, their branches grow a bizarre yellow fruit the size of an avocado. The skin of the fruit is a bright yellow and the whole thing is edible with a flavor that turns from sour to sweet. Consuming the fruit can cause a state of euphoria and/or relaxation similar to alcohol as well as inducing sleep in larger amounts. \n\nBlack Lagoon: the survival instinct in all living beings prevents guests from finding the black lagoon. Its purpose is a secret and will be revealed in time to those who explore the island and learn its secrets\n \nPink Lagoon: the pink lagoon does not always exist, and when it does it doesn\u2019t always exist in the same place twice. Entering the pink lagoon will cause someone to become afflicted with a random outcome revealed by an admin. There are 100 different outcomes and almost all of them are undesirable, but funny to those unaffected. All effects are temporary ending in 24 hours. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRules \n1) Keep OOC in the OOC chat and RP in the RP \n2) This is primarily a sexual roleplay, if you do not like seeing sexual actions played in public this chat is not for you \n3) As this is a sexual roleplay we ask everyone who joins be 18+ \n4) Playing a character who is clearly a child is not allowed \n5) Have some form of animated PFP when you join. Real pfps seem to kill the vibe for a lot of people 6) IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CONSENT FROM SOMEONE DO NOT TRY TO FORCE THEM INTO SEXUAL RP \n7) Rule 6 also applies to guilt trips and begging, no one is entitled to anything from anyone \n8) Take any extreme kinks that others may not be comfortable with to private, if you are not sure, ask in the OOC or ask an admin \n9) There are no cliffs to sit at dramatically or corners to mope in. such melodramatic attention seeking behavior will lead to removal \n10) There is a three (3) line minimum in the rp. If you cannot roleplay with that much length then you will be warned and ultimately removed \n11) Read number 6 again. Just humor me, people seem to forget it first. \n12) If you have an issue with anything please PM an admin \n13) If you are roleplaying with someone and want to transition your scene in private do so by inviting them back to your hut. This keeps the roleplay feeling more natural as a whole to other players 14) While this group started as a furry group you do not HAVE to have a furry character. Just have an animated ref and you\u2019re good \n15) No weapons on the island. Its needless and makes no sense for the setting its idiotic I have to add this as a rule yet here we are \n16) For the sake of keeping the Roleplay moving all staff are faceless NPC characters. So when doing things like ordering drinks at a bar or ordering food you don\u2019t need to wait for someone to reply to you.\n17) No special powers, IF you play a supernatural/otherworldy being and wish to make a case for being allowed some degree of extranatural ability you may message Akia and make a case for it provided it adds to quality roleplay. Otherwise no \n18) After you have read these rules please message Akia at theennuiyousee and say \u201cyes mister fox I read rule 6 and I promise not to be a creep\u201d\n",
