Episteme the Assassin, glad to finally be off from a contract, wandered in, taking in all the sights and sounds and smells. This was a place where he could truly relax, because it was Penis Day, and the orgies would last longer. Initially, the day had been commemorated in honor of the furs' unique biology, but soon it became apparent that furs were using it as an excuse to meet each other, hook up, and generally give the population a boost in children and marriages, sometimes between more than one partner. So the Feds decided to place it around the time all the herms and females would be in heat, so as to encourage this behavior. Episteme had been single for so long. Maybe now was the time to make his mark on society as more than just a hired gun? He looked at the sign just outside the entrance: 'No Clothing Permitted'. He took a deep breath and stripped. There were plenty of nudist furs, since clothes chafed or itched or were otherwise impractical, but he still liked looking badass. Now he was sexy, and ready to find a partner.\n\nThe first thing he noticed were the large tanks of cum. These tanks were connected to dispensers throughout the park. Cum from all species were collected there and given to whoever wanted some. No limits, no regulations. However, the park did ask that you don't use this stuff to get pregnant. The deeper into the park you went, the more and more blatant sex was happening. Out near the entrance there was maybe one or two people fucking, but sounds of pleasure echoed from the inner reaches. The distinct smell of cum finally reaches your nose, and as you inhale you can feel your body buzz. Weather you liked it or not, you were in heat. Episteme looked down at his penis. It had always been there for him, keeping him occupied whenever he was bored or lonely, and that had been a lot lately. He needed to give it some tender loving care, and not just masturbation. He looked at the couple fucking each other. They were cute and sexy, but not what he'd prefer for a long-term relationship. One of the workers seemed to know what he was thinking because he wandered over and handed him a schedule of activities with a wink. He paged through it, looking through all the contests, dick growing harder by the second at the thought of participating in some of them. Maybe someone else's cum was just what he needed. He got a free empty promotional water bottle, filled it with cum, and drank like it was manna from heaven. Many flavors mingled with each other: banana, strawberry, peppermint, lavender, butterscotch, and cinnamon. Their biology sure was something to be appreciated. He looked behind the dispensers to where the furs that were pumping it all out were, and he gave them a nod in thanks. They waved and continued pumping themselves. Some of them had additional suction tubes attached to their nipples, meaning that breast milk was in these as well. Episteme took another sip, and immediately felt more confident. The paper was advertising its first event as a park-wide meet-and-greet/dating event, where couples and harems could form and enjoy the festivities together, ending the event in a masturbation water gun fight, and the one who was the most covered in semen won a prize: the accompaniment of one of the workers along your day and night. The worker was guaranteed to be a part of the selection that was also single, and very into mingling. With a grin, he set off, taking sips from his cup, feeling like the world was on his side.\n\n~\n\nDiscord: Episteme#7925",

They can take a hit that'd knock lesser folk out cold and walk away barely scratched, catch fastballs to the gut casually, or box with bears for fun- but those whips and paddles make them into a puddle. Even when they stand a head above any man, they're more comfortable on their knees. \n\n-----------------------\n\nHey all! I'm looking for people willing to play big tough and yet submissive characters. I'm open to guys and gals and anything in between, and how extreme the \"Big and tough\" is can range from \"pro athlete\" up to really supernatural levels with Amazons and towering monsters and what have you. Speaking of, I'm open to either of us being whatever kind of furs, ferals, scalies, etc you want. As the intro implied I was hoping for lots of BDSM, but can dial that back a lot if it's really not your thing. I'm also open to the \"big and tough\" leaning mor towards \"big\" ie chubby characters, as long as it doesn't go hyper/inflation levels. \n\nI'd be playing a futa or guy with a more small/weak/cute appearance who's a total dom regardless, more specific details and appearance can be worked out based on your tastes.\n\nSome kinks i'd love to include (almost all optional): BDSM (obviously), sweat/musk, humiliation, cum play, dubcon/noncon (to clarify I'm totally fine with consensual too), impregnation, crossdressing, muscle worship, worship in general\n\nSome kinks I do NOT want: hyper, scat, guro, snuff, cuckoldry, roles being reversed back to normal\n\nI usually play here or on discord, please pm me to discuss details if interested. I'm moderately serious about this, any super low effort responses amounting to \"hey let's do fuck\" will probably be ignored.",
