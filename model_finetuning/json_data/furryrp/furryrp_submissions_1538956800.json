            "selftext": "*You wake up to sirens blazing, your ship shaking, and your crew mates in a panic. One of your fellow officers grabs you by your shirt and jerks you right out of your bunk shouting, \"We have to go now!\" He pushes you in the direction of the main hallway towards the escape pods.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"****\\*\\*WARNING WARNING\\*\\**** *CRITICAL DAMAGE TO SHIP HULL. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL! EVACUATE TO YOUR CLOSEST ESCAPE POD IMMEDIATELY!\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Along the way, a higher officer escorts you to an escape pod. The pod is mostly filled with equipment and gear allowing only 1 person to be seated safely. \"Recruit, I need you to guard this equipment with your life. When you make contact on the surface, I need you to activate your distress beacon so that we can find you. And here.\" He hands you a pistol. \"If there's any trouble, you know what to do.\"*  \n\n\n*As soon as you secure yourself in your seat and safety harness the officer shuts the pod door. Lights inside the craft begin to power up. A hologram from above displays diagnostics and camera visual of the front of the pod. You feel the ship drop. In the display shows the vastness of space and a marble red planet. A barrage of green lasers are fired from the surface of the planet. Another hologram appears showing the back view of the pod. You can see the extensive destruction made on your titanous frigate as the pod distances itself from the chaos. Other pods are jettisoned from the frigate, but many of them are being destroyed as soon as they drop.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*You feel the thrusting of the engines as the pod evades the planetary fire and dashes towards the planet. The planet's projection gets bigger and clouds materialize through the screen. The turbulence shakes the entire craft, some of the strapped down gear comes loose and starts bouncing around ship. You see a fire extinguisher flying towards your head, and then, darkness.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreetings, my name is Lux. I've dabbled a little bit into ERP and would like to practice a bit further by orchestrating a scenario. What I have in mind is a 1v1 story with light tabletop elements that would dictate whether actions succeed or fail. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking for someone who's either dominant or versatile, open minded, and adaptive. No need to write paragraph on paragraph of detail, but don't just type in one line or sentence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not very fetishy, but I can try to throw some elements in there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the idea intrigues you, feel free to hit me up on either Telegram: @iridianLux or Discord: RogueOfI3lush#4338",

Now, this won't just include sharp claws but many other races as well. \n\nI have no limits at all and this can be played totally noncon in a slave styled route or as dubcon where you adapt to the sexual lifestyles of the many tribes looking to serve eagerly becoming their sex toy for breeding. This will be long-term and include outfits, items and build up towards some of the more serious scenes. You'll go from each race/town working and adapting or being used. \n\nI may have no limits but I do absolutely love outfits, foot play, shoe play, footpaws, characters who are disgusted by the acts they do especially the stranger ones ( can explain further))\n\nso if you're interested in a longterm CYOA themed adventure of this sort send me your kinks/limits! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S anyone willing to GM for me works too ill happily play Krystal \n\n\nP.P.S: If you don't want to play her and wish to just play a different furry etc just send me your desired character! \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI only rp through Reddit so PM me !",

            "selftext": "As the title says,  I need a distraction from everything going on. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for years and while normally I\u2019m the one responding to others roleplay requests, this time I have a few things I\u2019d like to explore that I\u2019m not seeing around that much. Essentially looking for ERP, but happy to go for a long term romance plot as well, depending on the theme.\n\nI\u2019m a competent writer and role player, and while I\u2019ve mostly only lurked or responded on reddit over the last few years, I\u2019ve been quite active on F-list - and more recently Discord - for quite some time. If you want to read my stuff I can provide a link to my website. I\u2019m not selling anything on there, but I don\u2019t want to add a link to this post just in case I\u2019d be breaking a rule.\n\nI\u2019m putting this down as M4A as I\u2019d mostly like to explore me playing a Male character. I\u2019ve had enough of doing RPs as a futa or female with the understanding that my partner would swap after that RP came to a decent conclusion. Except they either fizzled out, didn\u2019t end or if they did, my partner would say they didn\u2019t feel like swapping. There is an exception to playing a male in the list of ideas below, but I\u2019ll get to that later.\n\nOkay, here\u2019s a list of roleplay ideas I\u2019d like to explore. If any tickle your fancy let me know. Primarily my character would be my polar bear called Beige, but happy to play either of my other characters (Grae the Bunny &amp; Alcatraz the Hound) or a human in any of these as well. And as said before, most of these could suit a short or long term roleplay. And for the record, my hard No\u2019s are Death, permanent injury and scat. \n\n1. Captain Normal: [m4A, superpowers, action, possible multiple characters] Everything changed when Alpha Centauri went supernova. Earth should have been destroyed. Instead, the only thing that changed as the celestial shockwave reached the planet is that all beings with a high level of sentience gained superpowers. That is, everyone except Beige. Looking for someone to play; a dominant villain (or hero) taking advantage of him; one or more of Beiges friends helping him through life; his pet that managed to get powers instead of him; the alien/god/being responsible for the powers or scientist trying to figure out why he wasn\u2019t altered. Good potential for a long term RP.\n\n2. Big Mythic Encounter: [m4A, Hyper/macro, Beast, Vore, Excessive Cum] Whilst out a wandering Beige comes across an area of woods he\u2019d not traversed before. Curious, he presses on and discovers the lair of something particularly large. Realising this was a bad idea he tries to return to the trail but it\u2019s too late, he\u2019s awakened the beast. Looking for someone to play a dragon, direwolf, or otherwise big creature. Preferably beast oriented but I\u2019m happy to consider really big characters as well (20ft+). Vore in this case does not include total digestion, but I am happy to discuss limits.\n\n3. Gloopy Goo: [m4A, WaM, light bondage, slime] It was a thankless job, but being the janitor on a passenger liner was the best way to see the universe. Most everything was automated anyway, but sometimes a problem would require the quick thinking and abstract solutions only an organic mind could come up with. This trip started like every other, until a motion sensor alert sounded in the cargo capsule. Squeezing through the tight maintenance tubes, Beige floated into the capsule, and his life was to be changed forever. Looking for someone to play an experiment gone loose, alien stowaway, or otherwise sentient slime or slimy being. This has the possibility of being long term romance as well, as Beige hides his discovery from everyone on the ship and helps it learn/grow. \n\n4. Shadow Realm: [Futa4f/Futa, beast, excessive cum, #thisistheexception] looking for someone to play a character that has ended up in the realm of Convoitise;  the shadow goddess who is humanoid in form but all purple with snakes for horns and a snake tail. Are they there to be punished or as a reward for serving her? Perhaps she brought them here to spare them an untimely death. Maybe she doesn\u2019t even know they\u2019re there at all. Regardless, her realm is filled with all manner of fantastical flora &amp; fauna ready to pounce on anyone careless enough to wander off the beaten path. Also willing to discuss the opposite of this; where Beige is caught in such a dimension and you play either Convoitise or a similar deity (which was the original agreement when the character of Convoitise was created). Ideally suited for long term.\n\n5. Monster Barn: [M4A, varied kinks] Genetic manipulation and artificial growth technology has finally reached its peak. As part of a promotion, Beige is chosen to visit Monster Barn before it opens and select a \u2018monster\u2019 to keep as his own. However, once he gets his new pet home, Beige realises the creature is smarter than the Scientists thought. Looking for someone to play a monstergirl, monsterboy or monsterfuta who despite being seen by society as a \u2018pet\u2019 along the same lines  as a dog or cat, is in fact just as intelligent as Beige (maybe even more so). The RP can range from a mostly sexual relationship, to more story based as Beige struggles with telling the world about his new friend or keeping them secret.\n\n6. Your idea: I\u2019m happy to discuss something you\u2019d like to do, even if it\u2019s nothing like those above. I would prefer one of my setups, but part of the reason I have a huge kink for being dominated by a massive beast (and filled to overflowing with cum) is because I took a chance with someone\u2019s idea a few years back. Variety is the spice of life.\n\nI can RP over Reddit Messages, Google Hangouts and at a push, Skype. But I prefer Discord. I\u2019ve tried Kik and Telegram and really aren\u2019t pleased with them, but if it\u2019s a dealbreaker I can look into using them again. \n\nLastly, I live in Australia in the AEST Timezone. Which means getting online at the same time as folks in European and the American timezones can be tricky. It\u2019s 2am when I post this, and it is about as late as I can go most nights as I\u2019m usually up at 7am. So mostly I either aim for multi-paragraph posts once or more a day, or finding time at the extremes of my day to do single/double sentence replies back and forth for a few hours. \n\nI\u2019ll really only be able to handle one, maybe two RPs right now, so once those are filled (fingers crossed) I\u2019ll let folks know.\n\nThanks for reading to the end, and stay groovy.\n",
