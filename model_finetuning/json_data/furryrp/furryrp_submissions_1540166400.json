            "selftext": "I live on fifteen acres of land I own in Alaska. It was owned by my grandfather, but he passed away five years ago. In his will, he left the property up for grabs to anyone who wanted it, but for some reason, I was the only one who did. When I finally graduated school, I decided to move from Colorado to Alaska to make a fresh start. With my small fortune that grandpa left me, I arrived at the property, and I found out why no one wanted it.\n\nThe cabin was in decent enough shape, a hole in the roof, a broken window, a couple other issues, but those were fast fixes in comparison to the yard. Dead trees everywhere laying on the ground with plenty still standing, a couple of rusty traps, an old truck that I haven't seen in years, and a tree looking like it was ready to fall on the house. This may not seem that bad, but it was ten acres of land with the cabin in the center of it all.\n\nWell, you can imagine it took me a month or so of work just to clean everything up to presentable standards. After that, I was free to do what I wanted.\n\nI've been living here for a couple years now, and not to toot my own horn, but I think it's amazing. There are four villages that surround me, about a mile or so away from me in each direction. I tend to only go to them when I need to pay a couple bills, need material, or I'm looking for something more specific. The people in them are nice enough, but I was never good at socializing. I always felt I came off as weird.\n\nI went to the southern village, Fenris, looking for some lumber to make a table and a couple chairs, to find out that the shop had a major surplus of it. That got me thinking about tree houses, so I made up my mind and built five of them.\n\nEach one was built on a different part of the property, each having a different asthetic inside, with the outside painted white, so not to draw attention to it. I even put solar panels on the roof of each one to have lights at night if I wanted to stay in one of them for the night. All of them had simple furniture, two of them had beds, and the other three had hammocks. On the walls I had a bunch of drawings of different view points of the property. My favorites were the ones that included the creek and the mountains together. I had family photos, but I kept those in the cabin. Even though I kept the tree houses pretty hidden I didn't want someone, somehow finding them and ruining the photos.\n\nOne day, I decided I wanted to see if I could build a bridge from one of the tree houses to another tree. You know, make yet another tree house. I headed down the south eastern path to my favorite of the High Five (get it\ud83d\ude0e) when I heard.... something. I wasn't quite sure what it was, but it sounded like someone was near by. My ears perked up, I start heading further down the path.\n\nAs I got closer I could tell the person was in the tree house. It was a bit windy today, with it blowing west, so it wasn't surprising that I didn't smell them. When the tree house was in my line of sight, I could hear that it was a female moaning and whimpering. I continued carefully and as quietly as possible. It was snowing a bit, so it was easier to keep silent. When I finally got within 10 feet of the tree house, I dropped my rope and tools loudly on a pile of sticks, making loud snapping noises. The whimpering stopped suddenly and I heard the intruder move to the window..............\n\nAnd that's where you come in. I know that was a long read, but I wanted to make at least a half decent back story. This is the first actual RP story I've written, so be gentle\ud83d\ude05.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is something with a bit of imagination.18+ people playing 18+ charcters, please. Talk to me about how you got there and why you're up there in the first place. I'm not looking for anything to rough just yet; I want this to build a bit.\n\nIf you got this far and you're interested in talking about this, have your fur color and whether you're short haired or long haired in the title to let me know. Like the title says, this is a wolf furry fantasy, but if want to change something, we can talk it out. Hell, nothing even has to happen, if you want to play the tease. Although, my character is a bit awkward and maybe a little oblivious to signals.\n\nUpdate: I'm wanting to do more in this RP that I've put together. If anyone wants to jump in still, you know what to do. I even have a few other posts that give a bit more background.",

            "selftext": "My story idea: Nimue was always the black sheep of any group. She usually kept to herself as she would adventure out to hike or draw some of her art. Though being shy and a little bit of social anxiety didn't help.\n\nOne day as she is looking for something to give her inspiration for her newly bought notebook to be filled with, she comes upon a old, seemingly abandoned university. She walks through the run down rooms and halls watching her step until she comes upon a door with a stairway leading downward. The odd thing is the door looked new. Shrugging, she opens the door and walks down the stairs. Realizing the staircase is brightly lit, she realized this area was no longer abandoned. She could her people talk in the distance. Peeking through a small window on the door, she saw men in lab coats walk past. Gasping she squatted down, her heart racing. But soon something catches her off guard. The air felt electrifying. She begins to follow the feeling to another floor down. Peeking through the door that she arrived to, no one was around and it sound quiet except a soft hum. Her curiosity got the best out of her and she couldn't help but feel drawn to the sound. She soon discovers the source of the sound. In a mattress padded room about the size of a class room is a few tables and computers and a bright oval shaped light with swirls of blue swirling around. She finds her self reaching out, her fingers reaching to the light. Little electrical sparks form around her fingers, tickling her skin. She takes a deep breath as she feels it guiding her towards the light and soon she finds her self walking through the light before everything goes dark. Her eyes open as her eyes adjust to the bright sunlight. She can hear leaves dancing in around in a quick breeze. and voices in the distance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is to be a NSFW yiff RP between a human and animal/furry.\n\nI have made a f-list so you know my character and her interests: [https://www.f-list.net/c/nimue%20moon](https://www.f-list.net/c/nimue%20moon)\n\nIf you are interested in doing this RP with me, please message me with you character's name and species. :)\n\nLooking forward to the fun!!! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "Hi all! I've been heavily in the mood for ferals recently, especially horses, dragons, and deer but I'm open to hearing from nearly any kind. As such I'm looking for anyone out there willing to play a sub or switch feral and get some good hard deep dicking. I can play an anthro or human depending on what you'd prefer, or nearly any kind of monster or fantasy race/creature you like. As the tags show I'm willing to play male or futa but I prefer futa, your character can be any sex as long as you're fine with them still being on the receiving end. My limits are gore, scat, snuff, and NTR, almost anything else is negotiable. I have a few potential plots and some fitting kinks but if you have other ideas feel free to say them:\n\nThe hunt: My character embarks on a hunt, wether modern or more old-school, but upon seeing what's caught in her trap decides she has much better uses for that fine piece of meat than as a meal (bdsm, predator/prey, humiliation, noncon/dubcon)\n\nAdoption: my character figured adopting a stray feral would be a breeze- too bad she forgot to look up when breeding season was! Now the horny beast won't stop trying to seduce her until they're both walking funny! (Seduction, heat, petplay, impregnation)\n\nBest in Show: you're not just a pet, you're a star! A master performer in the (your species) kennel club annual national competition! And the next event- sexual obedience! (Petplay, public, humiliation, bdsm)\n\nCan't break me: You're wild and untamable, scaring off anyone who tries to claim you even after you've been caught- but that's about to change. My character's a specialist in breaking in wild unruly ferals, and she's going to break you even if it takes all night and every bottle of lube in the building. (Bdsm, mindbreak, possibly wrestling/other combat, power difference) \n\nMeet n' Yiff: no nonsense simple option, feral and anthro meet and decide to fuck because they're horny. (Whatever kinks you want!) \n\nI'm willing to change kinks and situations to fit your kinks obviously\n\nI usually prefer to write in third person, and to here or on discord. PM me if interested!",

            "selftext": "**Post will be open for a long time!**\n\nHey there!\n\nI've been into anthro animal roleplay scenarios a lot, and I'd like to play out one scenario I've liked a lot!\n\nSo the idea for the roleplay is that an anthro animal, with some demonic powers, would seek out a temple belonging to a powerfull goddess(all other characters than the anthro male will be human). In this temple, he'd then use his dark powers to take control of the women guarding the temple, and then use sex to steal powers from them, making himself stronger, increasing his power over them, all to the point that he's strong enough to control even the goddess herself!\n\nSo, the powers for this roleplay would mostly be his dark aura, making women obey him, and help him. Not totally mindless, but unable to resist his orders. \n\nThis is the basic outline, and I'm open to discuss ideas :) \n\nSome anthro animal species I'd be into you playing for this would be wolf, tiger, lion, horse, bull, but might be open for other ideas there as well!\n\nWhile this is a roleplay with a lot of dominance in it, I want oit to still not get too dark, so no violent abuse, blood, or things like that. Historically I've played a lot of light hearted roleplay scenarios, so I don't want  to jump too far into dark teritories :)\n\nI'm thinking his motivation for this would be more about gaining power than the sex, with the sex being more of a means to getting power, and finally taking control of the goddess herself.\n\n* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, large cocks, anthros, mind control, magic, size difference, clothed sex\n* **Limits:** Toilet stuff, blood, death, violence, impregnation\n\nSo, if you're interested in this scenario, please send me a PM with some thoughts on the roleplay, tkinks and limits, or anything else you think would fit in this roleplay :)\n\nAnd please make sure you've read through the post as I don't want to stray too far from this general idea. Also, please send PM:s instead of using the chat, please :)\n\n*Love, Emelie*",
