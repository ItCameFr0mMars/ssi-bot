            "selftext": "The crowded night club was filled with smoke from the many cigars that the crowd was smoking. Low talking from the different species of Anthros could be heard from behind the thick curtain that hid the only human in the entire building.\n\nHis name is Kai and he is a traveling singer, going from city to city. Country to country to have his songs be heard by everyone. This time though, Kai wondered if this was a good idea since the city he was in only had Anthros/furries living in it. No humans would dare live here. Even some unique supernatural creatures lived here as well. A lot of human tourists would come and visit the city for their food and culture, but as soon as the humans came, they left in a hurry.\n\nBut Kai was not afraid, a little weary of the people in the club which the majority of were gang members, some criminals and even some famous Dons were here to bask in the entertainment of the infamous club called The Black Diamond. The human was just staying in the city for a few weeks to sing then he would travel to another city. Simple.\n\nThe man had on a black suit that hugged his well toned body. Kai knew he looked good, why not show it off? Plus some of the men in here were eye candy to him. Especially the bigger men who sat in the back.\n\nKai peeked out of the curtain and looked at the crowd, his eyes landed on you and from the gossip he heard from the women around here, you were a big deal. A Don and a handsome one at that. This is going to be interesting. Kai thought and his breath stilled a little when Kai caught your eye. The human moved back behind the curtain and put a heart over his chest with a small sigh. A sigh of fear or awe, he did not know. But what Kai did know was that he had a pang of lust as he looked at your form. And he knew he was playing with fire if Kai would flirt with you. But he couldn't help it, he was attracted to dangerous things.\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen. We are lucky to have so many special guests here tonight, but here is a special treat. A traveling singer is here to share his talent with you tonight. Please, welcome Kai Ito!\"\n\nThe crowd applauded as the curtains opened revealing Kai to the crowd. There were some wolf whistles and some cat calls. Which he was used to, Kai walked forward to the standing mic and he smirked as he locked eyes with you.\n\n\"Thank you for having me tonight, I am honored to sing to so many important people tonight.\" Kai blew a kiss to you and gave you a flirty wink before he started to sing.\n\n\"You had plenty money in 1922...\"\n\n****\nYou will be going off of my starter, your character is a Don or a mafia boss. When you contact me, please write where you found me, your character's info, kinks and a picture of your character. I also would like it if your character is something unique and not a wolf or a dog. I have seen a lot of wolves and dogs and just want something new. I am looking for a dominant male but can also go for a dominant female as well. \n\nThe world is set in the 20s and I'm looking for an advanced role play partner that has good Grammer, spelling and writes how I write. No one liners, detail is key. Try to tell a story. That's what I try to do when I write to others, tell a story so others can be engaged in the role play. Thicc, chubby and large male's are more than welcome! \n\nI write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words) 10+ lines and I'm very detailed in my writing and characters. I am a writer and love making a world come to life and breathing life into the characters and world around them.\n\nContact info: I role play on Telegram.\n\nTelegram: BishieLover1738\n\nDo I write smut?:\nYes, I sure do! I love smut! Just not all the time.\n\nWhat I'm looking for: an advanced role player and a dom. I'm a writer so I write a lot and I love detail. Please write with detail like my starter. If you can't do that, then we can't role play.\n\nIs there anything else I would like to add?:\nOnce again, I'm looking for advanced role players. People who write like my starter. If you can't write like that, then we cannot role play. I just really want to have a story between us and if you give me a tiny response that doesn't have anything to go off of, then we're not made to role play with each other",

However the situation can be different depending on personal preference, however I do have a few settings we could bounce off of.\n\n1. Tribal times, where our pack resents the idea of pregnancy before wedlock yet, so we have to hide it.\n\n2. Medevial, where we are a different species, and in our hometown we are unable to have a relationship with each other, but other towns allow our love to be shared. However all towns are against pregnancy before wedlock\n\n3. A modern world we can discuss further, as I am findi g it quite hard to justify hiding the pregnancy.\n\nThe main thing in this roleplay will be the romance portion, make my heart melt. This will not be a sexually driven roleplay.\n\nNSFW will be scarce, but when it comes to that point, I am a masochist, so be prepared to rough up a pregnant belly. Flora will also be smoking and drinking throughout the pregnancy\n\nI have many forms of communication, message me!\n\n",

My character is a 26/F/Orca (I can change species, which is fine if we want to try something different) and as by my title, I am looking for dominant males. By dominant, I mean males who will rip her clothes off and fuck her into a broken drooling mess with her snatch and ass spurting out the males thick hot musky cum. (Bit of a slut). Males that treat her like nothing more than a place to empty their balls into, whether that be her two holes or throat, and I especially enjoy males who are good at dirty talking/degradation. Maybe even getting her heavily pregnant, depending on your kinks. I do have a preference for males whose characters are chubby but that is optional, just nothing too thin or lean. NO underaged, and please be literate and post well, I like good chunk posts to read and respond to, makes it a lot more fun. Message me for my Kik. I also use telegram and discord.",
