Fantasy-you be a big scary monster type char and I'm the unwitting soul that crosses your path.\n\n2. Sci-Fi-You are the captain and I am a traveler drifting in space in a broken down ship when you find me.\n\n3. Slave Auction-I have been captured and put up for sale at the auctions and you're the purchaser.\n\n4. Father/Son-this one is somewhat underdeveloped, but you be the big marine type dad and I'm the geeky scrawny son.\n\nI have more so ask or if you have your own ideas let me know! I play the sub/bottom so I'm really looking for tops/doms. \n\nKik username - UnitedStatesOfJojo",

Please ignore the odd seeming username. \nI am looking for a straight romance/nsfw possibly a long-term roleplay. I have no specified plot and/or setting, we can describe the two of them inside messages.\nI'd most preferably do the roleplay in PMs, but we may use discord if you want- but that's all I got. \nNo Illiterate roleplay, or even casual- literate is a must- character isn't much of a worry the only species that I wouldn't prefer are Equines, Fowls/Birds, and some that may relate to those.\n\nNSFW wise; The roleplay will be romance related- and NSFW isn't a requirement but is preferred- and may even be just what we do. Kinks wise, I'm more vanilla, but feel free to share some kinks with me- I may make some acceptions. \n\nMy character is a Female Australian Shepherd, she of course is straight, as the roleplay will be a straight romance- The lowest age I go is 14, the highest is 25. Appearance, and rest of her may/will be described in messages- as of will the plot/setting.\n\nIf You're interested in roleplaying with me, send me a message. ",

Please be sure to read through the whole thing. If I hate something you love or love something you hate, we're probably not right for each other.\n\nI'm currently experiencing a bit of an RP drought, and I'm going to need some help stuffing that hole. Pun intended. First things first: I'm located in Europe. Partners from other continents are absolutely fine, but it would be great if we could **schedule** our rps somewhat to make sure we're both here. Also, I'm looking for a **reliable** partner. If something comes up and you can't make it to an agreed RP time, do let me know. If you hate something in the RP that we can fix, do let me know. If we're not good together and you want to stop playing, do let me know. We're reasonable adults, and whatever's going on, we can talk about it.\n\nI love story. I love smut. I need both. I'm not doing quick fucks, and I'm not doing weeks of RP without a single shag. A 50/50 ratio is usually agreeable. Please make sure that we share this view before replying.\n\nI'm okay with **any kind of gender pairing,** but I do prefer mixing it up. Maybe we can populate our original world (no fandoms, please, bit of creativity here!) with several characters each and play straight couples, gay men, lesbians, futas and all that stuff. If you have a strong preference for one or two genders, I'm sure we can still figure something out.\n\nAlright, **kink requirements!** Apart from grammar, punctuation and a decent one-, two- or three-paragraph post length, there's the following, structured in neat little categories for easy reference:\n\n**Favourites - I need those!**\n\n* **Cumshots.** Clean fur is nice, cum-covered fur is nicer! Depending on the setting, I'm okay with both realistic and unrealistic amounts of cum.\n\n* **Romance.** Maybe the relationship starts with a one-night stand, but there **is** a relationship. I want our characters to fall in love.\n\n* **Kissing.** I like kissing a lot, both in the NSFW part of our RP and in the story part. It's what makes romance romance in my opinion, and I do like a well-described kiss every now and then.\n\n* **Dirty Talk and Moans.** Please don't be too quiet when we shag. Sounds can be as enticing as physical sensations, smells and tastes.\n\n* **Favourite species:** Wolves, lynxes, red pandas.\n\n**Yes - I like those and generally want to include them, but if you don't like any of them, that's fine.**\n\n* **Slapping, biting, scratching.** I like it rough and passionate. If your characters don't, that's alright.\n\n* **Public sex, clothed sex, quickies.**\n\n* **Slightly chubby, slightly muscular, slightly tall and slightly short characters:** I don't like most extremes, but I do like variety in body types. That includes cock and breast sizes, of course!\n\n* **Multiple characters.** Maybe a friend joins in, maybe there's a love triangle... I'm okay with one player playing multiple characters at the same time.\n\n\n* **Species I like too:** Some breeds of cats and dogs (the domesticated kind), lizards without wings, horses without wings, female pandas, opossums, weasels, mouses... Anything that's not on the No List (further below) usually works out.\n\n**Maybe - Those depend on context, and I don't really want them in every play. If you don't like any of them, that's completely fine, because I'm totally okay leaving them out!**\n\n* **Watersports.** Can be hot sometimes, but it's not my main kink in any way.\n\n* **Sibling incest, particularly twins.** Surprise my character by showing up as two people when he expected one! Or let me be your brother or sister.\n\n* **Saliva play.** In a heated fuck, things can get messy. Messy kisses, messy blowjobs, bit of extra lube for a handjob or wet rimming. I'm down for that.\n\n**No - I'm not doing those!**\n\n* **Scat and Vomit are definitely on the no list!**\n\n* **Dom/Sub, Bondage, Torture, Violence.** I'm fine with violence in the plot section, of course, but our eRP will be full of love and equality, even when it's rough. No BDSM stuff. I'm adamant there. Don't contact me with \"Maybe a bit of tying you to the bed post, that's not really BDSM\" messages. Blindfolds are sometimes okay, but I'm not into master and pet stuff.\n\n* **Vore, Growth, Transformation, Tentacles.**\n\n* **Species I definitely don't want to play:** Frogs and toads, bovines, centaurs, flying dragons or anything that's a lot taller or shorter than a 'normal' anthro; no bestiality/ferals. No bats. No fish or other water creatures.**\n\n\nOkay! You made it through the kink list. Have a cookie! There's one more list coming up, namely scenario ideas. **Those are not all the ideas I have, and we can of course integrate your ideas!** Just to give you an idea of what's possible.\n\nI do **not** do fantasy or medieval. I RPed in WoW for seven years, and I'm sick of the whole \"no electricity, lots of lore, lots of races\" stuff.\n\n* **Urban Fantasy:** Probably my favourite setting. This doesn't necessarily mean vampires and werewolves, even though the literature world apparently thinks that. It could be magic users and normal people in a modern world, either getting along nicely or hating each other's guts.\n\n* **Slice of Life:** Just a normal modern world with furries instead of people. More of a focus on everyday activities instead of an over-arching plot with a villain and lots of action.\n\n* **Near future:** Ten or twenty years from now, with either an urban fantasy or slice of life touch to it. Technological gadgets, maybe a bit of spaces stuff, generally just somewhere between modern day and sci-fi.\n\n* **Sci-fi** is possible if it's done well. We'd have to take a look at each other's definition of sci-fi there.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAnd that's it! Congratulations, you've made it. Before you go (and hopefully drop me a private message telling me you want to play with me!), one more thing: Sometimes I've got a lot of time, sometimes not so much. This is a long-term thing, but not a \"for hours every day\" thing. Sometimes that can happen, but don't count on never doing anything else again. I enjoy playing a lot when I have the time, but depending on my schedule and your time zone, it doesn't always work.\n\nHave a great day!",

            "selftext": "Yes, I know, purple dragon, how cliche.  Blah blah blah.  [I have many images](https://imgur.com/a/ZGELWN6), by various artists, all of whom are lovely.  I'd like to say that my roleplaying skills are above par, which, if you know much about golf, means they aren't great.  But screw that!  I'm a chronic narcissist and don't examine my own flaws.  Of which there are none.  Err, sometimes in and out of character gets mixed up for comedy, but in essence, that's Lord's thought process.  Dragons are superior to other species, and he's superior to any other dragon.  Quite simply, he's the best.  His narcissism is but the most obvious facet of his personality, being rather nice outside of his speciesism/arrogance.  If you really wanna rile him up and make him mad, compare him to a snake.\n\nWell.  In any case, I'm seeking all sorts.  I am not one to say I have no limits, of course, just that those limits are rarely regarding those I seek.  My limits include scat, watersports, vomit, vore, gore, hyper, overly fat/muscular/thin characters, and, most of all, sharing.  I've never been one for gangbangs.  I much prefer being the only one to bang, ya dig?\n\nNow the fun part:  Kinks.  I have many, including, but not limited to:  clothing play (skimpy/maid outfits and such), cock warming, somnophilia, being worshipped (cock and otherwise), cumplay, and cum addiction.  And cuties.  Can't get enough of the cuties.  Those are just the biggest ones.  [I have a full F-list, if you care to check more in depth.](https://www.f-list.net/c/what%20up%20lord/)  Though it may have a bit out of date, for the most part it's accurate.\n\nThe casual tag is just a suggestion, mainly.  Most story oriented roleplays fall flat, if only due to getting too ambitious and launching into it without figuring if we're rather compatible with one another.\n\nHaving sneaked cum into your character's food for some time, until they were firmly attached to the taste is a popular suggestion.  But Lord's story always has room to add more.  Being a teacher, father, even an officeworker is available, if just a touch out of character.  None of us are going to have perfect chemistry right out the gate, so it's adjustable.\n\nSpeaking of out of character.  I don't mind talking out of character.  Having actual conversations rather than typefucking your murrsona.  Out of character, I'm a bit less narcissistic, but describing my own personality would be far too self aggrandizing.\n\nMy kik is TheEclecticGentleman.  It is Eclectic, not Electric.  Eclectic as in having varying tastes.  There's a theme, you see?",
