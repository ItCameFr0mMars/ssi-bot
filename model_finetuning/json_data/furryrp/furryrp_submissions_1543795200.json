            "selftext": "**Post will be open for a long time**\n\nHey there!\n\nI've been a lot into anthro on human roleplay scenarios lately, and today I'd like to explore dub-con and non-con as well :)\n\nI don't want a straight up rape or violence, but instead a scene where two anthro animals would coerce me to have sex with them. \n\nI like it to take a little time, if they use alcohol to get my inhibitions down, combined with me being a girl who's got a hard time saying no, especially after having drunk alcohol. \n\nIt would come to a point where I can't get away, both because of the alcohol, bad balance etc, but also because they could easily overpower me. So, I want them to be able to have their way with me, with me basically being able to protest verbally, but not able to escape. Knowing they have me in their power, they wouldn't need violence or threats, when they can just do what they like to me :)\n\nSome things I like to include is they groping me, undressing me etc while pushing me to drink more as well.\n\nSo, I don't want this to get out of hand with rougness etc, so again, it's not a straight up rape scenario. I'm mostly used to light hearted roleplaying, so I don't want to stray away too far with this roleplay, so I prefer if I see it more as an inconvenience rather than being traumatized :)\n\nAs for ages, I'd prefer my character to be around 25-27 something, with the guys being 18 years old.\n\nSome animal species I could think up: Wolf, donkey, horse, bull, dragon, bear, lion, tiger, zebra, hawk. I'm open for other ideas as well of course!\n\n* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, long cocks, large loads, clothed sex, banter, details, ageplay, animal cocks\n* **Limits:** Impregnation, toilet stuff, violence, \n\nSo, if you're interested in this, please let me know:\n\n* What your thoughts on the idea are\n* Your kinks\n* Limits\n* What animals you're open to play as\n* If you're ok with me being more of an everyday looking girl rather than a pornstar or model\n* If you're ok with playing as 2 anthros\n\nSo, hope to hear back from you! And please try to answer the post, and avoid one-liner responses or very low ewffort responses. I want to know what you're into with this, so I know if we're a good match :) \n\n*Love, Emelie*",

            "selftext": "Look no further, this is it. I'll make the intro short and sweet, I'm here looking for crazy, wild, fun, smutty roleplay. What I mean by that is I'm looking for a smut driven roleplay, that's why down below you'll find several plots that can satisfy your kinky roleplay needs, as well as any cravings for a story. My favorite kinks are bondage, rough sex, hair pulling, choking, name calling, forced, corruption, blackmail, humiliation, degradation, public play, mind breaking, etc. Keep in mind these are just a few of my favorites and I'm open to almost anything, excluding scat, vore, gore, and farting. Anything else is on the table.\n---------\nPlot 1: Life during the apocalypse is hard and dangerous, sometimes its more hard than anything.\n\nBasically we would be playing the roles of survivors, which opens many doors. Maybe we're from the same group, running a supply mission and we find ourselves passionately fucking in the heat of the moment. Maybe I'm selling goods that your group needs, however you have no currency so you find different means to pay. Or perhaps I'm a raider, I take what I want and when we come to pillage your settlement I have my way with you regardless of whether or not you want it.\n\nPlot 2: Never has the phrase \"Fuck the Police\" been so literal.\n\nYou're a newbie to the force, you just got your squad car and now you're on your first solo assignment. Responding to a call regarding a breaking and entering, you find yourself being overpowered by the very suspect you were supposed to arrest. Now, you're in your own cuffs and he reads you your rights as he shoves his cock down your throat.\n\nPlot 3: You failed a student, now he's giving you a D for an A.\n\nFor the entire semester one of your students hasn't shown up for more than a collective ten minutes. The day before grades are due, he questions why and how you're failing him. You explain, to which he then uses his own means to try and persuade you differently.\n\nPlot 4: In the not-so-distant future, bartenders serve their cum as drinks.\n\nA new bar has just opened up downtown, it's called \"The Triple X.\" It's famous for many things, it's no clothing rule, the hoards of strangers fucking everywhere in the building, and the only drink available is the bartenders spunk.\n\nPlot 5: You make it.\n\nThose are the plots I had in mind, if you had one of your own you'd like to try I'm always open for anything and everything. If you'd like to try one of mine, please message with a ref, which plot, and your kinks! Thanks for reading this, looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nMy Kik is HuntingCanine",

            "selftext": "The world of Pok\u00e9mon was a place of wonder, mystery and adventure. Whether you are going through gyms to participate in the league, exploring the furthest reaches to find new Pok\u00e9mon or even just running simple shops there was plenty of excitement to be found. But it was also a dangerous world with so many powerful creatures running around. That wasn't enough to deter the more bold humans from venturing into unknown depths.\n\nSuch was the case with one Pok\u00e9mon trainer. She was competent and was intent on finding a new undiscovered Pok\u00e9mon and had been at it for weeks. Seeing a silhouette in the distance she held up her Pok\u00e9dex and scanned it finding that the dex didn't recognize it. This was what she was waiting for. Running to the mon she reached down to her belt and was ready to try and catch it. Something was wrong as she got close she fell unconcious.\n\nLater she awoke with a throbbing headache and stood up. Or at least tried to stand up, finding her balance off and her body felt different. \"Whatever that was must've done a number on me, I need to get back.\"\n\nAnother trainer had been in that area and had come across a Pok\u00e9mon unlike any other. While it was a known species it was very humanoid and he heard it talk, it also looked somewhat injured. Taking a chance he threw a ball and prayed it would work.\n\nThe somewhat groggy girl heard something then felt the tap of a Pok\u00e9ball on her side and everything turned red as she was caught in a Pok\u00e9ball. After some shaking she was unable to break out of it.\n\n***\n\nHello, I do hope you enjoyed the Prompt. To make it clear I am looking to play as a male trainer who captures a female human turned into a anthro pok\u00e9mon. I am open to just about any mon.\n\nLimits are Scat, Gore, Vomit, Farting and Snuff. We can discuss kinks in messages.\n\nWhen you PM me include\n\n* A small sample of your writing\n* What Pok\u00e9mon you would like to play, or a list if you can't decide\n* Include your favorite anime (Or video game if you don't watch anime) in the body of the message to let me know you read it all",

            "selftext": "Hey there! \n\nI've been a LOT into anthro on human roleplay lately, and would like to try something out today where I'm a 25 year old human who would have either moved to, or just visiting an anthro country. In this roleplay world, I'm thinking humans and anthros would live on equal terms, and it's nothing strange about it, though they could feel a bit exotic to a human :)\n\nAs for my character, I'd prefer to be rather experienced, though never with an anthro, so  it would be a lot of new stuff for me\n\nAs for your character(s) I was thinking it could be fun with some age contrast, with him being either 18, or a fair bit older than me, but experienced whichever we go with :)\n\nWe could go with him being an older neighbor, maybe ana nthro pornstar, or something else. Open for everyday characters as well :)\n\nOverall, I like this to be a fun and light heartened roleplay scenario, so I'd like to leave out abuse and dominance etc :)\n\nSome animal species I could think up: Wolf, donkey, horse, bull, dragon, bear, lion, tiger, zebra, hawk. I'm open for other ideas as well of course!\n\n* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, long cocks, large loads, clothed sex, banter, details, ageplay, animal cocks\n* **Limits:** Impregnation, toilet stuff, violence, \n\nSo, if you're interested in this, please let me know:\n\n* What your thoughts on the idea are\n* Your kinks\n* Limits\n* What ages you're open to play as\n* What animals you're open to play as\n* If you're ok with me being more ov an everyday looking girl rather than a pornstar or model\n\nHope to hear back from you! And please no one l\u00f6iner responses or very low effort ones. I want to know what you're into, so I know if we're a good match :) \n\n*Love, Emelie*",
