            "selftext": "Hi everyone, token human guy Ravi here, full name Ravindra Wolfgang Amadeus Romulus Lebowski. I love righteous fucking power metal, classic fantasy literature, tabletop gaming, my family, shredding on my guitar, classic modern horror movies, and you. You might have seen me around with my band (we're not really famous yet, but we'll get there some day), at the Friendly Local Game Store, or less glamorously lifting heavy stuff as the only guy working at the local Hobby Lobby.\n\nI'm about 5'10\" (tall for a human but there's a good chance I'm shorter than you; one of my exes used to call me \"smol boi luv\"), kinda slim and toned, with green eyes and shoulder-length blond hair matching the long soul-patch on my chin.\n\nHumans and non-humans (particularly furries and monsters) live side by side, and as a result racism has fallen to the wayside in favor of discrimination based on species. Non-humans live as second-class citizens in many countries, if not legally then at least socially. Dating between humans and furries is often a taboo subject, the way interracial relationships have been for much of American history. \n\nYou and I however tend to forget about all of that when we're together. At least, we do when we're not in the bedroom, incorporating it into our dirty talk. Aside from how adorable and pettable you are, my other favorite thing about dating you is when you go into heat, making your sex drive go wild and turning you into my personal sex toy for a few days every month.\n\nHow did we meet? What do we see in each other? What's our relationship like? Will we start from the beginning with how we met, with our first date, or start after the first few weeks the morning after one of our dates?\n__________________\n**Kinks:** Furries, dub-con, free-use, dirty talk, slutty outfits, exhibition/voyeurism, light bondage, romance (the kinkster kind, not vanilla), pet play, cumplay, marathon sex, D/s Power play, toys, interracial themes, begging, cheating, rough sex, sleep play, cum play, pregnancy risk, Partners who have some idea of who their character is, rule 34, interaction, character development, cheesy sitcom plots.\n\n**Limits:** Blood, injury, bathroom stuff.",

            "selftext": "Warning, extremely long post ahead\n\n\n\nHello ladies, gentlemen and any other gender or whatever you are who is reading this, my name is Cameron and I am an admin for one of the most active and interactive groups around for masters/mistresses and those who wish to see themselves as possessions.\n\nNow I\u2019m here we have some unique terminology, guests are the masters or mistresses and the merchandise are our slaves. We keep these two groups separate until auction day where you bid on the one you want using points you\u2019ve accumulated via activity, skill at roleplay and some other factors, meaning that if you\u2019re more active and people enjoy playing with you you\u2019ll be rewarded greater than someone who isn\u2019t active.\n\nWhile the Guests get to stay in quite a swanky estate known as 'The Chateau' which includes many rooms to lounge and play in as well as 2 pools, a private garden and a game room, not to mention the private suites each guest gets during their stay, all slaves are kept below in The Dungeon. This space includes cages, cells with beds, training podiums, a shackle wall, showers, baths, some furniture, a bathroom, and alot of pent of slaves that regularly play with eachother! Once a week we hold the actual auction where one at a time the slaves are brought to the guests and put on display, rented by the highest bidder who becomes their master/mistress for a few days until the cycle starts over again.\n\nSo I\u2019ve you\u2019re still interested this far down you can tell that this has been thought through and won\u2019t collapse within a week unlike some other groups and we do like to have a lot of fun here don\u2019t you worry about that! Our rules are simple and easy but they are enforced so no one will eat away with anything no matter who they are. Our admins are very excellent people and will happily listen to any and all problems, concerns and questions!\n\nSo if you\u2019d like to apply for this then please note that we have openings for 2 male bisexual slaves, guests are open to any genders and as with all groups priority is given to female slaves, please note that you need to  be BISEXUAL to be a slave otherwise you won\u2019t be accepted.\n\nAlso you will need to fill out an application, provide a reference image and provide a sample of your previous roleplay experience which will be accepted in a sample of your writing. Our public application group is #auctionapplications \n\n",

I do want subs that can take care of themselves but also need me to take care of them. So like...sort of independent but at the same time not lol. My character is a singer and she's just looking for love and someone to take care of. \n\nI am a writer so I am looking for advanced role players. Good grammar, spelling and detail. Lots of detail and long paragraphs. Once again, I am a writer. I need detail and long paragraphs or I will get bored very very fast. \n\nWhen you message me, can you please tell me what post you found me on, your character info as well as a picture of your character, and your kinks! \n\nI really don't want canines or wolves or hybrids. Just please give me something different, or I will get bored. Just saying. \n\nTelegram: BishieLover1738",
