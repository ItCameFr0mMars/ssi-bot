That's when you walked in to my life.\"\n\nSo I have a special place in my ~~lust~~ heart for footplay and those that would naturally accompany such a thing, but I especially love feminine feet. It'snot limited to women, I also find I have the hots for tending to the paws of femboys, crossdressers, etc. It's simply an attraction to femininity.\n\nUnfortunately despite it being my top kink, it's the one I've been able to indulge the least in RP. So I'm hoping to find a dom/domme for a long term story of a poor little wolf, who's very much girly himself, and how you break him down and make him your perfect little pawslut and well, puddy under your paws to do what you wish to him.\n\nAs most of my prompts go, I tend to not set hard limits, because: \"Hey, it's just an RP. Why limit the fun?\"\n\nAnyhoo, hope to hear from you!",

And the only anthro I'm not a fan of is beaks, so if you want bird, no beak.\n\nNow, this could go many different ways:\n\n1. Human on anthro in a world where one is rare\n\n2. Anthro on anthro where the species are vastly different\n\n3. Human transformed into anthro and learning about the new body\n\nPlease let me know which you lean toward, and which species you might like to play.\n\nA couple starters that I've never gotten to fully play out:\n\nA. Rural America still hasn't seen many anthros, I play a simple farmer in one such town that has never seen an anthro before, but after ordering something from the general store, I find out that the new delivery boy/girl happens to be an adorable fox anthro. \n\nB. Spending a few decades on an oil rig off the cost means I missed the integration of anthros into our world. And life in a small town of anthros in the sticks means you haven't seen many humans, but by chance we both meet in the big city and bond over our common questions.\n\nC. A hiker lost in the mountains during a rainstorm happens upon a curious anthro deer, eager to help him find shelter, even if it is a cramped cave, and there's no telling how long the storm might last.\n\nD. Traveling abroad before Uni sounded like an excellent idea, until you find yourself lost and afraid on the city streets surrounded by unfamiliar species.\n\n\nHope someone finds the idea of discovery appetizing. And to be clear I'm not looking for a dom/sub routine, I'm not looking to force anything on anyone, or be sneakily seductive. What I'm looking for is a situation, or series of situations, that allow us to be curious and experiment because we're *both* curious. \n\nLimits are toilet, vore, and slutty characters\n\nOptional kinks include feet, sweat, impreg, and painful sex\n",

            "selftext": " \n\nI... Don't have any holiday pictures this time. Nuts. What I do have is enough love in me to give, baby. In addition to big, fat, juicy dragon cock.\n\nYes, I know, purple dragon, how cliche. Blah blah blah. [I have many images](https://imgur.com/a/ZGELWN6), by various artists, all of whom are lovely.  I'd like to say that my roleplaying skills are above par, which, if you know much about golf, means they aren't great. But screw that! I'm a chronic narcissist and don't examine my own flaws. Of which there are none. Err, sometimes in and out of character gets mixed up for comedy, but in essence, that's Lord's thought process. Dragons are superior to other species, and he's superior to any other dragon. Quite simply, he's the best. His narcissism is but the most obvious facet of his personality, being rather nice outside of his speciesism/arrogance. Even willing to take a joke on him, sometimes, depending on what the joke entails. It might be a better idea just to let him make the jokes, though. If you really wanna rile him up and make him mad, compare him to a snake. No promises that will make him like you.\n\nIn any case, I'm seeking all sorts. I am not one to say I have no limits, of course, just that those limits are rarely regarding those I seek. My limits include scat, watersports, vomit, vore, gore, hyper, overly fat/muscular/thin characters, and, most of all, sharing. I've never been one for gangbangs. I much prefer being the only one to bang, ya dig? Nor do I like prostituting pets/slaves or the like.\n\nNow the fun part: Kinks. I have many, including, but not limited to: clothing play (skimpy/maid outfits and such), cock warming, somnophilia (sleep sex), being worshiped (cock and otherwise), cumplay, and cum addiction. And cuties. Can't get enough of the cuties. Those are just the biggest ones. [I have a full F-list, if you care to check more in depth.](https://www.f-list.net/c/whatuplord/)Though it may have a bit out of date, for the most part it's accurate.\n\nThe casual tag is just a suggestion, mainly. Most story oriented roleplays fall flat, if only due to getting too ambitious and launching into it without figuring if we're rather compatible with one another.\n\nHaving sneaked cum into your character's food for some time, until they were firmly attached to the taste is a popular suggestion. Of course, he's also not always the most traditionally masculine. One could find him, and want a taste of him, until they learn that dragons are stronger than they appear. And after the first dozen orgasms, well, I'm sure they won't be too resistant for much longer. [Futa Lord](https://i.imgur.com/GcIJX3q.png), or [Lady](https://i.gyazo.com/56c1aa99069617896e246ed0edb288e1.png), might make you her girlfriend regardless of your own gender, if you know what I mean. But Lord's story always has room to add more. Being a teacher, father, even an officeworker is available, if just a touch out of character. None of us are going to have perfect chemistry right out the gate, so I can adjust him somewhat to fit with your own character.\n\nSpeaking of out of character. I don't mind talking out of character. Having actual conversations rather than typefucking your murrsona. Out of character, I'm a bit less narcissistic, but describing my own personality would be far too self aggrandizing.\n\nAlso, it is Eclectic, not Electric. Eclectic as in having varying tastes. There's a theme, you see? Anyway, hit me up.",

Her fur is that of a dark gray and white mixture, maybe some blacks thrown in there, and she is very well endowed, wielding around 3 rows of breasts, top one being double Gs cup, middle Es, and bottom  DDs.\n\n**Personality:** Hunter is a leans introvert though that doesn't make him anywhere close to a shy butterfly, knowing how to conduct himself, he is fairly laid back and is a bit awkward regarding sexual activity.\nHe is more thoughtful and likes to engage in small social settings, he leans more book smarts overall and is getting to grips with his new found power and responsibility.\n\n**Powers:** Hunter doesn't have any powers, however, hunger, lust, and long amounts of time in moonlight cause him to turn into his female wolf form, while his mind is not altered, her body has a lot more needs, urges and is quite powerful.\n\n**Strength** she is a lot stronger than a normal human being probably at peak being able to lift several tons though this weakens with heat or lust\n\n**Healing** as a werewolf, scars, bruises, cuts, and stabs heal much faster than a human, though this power carries over to her human form.\n\n**senses** her senses are on par with that of a dog or canine as well enhanced reflexes.\n\n**Images** (these are more how each form roughly looks, not exact and if Appearance overrules image)\n\n[Human form concept] (https://i.pinimg.com/236x/7c/a8/3c/7ca83c63fe3a3986fe11380a62fa14b9--cool-anime-guys-game-character.jpg)\n\n[Wolf form concept NSFW] (https://static4.hentai-image.com/upload/20170821/327/334287/p=700/6.jpg)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n##Plot-and-contact\n\nPlot would revolve around our characters meeting, the world is likely a human centered world where furries are rare, unless you want it the reverse, then Hunter could be sucked into that universe.\n\nregardless your character tries to bring out the inner animal in her, as well maybe they go through some struggles and stuff together.\n\nIf you desire or are interested in contacting me for this RP prompt, simply massage me directly why you like this RP and what elements you might want to include, and send me your discord tag.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Inspired by another prompt I saw which itself was inspired by a transformation comic:\n\nI knew the Heat was known to be a kind of crazy bondage club, but I figured you know, maybe some naked people running around, suspension, whips, chains, the usual.\n\nAnd to be honest on first arriving that's all that it seemed to be, some food was laid out on a table and there was nothing really odd to think of...but there was this look, some strange look some of the women gave me that should've peaked me to something being wrong. I was wearing a leather harness on my somewhat average 5'6\" frame, which of course would attract attention, but given the naked people all around and others in bondage gear it shouldn't have attracted this much attention. There was something else.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, the Mistress'/Dommes around tonight were given notice that a new lesbian plaything was arriving and that some scan had revealed that I was a submissive little pet deep down inside. Still, I didn't know this or anything that was about to happen when I reach for a strawberry at the snack table. But as soon as it was in my mouth and I heard you say stop, I was completely unable to move. What followed over the next minute or so was you crafting me into your perfect little anthro-pet, before the fruit in my mouth formed a gag and you leashed me up and pulled me over to your own little area, to be your pet forever.\n\nI'll admit, I liked the premise so much that I changed very little but I'm also open to more suggestions :)\n\nMy big kinks include anal, anal training, bondage, futa, toys, pet play, collar/leash play, body mods, lots of cum, and impregnation. I can deal with some violence (slapping, spanking, etc) but nothing too extreme. My limits are scat, gore, and humiliation.\n",

            "selftext": "\ud83d\ude21 Don't call me baby, cutie no flirty names. I'm not hear to flirt with you or even be your friend. I want role players that's it. Strictly business! If you start being flirty, or you fucking send me dick pics, I'm blocking you. I am here to role play, not be your girlfriend or your friend. If it doesn't work out between us, I will tell you and that's that. I'm looking for specific people. If you don't meet my expectations, then I will tell you. Don't try to ask or beg me to give you a second chance. If it doesn't work out, then it doesn't work. \n\nI honestly had no idea where to look for role players anymore. I tried a few different sites and they sort of just didn't meet up to my expectations even though I had said I was a writer and I'm looking for advanced people.\n\nMeaning people who can write very good. Three or more paragraphs. Two is fine I suppose. Spelling has to be good, I don't want to stare at my phone and figure out what the hell you're trying to say. I want people that can tell a story. Don't make me do all the damn work. Give me something to work off of!\n\nAnyway, I'm a 22 year old woman in college who loves to role play for fun! Just call me Nemu. It's actually sort of a hobby for me and I enjoy it since it's like telling a story between two people! And I'm an amateur writer so it helps me become better at writing as well! So like I said, I am in college, but I have my phone on me 24/7 so, hopefully we can get some rping done!\u00a0\n\n\nWhat I'm looking for: I want to do an African role play. Meaning, my character, my Cheetah Nemu is looking for a mate to help raise her cub but to also have another. She needs a strong mate to help survive the hardships of Africa as well as help her protect her cub as well as future cub.\n\nYou have to be a feline, so lion, leopard, cheetah, ect. Since she has to give birth to a feline. It doesn't have to be an African based feline either, but it would make more sense. \n\n\nBasic info:\n\n\n\ud83c\udf2dWhat I do: M/M, F/F, M/F. Dom/sub and original role plays.\n\n\ud83d\uded1 What I don't want: I don't want people who don't know how to rp. If you come to me, you better know how to tell a story, write well, give me about two or three paragraphs and I just don't want to jump into sex. Story first then sex.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf82 I've been rping since I was 12. So that's 10 years of role play experience yet I'm still learning!\u00a0\n\n\n\ud83c\udf7aI write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words) and I'm very detailed in my writing and characters.\u00a0\n\n\n\ud83c\udf54I can type pretty fast and I can crank out about 2 or 5 paragraphs (even more) if there's something to do between our characters. If there really isn't that much going on or you don't give me a lot to work with, it's probably going to be 1 paragraph.\n\n\ud83e\udd2cYou better tell me where you found me, send me a bio of your character plus a picture (no knot! Humanoid cocks only) and your kinks. If you freaking message me saying only \"hi\" and that's it. Nothing else, I'm fucking blocking you. I have rules that you need to follow. I didn't just write all this cause I didn't want people to not read it.\n\nTelegram: BishieLover1738. There's also a password, so you better read before you message me. ",

            "selftext": "Hello there, lately I've been in the mood for some MLP themed fun! Mostly looking for MxF, real gender doesn't really concern me so long as you're willing to play females!\n\nOf course the characters involved will be over 18\n\nAnd honestly we can do this anyway you want. Feral, anthro, characters in the style of Equestria Girls? I'm fine with any!\n\nThe main idea though is that I'd like to play a human male who wakes up one day and finds himself lost in the magical world. We can work from there, but he'd naturally be mating with characters from the show.  \n\n\nWhich brings up my next point, there are some specific characters I want included. You're free to suggest additions though! Candence, Starlight Glimmer, Rarity, Apple Jack, Rainbow Dash, and Celestia are at the top of the list.\n\nAnyways I think that's about everything I have to say, if you have any questions or are interested then please feel free to send me a message!",
