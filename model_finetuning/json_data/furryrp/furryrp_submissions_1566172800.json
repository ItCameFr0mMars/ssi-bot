            "selftext": "I looked at the check placed before me, and again counted the zeroes as my eyes went wide. \u201cHoly shit\u201d I blurted out \u201cThis is...\u201d My statement was cut short by a man in his 50s, his accent distinct yet I couldn\u2019t place its origin. \u201cMr. Thompson, this is the sum we are willing to offer you for your participation in the project, subject to its successful completion.\u201d\n\nSuccessful completion. Right. It had been several months ago where I had received a phone call from what I thought was a prospective employer. The lab I was currently in was working with the government on various tests and research studies, explaining the volume upon volume of documentation I needed to review and sign over. When contacted originally, I had agree to take part in a few smaller studies on the social sciences, and an occasional screening on my health.\n\nIt was almost a part time job in itself, paying decently and the medical studies allowing me to practically have full medical coverage. All of it seemingly benign and uninteresting. That is until my being chosen to take part in Project Noah.\n\nProject Noah was a classified experiment that was attempting to bridge the gap between human and animal, to create a new form of life. The researchers had discovered that it was fully possible for a human to mate with an animal to create a hybrid. One that would be studied of course and be the first of what was planned to be a new generation.\n\nI had no clue what purpose this was for in the least. As I sat in the well-furnished office looking at the check offered to me, a woman, early 40s and with a distinct British accent spoke \u201cMr. Thompson, we understand your concerns and the moral struggle you are having right now. Please be aware that you were selected for Project Noah due to the results from the previous studies you took part in.\u201d\n\nI shook my head again as I looked at both of them. \u201cSo let me get this straight, you\u2019re expecting me to have sex with an animal and get them pregnant. That\u2019s just...\u201d The man then spoke again. \u201cSubject LZ-4325 is much more human than animal. She has developed an intellect beyond what we would imagine.\u201d\n\nI looked back at the check again then to the officials \u201cOk, what if she does not WANT to mate with me? I\u2019m not going to just force myself on her now.\u201d The woman spoke \u201cNo and we would not expect nor want you to. Part of the project will involve your interactions with her, to see how she will respond to a suitor for the first time.\u201d She smiled \u201cConsider it a courtship if you will before you and her attempt to procreate.\u201d\n\nI looked back at the check again and sighed. Grabbing a pen I signed my name to it. \u201cWell then. For the future of humanity. Whatever it may be.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014 I\u2019m looking for a partner who is willing to play the role of the other subject in the project. Your character in this is what you wish, feel free to create her as you see fit.\n\nKinks: Seduction, cross-species play, impregnating, oral, anal, breast play\n\nLimits: Toilet, blood, heavy BDSM, dom/sub",

            "selftext": "Rei and I had been friends for as long as I could remember. We were both born on the same day, grew up in the same neighborhood, went to the same school, and were basically sisters as far as anybody was concerned. So whenever she told me she was pregnant, I was shocked and was jealous, I mean we were only recent graduates from highschool and were both taking a gap year, so while she could\u2019ve gotten knocked up safely, I didn\u2019t think she had it in her! Once I found out, baby fever started hitting me hard and I accidentally let it slip to her that I wanted a baby as well. She asked me what I\u2019d do to be knocked up and I foolishly answered \u201canything.\u201d She grabbed my hand and pulled me upstairs, to her brothers room.\n\n\n\n\nShe opened the door and her brother stood up, he was a few years older than us, 21 to our 18, but I was still a distant friend to him. \u201cAlright, here\u2019s my brother, Zen, he\u2019s like me, but single and hopeless.\u201d She said, smiling, rubbing her bump up against my back. \u201cHey!\u201d Zen said, clearly embarrassed at being intruded on. \u201cZen, this is Kat, she really needs to get pregnant.\u201d She said, I blushed, my heart raced faster with adrenaline. \u201cI\u2019ll go to your place and pack you a suitcase Kat, you can have the room down the hall... you\u2019ll look so cute when you\u2019re knocked up!\u201d She waddles out with her 6 month belly and shuts the door, leaving me and Zen alone. I back against the wall and blush furiously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey all! I\u2019ve been wanting to do this RP for a while but finally worked up the desire to post it. Rei and Zen are wolf anthros and I\u2019m a spotted Leopard anthro\n\nTo prove you\u2019ve read this far put \u201cyou will never reach the truth\u201d somewhere in your reply!",

I\u2019m looking for longterm roleplays. \nIn means of length I\u2019m very open. I prefer to only write my character and you yours, therefore 2-3 paragraphs should be the maximum length. I don\u2019t like single sentence responses  either. \n\nMy OC is Arch, a European red fox. He is quite strong, broad and tall... different from most other foxes.\n\nFor scenarios I have two completely different ones in mind:\n\n1. Bar: I visit a bar on vacation. You are the barkeeper. At the beginning I\u2019m not very social, but through conversation and alcohol this changes. Maybe we click and who knows what is going to happen ;-)\n\n2. The great city of Rome: this one is much more open then the first one. I would be a conquerer who just have come back from war. I got paid well for my victory. Who are you? A casual pedestrian, daughter of a rich man, an employee at the thermae or just a seller at the forum?\n\nI\u2019m looking forward hearing from you one or two who will like this post and get into detail!\nI usually play on Reddit pm, but could move to telegram or discord.",
