I prefer to be dom, so if you\u2019re a sub and like being told what to do, you\u2019ll get priority~ But, I also like to do romantic scenes without dom/sub as well\n\nAs for who I\u2019m looking for, all genders/species can shoot me a message. I highly prefer females over everything else. If you\u2019re a male, preference highly goes to sub femboys. Herms/futas are just as fine as well\n\nI\u2019m looking for either short or long term or a one time thing, up to you. Feel free to send any plot/story/scenario ideas you have and I\u2019ll probably go along with them. \nModern, sci fi, fantasy, could be anything. \nI like to roleplay a wide range of scenarios, from master/slave to a romantic couple to strangers doing a hookup, so don\u2019t be shy! I\u2019m open to anything, Dom/Sub not necessary \n\nFavorite kinks: pet/master, creampies, deepthroat, oral sex, breast play, begging, moaning, kissing, dirty talking, choking, cuddling, facefucking, cock worship, teasing, size difference, light bondage, incest (none necessary)\n\nAlso perfectly fine with anything vanilla\n\nLimits: blood, scat, urine, vore, gore, feet (don\u2019t want to do anything with these at all)\n\nMy kik/telegram is Dagaranth22, send your kinks, limits, a reference and perhaps story ideas, please don\u2019t only send \u201chi I saw your post\u201d. Also have discord but would rather not use that\n\nIf we were messaging before then feel free to message again! I just took a break and am back now",

That being said, let\u2019s fuck!\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am a male, and though I can be dominant, I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human (and scalies are pretty great).\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI much prefer plot development over sex.\n\nNow the plot: \n\nThese will all take place in a world where humans and Anthros coexist unless stated otherwise.\n\n1. Research: I\u2019ve been researching fake gills! The ability for humans to breathe underwater. I\u2019m conducting my research at a hidden beach where your kind usually frequent. They really aren\u2019t happy with me being here, but don\u2019t intervene as they must decide what to do. On the day my invention works, you strike (I\u2019d like to not know your plans, but we can discuss).\n\n2. Rulebreaker: As a bit of a rule, this is a beach where humans are not allowed. But I\u2019m a bit new and didn\u2019t know, so I end up stumbling by anyway. How do you deal with a rule breaker?\n\n3. Island: I am a shipwreck on your hidden island. I land on a beach considered cursed, and once you find me your tribe must decide what a cursed human is good for. Will there be trials? Slavery? Coexistence?\n\n4. Trespassing: The beach seems to be too close to a military base for comfort, but they all know to stay away. Until I\u2019m sort of hiding out of fear a bit too close. You, out on patrol, get the alarm and find me cowering on military property.\n\n5. Your Ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Big cock humiliation\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

I am actually in the mood for an rp filled with angst, romance, self-healing. \n\nI have been role playing for a while now, a couple of years give or take. I am an advanced role player, a writer and I am looking for people who can rp a lot but can make a story with me as well.\n\n**it would also be awesome if you could introduce yourself. Like who your character is(a small bio would be awesome. A pic of your character would be cool too!), how long you\u2019ve been doing, where you found me.**\n\nI write novel/book style, about 3-4 paragraphs(two if i can\u2019t think of anything) and I like to make the world and characters come to life! **third person only** I also write in past tense and I don\u2019t really like when people write \u201cshe would walk over to the door and open it\u201d it just sounds odd to me and I don\u2019t really like it. \n\nSetting: slice of life.\n\nPlot: Raven has gotten her heart broken too many times to count. People in her life that she loved, left her. Her trust is broken and she doesn\u2019t think she could ever love or trust another person again. Until you come along. Can you show her that it is okay to trust again? To be loved once more?\n\nThis is a starter I did hopefully you can continue from it?

            "selftext": "Let me start by saying this totally doesn\u2019t need to be smut at all, we can have a normal romance thing, you can also just be one person, I don\u2019t mind. That being said, let\u2019s fuck!\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am a male, and though I can be dominant, I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human (and scalies are pretty great).\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI much prefer plot development over sex.\n\nNow the plot: \n\nThese will all take place in a world where humans and Anthros coexist unless stated otherwise.\n\n1. Research: I\u2019ve been researching fake gills! The ability for humans to breathe underwater. I\u2019m conducting my research at a hidden beach where your kind usually frequent. They really aren\u2019t happy with me being here, but don\u2019t intervene as they must decide what to do. On the day my invention works, you strike (I\u2019d like to not know your plans, but we can discuss).\n\n2. Rulebreaker: As a bit of a rule, this is a beach where humans are not allowed. But I\u2019m a bit new and didn\u2019t know, so I end up stumbling by anyway. How do you deal with a rule breaker?\n\n3. Island: I am a shipwreck on your hidden island. I land on a beach considered cursed, and once you find me your tribe must decide what a cursed human is good for. Will there be trials? Slavery? Coexistence?\n\n4. Trespassing: The beach seems to be too close to a military base for comfort, but they all know to stay away. Until I\u2019m sort of hiding out of fear a bit too close. You, out on patrol, get the alarm and find me cowering on military property.\n\n5. Dare: I lose a bet and have to go to the beach, fully nude, and run a lap across the coast. Though they aren\u2019t really laughing once they see what I\u2019m packing, I\u2019m very embarrassed about my body and try to go quick. Hopefully I\u2019m not kidnapped or arrested before I can make it back.\n\n6. Your Ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Big cock humiliation\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

That being said, let\u2019s fuck!\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale.\n\nNow here\u2019s my strange plot:\n\nI am supposed to be the new ruler of a kingdom. Fame, power, money, slaves, all the benefits of being a mighty lord who can make the mightiest giant kneel in fear. Every other lord has been cruel and dominant, amassing an army and using slaves as they see fit.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem. I am not cruel. I consider myself a submissive top at best. I have no idea how I had been chosen to become this powerful lord. But I am afraid that I will be beheaded or worse if I am known to be kind, so I must act like I am a demon.\n\nA few ideas:\n-An ancient kingdom, rising up to power in a modern day, has elected me as a king just for finding and awakening them.\n\n-The previous lord of hell chose me for reasons none can understand. (Bonus points if you can play as one or all of the seven deadly sins as my \u201cGenerals\u201d.)\n\n-Some other third thing. Your choice.\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Big cock humiliation\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "Heya!\n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast, and I'm 19! I'm looking for someone literate to RP with, no one liners but other than that I'm pretty easy going, though a tad picky at points so be warned. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nWhat I'm looking for may sound strange to some but it's something I adore and is needed for me to really enjoy an RP. I love smaller and average sized cocks with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then, unless you want to do growth, then we can do that. anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me. my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. he prefers to let his partner take the lead as long as he gets to stick his cock in something, or grind it against some soft ass or tit fat, which he usually prefers, I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling, I like excessive cum but prefer normal size loads to go with the average sized cock my sona has, although if you want gallons of cum too that is fine but not preferred. My Sona's cock is 5.3 inches with a width of about 2 inches, just to put that up front.\n\nFor your characters I'm cool with almost any species aside from some really strange one like insects or primates, unless you can make them look very cute and voluptuous, then it's a maybe, just show me what you have and we can work from there! I'd also like it if you could play more than one character, I love getting smothered by multiple caring people, but it's not a must, if you want to play just one then that's fine as well! If you are interested I should note I have lots of kinks other than this but these are more optional and just to help with making things more lewd and having more ideas and such. I'll list those in a moment but first I would like to point out that I prefer if you can play multiple characters at once since I think that is super hot, but again that isn't needed and one on one stuff is fine.And if you do play multiple characters or even just one, please have a reference image ready for them, I like being about to see what I am getting my hands on heh\n\nA few ideas could be either something to do with your character being some sore of authority figure that takes a liking to my sona, like a teacher or a cop, something of that sort. if not that maybe our characters could mean someplace that they have a shared interested at, something like a convention or a museum. but I'd really like it if you could come up with the plot mainly! as long as it has most of what I'm asking for I'm sure I'll love it! And if you know about Mervas, or would like to, we can talk about doing that, of course you'd be GMing the world if we do it so keep that in mind\n\nI am looking for highly detailed and almost always lewd RP, not a whole lot of story, and if there is there needs to be lots of describing of your character's assets bouncing and jiggling around. aside from that, no one liners, if you do one liners I'm going to start putting much less effort into the RP and take much longer to respond, so keep that in mind. to make sure you understand all this and have read it all when you first message me say \"hello there tiny boy\", then you can go into detail about what you want to do with me, what your character(s) is/are like and we can go from there! If you dont type this you will probably be ignored\n\nAnyways, a few kinks I like are the following:   \nNon-Existence/Time stop  \n Watersports   \nHyper Breasts/Ass   \nBustyboys   \nCosplay/Girly outfits   \nTwerking/Dancing/Just anything that makes them ass and tits bounce and jiggle around, should be in just about every message tbh   \nFerals   \nPopular characters (still animals, or animal versions of characters, preferably ones I know)  \n and Lactation\n\nFor more detail, my bio, and reference pictures please see my F-list:\u00a0[https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog)\n\nIf you are interested, great! I can't wait to meet you! Feel free to hit me up at\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \n Telegram: u/DanTheCzechWolfDog   \nOr just PM me!",

As the titles suggests I\u2019m looking for a long term and story driven breeding roleplay where I play with someone who is at least semi-detailed and semi-literate. If I find out you are a One Liner once we start the RP it will instantly end the RP and I will stop talking to you. I apologize if that seems harsh but only typing one line of text is really lazy in my eyes and will not be tolerated. \n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, there are a number of plots that we can do that we can discuss in more detail once we are messaging on Kik, but a few ideas I have include: \n\n- Daddy/Daughter \n\n- Teacher/Student\n\n-Step-Mom or Mom/Son or Sons best friends \n\n-Sugar Daddy/Stripper, Escort, employee\n\n-Bride or groom/best man or maid of honor\n\nJust to name a few. Ask for my Kinks and Limits: \n\n\nKinks: blowjobs, blowjobs in public, being called daddy, when women wear heels (not stepping on my balls stuff...I just find it super sexy when women wear heels), breeding, knotting, public sex, shower sex (there\u2019s more but that\u2019s just off the top of my head.\n\nLimits: Limits: Scat, Vore, Gore, Toilet Play, Vomit, Foot Play. Anything Gross\n\nWhen you message me please include a ref for your character, name, age, a description of said character as well as your own kinks and limits \n\nI\u2019m excited and look forward to hearing from you.

            "selftext": "**Prompt will be open for several hours from being posted!**\n\nHello! It's been a while since I did a rule34 roleplay now, and I'd like to do something focusing on the 18+ aged Final Fantasy girls, mainly from FF10! \n\nFor this scenario, I'd like you to play as Kimahri from FF10, though as a slightly more horny and kinky version, with an already established sexual relationship with the girls. It's not something anyone else knows about though. During the adventure, he'd take the girls aside, one at a time at different locations, to have some fun! The girls are of course very open to get fucked by a big strong beast like him :)\n\nThis scenario could work with different scenes through the roleplay, for some variation. Overall, I want this roleplay to be funa nd light hearted, leaving out serious themes like dark themes, dominance, violence, death. I also prefer it to be about sex, and not love relations, kissing etc. \n\nI'd love to try a role switch and play Kimahri as well if you're into that, for some variation :)\n\n* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, anthro animal, clothed sex, slower sex, sneaking around\n* **Limits:**Toilet stuff, impregnation, violence, romance, male anal, exhibition, rough sex\n\nSo, if you're into this roleplay, please send me a response in a PM **(I don't use the chat!)** and let me know your thoughts on this idea :) To give me a better idea of what you're into, please let me know the responses to the following questions as well:\n\n* Your thoughts on the idea\n* Your kinks\n* Your limits\n* Some of your favourite FF girls\n* If you're open to switch roles as well, with me as Kimahri\n\nHope to hear back from you! And please, don't send me any one liner responses or very low effort ones. I don't expect any walls of text, but please at least show me you've read the prompt and answered the things above :) Also, please don't try to jump straight in, as I want to discuss some ideas before starting.\n\n*Love, Emelie*",

            "selftext": "*\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"*\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to many different suggestions, but it depends on what it is, of course. Don't be afraid to ask, though.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Shy Character** \\- My character, Jack Foxtrot, is a shy kind of person, but once you get to know him he really is special. Basically, I'm kind of a dork/klutz, but not in a bad way. My character is the sort of \"just be yourself\" kinda guy.\n   * Jack Foxtrot's never dated anyone before, having been single all his life, including high school. Even got picked on for just being himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. So if you need my info I'll give it. Also recently just got a Telegram! (yay)\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these.",

I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Shy Character** \\- My character, Jack Foxtrot, is a shy kind of person, but once you get to know him he really is special. Basically, I'm kind of a dork/klutz, but not in a bad way. My character is the sort of \"just be yourself\" kinda guy.\n   * Jack Foxtrot's never dated anyone before, having been single all his life, including high school. Even got picked on for just being himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. So if you need my info I'll give it. Also recently just got a Telegram! (yay)\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **@mrwallace888** on Telegram.\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these.",

            "selftext": "(Originally just an all-girl plot. A bit of editing has been done.)\n\nLet me start by saying this totally doesn\u2019t need to be smut at all, we can have a normal romance thing, you can also just be one person, I don\u2019t mind. That being said, let\u2019s fuck!\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI much prefer plot development over sex.\n\nNow the actual story:\n\nI had decided to go find a school somewhere where I can live on campus and have an easier time. My friends didn\u2019t want me to leave, so as I was sending out applications to literally everywhere, they would take them and change my species, so the academies thought I was a liar and reject it. And it worked! All of them rejected me, except for one...\n\nHetfield Academy was a school made for extraspecies, mostly so they feel safe and able to learn about humans without ridicule. The newest headmistress, upon learning that I was actually a human, thought it would be a good experiment to see how everyone react to a human student. So she accepted me.\n\nThe specifics of the rp is for the rp itself, but what I am hoping for is to get more of a big romance story than just a big orgy. Too many sex scenes and not enough breaks will leave me burnt out. \n\nYou can play students, teachers, the headmistress, anyone. It\u2019s obvious I won\u2019t fit in right away. Maybe there can be a bit of a love triangle with the school bully and a kind kobold. Maybe a few of the students become Yandere. Maybe some of the kind, helpful teachers have ulterior motives. Maybe some of the Muscular scalies and tall toned teachers spot my weakling body. I\u2019m fine with any of your ideas! Or ask me for mine!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale or we can dm here.\n\nMy kinks: Tongues, body licking, long tongues, multiple tongues, anything with oral, Muscular/toned girls, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, big cock humiliation\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked",

I am a (very hung) man who has shipwrecked on a small island somewhere in the middle of the pacific.

Now to your tribe, you have learned that the southern and eastern beaches are where evil comes from, which is why I hadn\u2019t been found yet. But once I set foot in the jungle, I can be easily caught and brought to your village for judgement from your leader. Since I came from the south and I am clearly not a giant warrior woman. (I have judgements if you need options)\n\n2. I have somehow made it to an all-anthro exclusive school. The headmistress wanted to experiment how a male would do in this school. One of the requirements is that I join a club. And while I am not particularly strong, some of the more athletic clubs have got their eyes on me, if not for work-outs, then just a boy who can admire them. Like a fan club.\n\n3. Something in my life has been slowly turning friends, family, lots of people into big Amazon women. Some retain their kind nature, some get a bit more aggressive, but a lot of them have their eyes set on me for one reason or another. Can I survive? \n\n4. On an adventure, set to stop a mad tyrant, I meet a barbarian at a tavern. We end up partnering up on the same quest. Along the way our party grows, both in numbers and in size. At first it could have been that slaying monsters is a good work out, but I don\u2019t seem to change all that much. Is it a curse? \n\n5.

            "selftext": "I'm looking for extremely effeminate, girly anthros of all shapes and sizes who are deeply submissive. The kind of partner that doesn't at all mind dressing up, wearing make-up, and acting as girly and feminine as possible. Who is willing to be completely subservient and let me have my way with them. Who won't care if I ruin their make-up or outfit or hair as I force them beneath me and throatfuck them like the dirty little whore they are. Who will scream and beg and moan like a total, wanton slut as I ram their tight, little ass so hard they'll have trouble sitting comfortably the next day. Who lives to serve a superior male and drain my cock of every drop of cum like it was their job. Who won't mind one bit if I call then awful names, yank their hair, bite them, slap them, spank them, spit on them, tie them up, and otherwise use, abuse, degrade, and humiliate them to my heart's content.\n\nDoes this sound like you? If so, then I very much want to arrange a playdate with you. Send me a message, give me a description or a picture of what your girly looking boyslut looks like, and tell me your favorite position to be fucked in.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon~",

My character is a 26/F/Orca (I can change species, which is fine if we want to try something different) and as by my title, I am looking for dominant males. By dominant, I mean males who will rip her clothes off and fuck her into a broken drooling mess with her snatch and ass spurting out the males thick hot musky cum. (Bit of a slut). Males that treat her like nothing more than a place to empty their balls into, whether that be her two holes or throat, and I especially enjoy males who are good at dirty talking/degradation. Maybe even getting her heavily pregnant, depending on your kinks. I do have a preference for males whose characters are chubby but that is optional, just nothing too thin or lean. NO underaged, and please be literate and post well, I like good chunk posts to read and respond to, makes it a lot more fun. Message me for my Kik. I also use telegram and discord.",
