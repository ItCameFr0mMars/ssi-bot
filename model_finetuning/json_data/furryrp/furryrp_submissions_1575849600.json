The only thing I won't do is underage, I'm *really* not into it. This can either be short or long term depending on how well we work together.

            "selftext": " \n\nHeya!\n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast, and I'm 19! I'm looking for someone literate to RP with, no one liners but other than that I'm pretty easy going, though a tad picky at points so be warned. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nWhat I'm looking for may sound strange to some but it's something I adore and is needed for me to really enjoy an RP. I love smaller and average sized cocks with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then, unless you want to do growth, then we can do that. anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me. my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. he prefers to let his partner take the lead as long as he gets to stick his cock in something, or grind it against some soft ass or tit fat, which he usually prefers, I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling, I like excessive cum but prefer normal size loads to go with the average sized cock my sona has, although if you want gallons of cum too that is fine but not preferred. My Sona's cock is 5.3 inches with a width of about 2 inches, just to put that up front.\n\nFor your characters I'm cool with almost any species aside from some really strange one like insects or primates, unless you can make them look very cute and voluptuous, then it's a maybe, just show me what you have and we can work from there! I'd also like it if you could play more than one character, I love getting smothered by multiple caring people, but it's not a must, if you want to play just one then that's fine as well! If you are interested I should note I have lots of kinks other than this but these are more optional and just to help with making things more lewd and having more ideas and such. I'll list those in a moment but first I would like to point out that I prefer if you can play multiple characters at once since I think that is super hot, but again that isn't needed and one on one stuff is fine.And if you do play multiple characters or even just one, please have a reference image ready for them, I like being about to see what I am getting my hands on heh\n\nA few ideas could be either something to do with your character being some sore of authority figure that takes a liking to my sona, like a teacher or a cop, something of that sort. if not that maybe our characters could mean someplace that they have a shared interested at, something like a convention or a museum. but I'd really like it if you could come up with the plot mainly! as long as it has most of what I'm asking for I'm sure I'll love it! And if you know about Mervas, or would like to, we can talk about doing that, of course you'd be GMing the world if we do it so keep that in mind\n\nI am looking for highly detailed and almost always lewd RP, not a whole lot of story, and if there is there needs to be lots of describing of your character's assets bouncing and jiggling around. aside from that, no one liners, if you do one liners I'm going to start putting much less effort into the RP and take much longer to respond, so keep that in mind. to make sure you understand all this and have read it all when you first message me say \"hello there tiny boy\", then you can go into detail about what you want to do with me, what your character(s) is/are like and we can go from there! If you dont type this you will probably be ignored\n\nAnyways, a few kinks I like are the following:  \nNon-Existence/Time stop  \nWatersports  \nHyper Breasts/Ass  \nBustyboys  \nCosplay/Girly outfits  \nTwerking/Dancing/Just anything that makes them ass and tits bounce and jiggle around, should be in just about every message tbh  \nFerals  \nPopular characters (still animals, or animal versions of characters, preferably ones I know)  \nand Lactation\n\nFor more detail, my bio, and reference pictures please see my F-list:\u00a0[https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog)\n\nIf you are interested, great! I can't wait to meet you! Feel free to hit me up at\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": " \n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast, and I'm 19! I'm looking for someone literate to RP with, no one liners but other than that I'm pretty easy going, though a tad picky at points so be warned. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nWhat I'm looking for may sound strange to some but it's something I adore and is needed for me to really enjoy an RP. I love smaller and average sized cocks with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then, unless you want to do growth, then we can do that. anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me. my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. he prefers to let his partner take the lead as long as he gets to stick his cock in something, or grind it against some soft ass or tit fat, which he usually prefers, I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling, I like excessive cum but prefer normal size loads to go with the average sized cock my sona has, although if you want gallons of cum too that is fine but not preferred. My Sona's cock is 5.3 inches with a width of about 2 inches, just to put that up front.\n\nI'm looking for one of two thinking, One  \nI want something who I can RP with daily, mainly from around 8 AM to the latest you can go, EST. For these RP they can just be fairly simple ones, lots of smothering, breastfeeding, teasing, dressing up, stripping. etc. mostly one on one, but if you play more than one character that's just better. I want this to be a mostly constant thing but we can take breaks for days if stuff comes up. as well as that I would like that most days you play different characters, they don't have to be characters you own, they could be canon ones, or other characters, such as pokemon, switch dog, start fox, and other such characters, all of which could be male or female, but all need to be very, almost hyper thick.\n\nThe other is also Daily, but instead will be on-going. Basically I want an RP where I can go around in some world that you control, people and all that I can mess around with to no limit, fuck whoever, ruin whatever, just go wild. No limits to kinks or anything, of you want to have an actual character you could join me as like a helper, but I'm super selfish so stuff is about me, if you couldn't tell already by this AD. This could be done with a few different ways, universal acceptance, time stop, non existence, and Mervas, we can go over each of these options in more detail when you message me, which I hope you do.\n\nif these interest you please contact me at one of the following links, and check out my F-list as well for a list of my kinks and more about my character:  \nF-list:\u00a0[https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog)\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": "Hey there!! I'm looking for a casual semi-literate (AT LEAST 2 lines of a reply) RP partner for any scenarios you would like! I have some options I can share in DM if you're interested, so why not shoot one my way? &lt;3\n\nIf you *are* interested, DM me showing a character ref (a detailed text form describing the character is fine too), what species, gender your character's name (or if you prefer another name like Daddy or Sir or any other name you like is fine too ;p we can get to that in RP), and your kinks! Preferably your kinks mostly match mine. Fast replies are not necessary as I know I can be bad with replying quickly on occasion (no more than an hour if I'm not busy), but please do not simply never reply. I will send you my discord if you are interested!\n\n**What I'm looking for in a partner:** *You can be any species, any gender (preferably male, but females willing to fuck this fox is also welcome &lt;3), any age (as long as you're and your character are above 18 and no older than 40), and into anything you want! My only hard limits on RPing kinks is scat, feet, fisting and vomit. Anything else should be okay (unless I forgot and I will tell you!)*\n\n**My character that I'll be using:** Image will be linked in DM if you are interested and send everything I said above, her name is Pepper and she is a fox furry. Not much else to be said there lol, but she likes parties, camping, summer, and sex.\n\n**Kinks:** breeding, knotting, hyper (cock/**balls**/both), macro/macro (no micro), **pissing (could be on someone, in someone, or just normal urination)**, lactation (in specific RP scenarios), gangbangs (if you want to play multiple characters), **excessive cum**, public, feral on anthro, surprise sex in front of an audience.\n\n**\\*bolded kinks are big ones I'm looking for my partner to like as well**\n\nWe can always do multiple RPs once one goes dry or we finish with it, and I'd love to explore more ideas and scenarios with you!\n\nHope to hear from somebody soon &lt;3",

My fiance, for instance, has made it clear he's not the sharing type. And before you start, no he isn't a \"well as long as it's with a girl\" kind of guy, I'm his entirely.\n\nStill, despite his stance seemingly covering all the bases, he can't help but have blind spots. As far as he knows I'm completely straight.\n\nIn this world, humans and anthros exist along side each other with a strained relationship. It's extremely taboo for anything romantic or sexual to occur between the two, removing even less suspicion from you. So when you came into my life, a young and seemingly sweet girl, he never saw you coming.\n\n____\n\nIf you're interested, PM me.

            "selftext": "Here is the dealio! I am a male, a submissive top because I like to take orders and be less aggressive but I don\u2019t like it up the butt.\n\nYou can be female or futa, even male, as long as you are a power bottom. And you can play one member of the tribe, a few members, the whole tribe, I don\u2019t mind!\n\nYour species also doesn\u2019t matter. I would love buff shark women just as much as buff human women.\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over just sex.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale \n\nThe plot:\n\nI am a (very hung) man who has shipwrecked on a small island somewhere in the middle of the pacific. After about a week of staying on the eastern beach and fishing, I decide to go into the jungle to get some different food and better-filtered water. I still have guns, so that really helps.\n\nNow to your tribe, you have learned that the southern and eastern beaches are where evil comes from, which is why I hadn\u2019t been found yet. But once I set foot in the jungle, I can be easily caught and brought to your village for judgement from your leader. Since I came from the south and I am clearly not a giant warrior woman.\n\nNow here\u2019s a few choices for your leader to determine:\n\n1. If I need anything from the tribe, I must complete a set of trials to determine life or death. By surviving, I become an honorary part of the tribe. Failure is death. I am to stay in a very public jail cell between each trial.\n\n2. I am immediately deemed as a slave worker. I must go around the tribe and do whatever the village asks of me, or death is sure to follow. On the bright side, I get my own hut. And maybe there are a couple who do not wish to see me slaved.\n\n3. I am seen as a sign of god and am to be treated as such. I am basically your god\u2019s messenger and you want me to bring good word of your tribe to them. The downside is I must sleep in a cave outside of the village, and there are some skeptics...\n\n4. I am absolutely the first male ever seen. As such, I am to be studied. I am given to the tribe\u2019s most scientific members (be it real science or just witch doctor stuff) to partake in any experiments or examinations. At least I get a bed in their place.\n\n5. Anything else you can think of.\n\nMost people miss the important bits of this plot, that being that I come from the cursed beach. There should be some hesitation, some controversy in the tribe. I don\u2019t want to just be found in the forest and fucked. Gimme some plot!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale.\n\nMy kinks: muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long tongues, Multiple tongues, monster girl, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, big cock humiliation\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "I had been given the traditional hero's farewell, dinner the night before in my order, the countless number of platitudes offered in my name, the endless amount of well wishes, and so on and so on.\n\nTruth is I didn't want it. The dinner, praises in my name, songs from the bard about my gallant bravery. It was all a big hoax.\n\nI was chosen as \"one of the best and bravest\" men of the village to climb to the peak of Mt. Anemulis and slay the dragon that has caused havoc within our small village's walls...except I know that wasn't true. None of it was.\n\nOh sure, there was a dragon on the mountain top, everyone had seen it. But the \"damage\" the \"havoc\", no this was done by man. You see, the elder leaders knew of the dragon's hoard. That is what they were after, and sent the \"best and the bravest\" to slay the \"foul beast\" to bring peace to our land...and pocket a little coin in the process.\n\nSo, why me? Why am I going? It's simple, I was chosen. I was the unfortunate bastard who was unlucky enough to have his name pulled from the \"Tome of Decision\". Never mind the fact I'm far from a knight, I'm a blacksmith. I fix swords and axes, not use them in battle. However at 6'0\", about 200 lbs and a good amount of muscle from my work, the town believes I'm their best choice...this month.\n\nIt takes two days, but I make my way towards the peak, the skeletons of the poor fools that came before me strewn amongst the landscape, their weapons and armor weather beaten and rusting. Finally, after what feels like an eternity I reach the mouth of the cave.\n\nI've already accepted my fate in this. Within moments I'll be charred than devoured. I step into the cave look around and find nothing. Taking a tentative step forward I then see it....blue with black tipped scales, a line of yellow scales along the long thin neck, the body thin as well, two long horns at the top.\n\n(https://i.imgur.com/L5nvD1m.jpg)\n\nI stop for a moment and realize that this... was a dragoness. They sent me to kill a female dragon, rare as they were. From the looks of the lair, one that was alone.\n\nThen it happens. One topaz-colored eye opens and is staring right at me. \"Welcome to my lair little one\" I hear it say in what can only be called a growl.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nWeeks pass by, as the village goes about it business. A new blacksmith currently serves the orders of the villagers, and in the far corner of the village, a newer white runestone marks the passing of the old blacksmith. The villagers have not tried to slay the dragon since, as the chaos it wrecked has stopped. Coincidentally the chaos stopped as the elders were driven from their place, as the villagers saw one attempting to light fire to one of the haystack outside the village walls. All assume the dragon was slayed by the brave blacksmith that never returned.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nYawning I open my eyes as light streams into the deep mountain cave. I run a hand over the scaled wing blanketing me and nuzzle the yellow scaled neck. \"You snore\" I say smiling kissing my beloved....dragoness.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nSo how did we get here? What caused this blacksmith brought to slay the dragon, and the dragoness who's lair he invaded to end up as lovers. Where did the romance begin?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nAs you can see I'm looking for a partner to play the part of the dragoness, and a romance between the two to develop. I would like to stay away from the obvious Dom/sub dynamic this would have, this would become mutual love affair between two beings that never would elsewise.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHeya!\n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast, and I'm 19! I'm looking for someone literate to RP with, no one liners but other than that I'm pretty easy going, though a tad picky at points so be warned. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nWhat I'm looking for may sound strange to some but it's something I adore and is needed for me to really enjoy an RP. I love smaller and average sized cocks with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then, unless you want to do growth, then we can do that. anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me. my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. he prefers to let his partner take the lead as long as he gets to stick his cock in something, or grind it against some soft ass or tit fat, which he usually prefers, I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling, I like excessive cum but prefer normal size loads to go with the average sized cock my sona has, although if you want gallons of cum too that is fine but not preferred. My Sona's cock is 5.3 inches with a width of about 2 inches, just to put that up front.\n\nFor your characters I'm cool with almost any species aside from some really strange one like insects or primates, unless you can make them look very cute and voluptuous, then it's a maybe, just show me what you have and we can work from there! I'd also like it if you could play more than one character, I love getting smothered by multiple caring people, but it's not a must, if you want to play just one then that's fine as well! If you are interested I should note I have lots of kinks other than this but these are more optional and just to help with making things more lewd and having more ideas and such. I'll list those in a moment but first I would like to point out that I prefer if you can play multiple characters at once since I think that is super hot, but again that isn't needed and one on one stuff is fine.And if you do play multiple characters or even just one, please have a reference image ready for them, I like being about to see what I am getting my hands on heh\n\nA few ideas could be either something to do with your character being some sore of authority figure that takes a liking to my sona, like a teacher or a cop, something of that sort. if not that maybe our characters could mean someplace that they have a shared interested at, something like a convention or a museum. but I'd really like it if you could come up with the plot mainly! as long as it has most of what I'm asking for I'm sure I'll love it! And if you know about Mervas, or would like to, we can talk about doing that, of course you'd be GMing the world if we do it so keep that in mind. I'd really like you to GM a world I can do anything with, it doesn't have to be Mervas but I'd like it to be, and I'd be happy to explain Mervas to you and what I want from it if you are interested\n\nI am looking for highly detailed and almost always lewd RP, not a whole lot of story, and if there is there needs to be lots of describing of your character's assets bouncing and jiggling around. aside from that, no one liners, if you do one liners I'm going to start putting much less effort into the RP and take much longer to respond, so keep that in mind. to make sure you understand all this and have read it all when you first message me say \"hello there tiny boy\", then you can go into detail about what you want to do with me, what your character(s) is/are like and we can go from there! If you dont type this you will probably be ignored\n\nAnyways, a few kinks I like are the following:  \nNon-Existence/Time stop  \nWatersports  \nHyper Breasts/Ass  \nBustyboys  \nCosplay/Girly outfits  \nTwerking/Dancing/Just anything that makes them ass and tits bounce and jiggle around, should be in just about every message tbh  \nFerals  \nPopular characters (still animals, or animal versions of characters, preferably ones I know)  \nand Lactation\n\nFor more detail, my bio, and reference pictures please see my F-list:\u00a0[https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog)\n\nIf you are interested, great! I can't wait to meet you! Feel free to hit me up at\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": "Solitude is frightening for most, and with good reason. Humans are social animals, we inherently crave community. We gravitate towards each other, building our cities tall to accommodate more of us, shoving houses onto every square inch of land to create a plethora of neighborhoods. I'm no different than the rest, I love my friends, my family, I'm even engaged to a lovely man. Just, every now and then, I crave something simpler.\n\nThis is why I'm shivering in a sleeping bag right now, alone in the woods with no one around for miles. And though the cold is harsher than I expected, there is a kind of peace to it all. Though I can't see the clear night sky from the inside of my tent, I know the stars are right above me. The sounds of nighttime animals doing their thing surrounds me, slowly lulling me to sleep.\n\nI've only been out here for about a day, I planned to stay for roughly a week or so being going back to it all. And true, a 24 year old woman on her own in the woods wasn't the smartest idea, but I wasn't completely unprepared. A rifle rested on the ground next to me, a birthday present from my father so many years ago. I had enough food to last me, but if the opportunity to hunt something came up I'd be prepared. And if something with the intent of hunting me came about, my grandfather's old .357 would take care of that. Sam, my fiance, was surprised when he saw me packing it. I just laughed, spout off some line about preferring to be safe then sorry.\n\nHe wasn't the most comfortable with the trip. He started with not wanting me to go at all, to offering to come along with me. That couldn't be of course, it would ruin the point. I *needed* my solitude, even from him. Maybe especially from him, who knows. That didn't matter right now, I'd be off to sleep soon anyways. The faint embers of my previously lit campfire were still barely visible through the tent as I clutched myself tighter before finally drifting off.\n\n______\n\nAaaand this is where you come in. When I first started thinking of this, the idea was that you'd be someone/something alone in the harsh cold looking for shelter or warmth. You'd stumble upon my camp, slip inside my tent and cuddle up against me before I had a chance to protest, begging me to let you stay and get warm.\n\nI am of course open to any and all ideas, maybe you're my future sister-in-law who followed me for some reason, maybe you're my totally not-pervy uncle and I'm using your land. You could be some random ass hunter, or hobo, or convict. You don't even need to be human, some kind of woodland creature or fae would be very appealing. Hell, be an alien for all I care. **Note:** The last time I post this I got some pretty interesting suggestions. There was a slime girl or two, but one person even had me excited for something based on the alien from LIFE before being deleted for some reason. So seriously, if you've got something weird let me know.\n\nWe can do a slow burn (preferred) of us getting used to each other before shenanigans start happening. Maybe you own a cabin nearby and offer to let me stay there, who knows. If you'd rather something involving you taking advantage of the poor girl in the woods, I'm game for ideas.\n\nWhatever we decide to go with, vanilla or depraved, cheating is a must. By this I mean I want your character to understand that, no loopholes or whatever. You're going to understand that I belong to someone else, and by either not caring or just caring for me too much you'll take me anyways. Also, I would have my cell phone on me, so if you're up for some kind of scene where I'm on the phone with my fiance while... stuff is happening, front of the line you go. Hell, maybe you can even pretend to be me as you text him, not like I can protest much while you're sitting on my face\n\nWe can discuss further kinks/limits/ideas together, don't be shy about bringing something up, I don't scare easy. (Also if you have a better title idea please let me know lol)\n\nIf you're interested, PM me. No reddit chat or commenting below asking me to message you (unless you legit cannot message for some reason). Also, I only play on Discord on my personal server, please keep that in mind.",

            "selftext": " \n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast, and I'm 19! I'm looking for someone literate to RP with, no one liners but other than that I'm pretty easy going, though a tad picky at points so be warned. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nWhat I'm looking for may sound strange to some but it's something I adore and is needed for me to really enjoy an RP. I love smaller and average sized cocks with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then, unless you want to do growth, then we can do that. anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me. my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. he prefers to let his partner take the lead as long as he gets to stick his cock in something, or grind it against some soft ass or tit fat, which he usually prefers, I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling, I like excessive cum but prefer normal size loads to go with the average sized cock my sona has, although if you want gallons of cum too that is fine but not preferred. My Sona's cock is 5.3 inches with a width of about 2 inches, just to put that up front.\n\nI'm looking for one of two thinking, One  \nI want something who I can RP with daily, mainly from around 8 AM to the latest you can go, EST. For these RP they can just be fairly simple ones, lots of smothering, breastfeeding, teasing, dressing up, stripping. etc. mostly one on one, but if you play more than one character that's just better. I want this to be a mostly constant thing but we can take breaks for days if stuff comes up. as well as that I would like that most days you play different characters, they don't have to be characters you own, they could be canon ones, or other characters, such as pokemon, switch dog, start fox, and other such characters, all of which could be male or female, but all need to be very, almost hyper thick.\n\nThe other is also Daily, but instead will be on-going. Basically I want an RP where I can go around in some world that you control, people and all that I can mess around with to no limit, fuck whoever, ruin whatever, just go wild. No limits to kinks or anything, of you want to have an actual character you could join me as like a helper, but I'm super selfish so stuff is about me, if you couldn't tell already by this AD. This could be done with a few different ways, universal acceptance, time stop, non existence, and Mervas, we can go over each of these options in more detail when you message me, which I hope you do.\n\nif these interest you please contact me at one of the following links, and check out my F-list as well for a list of my kinks and more about my character:  \nF-list:\u00a0[https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.f-list.net/c/DanTheCzechWolfDog)\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \nOr just PM me!",

Like who your character is(a small bio would be awesome. A pic of your character would be cool too!), how long you\u2019ve been rping and , where you found me.**\n\nI write novel/book style, about 3-4 paragraphs(two if i can\u2019t think of anything) and I like to make the world and characters come to life! \n\n**third person only** \n\n**paring: F/F. Tops only!**\n\nI also write in past tense and I don\u2019t really like when people write \u201cshe would walk over to the door and open it\u201d it just sounds odd to me and I don\u2019t really like it. \n\nSetting: Hm, I would have to say modern but it is in Hell so...fantasy would I guess be a part of it too?\n\nPlot: Holly is the princess of Hell, but she wants to become Queen to rule over all the demons and scum of Hell. To do that, she has to prove herself that she is able to rule. But she also needs to find a someone to rule by her side, she needs a Queen. Hopefully she can find one that is as crazy as her, but you know what they say, opposites attract.\n\nFun fact: Holly is a power bottom so I\u2019m looking for tops!

I apologize if that seems harsh but only typing one line of text is really lazy in my eyes and will not be tolerated. \n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, there are a number of plots that we can do that we can discuss in more detail once we are messaging on Kik, but a few ideas I have include: \n\n- Daddy/Daughter \n\n- Teacher/Student\n\n-Step-Mom or Mom/Son or Sons best friends \n\n-Sugar Daddy/Stripper, Escort, employee\n\n-Bride or groom/best man or maid of honor\n\nJust to name a few. Ask for my Kinks and Limits: \n\n\nKinks: blowjobs, blowjobs in public, being called daddy, when women wear heels (not stepping on my balls stuff...I just find it super sexy when women wear heels), breeding, knotting, public sex, shower sex (there\u2019s more but that\u2019s just off the top of my head.\n\nLimits: Limits: Scat, Vore, Gore, Toilet Play, Vomit, Foot Play. Anything Gross\n\nWhen you message me please include a ref for your character, name, age, a description of said character as well as your own kinks and limits \n\nI\u2019m excited and look forward to hearing from you.

            "selftext": "*\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"*\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to many different suggestions, but it depends on what it is, of course. Don't be afraid to ask, though.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there.\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Shy Character** \\- My character, Jack Foxtrot, is a shy kind of person, but once you get to know him he really is special. Basically, I'm kind of a dork/klutz, but not in a bad way. My character is the sort of \"just be yourself\" kinda guy.\n   * Jack Foxtrot's never dated anyone before, having been single all his life, including high school. Even got picked on for just being himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. So if you need my info I'll give it. Also recently just got a Telegram! (yay)\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these.",

Non-humans live as second-class citizens in many countries, if not legally then at least socially.

At least, we do when we're not in the bedroom, incorporating it into our dirty talk. Aside from how adorable and pettable you are, my other favorite thing about dating you is when you go into heat, making your sex drive go wild and turning you into my personal sex toy for a few days every month.\n\nHow did we meet? What do we see in each other? What's our relationship like?
