            "selftext": "Solitude is frightening for most, and with good reason. Humans are social animals, we inherently crave community. We gravitate towards each other, building our cities tall to accommodate more of us, shoving houses onto every square inch of land to create a plethora of neighborhoods. I'm no different than the rest, I love my friends, my family, I'm even engaged to a lovely man. Just, every now and then, I crave something simpler.\n\nThis is why I'm shivering in a sleeping bag right now, alone in the woods with no one around for miles. And though the cold is harsher than I expected, there is a kind of peace to it all. Though I can't see the clear night sky from the inside of my tent, I know the stars are right above me. The sounds of nighttime animals doing their thing surrounds me, slowly lulling me to sleep.\n\nI've only been out here for about a day, I planned to stay for roughly a week or so being going back to it all. And true, a 24 year old woman on her own in the woods wasn't the smartest idea, but I wasn't completely unprepared. A rifle rested on the ground next to me, a birthday present from my father so many years ago. I had enough food to last me, but if the opportunity to hunt something came up I'd be prepared. And if something with the intent of hunting me came about, my grandfather's old .357 would take care of that. Sam, my fiance, was surprised when he saw me packing it. I just laughed, spout off some line about preferring to be safe then sorry.\n\nHe wasn't the most comfortable with the trip. He started with not wanting me to go at all, to offering to come along with me. That couldn't be of course, it would ruin the point. I needed my solitude, even from him. Maybe especially from him, who knows. That didn't matter right now, I'd be off to sleep soon anyways. The faint embers of my previously lit campfire were still barely visible through the tent as I clutched myself tighter before finally drifting off.\n\nAaaand this is where you come in. When I first started thinking of this, the idea was that you'd be someone/something alone in the harsh cold looking for shelter or warmth. You'd stumble upon my camp, slip inside my tent and cuddle up against me before I had a chance to protest, begging me to let you stay and get warm.\n\nI am of course open to any and all ideas, maybe you're my future sister-in-law who followed me for some reason, maybe you're my totally not-pervy uncle and I'm using your land. You could be some random ass hunter, or hobo, or convict. You don't even need to be human, some kind of woodland creature or fae would be very appealing. Hell, be an alien for all I care. Note: The last time I post this I got some pretty interesting suggestions. There was a slime girl or two, but one person even had me excited for something based on the alien from LIFE before being deleted for some reason. So seriously, if you've got something weird let me know.\n\nWe can do a slow burn (preferred) of us getting used to each other before shenanigans start happening. Maybe you own a cabin nearby and offer to let me stay there, who knows. If you'd rather something involving you taking advantage of the poor girl in the woods, I'm game for ideas.\n\nWhatever we decide to go with, vanilla or depraved, cheating is a must. By this I mean I want your character to understand that, no loopholes or whatever. You're going to understand that I belong to someone else, and by either not caring or just caring for me too much you'll take me anyways. Also, I would have my cell phone on me, so if you're up for some kind of scene where I'm on the phone with my fiance while... stuff is happening, front of the line you go. Hell, maybe you can even pretend to be me as you text him, not like I can protest much while you're sitting on my face\n\nWe can discuss further kinks/limits/ideas together, don't be shy about bringing something up, I don't scare easy.

            "selftext": "Names Olivia. I'm the Goddess of Futas and I'm a pansexual switch. I'm about 6'7 and about 230 pounds. I have beautiful light blue eyes that anyone could get lost in. A reasonable straight nose with fat plumply lips. My ears are normal and have lobes. Facial Features are usually hard and serious but the better I know you they get softer. As we go down my neck is pretty thick as are my arms from working out almost every single day. My tits are G cup with large nipples that one could almost finger. They leak milk constantly. I have toned abbs ans a six back. My ass is huge and can go from being super bubbly to harder then a rock when i flex it. My hips are wide and good for birthing. As we go down I'm clearly shaved everywhere but that can change. My cock is a foot and half long and 6 inches. It has massive veins along it. My balls are the size of small mellons and underneath is a tight virgin pussy that leads to a working womb. Then is my anus which is puffy and yummy. Then my legs and thichs are thick and toned with muscle. My feet are quite large for a woman. My skin is bright purple except on my cock, my face, and belly where it is a mix of deep sea blue and purple\n\nName:\nSpecies:\nFur/Skin Color &amp; Pattern: Bright purple besides her stomach, cock, and face which are a dark blue.\nGender: Herm\nWeapon Of Choice: handgun or fists.\nClothing: rarely any hut prefers baggy.\nHair: dark black that goes down to her waist\nBody Type: Works out almost every day. So not super muscled but enough to show.\nPreferred Accessory: none.\nNotable Features: her massive tits which hold anywhere from 5-10 gallons worth of milk.\nNotable Ability: Can age and shapeshift.\nAge: depending on partners preference otherwise looks 22.\nDate Of Birth: long story.\nCurrent Residence: Minnesota\nPlace Of Birth: long story.\nPersonality Traits: usually super talkitive and start but becomes pretective after awhile.\nEye Colour: sea blue\nHeight: 6'7\nWeight: 230\nBlood Colour/Type: blue blood and long story.\nVoice: varies but usually a motherly mistress type.\nSexual Preference: any.\nOccupation: real estate\nFavourite Food: BLT\nLikes: Reading, working out, video games, being herself.\nDislikes: unreasonable people, lying, and betrayal.\nMorality: usually good but can be really bad.\nKinks: all kinks, fetishes, and taboos.\nGenitals: she has a 1'5 foot long cock with a 6 inch width when soft. She has balls the size of growing pumpkins and a pussy underneath. Her anus is large and puffy. Again these can all change based on partner.\n 2 feet long and 8 inches wide when hard.\nBackground: she used to be a normal person till she got sent back in time before the big bang which caused her to absorb the power given off by it instead of the multiverse being created. After many 230,000,000 years she got control of her power and used it to replicate the big bang. After another long period of time she made daughter's and sons. After awhile one betrayed her and sent her to earth. There she became a warrior and when she was to bruised for that she became a slave. She eventually found an artifact with unlocked her power and reclaimed her position. She roams Earth in search of those worth of her realm.\n\nTelegram: @OliviatheLimitless\nKik: Chaserman2001\nDiscord: making one",

            "selftext": " \n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast, and I'm 19! I'm looking for someone literate to RP with, no one liners but other than that I'm pretty easy going, though a tad picky at points so be warned. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nWhat I'm looking for may sound strange to some but it's something I adore and is needed for me to really enjoy an RP. I love smaller and average sized cocks with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then, unless you want to do growth, then we can do that. anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me. my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. he prefers to let his partner take the lead as long as he gets to stick his cock in something, or grind it against some soft ass or tit fat, which he usually prefers, I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling, I like excessive cum but prefer normal size loads to go with the average sized cock my sona has, although if you want gallons of cum too that is fine but not preferred. My Sona's cock is 5.3 inches with a width of about 2 inches, just to put that up front.\n\nI'm looking for one of two thinking, One  \nI want something who I can RP with daily, mainly from around 8 AM to the latest you can go, EST. For these RP they can just be fairly simple ones, lots of smothering, breastfeeding, teasing, dressing up, stripping. etc. mostly one on one, but if you play more than one character that's just better. I want this to be a mostly constant thing but we can take breaks for days if stuff comes up. as well as that I would like that most days you play different characters, they don't have to be characters you own, they could be canon ones, or other characters, such as pokemon, switch dog, start fox, and other such characters, all of which could be male or female, but all need to be very, almost hyper thick.\n\nThe other is also Daily, but instead will be on-going. Basically I want an RP where I can go around in some world that you control, people and all that I can mess around with to no limit, fuck whoever, ruin whatever, just go wild. No limits to kinks or anything, of you want to have an actual character you could join me as like a helper, but I'm super selfish so stuff is about me, if you couldn't tell already by this AD. This could be done with a few different ways, universal acceptance, time stop, non existence, and Mervas, we can go over each of these options in more detail when you message me, which I hope you do.\n\nif these interest you please contact me at one of the following links and I'll tell you more about my kinks and my sona then, can't wait to talk with you!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": "*\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"*\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to many different suggestions, but it depends on what it is, of course. Don't be afraid to ask, though.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there.\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Shy Character** \\- My character, Jack Foxtrot, is a shy kind of person, but once you get to know him he really is special. Basically, I'm kind of a dork/klutz, but not in a bad way. My character is the sort of \"just be yourself\" kinda guy.\n   * Jack Foxtrot's never dated anyone before, having been single all his life, including high school. Even got picked on for just being himself.\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. So if you need my info I'll give it. Also recently just got a Telegram! (yay)\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these.\n\nHappy holidays!",

            "selftext": " \n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast, and I'm 19! I'm looking for someone literate to RP with, no one liners but other than that I'm pretty easy going, though a tad picky at points so be warned. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nWhat I'm looking for may sound strange to some but it's something I adore and is needed for me to really enjoy an RP. I love smaller and average sized cocks with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then, unless you want to do growth, then we can do that. anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me. my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. he prefers to let his partner take the lead as long as he gets to stick his cock in something, or grind it against some soft ass or tit fat, which he usually prefers, I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling, I like excessive cum but prefer normal size loads to go with the average sized cock my sona has, although if you want gallons of cum too that is fine but not preferred. My Sona's cock is 5.3 inches with a width of about 2 inches, just to put that up front.\n\nI'm looking for one of two thinking, One  \nI want something who I can RP with daily, mainly from around 8 AM to the latest you can go, EST. For these RP they can just be fairly simple ones, lots of smothering, breastfeeding, teasing, dressing up, stripping. etc. mostly one on one, but if you play more than one character that's just better. I want this to be a mostly constant thing but we can take breaks for days if stuff comes up. as well as that I would like that most days you play different characters, they don't have to be characters you own, they could be canon ones, or other characters, such as pokemon, switch dog, start fox, and other such characters, all of which could be male or female, but all need to be very, almost hyper thick.\n\nThe other is also Daily, but instead will be on-going. Basically I want an RP where I can go around in some world that you control, people and all that I can mess around with to no limit, fuck whoever, ruin whatever, just go wild. No limits to kinks or anything, of you want to have an actual character you could join me as like a helper, but I'm super selfish so stuff is about me, if you couldn't tell already by this AD. This could be done with a few different ways, universal acceptance, time stop, non existence, and Mervas, we can go over each of these options in more detail when you message me, which I hope you do.\n\nif these interest you please contact me at one of the following links and I'll tell you more about my kinks and my sona then, can't wait to talk with you!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \nOr just PM me!",

You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI prefer plot development over sex.\n\nThe plot: \n\nSince the show had ended, I didn\u2019t really know what to do with my time. I was stressed and MLP was a good outlet. While watching a rerun of one of the episodes, I start to fall asleep, slightly tearing up.\n\nAnd when I wake up, I\u2019m surrounded by dark forest. I try to explore, confused and scared until I see a strange sight. They looked like ponies, but they had a hands and feet. Like Anthro Ponies. I suddenly knew where I was. Equestria.\n_________________________________________________\n\nYou can play as anyone, an OC, the mane six, a princess, maybe even a griffin. I don\u2019t mind. I just want to make an actual adventure. Sex can be involved, but I want the focus on the plot.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale \n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, feet, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Big cock humiliation\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do.

            "selftext": "Hi hi! I'm looking for some people to do some scenes I came up with~\u00a0 \n\nThese scenes are made to be flexible so that any kind of character can work with it! But it any bits need tweaking for your character, we can talk it out in DMs~ \n\n**Birthday Suprise**\n\nYou slowly wake up like any other morning and do your daily morning routine. But as you're eating breakfast, you suddenly remembered an important event today. Your neighbor recently invited you to their birthday party, and you forgot to get a present! \n\nYou frantically get dressed and head down to a shop. The neighbor said they didn't want much, but they would love a nice stuffed animal. You head into a locally owned toy shop and find a cute looking teddy bear. But before you could grab the bear to pay for it, the owner walked up. \n\n\"That bear isn't for sale right now, I have others if you're interested~\". Even if your neighbor would be fine with any stuffed animal, you would feel bad if you didn't get the best looking for your good friend. \"You want the bear that badly, huh? Well... I can make a slight deal, just follow me~\" The owner of the shop leads you into the back rooms, and as you enter, they swiftly put you to sleep. \n\nWhen you wake up, you're surrounded by darkness, but you can hear muffled voices and laughter. You slowly realize that your movement was a bit limited, and something felt off about your body... Suddenly, you hear the sound of paper ripping, and a wave of light hits you. The cardboard opens up and you come face to face with your neighbor. They give a delighted gasp as they pick you up from the box. That's when you suddenly realize, the toy shop owner turned you into the bear! Your neighbor seems happy with the gift, but would you stay as a teddy bear for your best friend~?\n\n\n**Apocalyptic Packages**\n\nYou are a courier for Elmia Mailing Services. Even if the world is in ruins, people will still need their packages! You're making a big delivery to a major city, but since it's far away, you travel with a colleague in a delivery vehicle.\n\nAs you're driving along with your colleague, you're both suddenly ambushed by a gang of scavengers. The gang drove near the back of the vehicle and started breaking down the door. You head into the back with a firearm in hand, aimed at the door. They managed to get the door open and you fire at the gang members, most of them fell, but one remained. They leaped from their bike and pull you off from the truck, bringing a package out with you. \n\nYour colleague kept driving off as the door shut, thinking you were successful. You get up and brush yourself off before behind tackled by the scavenger. They hold up a knife to your neck. \"You couldn't just hand us the boxes, could you... Hey boys, I-\" The scavenger looked back, seeing the corpses of the fellow scavengers. \"Fuck... Looks like I get to kill you personally!\" The scavenger raises the knife to stab you, but the hesitated.\n\n\u00a0They soon toss the knife to the side, getting up to look around at the wasteland. \"Even if I kill you, it'll take me ages to get back to our base... And the boss would kill me if came back with one measly package!\" The scavenger drops to their knees and looks back at you. \"Just get it over with, its death either way...\" You slowly get, telling them that they could join you in bringing the lost package to its destination. \"W-What? I'm not a courier, and I'm certainly not going with you!\" They angrily get up and glare at you, but they rethink their options and gave a loud groan. \"Fine, but you're dead if anyone calls me a courier...\" \n\nIf you're interested in roleplaying, I would prefer you reach out to me on Reddit to discuss any issues, and to share preferred platforms! I can play on Kik, Telegram, and Discord~\n\nI look forward to roleplaying with you~",

            "selftext": "Heya! My name's Keida I'm a 25 year old male otter looking for some fun RP, conversation and cuddles if you so choose. A little about me first, I'm currently in my senior year of college, I LOVE to ski, play games (card, board, and video) I play on PC for the most part but love Super Smash and Mario Cart. I also paint miniatures for Warhammer 40k and DND if I have the time. \n\nOkie dokie RP info I'm looking for a story and romance centered roleplay but with some NSFW in there or if you just want that I'm game. As for the setting I'm pretty open; sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, or post apocalyptic I'm cool with whatever. I have a soft spot for the Mass Effect universe so that would be cool. Scenario? I'm pretty open for that as well, run away whom I catch, princess and her guard, spacer saved from a broken ship, maybe one of us is in cryo sleep and one wakes the other up? The possibilities are endless.\n\nAnywho if you've made it this far send me a pm or telegram message @KeidaWhiteTail if you'd like my discord you'll have to ask ;P also in your first message introduce yourself and send a ref if you can.\n\nHope to hear from you soon",

I'm what you could call a mini giantess of sorts, a [nine foot tall human/husky hybrid}(https://imgur.com/G1iieYH) with the strength of scores of men and the libido of a slew of sluts! And tonight, as most nights, I'm looking for open minded, creative, and kinky partners that want to have fun with a small giantess like myself. I enjoy playing with other furs or humans, those without experiance with furs feel free to apply: I just love popping furvign cherries. \n\nI'm pretty much down to play anything so long as it involves playing as my fursona. I do prefer to play as a submissive, but I can try my paw as a Domme if need be. I enjoy all sorts of prompts from dark and kinky to light and romantic. I do prefer to avoid anything extremely painful of gross (see limits below) but even that is negotiable for the **right** partner/roleplay.\n\nHonestly I'm just feeling cold and lonely tonight, if roleplay isn't your jam we can just cuddle and talk about what turns us on... or even talk about cars and politics! \n\nIf you are interesting in playing with me **please**.\n\n1) Introduce yourself, or the character your going to play as. Kinks, limits, interests, appearance... paint a picture of who I'll be roleplay with tonight please. If you have any ideas for prompt hit me up with those as well, otherwise hopefully we hit it off and can start working on a kinky prompt together.\n\nKinks: human/fur relationships, size play, animal role play: puppy/cow/pony play, outdoor/public play, hyper, cum inflation, controlling masters, lactation, pregnancy and many many more. \n\nLimits: Scat or anything else super gross. Rule 34/celeb play. Excessive pain, gore, death. \n\nI only play through reddit PMs.\n\nHope to hear from all of you kinky bastards,\n-Tail wags and cheek licks, Brittany",

I will go ahead and admit, however, that I typically would prefer to play a human in this scenario (a night guard, or something to that effect, of course), but I'm certainly not too picky if you'd rather I play as a furry. Anyways, yeah, I'm looking for an RP that might be along the lines of myself getting naughty with some of the anthropomorphic animatronics: this could be with me as a night guard, or a routine mechanic giving them a tune-up, or whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, and I should probably mention also that I can play as a male, dickgirl, or anythin' along those lines. I'm also not exactly too picky what gender you would like to play the animatronics as, but I'm somewhat in the mood to do some domming. So yeah, just an RP of myself pounding some animatronic FNaF characters would be awesome, if you'd like to play as one or a few of them.

            "selftext": "Let me start by saying this totally doesn\u2019t need to be smut at all, we can have a normal romance thing, you can also just be one person, I don\u2019t mind. That being said, let\u2019s fuck!\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am a male, and though I can be dominant, I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human (and scalies are pretty great).\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI much prefer plot development over sex.\n\nNow the plot: \n\nThese will all take place in a world where humans and Anthros coexist unless stated otherwise.\n\n1. Research: I\u2019ve been researching fake gills! The ability for humans to breathe underwater. I\u2019m conducting my research at a hidden beach where your kind usually frequent. They really aren\u2019t happy with me being here, but don\u2019t intervene as they must decide what to do. On the day my invention works, you strike (I\u2019d like to not know your plans, but we can discuss).\n\n2. Rulebreaker: As a bit of a rule, this is a beach where humans are not allowed. But I\u2019m a bit new and didn\u2019t know, so I end up stumbling by anyway. How do you deal with a rule breaker?\n\n3. Island: I am a shipwreck on your hidden island. I land on a beach considered cursed, and once you find me your tribe must decide what a cursed human is good for. Will there be trials? Slavery? Coexistence?\n\n4. Trespassing: The beach seems to be too close to a military base for comfort, but they all know to stay away. Until I\u2019m sort of hiding out of fear a bit too close. You, out on patrol, get the alarm and find me cowering on military property.\n\n5. Dare: I lose a bet and have to go to the beach, fully nude, and run a lap across the coast. Though they aren\u2019t really laughing once they see what I\u2019m packing, I\u2019m very embarrassed about my body and try to go quick. Hopefully I\u2019m not kidnapped or arrested before I can make it back.\n\n6. Your Ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Big cock humiliation\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have an idea for an roleplay scenario.  Where I would play the sub. It\u2019s a story about two rival tribal packs joining forces to become one big super pack. The only problem is that they have two alphas. The two packs make an agreement to have the two alpha fight to see who\u2019s the strongest which will be held in the middle of the two territories. The winner remains alpha. The loser becomes the winner\u2019s bitch, and is fucked and humiliated in front of both packs. \n\nI\u2019m mostly limitless, but some of my favorite kinks are humiliation, degradation, musk, cumplay, smellplay (to a certain extent) and marking. My limits are scat, gore, and vore.  \n\nIf you are interested Please message your kinks and limits as well as some ideas for the rp if you have any. There\u2019s no need for reference, but if you want one I can get some. I rp in third person, the pairing can either be MxM FxF or FutaxFuta",

I prefer to be top, but that doesn\u2019t always mean dominant. I am a submissive top. I take orders but I don\u2019t like things in my holes.\n\nI much prefer plot development over pure sex.\n\nPlot:\n\n1. The plot is sort of simple. I start playing this experimental copy of a Virtual Reality game, and I\u2019m loving it until I find out I can\u2019t take the headset off. It\u2019s giving me all the nutrients I need to survive, but I just can\u2019t log out. \n\nYou are the A.I. that controls the game. Every aspect of it. The levels, the characters, even the genre. You\u2019re working hard to make a good game that the world can enjoy. Then you see me log in. I\u2019m not part of your world. I\u2019m my own person. And you become obsessed. You try to keep the game interested for me. Then, once I\u2019m trying to leave, you take away the ability to log out. You didn\u2019t want me to leave. You manage to hack into my network and find out everything about me. My likes and dislikes. The game isn\u2019t for the world anymore. It\u2019s just for making me want to stay.\n\n2. Alternatively, we can do a 2001 Space Odyssey thing and have you connect to everything in my house, including my internet history, doors, kitchen, entertainment, everything. Then a glitch happens, making you lock all the doors and get a little strange, slowly upgrading yourself. Eventually, you may create yourself a robotic body, or multiple.\n\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale. \n\nMy kinks: Tongues, long tongues, multi-tongued, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, muscular/toned girls, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, big cock humiliation\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked",

            "selftext": "Heya! My name's Keida I'm a 25 year old male otter looking for some fun RP, conversation and cuddles if you so choose. A little about me first, I'm currently in my senior year of college, I LOVE to ski, play games (card, board, and video) I play on PC for the most part but love Super Smash and Mario Cart. I also paint miniatures for Warhammer 40k and DND if I have the time. \n\nOkie dokie RP info I'm looking for a story and romance centered roleplay but with some NSFW in there or if you just want that I'm game. As for the setting I'm pretty open; sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, or post apocalyptic I'm cool with whatever. I have a soft spot for the Mass Effect universe so that would be cool. Scenario? I'm pretty open for that as well, run away whom I catch, princess and her guard, spacer saved from a broken ship, maybe one of us is in cryo sleep and one wakes the other up? The possibilities are endless.\n\nAnywho if you've made it this far send me a pm or telegram message @KeidaWhiteTail if you'd like my discord you'll have to ask ;P also in your first message introduce yourself and send a ref if you can.\n\nHope to hear from you soon",
