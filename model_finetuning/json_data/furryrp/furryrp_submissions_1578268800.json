That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI much prefer plot development over sex.\n\nNow the actual story:\n\nI had decided to go find a school somewhere where I can live on campus and have an easier time. My friends didn\u2019t want me to leave, so as I was sending out applications to literally everywhere, they would take them and change my species to Arachnid, so the academies thought I was a liar and reject it. And it worked! All of them rejected me, except for one...\n\nHetfield Academy was a school made for extraspecies, mostly so they feel safe and away from humans as they learn the culture. The newest headmistress, upon learning that I was actually a man, thought it would be a good experiment to see how everyone react to a human student. So she accepted me.\n\nThe specifics of the rp is for the rp itself, but what I am hoping for is to get more of a big romance story than just a big orgy. Too many sex scenes and not enough breaks will leave me burnt out. \n\nYou can play students, teachers, the headmistress, anyone. It\u2019s obvious I won\u2019t fit in right away. Maybe there can be a bit of a love triangle with the school bully and a kind girl. Maybe a few of the students become Yandere. Maybe some of the kind, helpful teachers have ulterior motives. Maybe some of the Muscle girls and tall toned teachers spot my weakling body. I\u2019m fine with any of your ideas! Or ask me for mine!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale or we can dm here.\n\nMy kinks: Tongues, body licking, long tongues, multiple tongues, anything with oral, Muscular/toned girls, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, big cock humiliation, weird penetrations (nipple, ear, etc.), clowns\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked",

            "selftext": "*\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"*\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to many different suggestions, but it depends on what it is, of course. Don't be afraid to ask, though.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more like casual things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards like scalie characters, like sharks, dragons, etc. but only a little. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there.\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before.\n   * He graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. He attended school in Los Angeles but graduated in Japan (he spent his senior year at a high school in Gunma). He then went back to L.A. and got a degree in computer science. He's a gamer and works part-time at home as a game developer, but he also has a YT channel for music and other content.\n   * His car is a 1983 Toyota AE86 Trueno Hatch. He bought one stock in Japan with a white and black two-tone (officially called \"High-Tech Two-Tone\" by Toyota), and a maroon interior. He then got it imported back in L.A. and made visual changes, mostly yellow foglights on the front and black Watanabe RS 8-Spoke rims.\n   * Jack has never been in a relationship before because he just figured he wasn't good with women. In high school he was also picked on quite a lot so his shyness just kinda stuck with him. He *loves* meeting new people though, he's just shy is all.\n   * Jack isn't much of a drinker, either. He only drinks in small amounts if at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. So if you need my info I'll give it. Also recently just got a Telegram! (yay)\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these.\n\nCan't believe it's 2020 already, lol.",

That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex. Please give it time. I have been through so many sex scenes that it gets a bit boring.\n\nThe plot: \n\nMy uncle lived a secret life in his mansion, and I was always his favorite child. When he died, he left his mansion and everything in it all to me. I felt like I couldn\u2019t accept it, so I just went in to grab what I wanted and donate the rest.\n\nThat\u2019s when I found out his secret staff of maids and chefs and all that. They weren\u2019t all that normal. Apparently, he had slaves. And for the past few months he had been training them to love me and my cock for his upcoming death. \n\nNow the house needed to keep a master or else everyone would be out of a job, but the main problem was that I really didn\u2019t want a house full of sex slaves.\n_________________________________________________\n\nAnd there ya go. Fitting in with my submissive top nature, I want some of the staff to be power bottoms. I would be a little lax on the requests as I don\u2019t need any maids and all that, so feel free to take matters into your own hands. Or mouth.\n\nFeel free to add to the plot!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Big cock humiliation, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": " I'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast, and I'm 19! I'm looking for someone literate to RP with, no one liners but other than that I'm pretty easy going, though a tad picky at points so be warned. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nWhat I'm looking for may sound strange to some but it's something I adore and is needed for me to really enjoy an RP. I love smaller and average sized cocks with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then, unless you want to do growth, then we can do that. anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me. my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. he prefers to let his partner take the lead as long as he gets to stick his cock in something, or grind it against some soft ass or tit fat, which he usually prefers, I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling, I like excessive cum but prefer normal size loads to go with the average sized cock my sona has, although if you want gallons of cum too that is fine but not preferred. My Sona's cock is 5.3 inches with a width of about 2 inches, just to put that up front.\n\nI'm looking for one of two things,  \nOne will be on-going, daily, and mainly from around 8 AM to the latest you can go, EST. Basically I want an RP where I can go around in some world that you control, people and all that I can mess around with to no limit, fuck whoever, ruin whatever, just go wild. No limits to kinks or anything, of you want to have an actual character you could join me as like a helper, but I'm super selfish so stuff is about me, if you couldn't tell already by this AD. This could be done with a few different ways, universal acceptance, time stop, non existence, and Mervas, we can go over each of these options in more detail when you message me, which I hope you do.\n\nThe other is also Daily, but instead this RP can just be a fairly simple one, lots of smothering, breastfeeding, teasing, dressing up, stripping. etc. mostly one on one, but if you play more than one character that's just better. I want this to be a mostly constant thing but we can take breaks for days if stuff comes up. as well as that I would like that most days you play different characters, they don't have to be characters you own, they could be canon ones, or other characters, such as pokemon, switch dog, start fox, and other such characters, all of which could be male or female, but all need to be very, almost hyper thick. You could be a different character everyday, surprise me and such, I'd find that a lot of fun, I may be busy some time but I'll always respond when I can\n\nif these interest you please contact me at one of the following links and I'll tell you more about my kinks and my sona then, can't wait to talk with you!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": "As a note, if you plan to ghost or are known to ghost, please don't message me. Just don't even bother. XD\n\nHello there sweeties~ I am looking for some friendly people to RP with. Had a bit of luck recently with my last post so, figured I would try again~ This rp is for 18+ only! \n\nA bit about my self, I am more of a dom bottom, then a top. I can switch, but I rarely like to top and prefer to bottom. I am a liox (lion ox mix). I am looking for males to play with or females who play male~\n\nHere are some of the ideas I would like to play out. We can modify them and add some of your kinks to them if you like, or we can start our own! We do not have to do any kinks that you don't like; I would expect to be shown the same respect with this. \n\n1. A mother (yes, I would still have a penis) son rp where I am the mom who gets knocked up by his son. (incest, mpreg) \n\n2. We are a couple trying to have a baby. I seem to be unable to get pregnant and am very sad about it. One day, you stumble upon a place offering a guaranteed method to get someone pregnant. Little do we know, when we sign the contract, you would become mine... (male unbirthing)  \n\n3. We are best friends or new friends who stumble upon vore. Vore would be illegal in this world. We snicker at the idea and call it stupid, but continue to look at images about it. Soon you bring up the idea that you want to see mine do it. So, after some convincing, you manage to get mine to agree to try swallowing some foods whole... We slowly work up from there and have to deal with my growing hunger for bigger things... Let's hope no one finds out... (vore)  \n\n4. You are my son who has been gaining weight recently. Slowly growing out your cloths. I end up liking your added weight and start secretly feeding you more and more. During this time, we end up growing closer and you end up getting me pregnant without us knowing. As you grow bigger and become immobile, I start getting weird cravings to eat you... (weight gain, incest, mpreg, vore)  \n\n5. As you are casually out one day, you notice a new pet shop opening up. You decide to pay it a visit and pick out a new pet. When you visit, you come to the realization that this pet shop is selling feral furries. Furries who have never had a home. This is where you find me, your new pet. You'll have to teach me how to behave and how to please master~ (pet play?)\n\n6. I am your dad, who acts very manly. You see me naked one day, and decide you want to have your way with me. You think I have a girly figure even though I act manly. And, what's worst is you want to turn me into your mom... you want me to carry you even if I don't want to... you'll make me if you have too.\n\nFinally, to prove you have read my post entirely, tell me your favorite cartoon and call me mommy buckles~\n\nSocials:\nTelegram: @Buckles_Husky\nDiscord: ask\n\nLooking forward to hear from you lovelies~",

That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human (and scalies are pretty great).\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI much prefer plot development over sex.\n\nNow the plot: \n\nThese will all take place in a world where humans and Anthros coexist unless stated otherwise.\n\n1. Research: I\u2019ve been researching fake gills! The ability for humans to breathe underwater. I\u2019m conducting my research at a hidden beach where your kind usually frequent. They really aren\u2019t happy with me being here, but don\u2019t intervene as they must decide what to do. On the day my invention works, you strike (I\u2019d like to not know your plans, but we can discuss).\n\n2. Rulebreaker: As a bit of a rule, this is a beach where humans are not allowed. But I\u2019m a bit new and didn\u2019t know, so I end up stumbling by anyway. How do you deal with a rule breaker?\n\n3. Island: I am a shipwreck on your hidden island. I land on a beach considered cursed, and once you find me your tribe must decide what a cursed human is good for. Will there be trials? Slavery? Coexistence?\n\n4. Trespassing: The beach seems to be too close to a military base for comfort, but they all know to stay away. Until I\u2019m sort of hiding out of fear a bit too close. You, out on patrol, get the alarm and find me cowering on military property.\n\n5. Dare: I lose a bet and have to go to the beach, fully nude, and run a lap across the coast. Though they aren\u2019t really laughing once they see what I\u2019m packing, I\u2019m very embarrassed about my body and try to go quick. Hopefully I\u2019m not kidnapped or arrested before I can make it back.\n\n6. Your Ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Big cock humiliation, weird penetrations\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

Message me here or on discord (Sekry#1721) with a bit of a prompt. Be creative, don't be afraid to break the mold, if you think you might be on an extreme end, I don't care, might even be interested. Even if you don't have a prompt, its okay so long as you tell me about your character or even yourself if you wish to. Heck, you can even get me to come up with the prompt so long as you play it well. I'm going to do my best to respond to whatever you give me as best as I can. The more you can give me, the more I can give back.\n\nAbout me: I'm primarily submissive. I prefer to work with males, however, futa's are more than welcome, possibly even preferred if done right\\~ I could attempt to dom, but I never have, and am not really interested in it. I'm more interested in the being dominated part. Taken quite literally. You can get me to do nearly anything if you know what you are doing. Here's a few hints, You can learn the rest over time, or try and get me to tell you in character. At the top of the list is larger dominant partners, or people who are willing to become larger possibly at the use of potions. right under that, I'd say is a good description of musk. A close third is excessive cum, and tied with it is a dash of degradation. I can play any character you want me to play. however, I prefer being a male character , my female descriptions might not be as good as my male ones.\n\nFeel free to send me a message, I have very few limits, these include scat, watersports, and heavy gore. If you have questions on stuff that are typical limits, ask. Don't be afraid, worst that will happen is that I turn you down. Don't worry, Ill at least tell you, and not just ghost you. Ill do my best to respond to everyone at least once. Keep in mind I'm writing this as I head off to bed, so if you catch me quick ill try to respond, if not, I've fallen asleep. Here's my discord one more time Sekry#1721",

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale.\n\nNow here is my idea:\n\nWe are either friends, roommates, or siblings in any of these scenarios. (And for convenience, my precum will make any hole it touches stretchy enough to handle)\n\n1. After angering a god, they decided to put a curse on me. My cock would just grow and grow every time I had sex with a woman. Not only that, it is a world of super size queens who are a bit attracted to me. I must find the god/goddess\u2019s temple and somehow convince them to lift the curse, before the whole country is stuck under my balls.\n\n2. I was already a man with huge balls. Heavy and can barely fit in my pants. I hid them well, though. You, however, find out and this eventually leads to us fucking. We then find out that my cum is not like any other cum. Whatever it touches grows a bit. Swallowing it could make anything grow.\n\n3. I buy a video game, it\u2019s pretty cool, we sit down to play it. We decide to make character models of each other because why wouldn\u2019t we? While messing around with the settings, they have one of those sex appeal sliders. However, through testing, we find out these sliders work on our real bodies. \n\n4. You are a shapeshifter. You can become literally anyone or anything, grow and shrink your body, you\u2019re basically super powerful. I\u2019m pretty bummed out on my birthday and I don\u2019t know your secret. You decide as a good present to give me a blow. It was fine, until you realized how addictive my cum tasted. Now you wanted more. You knew I wouldn\u2019t want to keep fucking you, so you had to find more creative ways to get my delicious cum.\n\n5. I\u2019ll tell you this one only if you\u2019re interested in cock vore and being multiple victims.\n\n6. You were a special kind of alien, sent to do observations, acting as my roommate (or sister). I was never allowed once in your room because of all the alien tech. But one of those items lets you take any human woman\u2019s \u201cSizes\u201d and add to your own. Not men, the rest of your species wants them intact. The first time you used it, it felt so good that you kept going. As I start to notice the increase in flat-chested or assless women, I begin to investigate.\n\n7. A bit of a secret you have is that you are a vampire. You don\u2019t exactly need just blood, just any fluid would work, some more delicious than others. On top of that, the energy you get would be stored in your already massive tits or fat ass until it fully absorbs. You would like to keep it a secret from me, of course, but one day you are able to just sense all the energy from me.\n\n8. You are given the full powers of a genie. Anything you wish, as long as it is not death or forced love, will become true to you. You have had your eye on me for a long time, almost an obsession, and though you can\u2019t just wish for me to love you back, you can start to make life a little...better.\n\n9. Your ideas!\n\nMy kinks: Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, Muscle girls, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, muscle girls, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, big cock humiliation, weird penetrations\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'm lookin for someone to help scratch a bit of an itch. Its been a long time since I've rp'd. I can usually give pretty descriptive messages, but that only works if it goes both ways. More you give me to work with, more I can give back. \n\nOf course, I'm always up for slowing into it, or hopping right in. Whichever you prefer. If you want a one time thing though, let me know ahead of time at least. If you plan to go long term, I'd obviously want to put more effort in, and hope you'd do the same. If it's not working out Ima try to be honest and tell you. \n\nAs for what I'm looking for, I'd prefer someone into some size difference or sizeplay stuff. Possibly going as far as mixing potions to have fun with~ that's not required though. I personally am into bulge stuff, bit of musk, and partners who would either introduce me to new stuff, or make me do stuff. Of course though, those are not required and I'd be more than willing to not have those if you don't want it. I'm very much on the submissive side when it comes to nsfw stuff, but if we do other stuff, I may be more towards the middle. I like to think I don't have very many limits, only ones I've got are no scat, watersports, or super heavy gore. I'm fine with a lil gore though. \n\nAs far as platforms go, discord, telegram or even here on reddit. DM me for contacts elsewhere! (I'm posting this before I go to sleep. So don't count on a super quick response)",

            "selftext": " Hey, thanks for checking out my post!\n\n**About me**\n\nI'm a 20's nerdy Korean female who enjoys the company of other geeks and nerds too. I do prefer older partners but people around my age are great too. Confidence, playfulness and sociability go far with me so if you have those traits you have my attention!\n\n**Kinks and Scenarios**\n\nI'm more or less on the submissive side of things and enjoy getting to the action somewhat quickly. Scenarios I've enjoyed in the past tend to revolve around meeting people online or having acquaintances with some flirtatious history.\n\nIn terms of actual kinks I enjoy they range quite a bit but some favourites are: anal, rough sex, choking, being bitten, pet play, breeding, group play with multiple males and pleasing my oral fixation with lots of swallowing (spit, cum, watersports). If literacy could be a fetish I'd probably put it somewhere in here too.\n\nIn terms of limits I'd say I don't enjoy non-con, scat, blood, excessive abuse or violence. I'm looking for someone who I will enjoy my time with mutually. I also have a limit on settings that take place in forests, farms or general middle-of-nowhere situations.\n\nAll things considered if any of my post has interested you just feel free to message me! I'm sure we can work something out, especially if it's between human me and non-human you!",
