I'm warming up to the scene again, but I got some experience under my sleeves.\n\nAnyways, here's the prompts!\n----------\n...So, Roomates. Maybe around the basis of struggling to survive, but maybe one of them gets an interesting job. Something like secrets between two people who sleep under the same roof sounds interesting.\n...Camping but a fiasco. Pure survival! And also, friends. Peeps get stuck in the forest, camping for a tad before realizing that yes: they are lost. It'll be a couple of days before they get out, but what better way to pass the time than talking around a campfire? Also, they don't have to be lost. It can literally just be some mundane camping trip with some interesting aspects.\n...Bar Hookup. Why not see the true colors of someone best when they're under a couple of shots already? An interesting little thing, but it could be anywhere. Call it at a rave with neon accents and fancy bottles, or maybe some rustic classy bar down the street. Interesting start to make new partners and maybe catch a couple dates.\n----------\nCome around my PM's if any hit the mark. Come with, at the very least, kinks, limits, and a Discord handle. I appease by pleasing, but why don't you take aim, hotshot? See you in the Private Chats~",

            "selftext": "\n[Matiq ](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/12/8a/30/128a306a9aaf8d3d5cd6eeb677901496.png) was a nomad, traveling with his caravan for his entire life. His mother, cousins, brothers, they were all one big family traveling together, trading together, and watching out for one another\u2019s safety. Bandits, slavers, and all kinds of foes loved to prey on Kitsune caravans.\n\nSince the caravans are each a big family, they get together once a year during mating season. Here they\u2019ll spend a few weeks reveling, feasting, and mating until they all go their separate ways. Matiq wasn\u2019t old enough to experience this until recently, and mating season was months away, but his older cousins decided to get into some trouble with him when stopping near a human town one night. \n\nThis was the night Matiq was introduced to gold, having been trading and bartering with goods all his life. Something about the jingling of a full purse and the shining coins appealed to him, but what appealed more was the wine he bought with it. A few drinks later and he and his cousins rented a room, a few whores, and partook in the pleasures the town had to offer. \n\nThat night, Matiq became a man and realized what joy the soft skins could bring. A place to call your own, the chance to have sex whenever you wanted, it all seemed so glamorous. So instead of returning to the caravan, and preparing to build his own wagon, he decided to stay in the human kingdom. He was sneaky and cunning, and knew a bit about brewing potions and toxins. Surely he could make something of himself here?\n\n____________\n\nSo that\u2019s about it! I\u2019m looking to play and explore this character with a partner in a long term, plot driven story together! I\u2019m open to you playing a character, acting as a GM, or anything else you\u2019d like to suggest! \n\nNow as a character, Matiq is a young man with wanderlust among other types of lust. One night of debauchery was enough to convince him to leave his life behind. He\u2019d constantly be chasing that thrill of his first night, chasing wealth bd women and pleasure. How does he do this? I\u2019m open to discussing ideas! He could get involved in the criminal world somehow or end up doing honesty bounty hunting or adventuring. He has a fairly loose set of morales. He won\u2019t steal from beggars or hurt innocents. But he\u2019s not afraid to break laws for his own gain. Mostly because these laws are odd to him. Hell, he could even cross the wrong people and end up in prison or enslaved. \n\nA few kinky things I\u2019d like to include:\n\nPregnancy: Kitsune really only mate once a year for procreation more than pleasure. So while Matiq will be chasing as much tail as he can, his goal is always to give his partner a child since he equates sex with breeding so heavily.\n\nSmall Dom: This ones not mandatory, but I love the idea of Kitsune being shorter statures, perhaps 4\u20198\u201d or so? I just love the mental image! \n\nIf you\u2019d like to talk details, send me a message!",

As these cows, we remain to have our intelligence and our speech but we just come to experience all sorts of side effects as cows, such as random mooing, lactation, that sort of stuff. Ideally, we come to clear the curse off of ourselves.. with the price that we remain forever as big fat female cow anthros. Possibly afflicted with an immortality spell as well or not at all. Think it'd be cute to experience life as the years go by, passing on our knowledge as we grow ancient together, as life mates.\n\nIdea 2:\n\nThis next one I dont have a solid set-up for just yet, we can figure it out together if interested, but for the most part i want to do transformation into a big [fat, giant koopa Princess](http://d.facdn.net/art/jouigidragon/1536978399/1536978381.jouigidragon_koopaass.png) and this would also involve slob in a big way (Heavy Filth, bathroom stuff).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Looking for big posts, anywhere from 50-500+ Words**\n\n**Discord, Telegram Or Reddit Chat please**",

So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then. I like Anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me.my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:Likes:-Hyper-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)-Watersports (sometimes)-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)-Gore (sometimes)\n\nNo:-Vore-Micro/Macro-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)-Huge muscles-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what.

            "selftext": " \n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast and i'm looking for someone literate to RP with. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nI love average sized cocks, which is what my sona has, 5.3 inches to be exact, with huge hyper sized breasts and\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then. I like Anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me.my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:Likes:-Hyper-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)-Watersports (sometimes)-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)-Gore (sometimes)\n\nNo:-Vore-Micro/Macro-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)-Huge muscles-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: u/DanTheCzechWolfDog  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": "*\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"*\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to many different suggestions, but it depends on what it is, of course. Don't be afraid to ask, though.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more like casual things, though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards like scalie characters, like sharks, dragons, etc. but only a little. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there. Though to be fair, I might prefer a little bit more detail, it helps keep it interesting. All I can say is the more detail the better. But don't stress about it!\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex, Remy, and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before.\n   * He graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. He attended school in Los Angeles but graduated in Japan (he spent his senior year at a high school in Gunma). He then went back to L.A. and got a degree in computer science. He's a gamer and works part-time at home as a game developer, but he also has a YT channel for music and other content.\n   * His car is a 1983 Toyota AE86 Trueno Hatch. He bought one stock in Japan with a white and black two-tone (officially called \"High-Tech Two-Tone\" by Toyota), and a maroon interior. He then got it imported back in L.A. and made visual changes, mostly yellow foglights on the front and black Watanabe RS 8-Spoke rims.\n   * Jack has never been in a relationship before because he just figured he wasn't good with women. In high school he was also picked on quite a lot so his shyness just kinda stuck with him. He *loves* meeting new people though, he's just shy is all.\n   * Jack isn't much of a drinker, either. He only drinks in small amounts if at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. So if you need my info I'll give it. Also recently just got a Telegram! (yay)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these.",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I'm Totally not Ali. I'm a 20 year old male who's just recently gotten into yiff and such. I write a lot of erotica on my own, but sometimes you just gotta bring someone else into the mix to spice things up!\n\nI'm looking for someone who wants to write a longer tale about bellies and the world that revolves around them. We can share yiff, talk dirty, all that jazz. I don't really care if you're male or female; long as we don't share our IRL identities, it's all good by me. (Pot-bellied guys are a *very* new kink of mine, so if you're looking for someone who's down with the gayness, I'm open to it!)\n\nI feel like there's a lot I need to cover with this ad-thing, but I'll just put down some prompts for now. We can figure out the rest later, if you're interested :)\n\n1. I've always been a sucker for the princess in a castle vibe. Not to be rescued, more along the lines of a spoiled brat that needs to be taught how to love herself.\n\n2. A modern sort of setting in a yiff/ human world. Mixes are common, leading to many fun and exciting matchups. Maybe two roommates who have discovered they're both into big bellies, and decide to have some fun. \n\nI'm not specifically dominant or submissive: I just play characters as needed. I like being the DM of a sexual story. I *really* like cozy stories, like making love by candlelight and snuggling after a big meal and good fuckin'. **Brutal stuff doesn't really do it for me**, not even force-feeding unless there's some nice buildup. I just don't have it in me to be harsh on someone, or to play someone trying to resist. I just wanna have a happy little fuck.\n\nAnyway, at the end of the day, I just like writing. I like looking back after a long session and seeing pages upon pages of filthy smut that I can come back to again and again to get myself off. It makes me feel better about myself to create my own fap material rather than relying on others. That said, I don't mind become a bit dependent on a certain kink to *really* get me going. ;)\n\nI like to do this stuff over discord, with the writing itself on google docs. (easier to read afterwards) PM me if you're interested!",

            "selftext": " \n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast and i'm looking for someone literate to RP with. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nI love average sized cocks, which is what my sona has, 5.3 inches to be exact, with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then. I like Anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me.my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:Likes:-Hyper-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)-Watersports (sometimes)-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)-Gore (sometimes)\n\nNo:-Vore-Micro/Macro-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)-Huge muscles-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading!

Only have a real reference sheet for one of them. One is  more androgynous while the other is  more masculine.  I don't have many, if any, limits at all besides snuff and scat, so I'll more than gladly do whatever kink you are into.  Literally any besides those two.\n\nI do kind of want it to have a setting/plot like something goes awry at a party or like your character is my roommates friend who keeps checking my character out. Or we could even do a dad/mom/brother son thing. I'm super weird, so We can do anything lmao.\n\nI'm unfortunately not a big fan of script RPs. paragraph is much more style since I LOVE to write, and I can get pretty detailed. \n\nHmu if you'd be interested!  We can exchange character refs and see if we could work something out :')\n\nDiscord or Reddit",

            "selftext": "Solitude is frightening for most, and with good reason. Humans are social animals, we inherently crave community. We gravitate towards each other, building our cities tall to accommodate more of us, shoving houses onto every square inch of land to create a plethora of neighborhoods. I'm no different than the rest, I love my friends, my family, I'm even engaged to a lovely man. Just, every now and then, I crave something simpler.\n\nThis is why I'm shivering in a sleeping bag right now, alone in the woods with no one around for miles. And though the cold is harsher than I expected, there is a kind of peace to it all. Though I can't see the clear night sky from the inside of my tent, I know the stars are right above me. The sounds of nighttime animals doing their thing surrounds me, slowly lulling me to sleep.\n\nI've only been out here for about a day, I planned to stay for roughly a week or so being going back to it all. And true, a 24 year old woman on her own in the woods wasn't the smartest idea, but I wasn't completely unprepared. A rifle rested on the ground next to me, a birthday present from my father so many years ago. I had enough food to last me, but if the opportunity to hunt something came up I'd be prepared. And if something with the intent of hunting me came about, my grandfather's old .357 would take care of that. Sam, my fiance, was surprised when he saw me packing it. I just laughed, spout off some line about preferring to be safe then sorry.\n\nHe wasn't the most comfortable with the trip. He started with not wanting me to go at all, to offering to come along with me. That couldn't be of course, it would ruin the point. I needed my solitude, even from him. Maybe especially from him, who knows. That didn't matter right now, I'd be off to sleep soon anyways. The faint embers of my previously lit campfire were still barely visible through the tent as I clutched myself tighter before finally drifting off.\n\nAaaand this is where you come in. When I first started thinking of this, the idea was that you'd be someone/something alone in the harsh cold looking for shelter or warmth. You'd stumble upon my camp, slip inside my tent and cuddle up against me before I had a chance to protest, begging me to let you stay and get warm.\n\nI am of course open to any and all ideas, maybe you're my future sister-in-law who followed me for some reason, maybe you're my totally not-pervy uncle and I'm using your land. You could be some random ass hunter, or hobo, or convict. You don't even need to be human, some kind of woodland creature or fae would be very appealing. Hell, be an alien for all I care. Note: The last time I post this I got some pretty interesting suggestions. There was a slime girl or two, but one person even had me excited for something based on the alien from LIFE before being deleted for some reason. So seriously, if you've got something weird let me know.\n\nWe can do a slow burn (preferred) of us getting used to each other before shenanigans start happening. Maybe you own a cabin nearby and offer to let me stay there, who knows. If you'd rather something involving you taking advantage of the poor girl in the woods, I'm game for ideas.\n\nWhatever we decide to go with, vanilla or depraved, cheating is a must. By this I mean I want your character to understand that, no loopholes or whatever. You're going to understand that I belong to someone else, and by either not caring or just caring for me too much you'll take me anyways. Also, I would have my cell phone on me, so if you're up for some kind of scene where I'm on the phone with my fiance while... stuff is happening, front of the line you go. Hell, maybe you can even pretend to be me as you text him, not like I can protest much while you're sitting on my face\n\nWe can discuss further kinks/limits/ideas together, don't be shy about bringing something up, I don't scare easy. (Also if you have a better title idea please let me know lol)\n\nIf you're interested, PM me. No reddit chat or commenting below asking me to message you (unless you legit cannot message for some reason). Also, I only play on Discord on my personal server, please keep that in mind.",

I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:Likes:-Hyper-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)-Watersports (sometimes)-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)-Gore (sometimes)\n\nNo:-Vore-Micro/Macro-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)-Huge muscles-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading!

            "selftext": " \n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast and i'm looking for someone literate to RP with. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nI love average sized cocks, which is what my sona has, 5.3 inches to be exact, with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then. I like Anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me.my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:Likes:-Hyper-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)-Watersports (sometimes)-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)-Gore (sometimes)\n\nNo:-Vore-Micro/Macro-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)-Huge muscles-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA  \nOr just PM me!",

I typically play a male zebra or tibetian mastiff!\n\n\nNote: All these rps can be played with your role as any other gender. Also please, feel free to share your ideas with me, or we can even come up with something together!\n\nMy first idea revolved around a predator and prey idea. We both live on the African Savannahs in different tribes, the Prey and the Predators. One day while gathering materials you stumble across me. I assume my life is over for good, but you catch a glimpse of beneath my loin cloth. They could have sex there, have the tiger torment him for a bit but let him go, or something else. Now this behavior wouldn't be such a big deal...if you weren't the prince of the Predator Kingdom.\n\nUpon recieving some of the best food you've had, you decide to \"pay your compliments to the chef\" in person. Short term, least excited to do\n\nYou visit the UK and meet a photographer zebra. He offers a wonderful tour for a low price. He takes you through the town, showing you all the beautiful sights and hidden gems of the town. He then drops you off at your hotel and leaves. You encounter again near the end of your visit, things happen and you share a kiss or confession of feelings. They decide to try and continue the relationship despite being seperated by the sea. Yada yada\n\nYou end up meeting a big fluffy tibetan mastiff with a scarred body and a hard demeanor. He's almost unapporachable, but he serves his job as a bodyguard well.\u00a0 (Can be a bouncer to a nightclub, bodyguard to a well known ceo, etc.). Since you spend almost all your day protected by him, you get to know more of him and his life. Cracking the hard demeanor and revealing a need for love and a partner. (Could include cheating).\n\nYou're an older neighbor of mine (any gender), and I help you out around the house and yard for some pay. I've been doing this since I was kid. You've watched me become me, and started to feel something more than s friendly love. (Ageplay)\n\nFeel free to send any ideas you may have as well! Please include a kink list, time zone, a little about yourself, and the password Superfly. My kik is hish_qu_ten if you'd prefer that!",

            "selftext": "**All characters are to be 18+ years old. No exceptions.**\n\nI've always been fascinated by older ladies. Something so tantalizing about the maturity that comes with age. Both physically and emotionally. A female's desires don't suddenly disappear just because they're a bit older. And I find that idea intensely enticing.\n\nI would love to be the spark that ignites a new side of an older furry's love life. Why should your best sex come early in life? Age is just a number, everyone has needs, and I want to satisfy yours. We don't need to add a taboo angle, but I most certainly won't mind if that adds to the excitement.\n\nAm I the young fella you met on an online dating site who you're finally going to invite over for the night? Am I friends with one of your kids who's been eyeing you since I was a teen and now you're finally gonna give me something to really look at? Are you my stepmom or aunt who finds herself in bed with me for one reason or another? Do you have an idea of your own you wish to explore?\n\nI'm.sure some of you have an older MILF character you love to look at or want to play.  And I want you to bring them out.  Show me your voluptuous, older furry.  I wanna see exactly what I'm going to rut~ \n Feel free to message me anytime~",

I'm not really wanting just pure smut but it's always nice to have. 3rd person writing is always my favorite and I would appreciate it if you would also use 3rd. I'm looking for a paragraph or 2 when writing responses, but I get it if the situation doesn't call for that much. We can go ahead and brainstorm a good start and go off from there, I'm open to any ideas you have!\n\nKinks: Deepthroat, foreplay, facials, gentle sex, rough-sex, dry-humping, public play.\n\nLimits: Gore, vore, scat, watersports, cubs, diapers, anything super extreme. (Just ask and I'll let you know.)\n\nThanks for reading this far, and I really hope to see some responses, there's no password or anything so just come right in!",

            "selftext": " \n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast and i'm looking for someone literate to RP with. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nI love average sized cocks, which is what my sona has, 5.3 inches to be exact, with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then. I like Anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me.my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:Likes:-Hyper-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)-Watersports (sometimes)-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)-Gore (sometimes)\n\nNo:-Vore-Micro/Macro-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)-Huge muscles-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: u/DanTheCzechWolfDog  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": "Howdy everyone! I'm looking for several RP partners! So for starters genre wise I am pretty broad. I can do nearly any genre. Historical, Horror, SoL, Fantasy, etc. It's all open to me! I'm also fine with any story/smut ratio. So don't be afraid to tell me exactly what you're looking for. I have several ideas in mind as well. No triggers, so bring your full force at me!\n\nOf course I also do fandoms, which are in the document below. I've gotten requests for them before, so I decided to include it in the post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nSIJSBOsqmoR7TXuPHM6irtXvWvoo\\_y0xRwu6m3rhKk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nSIJSBOsqmoR7TXuPHM6irtXvWvoo_y0xRwu6m3rhKk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nKinks and limits: I'm fine with most kinks and will gladly list off mine, limits tend to be hard stuff. sexual gore, vore, etc.\n\nI mainly stick to discord but if you prefer another medium such as email or another I'll gladly discuss that as well.\n\nMy schedule is pretty flexible and I can easily get in a couple replies a day, but don't expect that from my partner, real life comes first so if a day or two goes by without a reply it's no problem, but it's a bonus if you can give me a heads up.\n\nAs for themes I don't mind dark themes, and I don't have any triggers so feel free to come at me full force. As for something I'm hoping, I do want romance if possible, but it isn't required.\n\nI'm a novella length RPer, and will gladly provide a sample if you ask!  \n\n\nIf you are interested, DM me and I'll give you my discord!",

            "selftext": "Today I'm looking for something a little different. I'm looking to fulfill a very primal need; to demonstrate my alpha status in a completely undeniable way. And what better opportunity would there be then to take another male, make him dress up in women's clothing, and fuck him until he becomes my willing cocksock?\n\nSo that's where I'm hoping you come in. I'm looking for someone to be my submissive boytoy today. I don't just want a somewhat effeminate looking twink though, I want someone who is nearly indistinguishable from a real, honest-to-god female. Someone who could pass as a real female in almost every single way, with the only exception being an absolutely pathetically small cock and balls between \"her\" legs.\n\nIt ain't just about the looks though. It's about attitude too. I want someone who is looking to be put in their rightful place. I'm a Dom, and I like to be very rough in the bedroom. Not just hard, intense fucking, I also get off on humiliating and degrading my partner. I'm looking for someone who won't mind gagging on my cock as I slam it down your throat while I call you a femmy little faggot and spit on your face. Someone who would get off on having their hair yanked on while getting pounded from behind and being forced to call themselves names if they want to be allowed to cum. Who won't mind getting their clothes torn or their make-up ruined or their boypussy gaped so long as they get to service a real man.\n\nDoes that sound like the kind of thing you'd be interested in? Then shoot me a message. Don't just send me a few words; give me something to work with. Tell me your favprite position to get fucked in. Show me a picture of the type of clothes you would wear for me or of a girly trap OC you wish you could be. Give me an idea of what kind of scene you wanna be in. Believe me, I wanna get off as bad as you do, but I'm looking for someone willing to meet me in the middle effort-wise.\n\nHope to hear from you cuties soon~",

I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:Likes:-Hyper-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)-Watersports (sometimes)-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)-Gore (sometimes)\n\nNo:-Vore-Micro/Macro-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)-Huge muscles-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what.

So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then. I like Anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me.my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:Likes:-Hyper-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)-Watersports (sometimes)-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)-Gore (sometimes)\n\nNo:-Vore-Micro/Macro-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)-Huge muscles-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what.
