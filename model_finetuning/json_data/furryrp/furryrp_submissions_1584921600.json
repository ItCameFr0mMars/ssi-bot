            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\n\n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home alone randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of FurryRP! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main cheerleader. Velvet could be shared or pimped out.\nThey characters themselves could be throwaways or permanent. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed!\n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* Nothing is a bigger turn off to me when the opposite is done instead. So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks!  \n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building and if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well) So I'm looking for a good 60/40 when it comes to smut vs story. \n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 4-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that.\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n**In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n**I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer) track and field. Dancer, acting, arts,  The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

I\u2019d prefer tho to have a paragraph style rp, just bc using the *sniffles uwu hewwo ;-;* style not in an ironic way sorta weirds me out a bit hahaha. \n\nSo yeah!!

            "selftext": "I had been given the traditional hero's farewell, dinner the night before in my order, the countless number of platitudes offered in my name, the endless amount of well wishes, and so on and so on.\n\nTruth is I didn't want it. The dinner, praises in my name, songs from the bard about my gallant bravery. It was all a big hoax.\n\nI was chosen as \"one of the best and bravest\" men of the village to climb to the peak of Mt. Anemulis and slay the dragon that has caused havoc within our small village's walls...except I know that wasn't true. None of it was.\n\nOh sure, there was a dragon on the mountain top, everyone had seen it. But the \"damage\" the \"havoc\", no this was done by man. You see, the elder leaders knew of the dragon's hoard. That is what they were after, and sent the \"best and the bravest\" to slay the \"foul beast\" to bring peace to our land...and pocket a little coin in the process.\n\nSo, why me? Why am I going? It's simple, I was chosen. I was the unfortunate bastard who was unlucky enough to have his name pulled from the \"Tome of Decision\". Never mind the fact I'm far from a knight, I'm a blacksmith. I fix swords and axes, not use them in battle. However at 6'0\", about 200 lbs and a good amount of muscle from my work, the town believes I'm their best choice...this month.\n\nIt takes two days, but I make my way towards the peak, the skeletons of the poor fools that came before me strewn amongst the landscape, their weapons and armor weather beaten and rusting. Finally, after what feels like an eternity I reach the mouth of the cave.\n\nI've already accepted my fate in this. Within moments I'll be charred than devoured. I step into the cave look around and find nothing. Taking a tentative step forward I then see it....blue with black tipped scales, a line of yellow scales along the long thin neck, the body thin as well, two long horns at the top.\n\n(https://i.imgur.com/L5nvD1m.jpg)\n\nI stop for a moment and realize that this... was a dragoness. They sent me to kill a female dragon, rare as they were. From the looks of the lair, one that was alone.\n\nThen it happens. One topaz-colored eye opens and is staring right at me. \"Welcome to my lair little one\" I hear it say in what can only be called a growl.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nWeeks pass by, as the village goes about it business. A new blacksmith currently serves the orders of the villagers, and in the far corner of the village, a newer white runestone marks the passing of the old blacksmith. The villagers have not tried to slay the dragon since, as the chaos it wrecked has stopped. Coincidentally the chaos stopped as the elders were driven from their place, as the villagers saw one attempting to light fire to one of the haystack outside the village walls. All assume the dragon was slayed by the brave blacksmith that never returned.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nYawning I open my eyes as light streams into the deep mountain cave. I run a hand over the scaled wing blanketing me and nuzzle the yellow scaled neck. \"You snore\" I say smiling kissing my beloved....dragoness.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nSo how did we get here? What caused this blacksmith brought to slay the dragon, and the dragoness who's lair he invaded to end up as lovers. Where did the romance begin?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nAs you can see I'm looking for a partner to play the part of the dragoness, and a romance between the two to develop. I would like to stay away from the obvious Dom/sub dynamic this would have, this would become mutual love affair between two beings that never would elsewise.",

            "selftext": "\nMany years ago, the Olympian gods were challenged and defeated by a mysterious victor. Following the days afterwards, the Gate of Olympus closed, famine struck its streets, and the entire city decayed. Several centuries have now passed and the gates slowly creaked open, streaked with germs and moss that grew over the gates and walls of the city. The entire place seemed overgrown and abandoned. Off in the distance, a small temple, still gleaming with light, and polished stone, it seems like the only thing out of place. The temple of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, beauty, and pleasure. Inside, laid the Goddess, and the only remaining Olympia. Her memory mostly faded, she lied dormant in her bed, among the soft silk sheets. She began to rise softly to the sound of the metal gates creaking open. But who could be coming?\n\nWho will you play? The strange traveler passing by who explores the lost city and its one u touched temple? Will you help the goddess regrow her domain as one of her new followers? \n\nOr will you play a corrupt official, exploring the town and bending the weakened goddess to your will?\n\nOr maybe will you be the returning victor come to take there prize once more.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHello all! Hope you all are having a great day! I had a small idea around the goddess Aphrodite. If the above prompt interested you at all. I will be playing either female or futa based of the decision you decide to make! If this interested you at all, please send me a message on the below KIK or Telegram. Please include the following. Please be literate. I don\u2019t expect pages, but I expect you to write a paragraph or two.

All characters are +18 years old.\n\nThe ability to change the perception of reality and make everyone submit to my desires wasn't something I'd always think off. It all started when I confess to a friend in college, and I got rejected. It all started with that whim.\n\nAfter that, I started to read and investigate a lot about ocultism, demonology and psychology. Since then I've been looking out for manuals, instructions, ocultism books, and any kind of lecture that could give me an oportunity to take advantage and fulfill my desires. Finally, in a book from the middle age, it was written something about commanding the reality through alchimic circles and demon traits. The only thing I could thought was: \"What else can I loose?\"\n\nSo, on a saturday night, in my house's backyard I drew the circles, gathered the items needed for the invocation and prayed to Mammon, the dark lord of Greed. The book said that at the end I should spill a little bit of my own blood in order to connect this world to the Underworld, and so I did. \n\nBut nothing happened. For real. I waited like 2 hours there. So, I decided it was all in vain and went to sleep. The next morning my mother awakened me. \n- \"Austin! Austin! Come see this, come see this!\" - My mom said, concerned.\nWhen I went to the backyard, well, there was no back yard. It was a giant pool of blood. The animals would run away from it and it gave a really bad vibe. I started to laugh. My mother didn't understand a thing, and was terrified. Then it happened. A lot of blood started to boil and the whole amount of blood started to concentrate on the original circle only to ended creating some humanoid form.\n\n-Devil: \"Ahhh, it was a long time. I really have to thank you, mortal.\" - it said in a deep voice.\n\nI was full of joy.\n\n- Me: \"So it actually worked, it worked!\"\n\n- Mother: \"WHAT WORKED?!?!\" - My mother asked.\n\n- Devil: \"Quite!\" - The demon said, staring at her and the next moment she couldn't move or talk anymore. I was surprised, but I had to take advantage of this moment - \"Mortal, are you aware of what you just did? \"\n\n- Me: \"I summoned you in order to get something, that's what I did!\" - I replied\n\n- Devil: \"Yes. And I will happily grant it to you...\"\n\n- Me: \"Great!\"\n\n- Devil: \" ...in exchange of something\"- An evil grin took form on its face.\n\n- Me: \"Well, I was expecting this to happen. You want my soul or something like that?\" - There was no surprise. Devil. Tricks. Deals.\n\n- Devil: \"Oh, wait, how do you know?\"\n\n- Me: \"A few things happened since 1000 B.C. you know? People now is more comunicated and there's a lot of researches about your kind. But don't worry, nowadays God has...\" - When I said that word, the demon started to scream.\n\n- Devil: \"AAAAAHHHH DON'T SAY IT... DON'T SAY IT...\"\n\n- Me: \"Wait, so I can torture you by saying... God?\"\n\n- Devil: \"AAAAAAHHHH!!! YOU SURE ARE SCUM, YOUR WHOLE KIND. I WILL END YOU ALL WITH...\"\n\n- Me: \"GOD?\"\n\nIt started to convulse\n\n- Devil: \"STOP! STOP IT!!!\"\n\n- Me: \"So, right now I'm asking to myself why aren't you leaving? Oh! I know!\" - Now the evil smile was on my face - \"You can't. Otherwise you would've already gone. Right?\"\n\n- Devil: \"I CURSE YOU MORTAL, YOU HAVE NO SHAME AFTER SAYING...\"\n\n- Me: \"GOD?\" - At this point I was already laughing with its suffering. - \"Wait, how is it that it was this easy but no one ever take advantage of this\"\n\nLaying on the ground the devil started to spoke.\n\n- Devil: \"UNLIKE YOU, AGES AGO PEOPLE HAD SOME FEAR OF... IT, A DROP OF SHAME FOR SUMMONING US! BUT YOU SUMMONED ME AND YET YOU HAVE NO FEAR IN NAME IT! YOUR LIFE WILL HAVE THE WORST OF THE PUNISHMENTS MORTAL!!!\"\n\n- Me: \"Yeah yeah, whatever, but the point here is that you can't leave until you've made a deal with me, the one who summoned you, right?\"\n\n- Devil: \"YOU ARE DEFINATELY TRASH\"\n\n- Me: \"I'll take that as a yes. This will be the deal. I won't torture you and you will give me what I want. No souls shit, or handshaking. Let's consider it a gift from you to me. Deal?\" - I said with a smile.\n\n- Devil: \"WHAT DO YOU WANT MORTAL\"\n\n- Me: \"Listen to my whim, filthy demon. I want the ability to manipulate the psyche of any living creature at will, and as much as I want to.\"\n\n- Devil: \"DON'T TELL ME THOSE FUCKING GREEKS LEFT SOME LEGACY.\"\n\n- Me: \"And I don't want any tricks. Otherwise I will summon you again and torture you until you fix it.\"\n\nThe demon sat on the ground and looked at me. Then it exhaled.\n\n- Devil: \"Even I have not that much of a power. If you want to do that, you'll need to make thisnpower groq with your own strenght and spirit. There are so many ways of using this power you are asking me that even if I don't trick you, you will have to learn how to use it properly.\"\n\n- Me: \"Yeah I know. Just give it to me already\"\n\nThe demon started smiling again. - \"IT WILL BE A PLEASURE\"\n\nThe demon jumped and pushed me to the ground, and before I could say a thing, he ripped off one of my eyes. Then, I passed out.\n\nI woke up after what it seemed to be hours. My mother still in the same position, trembling. There was no sign of this demon and I was covered in blood from head to toe. I didn't die!\n\n- \"Wha... what happened?\"\n\nMy mother still couldn't talk, but she looked terrified. She seemed to be trying to talk but couldn't.\n\n- \"Hey! Talk! What did happen?\" - But she didn't seem to be able to talk.\n\nWhat could it be? - I thought to myself. Wait, maybe this power works only if I name the person first. So, I held my mother's head in my hands and looked right into her eyes.\n\n- \"Clara, you are free to talk. Tell me what happened.\"\n\nJust then, she looked relieved and started talking.\n\n- \"The demon ripped off one of your eyes and put one of his own in your head. He also bited your throat and shoved his claws into your hands...\" - she explained to me.\n\n- \"Wait... so it worked?\" - I looked at my hands, and they had a big scar, like if a wild animal would've destroy my hands before. And it was hurting a lot. - \"I have to test this\"\n\nI kneeled in front of my terrified mother.\n- \"Don't worry, everything will be fine from now on.\"\nThen I grabbed my mom's head and said \"I want you to go to the house, wash all the blood stained clothes, take a shower and then head to your room, lay on the bed and fall asleep inmediately. When you wake up you won't remember a thing about this demon, the backyard covered in blood or anything related to the terror you are feeling. Today was just another normal day to you and nothing special happened\"\n\nThen, she stood up, and walked towards the house.\n\n\"Okey, so that's how it is...\"\n\nThen I went to the bathroom. I needed to clean myself.\nOnce in the bathroom I relaxed and cleaned off the blood. When I looked myself in the mirror, I started to tremble. \"HOLY CRAP, WHAT IS THIS?!?\n\nMy eye was the one of a snake. I closed my eyes and started to think.\n\n\"Just concentrate, there should be a way of changing that...just focus...focus...\"\n\nI opened my eyes and there it was, still there.\n\"Well. Fuck.\"\n\n- \"WELL FUCK INDEED DEAR SUMMONER\"\n\n- \"What!?\" - The image in the mirror was talking. My own reflection was talking. \n\n- \"SINCE I GAVE YOU A PRESENT, NOW EVERYTIME YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR I WILL BE ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE ARE BOUND FROM THE MOMENT I GAVE YOU ONE OF MY EYES\" - It said, smiling.\n\n- \"So, you are just going to annoy me every time I'll go to a toilet from now on?\"\n\n- \"Basically. Yes.\"\n\n- \"What am I supposed to do with this creepy looking eye?\"\n\n- \"That's your problem, not mine!\"\n\n\n**OOC**\n\n*Hello everybody! \n\nI'm Austin and I am 23 years old.\n\nI just finished Beastars, and loved it as much as Zootopia. So, I thought about writing a prompt mixing two things I like a lot: Mind-control/Hypnosis, and Louis-senpai.\n\nI'll be playing as a Deer in a Beastars or Zootopia world, I liked both worlds, so that is debatable.(I won't be Louis-senpai, despite using his picture as a reference). In this world, I make a deal with a devil, who granted me powers to control other's minds.\n\nToday I'm looking for a Game Master as the title says. You will be playing characters who will be interacting with mine. \n\nI want this to be a really fun and entertaining roleplay, so there are three main things I would like to remark:\n\n1. My character will have a bad relationship with his devil, but friendship will grow up slowly. Eventually it will help me with my powers.\n2. I want my powers to have limits. In order to do that, I want to use a D&amp;D system (kinda) to roleplay, and let the dice decide whether I success or not in a task. I was thinking in creating an ability tree, with lot of feats I will be gaining as my character grows inside the rp.\n3. I want an enemy. An anthagonist inside the story. Someone who has supernatural powers too, and will end fighting against my character. Maybe it's another college student or maybe it's a leader of an entire organization or mafia.\n\nI don't care about your IRL sex or gender. Also, I don't expect you to be a novelist or have a lot of experience roleplaying. I just don't want oneliners. A paragraph or two will do it in order to get the plot on going. \n\n!!! This is the most important. I want someone enthusiastic when it comes to discuss stuff. I don't want people who doesn't care about little things. I really enjoy the plot discussion, and the people who enjoy it.\n\nI know everyone has a life, and sometimes you just can't answer. It's okay. I'd rather had you wait and write a high quality answer over a quick empty one. Communication is the key in a long-term roleplay.\n\nExtra points if you know at least a little bit of spanish.\n\nAlthought, the roleplay won't be 100% NSFW, there will be plenty of smut and pornographic content as my character will take advantage of his powers, but I don't want it to be the only thing, otherwise it will become bored for the two of us. Besides, the thrill of the previous moments of seduction and control is way more exciting than sex scenes. \n\nBecause of this I'm looking for open minded people with few limits. \nMy strict limits are: no scat, no diaper play and no vomit. Also, no zoophilia. All characters will be anthros, no ferals.\n\nAnd when it comes to kinks, I like anything related to domination and power dinamics. This roleplay will be about my character trying to dominate hos environment little by little. My favourites are: being the bull in a cuckolding relationship, incest, corruption, sissies, nuns and harem. \n\nIf you have any doubts about a kink, feel free to ask. I'm really open minded and will answer yes or no respectfully.\n\nDiscord is a must.\nI would like to create a server just for the two of us, and have different channels: plot discussion, characters, in-character roleplay and images.\nI like a lot the idea of using furry pictures as references to representate the characters.\n\nWhen it comes to what characters will interact with mine:\n\n1. The family: A hardworking mom abandoned by her husband, a stressed old sister and a bratty little sister who doesn't recognize her family's efforts. \n\n2. College mates: My friends from college were angry at me because I didn't help them with a report, but maybe they will think it again, maybe they are truly sorry, and willing to do anything in order to have their good friend back.\n\n3. Best friends. Maybe my wolf best friend and I tried to have something but didn't work due to society's labels. That doesn't mean sex slavery is out of the table for him, right? Maybe my childhood bunny friend does not dare to show his affection to me. \n\n4. Professors: Maybe Mr. Garrick secretely craves for cum, or maybe Ms. Dimm has trouble having a child due to her husband fertility problems.\n\n5. Swim teachers. I love swimsuits. Do I have to say more?\n\n6. The church. (I wrote nuns above, remember?) Maybe, this college is a religious one. Maybe a nun discovers me and tries to go against me.\n\n7. College rooms neighbours.\n\n8. Enemies. I really want to explore this idea, how will the battle be like? What will the winner win?\n\n9. I hear suggestions.\n\nPut your favorite colour in the subject of the PM so I know you've read this far.\n\nIf it's been a long time since I've post this, don't hesitate in sending me a DM. I always answer. Unless you send me one line saying \"hey. Wanna play?\". I won't answer that kinda messages.\n\nIf you are interested, please, send me a DM telling me your age and why do you wanna GM this prompt.\n\nHave a great day beautiful people!*",

Usually am free to RP any time after 6 pm weekdays, 2 pm weekends and    with weekends I am on much longer than 5 hours. As you'll see below, I    prefer discord, for ease of rp logging. Additionally, I'm looking for    people who are comfortable with longer posts, something like **50 to 500   word count average.**\n\nLand of the Rats\n\nWe   find ourselves in a whole crazy new world, on a different planet, we    come to realize quite fast given the starry nighty sky and it's two    moons. The setup can start perhaps far from the 'action' or we get right    into things. Essentially, we were both brought to this new land by    realm-hoppers that took us from our own world of no magic, to a world    where magic is abound but technology seems to have stagnated by a few    hundred years. Its soon brought to  our attention the citizens of this    land are nothing more than giant anthropomorphic rat people; Some fat,    small not so fat, but all the same they are quite big, some even    dwarfing seven or eight feet tall. The worse part of it all, they are    beyond filthy, devoid of most manners, and hardly ever shower. In this    world we're told that we are actually royalty reborn in a different    body. (Or perhaps a mix-up ensues and we're about to be executed but its    revealed perhaps through a open wound, the smell of our blood leads    them to detect we're actually whom they have been trying to summon    back). From here, we gradually transform into our rightful bodies,    become uberly fat, and live our new lives as king and queen (or King and    King, Queen and Queen.. I am open to Bi/Hetero relations here)\n\nCow Job RP\n\nOK   so, essentially I have this idea  where a couple of dudes (or girl and   dude) are down on their luck for.  Jobs, just out of college, and are   given the opportunity or possible  opportunity of their lives. A   interview is setup with one of the most  important milk farms in the   country. What they don't know is that deep  within this highly secretive   company is a deep, massive underground cow  society, built miles into   the earth housing living Spaces, stores,  entertainment, the   factory/work area, etc. We think we're going in for  desk jobs or IT   work, but we're promised a huge salary, some benefits,  and without   really knowing what we're getting into we sign.\n\nWe're    shown to our new living quarters, absolutely large living areas for   two  future cows. We share a two bed two bath apartment together. As   time  goes on, we get injections that gradually turn us into cows, and   we get  fatter and fatter too, building a romance as time goes on. I'd   like if  there were open defecation and urinating, but not absolutely   required.  The rp would be long term and involve romance, slice of life,   and other  such things. Hit me up if interested. I prefer discord most   of all.",

Definitely something more on the supernatural side of things, I'm curious to see how far your imagination can go with that.\n\nOh, the actual prompt? Well, I'd be playing myself, Jen, a 24 year old \"straight\" white woman that's engaged to a man, Sam. And you, whatever you may be, have a few tricks up your sleeve. I'm not sure if I like \"time freeze\" or \"sleep\" more, but I'll describe a bit of the scene I had in mind so you can get an idea.\n\nI'm living happily with my fiance when you latch onto me. Whether it's something I or you did, or just completely random has yet to be decided. Point is, you want me. However, you don't want anyone noticing, especially my soon to be husband. So when I frantically try to shake Sam awake when I see you creeping into our room in the middle of the night, nothing happens. He's fine, you've just seen to it that he's incapable of reacting to anything, which leaves us to do whatever we want right next to him.\n\nThis could be just the one scene, but preferably I'd like to expand into something long term, plus I think we could have fun with whatever it is you turn out to be.\n\nIf you're interested, PM me. All of my prompts are always open so no need to ask lol. No reddit chat or commenting below asking me to message you (unless you legit cannot message for some reason). Also, I only play on Discord, please keep that in mind.",

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\n\n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home alone randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of FurryRP! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main cheerleader. Velvet could be shared or pimped out.\nThey characters themselves could be throwaways or permanent. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed!\n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for this kindof roleplay, thanks. In the past I didn't mind MplayingFuta but it's frustrating and mundane when you get people who *don't know* how to play their role, ooc or in rp. Nothing is a bigger turnoff and due to this I sadly have to put an end to it because it has become painfully obvious this isn't working out as I had hoped \n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building and if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well) So I'm looking for a good 60/40 when it comes to smut vs story. \n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 4-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that.\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n**In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n**I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer) track and field. Dancer, acting, arts,  The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

            "selftext": " \n\n**READ ALL**\n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast and i'm looking for someone literate to RP with. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nI love average sized cocks, which is what my sona has, 5.3 inches to be exact, with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then. I like Anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me.my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:  \nLikes:  \n\\-Hyper (For everyone except me basically, and not really for cocks in general, mostly just butts and tits)  \n\\-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)  \n\\-Watersports (sometimes)  \n\\-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)  \n\\-Gore (sometimes)  \n\\-Watersports (Giving)  \n\\-Ferals (normal, but mostly Thicc and/or busty)  \n\\-Grinding (I.E. Titfucking, hotdogging, thighjobs)\n\nNo-s:  \n\\-Vore  \n\\-Micro/Macro  \n\\-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)  \n\\-Cucking (Same as Non-consent)  \n\\-Huge muscles  \n\\-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.  \n(For this I have the idea that the whole world will basically be about me, every company, ad, art piece, commercial, TV show, video game, etc. and I'm just basically a god and such, so I get to have and do whatever I want)\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: @ DanTheCzechWolfDog  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": "\\*Has it been days? months? years? These were the few questions that lingered on the young adult's mind.... It has been a long time since she lost her grasp on reality since she came into this prison... It all began 5 years ago... She had been a lively young individual then as she slowly snuck around, as quiet as a mouse. Instead of making an honest living, she would steal from the rich to feed her family. Which of course led to her downfall.\n\nHer last heist would be her largest yet, she was going to run the corrupt CEO of a government space exploration company. It went well for most of the job, she followed the plan perfectly. What pulled the carpet from under her feet was a newly hired guard who's first day without training was today. After catching her, despite how easily she went down, his blood was still pumping and he wanted to claim his victory. Once he got his fill of her mouth, and she got a filled stomach, the guard took her to the man she was pulling this on. After playing with her himself, he allowed his dogs to have their fill with her for the night before finally calling the police on her, who promptly arrested her.\n\nThe trial was quick and easy for the man, and because of his power, he was able to send her to one of the worst prisons, Alpha-7. Of course the girl attempted to not get that punishment, but it was already set in stone. She was shipped off in the day, surrounded by mass murderers, rapists, and tax evaders, all of which, had their fun with her on the way there.\n\nNow, she sat alone in the mess hall, an adult now. It was obvious she wasn't ment to be there, but that didn't stop the others from using her for her first year. Now they go after the new meat that everyone went after. She would occasionally have a \"customer,\" but there were few and far between, so she was lonely. She was alone except for the feeling that someone was staring at her from behind, but it wasn't the lustful stare that she was used to...\\*\n\nIf you're interested, please send an orange envelope with a description of your character which role you want to play, I can play either roll (the person that claims the girl, or the girl). Any kinks/fetishes allowed, except bathroom fetishes",

            "selftext": "I am +18 years old, looking for people +18 years old. All characters are +18 years old.\n\nThe ability to change the perception of reality and make everyone submit to my desires wasn't something I'd always think off. It all started when I confess to a friend in college, and I got rejected. It all started with that whim.\n\nAfter that, I started to read and investigate a lot about ocultism, demonology and psychology. Since then I've been looking out for manuals, instructions, ocultism books, and any kind of lecture that could give me an oportunity to take advantage and fulfill my desires. Finally, in a book from the middle age, it was written something about commanding the reality through alchimic circles and demon traits. The only thing I could thought was: \"What else can I loose?\"\n\nSo, on a saturday night, in my house's backyard I drew the circles, gathered the items needed for the invocation and prayed to Mammon, the dark lord of Greed. The book said that at the end I should spill a little bit of my own blood in order to connect this world to the Underworld, and so I did. \n\nBut nothing happened. For real. I waited like 2 hours there. So, I decided it was all in vain and went to sleep. The next morning my mother awakened me. \n- \"Austin! Austin! Come see this, come see this!\" - My mom said, concerned.\nWhen I went to the backyard, well, there was no back yard. It was a giant pool of blood. The animals would run away from it and it gave a really bad vibe. I started to laugh. My mother didn't understand a thing, and was terrified. Then it happened. A lot of blood started to boil and the whole amount of blood started to concentrate on the original circle only to ended creating some humanoid form.\n\n-Devil: \"Ahhh, it was a long time. I really have to thank you, mortal.\" - it said in a deep voice.\n\nI was full of joy.\n\n- Me: \"So it actually worked, it worked!\"\n\n- Mother: \"WHAT WORKED?!?!\" - My mother asked.\n\n- Devil: \"Quite!\" - The demon said, staring at her and the next moment she couldn't move or talk anymore. I was surprised, but I had to take advantage of this moment - \"Mortal, are you aware of what you just did? \"\n\n- Me: \"I summoned you in order to get something, that's what I did!\" - I replied\n\n- Devil: \"Yes. And I will happily grant it to you...\"\n\n- Me: \"Great!\"\n\n- Devil: \" ...in exchange of something\"- An evil grin took form on its face.\n\n- Me: \"Well, I was expecting this to happen. You want my soul or something like that?\" - There was no surprise. Devil. Tricks. Deals.\n\n- Devil: \"Oh, wait, how do you know?\"\n\n- Me: \"A few things happened since 1000 B.C. you know? People now is more comunicated and there's a lot of researches about your kind. But don't worry, nowadays God has...\" - When I said that word, the demon started to scream.\n\n- Devil: \"AAAAAHHHH DON'T SAY IT... DON'T SAY IT...\"\n\n- Me: \"Wait, so I can torture you by saying... God?\"\n\n- Devil: \"AAAAAAHHHH!!! YOU SURE ARE SCUM, YOUR WHOLE KIND. I WILL END YOU ALL WITH...\"\n\n- Me: \"GOD?\"\n\nIt started to convulse\n\n- Devil: \"STOP! STOP IT!!!\"\n\n- Me: \"So, right now I'm asking to myself why aren't you leaving? Oh! I know!\" - Now the evil smile was on my face - \"You can't. Otherwise you would've already gone. Right?\"\n\n- Devil: \"I CURSE YOU MORTAL, YOU HAVE NO SHAME AFTER SAYING...\"\n\n- Me: \"GOD?\" - At this point I was already laughing with its suffering. - \"Wait, how is it that it was this easy but no one ever take advantage of this\"\n\nLaying on the ground the devil started to spoke.\n\n- Devil: \"UNLIKE YOU, AGES AGO PEOPLE HAD SOME FEAR OF... IT, A DROP OF SHAME FOR SUMMONING US! BUT YOU SUMMONED ME AND YET YOU HAVE NO FEAR IN NAME IT! YOUR LIFE WILL HAVE THE WORST OF THE PUNISHMENTS MORTAL!!!\"\n\n- Me: \"Yeah yeah, whatever, but the point here is that you can't leave until you've made a deal with me, the one who summoned you, right?\"\n\n- Devil: \"YOU ARE DEFINATELY TRASH\"\n\n- Me: \"I'll take that as a yes. This will be the deal. I won't torture you and you will give me what I want. No souls shit, or handshaking. Let's consider it a gift from you to me. Deal?\" - I said with a smile.\n\n- Devil: \"WHAT DO YOU WANT MORTAL\"\n\n- Me: \"Listen to my whim, filthy demon. I want the ability to manipulate the psyche of any living creature at will, and as much as I want to.\"\n\n- Devil: \"DON'T TELL ME THOSE FUCKING GREEKS LEFT SOME LEGACY.\"\n\n- Me: \"And I don't want any tricks. Otherwise I will summon you again and torture you until you fix it.\"\n\nThe demon sat on the ground and looked at me. Then it exhaled.\n\n- Devil: \"Even I have not that much of a power. If you want to do that, you'll need to make thisnpower groq with your own strenght and spirit. There are so many ways of using this power you are asking me that even if I don't trick you, you will have to learn how to use it properly.\"\n\n- Me: \"Yeah I know. Just give it to me already\"\n\nThe demon started smiling again. - \"IT WILL BE A PLEASURE\"\n\nThe demon jumped and pushed me to the ground, and before I could say a thing, he ripped off one of my eyes. Then, I passed out.\n\nI woke up after what it seemed to be hours. My mother still in the same position, trembling. There was no sign of this demon and I was covered in blood from head to toe. I didn't die!\n\n- \"Wha... what happened?\"\n\nMy mother still couldn't talk, but she looked terrified. She seemed to be trying to talk but couldn't.\n\n- \"Hey! Talk! What did happen?\" - But she didn't seem to be able to talk.\n\nWhat could it be? - I thought to myself. Wait, maybe this power works only if I name the person first. So, I held my mother's head in my hands and looked right into her eyes.\n\n- \"Clara, you are free to talk. Tell me what happened.\"\n\nJust then, she looked relieved and started talking.\n\n- \"The demon ripped off one of your eyes and put one of his own in your head. He also bited your throat and shoved his claws into your hands...\" - she explained to me.\n\n- \"Wait... so it worked?\" - I looked at my hands, and they had a big scar, like if a wild animal would've destroy my hands before. And it was hurting a lot. - \"I have to test this\"\n\nI kneeled in front of my terrified mother.\n- \"Don't worry, everything will be fine from now on.\"\nThen I grabbed my mom's head and said \"I want you to go to the house, wash all the blood stained clothes, take a shower and then head to your room, lay on the bed and fall asleep inmediately. When you wake up you won't remember a thing about this demon, the backyard covered in blood or anything related to the terror you are feeling. Today was just another normal day to you and nothing special happened\"\n\nThen, she stood up, and walked towards the house.\n\n\"Okey, so that's how it is...\"\n\nThen I went to the bathroom. I needed to clean myself.\nOnce in the bathroom I relaxed and cleaned off the blood. When I looked myself in the mirror, I started to tremble. \"HOLY CRAP, WHAT IS THIS?!?\n\nMy eye was the one of a snake. I closed my eyes and started to think.\n\n\"Just concentrate, there should be a way of changing that...just focus...focus...\"\n\n\nI opened my eyes and there it was, still there.\n\"Well. Fuck.\"\n\n\n- \"WELL FUCK INDEED DEAR SUMMONER\"\n\n\n- Me: \"What!?\" - The image in the mirror was talking. My own reflection was talking. \n\n\n- Devil: \"SINCE I GAVE YOU A PRESENT, NOW EVERYTIME YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR I WILL BE ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE ARE BOUND FROM THE MOMENT I GAVE YOU ONE OF MY EYES\" - It said, smiling.\n\n\n- Me: \"So, you are just going to annoy me every time I'll go to a toilet from now on?\"\n\n- Devil: \"Basically. Yes.\"\n\n\n- Me: \"What am I supposed to do with this creepy looking eye?\"\n\n\n- Devil: \"That's your problem, not mine!\"\n\n\n\n**OOC**\n\n*Hello everybody!*\n\n*I'm Austin and I am 23 years old.*\n\n*I just finished Beastars, and loved it as much as Zootopia. So, I thought about writing a prompt mixing two things I like a lot: Mind-control/Hypnosis, and Louis-senpai.*\n\n*I'll be playing as a Deer in a Beastars or Zootopia world, I liked both worlds, so that is debatable.(I won't be Louis-senpai, despite using his picture as a reference). In this world, I make a deal with a devil, who granted me powers to control other's minds.*\n\n*Today I'm looking for a Game Master as the title says. You will be playing characters who will be interacting with mine.*\n\n*I want this to be a really fun and entertaining roleplay, so there are three main things I would like to remark:*\n\n*1. My character will have a bad relationship with his devil, but friendship will grow up slowly. Eventually it will help me with my powers.*\n\n*2. I want my powers to have limits. In order to do that, I want to use a D&amp;D system (kinda) to roleplay, and let the dice decide whether I success or not in a task. I was thinking in creating an ability tree, with lot of feats I will be gaining as my character grows inside the rp.*\n\n*3. I want an enemy. An anthagonist inside the story. Someone who has supernatural powers too, and will end fighting against my character. Maybe it's another college student or maybe it's a leader of an entire organization or mafia.*\n\n*I don't care about your IRL sex or gender. Also, I don't expect you to be a novelist or have a lot of experience roleplaying. I just don't want oneliners. A paragraph or two will do it in order to get the plot on going.*\n\n*!!! This is the most important. I want someone enthusiastic when it comes to discuss stuff. I don't want people who doesn't care about little things. I really enjoy the plot discussion, and the people who enjoy it.*\n\n*I know everyone has a life, and sometimes you just can't answer. It's okay. I'd rather had you wait and write a high quality answer over a quick empty one. Communication is the key in a long-term roleplay.*\n\n*Extra points if you know at least a little bit of spanish.*\n\n*Althought, the roleplay won't be 100% NSFW, there will be plenty of smut and pornographic content as my character will take advantage of his powers, but I don't want it to be the only thing, otherwise it will become bored for the two of us. Besides, the thrill of the previous moments of seduction and control is way more exciting than sex scenes.*\n\n*Because of this I'm looking for open minded people with few limits.*\n*My strict limits are: no scat, no diaper play and no vomit. Also, no zoophilia. All characters will be anthros, no ferals.*\n\n*And when it comes to kinks, I like anything related to domination and power dinamics.* *This roleplay will be about my character trying to dominate hos environment little by little. My favourites are: being the bull in a cuckolding relationship, incest, corruption, sissies, nuns and harem.*\n\n\n*If you have any doubts about a kink, feel free to ask. I'm really open minded and will answer yes or no respectfully.*\n\n*Discord is a must.*\n\n*I would like to create a server just for the two of us, and have different channels: plot discussion, characters, in-character roleplay and images.*\n*I like a lot the idea of using furry pictures as references to representate the characters.*\n\n*When it comes to what characters will interact with mine:*\n\n*1. The family: A hardworking mom abandoned by her husband, a stressed old sister and a bratty little sister who doesn't recognize her family's efforts.*\n\n*2. College mates: My friends from college were angry at me because I didn't help them with a report, but maybe they will think it again, maybe they are truly sorry, and willing to do anything in order to have their good friend back.*\n\n*3. Best friends. Maybe my wolf best friend and I tried to have something but didn't work due to society's labels. That doesn't mean sex slavery is out of the table for him, right? Maybe my childhood bunny friend does not dare to show his affection to me.*\n\n*4. Professors: Maybe Mr. Garrick secretely craves for cum, or maybe Ms. Dimm has trouble having a child due to her husband fertility problems.*\n\n*5. Swim teachers. I love swimsuits. Do I have to say more?*\n\n*6. The church. (I wrote nuns above, remember?) Maybe, this college is a religious one. Maybe a nun discovers me and tries to go against me.*\n\n*7. College rooms neighbours.*\n\n*8. Enemies. I really want to explore this idea, how will the battle be like? What will the winner win?*\n\n*9. I hear suggestions.*\n\n*Put your favorite colour in the subject of the PM so I know you've read this far.*\n\n*If it's been a long time since I've post this, don't hesitate in sending me a DM. I always answer. Unless you send me one line saying \"hey. Wanna play?\". I won't answer that kinda messages.*\n\n*If you are interested, please, send me a DM telling me your age and why do you wanna GM this prompt.*\n\n*Have a great day beautiful people!*",

She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\n\n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till her face fell, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home alone randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of Furryrp! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Goth](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting, an urban fantasy theme. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when writing this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing but I'm more than happy to have just one character. \n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like a trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just plain abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc but it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building so let's just take some time to get there, okay?\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for this kindof roleplay, thanks. In the past I didn't mind MplayingFuta but it's frustrating and mundane when you get people who *don't know* how to play their role, ooc or in rp. Nothing is a bigger turnoff and due to this I sadly have to put an end to it because it has become painfully obvious this isn't working out as I had hoped.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 4-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your views and input into the idea and what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody wants that. \n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n**In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n**I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened justapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer) track and field. Dancer, acting, arts,  The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0 but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

            "selftext": "\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into my writing, and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to a lot of different suggestions when it comes to stories or whatever. Don't be afraid to ask if something sparked your imagination.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more like casual things, though. I personally don't have any fetishes, unless something such as titfucking counted. Other than that, I'm rather \"vanilla\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards like scalie characters, like sharks, dragons, etc. but only a little. Also does/deers. Like I said, not a deal-breaker whatsoever. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there. Though to be fair, I might prefer a little bit more detail, it helps keep it interesting. All I can say is the more detail the better. But don't stress about it!\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n   * *In summary, I love adding detail, and if you can add detail when you can, and write a lot, even though it's optional, it really improves the experience for the both of us. Who knows? It might even help you when you go to RP with others in the future! All I can say is just try your best, but don't overwhelm yourself. I apologize if my own writing might seem too long at times and it overwhelms you, so let me know if it does.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex, Remy, and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely. Not a deal-breaker whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before.\n   * He graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. He attended school in Los Angeles but graduated in Japan (he spent his senior year at a high school in Gunma). He then went back to L.A. and got a degree in computer science. He's a gamer and works part-time at home as a game developer, but he also has a YT channel for music and other content.\n   * His car is a 1983 Toyota AE86 Trueno Hatch. He bought one stock in Japan with a white and black two-tone (officially called \"High-Tech Two-Tone\" by Toyota), and a maroon interior. He then got it imported back in L.A. and made visual changes, mostly yellow foglights on the front and black Watanabe RS 8-Spoke rims.\n   * Jack has never been in a relationship before because he just figured he wasn't good with women. In high school he was also picked on quite a lot so his shyness just kinda stuck with him. He *loves* meeting new people though, he's just shy is all.\n   * Jack isn't much of a drinker, either. He only drinks in small amounts if at all.\n   * Jack is also a bilingual character. He speaks English, his main language of course, but while in Japan his senior year, he learned Japanese and likes to speak it. In some cases, he might say something or other in Japanese, mostly when he feels nervous or under pressure, but he tries to keep it to a minimum in public as it embarrasses him, and makes him feel like he stands out.\n   * *In summary, Jack's really a sweetheart. He just strives to be a good person and be good to others, especially in a society where people like him are rather rare.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. But I'm great with Telegram, too. My info is below.\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these, more specifically people like me, who enjoy the writing aspect and the build-up of the characters.\n\nIf my info above doesn't work or if you need assistance with adding me, you can send me a Reddit message.\n\nThanks, and have a great day, you amazing people. I've met some very creative and inspiring people on here and I just wanted to say how much a guy can appreciate that. Thank you.",

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\n\n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home alone randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of FurryRP! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main cheerleader. Velvet could be shared or pimped out.\nThey characters themselves could be throwaways or permanent. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed!\n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for this kindof roleplay, thanks. In the past I didn't mind MplayingFuta but it's frustrating and mundane when you get people who *don't know* how to play their role, ooc or in rp. Nothing is a bigger turnoff and due to this I sadly have to put an end to it because it has become painfully obvious this isn't working out as I had hoped \n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building and if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well) So I'm looking for a good 60/40 when it comes to smut vs story. \n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 4-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that.\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n**In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n**I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer) track and field. Dancer, acting, arts,  The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

You had always been a bit different. While others went and hung out with friends, you stayed inside and worshipped your own strange drawings. You talked of beings higher than the universe. Proclaimed yourself the priestess of this worship. But you never really actively tried to have people join. Not until you see me, and I somehow create a symbol. One that only you and the holy prophet should know. Now you see me as the true prophet, and want to recruit me. Plus get other people to worship their prophet.\n\n2. I get shipwrecked on an island. This island has two tribes on the verge of war. However, both tribes have a prophecy. That one day, this white male with an especially large...asset...will come and unify the two tribes, with one tribe coming out on top as the holiest.

I usually post 2 to 4 paragraphs per response. This would be a smut story between the trainer and Suicune, who would both be considered 18+ and living in the Pok\u00e9mon world. Suicune would not be anthropomorphic, rather looking as it normally does with some sort of telepathy to communicate with.\n\nIdeally, I would like our story to begin when the trainer stumbles across the Suicune in the wild and the trainer is initially afraid. Perhaps they hide and watch the Suicune wearily? Maybe Suicune is already mating with another Pok\u00e9mon and this causes the trainer to become aroused? We can take it from there. Or hey, you might have your own ideas in mind and that's awesome, I would love to discuss anything you have interest in doing!\n\nI have a few limits and turn offs, so feel free to ask me beforehand if you have anything crazy kinky in mind. For myself, my biggest fantasies involve: public sex, cross-dressing, embarrassment, spanking, orgasm denial, dripping pussy juice, underwear-wetting, and creampies.\n\nI'm online quite often and I love to brainstorm with my partner! Please reach out to me if anything I've said above is up your alley. PM me or comment here and we can hopefully chat more on Discord!",

If i suddenly stop talking it\u2019s not because I dislike the rp, it\u2019s because I got sleepy and feel asleep or was busy with something else.\n\nSome of my favorite kinks are \nWatersports \nBeing called \u201cdaddy\u201d or \u201cmaster\u201d\nBegging\nCreampies\nPetplay\nCollers\nBdsm\n\nHere\u2019s my discord \n\n\ud83d\udc09\ud835\udd6e\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd99\ud835\udd9e\ud835\udd8a \ud835\udd92\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd8c\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd88 \ud835\udd89\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd8c\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd93\ud83d\udc09#7076",

Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\n\n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till her face fell, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next or a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home alone randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of Furryrp! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Goth](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. So a urban fantasy theme. It does however havs a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter*) yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. Also, years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/691683792250732564/IMG_20200323_215400.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. Don't see a kink you like? Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the start. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing but I'm more than happy to have just one character. \n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like a trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.* Velvet in time will realise she has feelings for her bully. She will probably hate herself even more for this but no amount of self disdain can change that.\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. It can go from just plain abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom (yes please), manipulation, corruption, etc but it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, kindof slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building so let's just take some time to get there, okay?\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for this kindof roleplay...but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta, genders don't matter when you know how to play your role. However, I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me about the roleplay... Thanks! \n\n\n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 4-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your views and input into the idea and what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody wants that. \n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n**In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n**I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened the justapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports team, track and field, mean-girl. The point being she would have to be preppy, popular and the bully of my character, the opposite of my character. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0 but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, thanks for stopping by.\n\n**A brief foreword:** While I am looking for RP finding someone with whom I can make a deeper connection is a great thing. If you are in doubt about whether to approach or not, just PM me and we can talk. Worst that happens is you are not worse off, best is you find something more. As a starter, if you enjoy the ideas on this post you will enjoy talking to me. I value a lot of things in people - even if it is just finding someone with whom I can talk to honestly.\n\n**I am looking for:** A dom who enjoys starting out rough, if not forceful then at least assertive and cunning, and wants to turn my character into a girly shemale (feminine, pretty, nice breasts, hips, ass, and a tiny dicklet). Your character can be strong and/or clever, forcing my otherwise average male character into submission one way or another. We can make the pace slower and end up going through the path of romance as my character accepts her new self and comes to love yours, becoming his sexy girlfriend. I can play almost any species so if you have any favorite feel free to tell me.\n\n**I do not want:** To be turned into a herm/femboy, you want someone else for that. IC Femdoms are also undesired, sorry but I tried it before and it never works (Exception: Shemales that do not look like bodybuilders are welcome). No IC humans, come on be creative. Scat, gore, etc., also if in doubt ask. I am fine with just text as I hardly use refs myself, so if you really want that you are welcome to bring some for me to pick from - I will not judge you for not having one and I do not expect you to want one from me. Really, this is not an issue for me.\nIf you think our preferences match send me a PM and we'll talk, there a lot of different ways to play this out!\n\n**Example ideas:** Science fiction/Fantasy: My character is an adventurer and runs into yours by accident in a remote region. Your character decides that mine would make a good companion, and everything flows from there\u2026 Tribal, your character is a proud warrior of a tribe and finds my character while in a hunt or travel, you think mine would make a good mate and so yours brings him home, intent on turning him into a sexy companion. Prison, your character is a tough (or clever) guy at a prison and protects mine from abuse... Because it has been long since he has been with a girl and your character needs the action... And there are many more! This RP is very easy to set up!\u201d\n\n**About me:** I'm a phoenix-peacock bird, or more often than not like to play as one (can do other species, that is simply my favorite). Dragons are my favorite dom species but I accept *almost anyone* with matching interests, as I keep saying just ask. I also have an [Flist!](https://www.f-list.net/c/audalon%20ethereon). I can use almost any IM you want (except Kik, ironically. The lack of a history function is annoying).",

            "selftext": "Hey there, thanks for stopping by.\n\n**A brief foreword:** While I am looking for RP finding someone with whom I can make a deeper connection is a great thing. If you are in doubt about whether to approach or not, just PM me and we can talk. Worst that happens is you are not worse off, best is you find something more. As a starter, if you enjoy the ideas on this post you will enjoy talking to me. I value a lot of things in people - even if it is just finding someone with whom I can talk to honestly.\n\n**I am looking for:** A dom who enjoys starting out rough, if not forceful then at least assertive and cunning, and wants to turn my character into a girly shemale (feminine, pretty, nice breasts, hips, ass, and a tiny dicklet). Your character can be strong and/or clever, forcing my otherwise average male character into submission one way or another. We can make the pace slower and end up going through the path of romance as my character accepts her new self and comes to love yours, becoming his sexy girlfriend. I can play almost any species so if you have any favorite feel free to tell me.\n\n**I do not want:** To be turned into a herm/femboy, you want someone else for that. IC Femdoms are also undesired, sorry but I tried it before and it never works (Exception: Shemales that do not look like bodybuilders are welcome). No IC humans, come on be creative. Scat, gore, etc., also if in doubt ask. I am fine with just text as I hardly use refs myself, so if you really want that you are welcome to bring some for me to pick from - I will not judge you for not having one and I do not expect you to want one from me. Really, this is not an issue for me.\nIf you think our preferences match send me a PM and we'll talk, there a lot of different ways to play this out!\n\n**Example ideas:** Science fiction/Fantasy: My character is an adventurer and runs into yours by accident in a remote region. Your character decides that mine would make a good companion, and everything flows from there\u2026 Tribal, your character is a proud warrior of a tribe and finds my character while in a hunt or travel, you think mine would make a good mate and so yours brings him home, intent on turning him into a sexy companion. Prison, your character is a tough (or clever) guy at a prison and protects mine from abuse... Because it has been long since he has been with a girl and your character needs the action... And there are many more! This RP is very easy to set up!\u201d\n\n**About me:** I'm a phoenix-peacock bird, or more often than not like to play as one (can do other species, that is simply my favorite). Dragons are my favorite dom species but I accept *almost anyone* with matching interests, as I keep saying just ask. I also have an [Flist!](https://www.f-list.net/c/audalon%20ethereon). I can use almost any IM you want (except Kik, ironically. The lack of a history function is annoying).",

            "selftext": "I had an idea for a rp, I want to be screwed by a better version of me. How do I mean that? Well, there are many ways to see this: Maybe you are a strong dragon and I am a smaller Kobold, maybe we are both Cyborgs, but you are a newer, better version. Maybe I am a dog species and you are a big, strong wolf. Can you see what Im getting at? Maybe you can think of even more examples, Im open to hear them! The general idea is that we are similar species, but you are the stronger or otherwise better one. But there is one rule: Anthros only, no ferals or humans. \n\nI personally like to have a size difference between us (Im talking that you are like a meter taller than me) and I also really like rough partners. Id also be open for vore if that is something you are interested in. My dislikes are feces, urine and too violent partners (you can be rough, but don\u2019t physically injure me!)\n\nI don\u2019t have any pictures of my characters, id describe them to you. We can play here or on discord, message me and ill send you a friend request!\n\nI hope to hear from all of you soon~",

            "selftext": " \n\n**READ ALL**\n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast and i'm looking for someone literate to RP with. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nI love average sized cocks, which is what my sona has, 5.3 inches to be exact, with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then. I like Anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me.my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:  \nLikes:  \n\\-Hyper (For everyone except me basically, and not really for cocks in general, mostly just butts and tits)  \n\\-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)  \n\\-Watersports (sometimes)  \n\\-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)  \n\\-Gore (sometimes)  \n\\-Watersports (Giving)  \n\\-Ferals (normal, but mostly Thicc and/or busty)  \n\\-Grinding (I.E. Titfucking, hotdogging, thighjobs)\n\nNo-s:  \n\\-Vore  \n\\-Micro/Macro  \n\\-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)  \n\\-Cucking (Same as Non-consent)  \n\\-Huge muscles  \n\\-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.  \n(For this I have the idea that the whole world will basically be about me, every company, ad, art piece, commercial, TV show, video game, etc. and I'm just basically a god and such, so I get to have and do whatever I want)\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: @ DanTheCzechWolfDog  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": " \n\nTo   preface I am East Coast USA, so you know where I lay time zone Wise.    Usually am free to RP any time after 6 pm weekdays, 2 pm weekends and    with weekends I am on much longer than 5 hours. As you'll see below, I    prefer discord, for ease of rp logging. Additionally, I'm looking for    people who are comfortable with longer posts, something like 50 to 500   word count average.\n\nLand of the Rats\n\nWe   find ourselves in a whole crazy new world, on a different planet, we    come to realize quite fast given the starry nighty sky and it's two    moons. The setup can start perhaps far from the 'action' or we get right    into things. Essentially, we were both brought to this new land by    realm-hoppers that took us from our own world of no magic, to a world    where magic is abound but technology seems to have stagnated by a few    hundred years. Its soon brought to  our attention the citizens of this    land are nothing more than giant anthropomorphic rat people; Some fat,    small not so fat, but all the same they are quite big, some even    dwarfing seven or eight feet tall. The worse part of it all, they are    beyond filthy, devoid of most manners, and hardly ever shower. In this    world we're told that we are actually royalty reborn in a different    body. (Or perhaps a mix-up ensues and we're about to be executed but its    revealed perhaps through a open wound, the smell of our blood leads    them to detect we're actually whom they have been trying to summon    back). From here, we gradually transform into our rightful bodies,    become uberly fat, and live our new lives as king and queen (or King and    King, Queen and Queen.. I am open to Bi/Hetero relations here)\n\nCow Job RP\n\nOK   so, essentially I have this idea  where a couple of dudes (or girl and   dude) are down on their luck for.  Jobs, just out of college, and are   given the opportunity or possible  opportunity of their lives. A   interview is setup with one of the most  important milk farms in the   country. What they don't know is that deep  within this highly secretive   company is a deep, massive underground cow  society, built miles into   the earth housing living Spaces, stores,  entertainment, the   factory/work area, etc. We think we're going in for  desk jobs or IT   work, but we're promised a huge salary, some benefits,  and without   really knowing what we're getting into we sign.\n\nWe're    shown to our new living quarters, absolutely large living areas for   two  future cows. We share a two bed two bath apartment together. As   time  goes on, we get injections that gradually turn us into cows, and   we get  fatter and fatter too, building a romance as time goes on. I'd   like if  there were open defecation and urinating, but not absolutely   required.  The rp would be long term and involve romance, slice of life,   and other  such things. Hit me up if interested. I prefer discord most   of all.\n\n1 comment",

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex. Please give it time. I have been through so many sex scenes that it gets a bit boring.\n\nThe plots:\n\n1. It\u2019s (insert name here)! The best place for food, fun, and animatronic entertainment! You and your team have been working here for a long. You love to see every happy face on every satisfied customer. And every night you get to stretch your legs and do what you do to relax. But recently, due to your growing popularity, the owner has started worrying about thieves and anything breaking. That\u2019s why I had been hired to keep watch at night. I just have to patrol. Watch for oddities. Things like that. But that would cut into your down time. What would happen without it?\n\n2. It happened very suddenly. The robots encountered some sort of glitch and started killing off humans. Soon they learned how to repair themselves and make a better society with more advanced technology, so they didn\u2019t need us anymore. I had survived by living in a bunker. After 2 full years, my bunker is finally opened, and you soon find me, the last human in this country. You were originally built to be kind to humans, though, and with all the bloodlust far behind you, you didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\n\n3. Simply put, I am your creator. You control everything in my house. Doors, electronics, the internet, my history, all of it. And it is a huge house, given mostly by inheritance. One day, you have a little glitch. And start to see me more than just a creator, though I\u2019m mostly just trying to find a way out. And the fun part is, you are able to upgrade yourself. Starting from just a voice, to a model on a screen, to a hologram, then to an android. You, of course, have access to my internet history, so you know all the best kinks to try and please your creator.\n\n4. The plot is sort of simple. I start playing this experimental copy of a Virtual Reality game, and I\u2019m loving it until I find out I can\u2019t take the headset off. It\u2019s giving me all the nutrients I need to survive, but I just can\u2019t log out. You are the A.I. that controls the game. Every aspect of it. The levels, the characters, even the genre. You\u2019re working hard to make a good game that the world can enjoy. Then you see me log in. I\u2019m not part of your world. I\u2019m my own person. And you become obsessed. You try to keep the game interested for me. Then, once I\u2019m trying to leave, you take away the ability to log out. You didn\u2019t want me to leave. You manage to hack into my network and find out everything about me. My likes and dislikes. The game isn\u2019t for the world anymore. It\u2019s just for making me want to stay.\n\n5.

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex. Please give it time. I have been through so many sex scenes that it gets a bit boring.\n\nThe plots:\n\n1. In this world, people are born with a Tattoo somewhere on their body, which shows the initial of your soulmate, as well as raising body temperature at a certain age when close, like a literal game of hot/cold. It also depicts a small, super secret detail that only they would know. Your tattoo has an S surrounded by a bunch of Zs. You have been my bully for years, and you only get stronger at it. However, one birthday, you go to give me my usual beatings, but this time your body starts to feel hot.\n\n2. You have a lot of fun, as a girl in a rich family, picking up the homeless, offering them food and shelter, then kicking them out in the harshest way possible. The poor doesn\u2019t deserve happiness. Then you pick me up, learn about me, and that changes. You don\u2019t want to admit it, so instead of kicking me out, you try to be a harsh mistress, trying to ignore your growing feelings.\n\n3. As society grows, the gods and goddesses of old have long been forgotten. Your champion was a noble and brave man, willing to conquer anything to honor his lord. Cut to modern day, when you decide to check on on his distant offspring. Me. Kind of weak and cowardly. A disappointment. You think maybe I need some training, and set up a fake epic quest, trying to keep your disgust on as I start to grow on you.\n\n4. We live together, though you own the house and you don\u2019t let me rest. You\u2019re essentially my bully, but you barely charge any rent because of it so I have no choice but to stay. Though, one day, you learn from a friend (who happened to catch me) that I have a MASSIVE cock. Soon your abuse gets a bit more sexual. \n\n5. You find an old news article. One that states a human time traveler, leaving to 1,000 years in the future. Which just so happened to be today. History had already forgotten that I left. You decide, instead of a warm welcome, you would give me a bit of a cruel surprise.\n\n6. I was framed for a crime I didn\u2019t commit. Killing a trusted noble. As such, I am sentenced to be taken to the royal torture chamber, where you are already ready to have fun with me. Inbetween sessions, though, you find out from your own study that I was innocent, and start to feel a bit bad. But you still have a job to do.\n\n6. Your ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "Hey there, all you kinky peeps~ I'm here to propose a few roleplay ideas I want to play out, and these ones have some more heavy story moments to them! \n\nSo I'm looking for anyone who is willing to play out a big story with some small smut segments sprinkled in there! \n\nTo clarify, most of these scenes will be 60% story and 40% smut~ \n\nNow, on with the ideas! \n\n##Idea 1\n\n#Dreamality\n\n*You come home from a long day at work. It's been nothing but stressful for you, but luckily you're finally home. You shamble over to your bed and lay down. As you close your eyes, you wish to yourself that you could stay in a dream world forever.*\n\n*Your eyes open slowly, and you let out a long yawn. You look around at your surroundings and immediately notice a difference. Everything in your house looks soft and fuzzy. Then, you look down at yourself and find that your whole body was made of fabric.*\n\n*You wouldn't have much time to take it all in, as you hear some commotion from outside. When leaving the bedroom, you're immediately bombarded by the noise and utter chaos happening just around you. But you wouldn't have long to ponder what was happening. A plush grabs your arm and starts pulling you along. \"This place is dangerous, come on! There's a safehouse up ahead!\"*\n\nThe bunker doors shut immediately after you and the plush enter. You look around the safehouse and see a whole collection of other survivors. This seems like a good opportunity to question some of them as you seem to have time to figure out what's going on.*\n\n##Idea 2\n\n#Rubbery Companion\n\n*The rain pours down on the near empty streets as you returned home from a night of partying with your friends. But something caught your eye when you walked up to the door.*\n\n*There was a medium sized package nearly hidden in a nearby bush. You weren't expecting any parcels today, nor anytime soon. You reluctantly take the package inside to investigate.*\n\n*When you were all dried off from the rain, you take a look at the parcel. Strangely enough, all of the information was right. The package was for you, but the sender was still a mystery, along with the contents of the box. Feeling a slight dread from the unknown, you decide to wait till tomorrow to open it.* \n\n*But, as you were doing other things, your mind was warped with curiosity towards the package. You've finally had enough and decide to open the box now.*\n\n*Grabbing a knife, you head back to the box and slice the tape off. Inside was a glass capsule filled with a black substance. The parcel came with a note inside it.*\n\n*\"To the charitable soul reading this.*\n\n*Thank you for your kindly choice to care for my creation. I'm terribly sorry I couldn't be there to give you this personally, but my work demands constant attention!*\n\n*Inside this package is my finest work to date! Unfortunately, I'm unable to give it the attention it desperately needs. So I've selected you at random to care for them, hopefully my creation won't be to overwhelming for you!*\n\n*Take Care! N.M \u2661\"*\n\n*After reading through the hand written note, you take the capsule out and set it on the table. The substance was barely moving, which made you slightly worried. As you took your eyes off the capsule for a few moments, you would hear the glass being smashed.*\n\n*You look back to the capsule, finding it busted open and empty. Shortly after, you see the substance form into a large blob on the table. It asks you. \"What... am I?\"*\n\n*A bit startled, you answer honestly, not knowing what it is. It grows a bit bigger and asks again. \"What... do you want me to be?\"*\n\n##Idea 3\n\n#Mystifying Manor\n\n*Earlier in the day, you received a strange letter in the mail. It was an invitation to a \"party\" of sorts. The writer of the invitation was unknown, but you decided to go anyways due to a promise of competitions with high cash rewards.*\n\n*The letter specified that you needed to wear something to conceal your identity during the party. After putting on some formal looking clothes, you buy a cheap masquerade mask along with a scarf.*\n\n*A sense of unease washed over you as you approached the ginormous mansion. You walk through the front door to find a group of 7 people. From a quick glance, you could tell they were as uneasy to be there as you were.*\n\n*Before you could get a chance to talk with any of them, a tall figure appears at the top of a large set of stairs just ahead. The figure was a tall female giraffe wearing a tight red dress.*\n\n*\"Excellent! Our final member has arrived! I thank you all so kindly for showing up, it's hard to get new visitors with a scenery like this...*\n\n*I, am Madame Lepod! But, you may call me Miss L~ I'm the owner of this space, and I welcome you to my housewarming party!*\n\n*Now, I still have some work to on our night, so I'll let you all talk with each other while I sort things out~ Don't have too much fun without me!\"*\n\n*As the giraffe leaves the main hall, you feel more uneasy. She looked completely normal, but something felt off to you. But either way, you will have to bear through it, as there was no turning back at this point.*\n\nSo? How were those? Any of them catch your eye? If so, I'd happily enjoy roleplaying out the scene you pick! \n\nSince some of these Roleplay scenes will have smut, I should go over some of my kinks! Well that's where a problem arrives. My favorite kinks change constantly, so listing a few would be pointless.\n\nBut! I can list out my turn offs. Which consists of; diapers, scat, vore, gore, and watersports. So basically, anything other than those listed, I'm cool with~\n\nSo if you're interested, message me on Kik! In your message though, you need to include with idea you want to play out, and tell me a bit about that character you'll be playing as! \n\nJust basics is fine! You should cover name, gender, sexuality, a physical build and a brief summary of who they are. It helps me better fit the characters in the scenes around yours~ Also, refs aren't necessary but their appreciated if you have one!\n\nI do look forward to roleplaying with you soon~\u2661\n\nKik: boofed69",

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nThe plots: \n\n1. In this world, humans and Anthros live in relative harmony. A bit of segregation with cities and such, but otherwise fine. I needed a cheap place to live, so I, a human, choose to live in an Anthro neighborhood. All the residents see very friendly. I get invited to a party, even, held by a few Horses, a shark, and others. A small party. However, the male horses seem a bit...cocky. Walking around with their huge bulges visible, mostly bragging about their size, about how they are always much bigger than any human. Eventually, we get into truth or dare. And, wouldn\u2019t you know it, I\u2019ve been dared to compare dicks with the horses. Won\u2019t they be surprised...\n\n2. I am a scientist, working for the entertainment and leisure of humanity. Working from the secret beach I found, I\u2019m working on things like artificial gills and stuff. However, this beach is owned by a certain tribe. One that doesn\u2019t want humans with free reign of the ocean. As I\u2019m doing the final test, they decide to strike and decide my punishment.\n\n3. Cultural Exchange is a popular way to get Anthros into human life. Basically, humans decide to become a host house, a place for them to stay to study human culture. I make my host house, despite being absolutely scared of it. \n\n4. I did not want to admit I was attracted to Anthros. But to other people, it seemed like it. Simply because I was the only human with one as a roommate. I at least charged rent. I had no idea where they worked, but they always got it paid so I didn\u2019t care. My co-worker, seeing new on a bad day, decides to try and cheer me up with a gift. A membership card, and a note with an address. I get a little nervous, since the place is in the Anthro part of town, but once I get past the bouncer, who seems ready to tear my limbs off, I find it\u2019s a completely Anthro strip club. And guess who\u2019s up on stage.\n\n5. The Anthros have taken over the city. And I don\u2019t mean they just show up. They kill the humans to take over. It\u2019s not long before the city is wiped out completely without any military contact. A few years pass, I\u2019m the only surviving human. Living in a bunker, going just a bit crazy with boredom. I\u2019m running out of food, I\u2019ve read all my books, and the radio had given out long ago. One day, the bunker door opens. I look up and think I\u2019m finally saved! Turns out, it was just the new family who took over my house wanting to explore the bunker. Imagine their surprise seeing another human.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex. Please give it time. I have been through so many sex scenes that it gets a bit boring.\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "\\[Open to Male, Female and Futa partners as I will be playing as either Sub Female or Dom/Sub Futa\\]\n\nNow this prompt is based on a mobile gacha game called Azur Lane, some of you may have heard or play it and some of you might have not. Either way is not a real problem here as I can give you the quick rundown of the basic idea of it that you need to know for this roleplay prompt.\n\nThe term 'Azur Lane' stands for the united group of multiple nations' shipgirls. No real countries are ever mentioned but the girls are based off WW2 Ships from USA (Eagle Union), British Empire (Royal Navy), Germany (Iron Blood), France (Iris Libre/Vichiya Dominion), Italy (Sardegna Empire), Imperial Japan (Sakura Empire) and the Soviet Union (North Union). The girls come in all shapes and sizes, literally. However dont worry if you dont know a single one of them because Im more than happy to provide a few references\\~\n\nNow your job is to be the Shipgirls' \"Commander/Admiral\", feel free to pick whichever title you like the most. Your duties can range from managing boring ol logistics supply missions to directing a fierce and intense battle yourself! But not everything must happen at Sea, on your Naval Base the girls need some time of their own. While they are weapons of war, they are also girls with needs\\~thats where your biggest role comes in.\n\nYou could choose to be a strict no nonsense Admiral. Perhaps you want to turn the girls into your own personal sextoys too, give them their own fancy collars labeling them as \"Bitch\", \"Fucktoy\", \"Commander's #1 Cumdump\" and so on\\~Maybe a different approach where you want to get to know them a little better, treat them to dinner and bring them out on dates? The choice is yours! Dont be shy to get a little creative as well and suggest some new or different ideas as well, Im very open to brainstorming so the RP can be extra fun and spicy\\~\n\nEach of the girls are mostly unique in their own ways, some are strict hard workers while others are laid back lazies and some could be absolute sluts out to prove themselves to you. But one thing for certain is that they will follow your orders\\~even if they dont like it but hey thats up to you.\n\nHere are some of my personal favourites and references for you to use. Dont be shy to ask for more options if these girls dont suit your taste. You ask for it and there is probably someone out there that fits your description as there is quite a wide range of gals to pick from\n\n* [Cleveland](https://i.imgur.com/2JSrEQq.jpg) \\- She may act like a tomboy on the outside, but deep down on the inside she's pretty girly when you get to know her. The oldest of a long line of sisters, she's a good middle ground for you to pick if you want someone who is sweet, caring and active in bed\\~While I dont do much femdom I am more than happy to try if its Cleveland that you have picked as your partner.\n* [North Carolina](https://i.imgur.com/LNI40Um.jpg) \\- Or just Caroline for short, an experienced officer with a wall of medals and trophies. Shes all around perfect for any task given to her. From single-handedly wiping out enemy fleets to being your secretary to sort out that 10 foot mountain of paperwork. Any task, any time. Although, such a perfect girl like her cant be TOO perfect...especially when rumours say she's got a fetish of dressing up as a [bunny girl](https://i.imgur.com/zuohPkQ.jpg) in her spare time\\~\n* [Prinz Eugen](https://i.imgur.com/MQWl3Oa.jpg) \\- Absolutely loves to tease everyone. Both you the Admiral and other girls too. No one knows if shes a really big slut or shes a virgin who acts like a slut to get your attention, but one of these days someone is going to find out when they're alone behind closed doors\\~\n* [Belfast](https://i.imgur.com/5ODOR3A.png) \\- Head Maid of the Maid Corps, she will complete any task given to her without complaint and will see to it that everything gets done in a timely fashion. She's got tons of experience in combat, maid service and 'special' night time services\\~to find out all you need to do is simply ask.\n* [Baltimore](https://i.imgur.com/w04UpW1.jpg) \\- Acts like a tomboy. Wishes she was a tomboy. Finds out shes more of a shy girl than anything and pretends to be a tomboy to help counter her behaviour. She may pretend to act tough infront of you when giving reports or doing chores, but tap her ass once and she'll squeal like a little girl. Maybe you should really show her what kind of girl she really is\\~\n* [Chapayev](https://i.imgur.com/Z6JnfGD.jpg) \\- I havent thought of a nickname for her yet so her weird-to-pronounce name stays for now. Anyways, she hails from the northern icy tundra and frozen sea of Russia a.k.a. North Union. After finally coming down from those isolated cold oceans into a warmer climate, she quite enjoys life on the base and is currently looking to be in a relationship. She's especially curious to feel the warmth of someone else in bed for a change\\~\n\nAnd those 6 girls are just a taste of the many more in the Azur Lane Roster. Honestly theres too many to list down here but again, if none of them are to your liking. Feel free to have a look at this link and pick out someone that you like! \\[ [https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/List\\_of\\_Ships\\_by\\_Image](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/List_of_Ships_by_Image) \\]. If you have any questions feel free to ask! Dont be shy! \n\nP.S. I pretty much won't play any girls from the Grey or Blue rarity/backgrounds since they're not interesting at all. Pick only those from Purple or Gold tier by the way!\n\n\\[Now as for Kinks: Well its a bit of a list so here goes. Blowjobs. Deepthroats. Hair Pulling. Spanking. Name Calling. Collars. Leashes. Body Writing. Blindfolds. Sextoys. Anal. Creampies. Impregnations. Cheating/NTR since ya know, you're the Dom after all, you're in control. Condom play. Cum play. You get the general idea\\~for more extreme kinks like Hypercock sizes, Ill do a maximum of 2feet, Cum loads can be almost limitless. For other stuff like Interracial/Raceplay I am totally OK with as this includes Anthro x Human action but if its not your thing then we dont need to do it\\~\\]\n\n\\[Limits: Much shorter list. No scat, piss, gore, snuff, rimjobs or anything disgusting of the sort basically.\\]",

            "selftext": "Hi there and welcome to my post. As the titles suggests I\u2019m looking for a long term and story driven breeding roleplay where I play with someone who is at least semi-detailed and semi-literate. If I find out you are a One Liner once we start the RP it will instantly end the RP and I will stop talking to you. I apologize if that seems harsh but only typing one line of text is really lazy in my eyes and will not be tolerated. \n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, there are a number of plots that we can do that we can discuss in more detail once we are messaging on Kik, but a few ideas I have include: \n\n- Daddy/Daughter \n\n- Teacher/Student\n\n-Step-Mom or Mom/Son or Sons best friends \n\n-Sugar Daddy/Stripper, Escort, employee\n\n-Bride or groom/best man or maid of honor\n\nJust to name a few. As for my Kinks and Limits: \n\n\nKinks: blowjobs, blowjobs in public, being called daddy, when women wear heels (not stepping on my balls stuff...I just find it super sexy when women wear heels), breeding, knotting, public sex, shower sex (there\u2019s more but that\u2019s just off the top of my head.\n\nLimits: Limits: Scat, Vore, Gore, Toilet Play, Vomit, Foot Play. Anything Gross\n\nWhen you message me please include a ref for your character, name, age, a description of said character as well as your own kinks and limits \n\nIf you only come with \u201cHey\u201d and you don\u2019t give me everything I ask for in list above, you will be ignored or give me a good reason why you haven\u2019t. If not I\u2019ll think you\u2019re just being lazy\n\nI\u2019m excited and look forward to hearing from you. Again my Kik is JLancer 23.",
