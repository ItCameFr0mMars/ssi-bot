I\u2019ve been a casual brony since my highschool days and with the show over and this damn quarantine, I find myself with a lot of free time for MLP to creep back into my mind. I\u2019m not a mega fan but I definitely like it and love NSFW stuff. Role play also is a new frontier for me, so why not combine them? I\u2019m casual and write till I\u2019m satisfied. I like matching my partner, though I think I cut myself off at one paragraph. I Mostly play a submissive male but can dom. I think what I\u2019m looking for is a GM, too? Someone to help guide the story. I\u2019m pretty limitless aside from scat, sounding and snuff. Big kinks are massive proportions, dom of any type, Futas, anal and very rough play. Feel free to make suggestions, anyone and everyone is welcome. So let\u2019s see what happens? I have some ideas so HMU if interested, would like to stay on reddit if that\u2019s cool. Also I don\u2019t really have refs so let me know what you like.",

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex. Please give it time. I have been through so many sex scenes that it gets a bit boring.\n\nPlots: \n\n1. Cultural Exchange is a popular way to get Extraspecies into human life. Basically, humans decide to become a host house, a place for them to stay to study human culture. I make my host house, despite being absolutely scared of it. To see what creature would be living with me.\n\n2. Strip Club: I did not want to admit I was attracted to Extraspecies. But to other people, it seemed like it. Simply because I was the only human with one as a roommate. I at least charged rent. I had no idea where they worked, but they always got it paid so I didn\u2019t care. My co-worker, seeing new on a bad day, decides to try and cheer me up with a gift. A membership card, and a note with an address. I get a little nervous, since the place is in the monster part of town, but once I get past the bouncer, who seems ready to tear my limbs off, I find it\u2019s a completely monster girl strip club. And guess who\u2019s up on stage.\n\n3. The people of my home town are suddenly terrorized by a monster. I had never seen it, but I knew I had to kill it. Heading out into the forest where it\u2019s said to live, I find that it\u2019s easier said than done.\n\n4. After years of war, humans are very nearly extinct. Monsters now control the cities, setting up their houses and societies. You happen to find an old bunker underneath your backyard. Inside it is me, a human who had survived 8 years underground, since I was a youngling. What will you do?\n\n5. After a hard day of bullying, and a full moon shining on my small bloodstones, I grasp them in my hand and wish for things to get better. I wasn\u2019t very spiritual, I was just doing it as a joke. But very soon, some of the people in my life start to evolve a little bit.\n\n6. Your ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

With a record of 8 wins and 8 losses, 6 of which were sexual knockouts (failed to get up before the 10 count after a fuck session). You loved it cause you were a little bit of a whore but also loved the idea of making a man kiss by using your cunt skills. But the new champion Chris (my bear sona) had just knocked out your idol Jessica (a Tiger) by kicking her square in the jaw. So\nNow you were up against Chris. Would you fall victim to his strikes or his cock? Or would you triumph and dethrone the champion? \n\n\n(THERE WILL BE MILD FIGHT BLOOD. MORE BRUISING THAN BLEEDING.)\n\nExpect to have a couple fights before Chris, and after Chris.

Your own body was naked underneath me, your shaft rising between both of our legs far surpassing my own. You always loved to tease me about our sizes and how cute mine was. Your head laid upon my shoulder as you smiled and nuzzled into my soft skin giving my ear a playful little nip. I shuddered as my shaft twitched, feeling you breath into my ear. \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s mommy\u2019s good boy~? Is it you~?\u201d You teased playfully, needing to be careful with how close you got. I could only whine in response as I gave out a soft sweet moan of pleasure. My body shuddered as I fought of the urge to blow. \n\nWe had been dating for almost half a year now and in that tome you had learned something amazing. I was incredibly sensitive to both touch and sound but only in specific places. Feeling your hand between my thighs was enough to make me cream my pants somewhat, so was rubbing just behind my shoulder blades. But what really seemed to push me over the edge in a moment was whispering into my ears. You had discovered this by accident but that didn\u2019t matter to you. \n\nIt happened while we were watching a movie, I was sitting in your lap because you had pulled me in close. While the movie was starting to wrap up you leaned into my ear and whispered something that is lost to us both but I moaned sweetly in response, a patch of wetness appearing as I suddenly blew my load. Embarrassed, I left your apartment immediately and went home. You didn\u2019t bring it up the next day but silently you planned, waiting for the perfect time to use what you had learned. \n\nAnd tonight was the night. I sat on your lap panting softly as you hold me close and cuddled my naked body. Taking out an extra small condom you slipped it onto my shaft, ready to watch my explode as your head rested upon my shoulder once more.",

            "selftext": "I am +18 years old, looking for people +18 years old. All characters are +18 years old.\n\nThe ability to change the perception of reality and make everyone submit to my desires wasn't something I'd always think off. It all started when I confess to a friend in college, and I got rejected. It all started with that whim.\n\nAfter that, I started to read and investigate a lot about ocultism, demonology and psychology. Since then I've been looking out for manuals, instructions, ocultism books, and any kind of lecture that could give me an oportunity to take advantage and fulfill my desires. Finally, in a book from the middle age, it was written something about commanding the reality through alchimic circles and demon traits. The only thing I could thought was: \"What else can I loose?\"\n\nSo, on a saturday night, in my house's backyard I drew the circles, gathered the items needed for the invocation and prayed to Mammon, the dark lord of Greed. The book said that at the end I should spill a little bit of my own blood in order to connect this world to the Underworld, and so I did. \n\nBut nothing happened. For real. I waited like 2 hours there. So, I decided it was all in vain and went to sleep. The next morning my mother awakened me. \n\n- \"Austin! Austin! Come see this, come see this!\" - My mom said, concerned.\n\nWhen I went to the backyard, well, there was no back yard. It was a giant pool of blood. The animals would run away from it and it gave a really bad vibe. I started to laugh. My mother didn't understand a thing, and was terrified. Then it happened. A lot of blood started to boil and the whole amount of blood started to concentrate on the original circle only to ended creating some humanoid form.\n\n-Devil: \"Ahhh, it was a long time. I really have to thank you, mortal.\" - it said in a deep voice.\n\nI was full of joy.\n\n- Me: \"So it actually worked, it worked!\"\n\n- Mother: \"WHAT WORKED?!?!\" - My mother asked.\n\n- Devil: \"Quite!\" - The demon said, staring at her and the next moment she couldn't move or talk anymore. I was surprised, but I had to take advantage of this moment - \"Mortal, are you aware of what you just did? \"\n\n- Me: \"I summoned you in order to get something, that's what I did!\" - I replied\n\n- Devil: \"Yes. And I will happily grant it to you...\"\n\n- Me: \"Great!\"\n\n- Devil: \" ...in exchange of something\"- An evil grin took form on its face.\n\n- Me: \"Well, I was expecting this to happen. You want my soul or something like that?\" - There was no surprise. Devil. Tricks. Deals.\n\n- Devil: \"Oh, wait, how do you know?\"\n\n- Me: \"A few things happened since 1000 B.C. you know? People now is more comunicated and there's a lot of researches about your kind. But don't worry, nowadays God has...\" - When I said that word, the demon started to scream.\n\n- Devil: \"AAAAAHHHH DON'T SAY IT... DON'T SAY IT...\"\n\n- Me: \"Wait, so I can torture you by saying... God?\"\n\n- Devil: \"AAAAAAHHHH!!! YOU SURE ARE SCUM, YOUR WHOLE KIND. I WILL END YOU ALL WITH...\"\n\n- Me: \"GOD?\"\n\nIt started to convulse\n\n- Devil: \"STOP! STOP IT!!!\"\n\n- Me: \"So, right now I'm asking to myself why aren't you leaving? Oh! I know!\" - Now the evil smile was on my face - \"You can't. Otherwise you would've already gone. Right?\"\n\n- Devil: \"I CURSE YOU MORTAL, YOU HAVE NO SHAME AFTER SAYING...\"\n\n- Me: \"GOD?\" - At this point I was already laughing with its suffering. - \"Wait, how is it that it was this easy but no one ever take advantage of this\"\n\nLaying on the ground the devil started to spoke.\n\n- Devil: \"UNLIKE YOU, AGES AGO PEOPLE HAD SOME FEAR OF... IT, A DROP OF SHAME FOR SUMMONING US! BUT YOU SUMMONED ME AND YET YOU HAVE NO FEAR IN NAME IT! YOUR LIFE WILL HAVE THE WORST OF THE PUNISHMENTS MORTAL!!!\"\n\n- Me: \"Yeah yeah, whatever, but the point here is that you can't leave until you've made a deal with me, the one who summoned you, right?\"\n\n- Devil: \"YOU ARE DEFINATELY TRASH\"\n\n- Me: \"I'll take that as a yes. This will be the deal. I won't torture you and you will give me what I want. No souls shit, or handshaking. Let's consider it a gift from you to me. Deal?\" - I said with a smile.\n\n- Devil: \"WHAT DO YOU WANT MORTAL\"\n\n- Me: \"Listen to my whim, filthy demon. I want the ability to manipulate the psyche of any living creature at will, and as much as I want to.\"\n\n- Devil: \"DON'T TELL ME THOSE FUCKING GREEKS LEFT SOME LEGACY.\"\n\n- Me: \"And I don't want any tricks. Otherwise I will summon you again and torture you until you fix it.\"\n\nThe demon sat on the ground and looked at me. Then it exhaled.\n\n- Devil: \"Even I have not that much of a power. If you want to do that, you'll need to make thisnpower groq with your own strenght and spirit. There are so many ways of using this power you are asking me that even if I don't trick you, you will have to learn how to use it properly.\"\n\n- Me: \"Yeah I know. Just give it to me already\"\n\nThe demon started smiling again. - \"IT WILL BE A PLEASURE\"\n\nThe demon jumped and pushed me to the ground, and before I could say a thing, he ripped off one of my eyes. Then, I passed out.\n\nI woke up after what it seemed to be hours. My mother still in the same position, trembling. There was no sign of this demon and I was covered in blood from head to toe. I didn't die!\n\n- \"Wha... what happened?\"\n\nMy mother still couldn't talk, but she looked terrified. She seemed to be trying to talk but couldn't.\n\n- \"Hey! Talk! What did happen?\" - But she didn't seem to be able to talk.\n\nWhat could it be? - I thought to myself. Wait, maybe this power works only if I name the person first. So, I held my mother's head in my hands and looked right into her eyes.\n\n- \"Clara, you are free to talk. Tell me what happened.\"\n\nJust then, she looked relieved and started talking.\n\n- \"The demon ripped off one of your eyes and put one of his own in your head. He also bited your throat and shoved his claws into your hands...\" - she explained to me.\n\n- \"Wait... so it worked?\" - I looked at my hands, and they had a big scar, like if a wild animal would've destroy my hands before. And it was hurting a lot. - \"I have to test this\"\n\nI kneeled in front of my terrified mother.\n- \"Don't worry, everything will be fine from now on.\"\nThen I grabbed my mom's head and said \"I want you to go to the house, wash all the blood stained clothes, take a shower and then head to your room, lay on the bed and fall asleep inmediately. When you wake up you won't remember a thing about this demon, the backyard covered in blood or anything related to the terror you are feeling. Today was just another normal day to you and nothing special happened\"\n\nThen, she stood up, and walked towards the house.\n\n\"Okey, so that's how it is...\"\n\nThen I went to the bathroom. I needed to clean myself.\nOnce in the bathroom I relaxed and cleaned off the blood. When I looked myself in the mirror, I started to tremble. \"HOLY CRAP, WHAT IS THIS?!?\n\nMy eye was the one of a snake. I closed my eyes and started to think.\n\n\"Just concentrate, there should be a way of changing that...just focus...focus...\"\n\n\nI opened my eyes and there it was, still there.\n\"Well. Fuck.\"\n\n\n- \"WELL FUCK INDEED DEAR SUMMONER\"\n\n\n- Me: \"What!?\" - The image in the mirror was talking. My own reflection was talking. \n\n\n- Devil: \"SINCE I GAVE YOU A PRESENT, NOW EVERYTIME YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR I WILL BE ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE ARE BOUND FROM THE MOMENT I GAVE YOU ONE OF MY EYES\" - It said, smiling.\n\n\n- Me: \"So, you are just going to annoy me every time I'll go to a toilet from now on?\"\n\n- Devil: \"Basically. Yes.\"\n\n\n- Me: \"What am I supposed to do with this creepy looking eye?\"\n\n\n- Devil: \"That's your problem, not mine!\"\n\n\n\n**OOC**\n\n*Hello DirtyPenPals!*\n\n*I'm Austin and I am 23 years old.*\n\n*I wanted to create a prompt with two things I really like: Mind Control and college prompts*\n\n*I'll be playing as a college student who made a deal with a devil, granting me powers to control other's minds.*\n\n*Today I'm looking for a Game Master as the title says. You will be playing characters who will be interacting with mine.*\n\n*I want this to be a really fun and entertaining roleplay, so there are three main things I would like to remark:*\n\n*1. My character will have a bad relationship with his devil, but friendship will grow up slowly. Eventually it will help me with my powers.*\n\n*2. I want my powers to have limits. In order to do that, I want to use a D&amp;D system (kinda) to roleplay, and let the dice decide whether I success or not in a task. I was thinking in creating an ability tree, with lot of feats I will be gaining as my character grows inside the rp.*\n\n*3. I want an enemy. An anthagonist inside the story. Someone who has supernatural powers too, and will end fighting against my character. Maybe it's another college student or maybe it's a leader of an entire organization or mafia.*\n\n*I don't care about your IRL sex or gender. Also, I don't expect you to be a novelist or have a lot of experience roleplaying. I just don't want oneliners. A paragraph or two will do it in order to get the plot on going.*\n\n*!!! This is the most important. I want someone enthusiastic when it comes to discuss stuff. I don't want people who doesn't care about little things. I really enjoy the plot discussion, and the people who enjoy it.*\n\n*I know everyone has a life, and sometimes you just can't answer. It's okay. I'd rather had you wait and write a high quality answer over a quick empty one. Communication is the key in a long-term roleplay.*\n\n*Extra points if you know at least a little bit of spanish.*\n\n*Althought, the roleplay won't be 100% NSFW, there will be plenty of smut and pornographic content as my character will take advantage of his powers, but I don't want it to be the only thing, otherwise it will become bored for the two of us. Besides, the thrill of the previous moments of seduction and control is way more exciting than sex scenes.*\n\n*Because of this I'm looking for open minded people with few limits.*\n*My strict limits are: no scat, no diaper play and no bestiality.*\n\n*And when it comes to kinks, I like anything related to domination and power dinamics.* *This roleplay will be about my character trying to dominate his environment little by little. My favourites are: being the bull in a cuckolding relationship, incest, corruption, sissies, nuns and harem.*\n\n\n*If you have any doubts about a kink, feel free to ask. I'm really open minded and will answer yes or no respectfully.*\n\n*Discord is a must.*\n\n*I would like to create a server just for the two of us, and have different channels: plot discussion, characters, in-character roleplay and images.*\n*I like a lot the idea of using anime pictures or porn actresses pics as references to representate the characters.*\n\n*When it comes to what characters will interact with mine:*\n\n*1. The family: A hardworking mom abandoned by her husband, a stressed old sister and a bratty little sister who doesn't recognize her family's efforts.*\n\n*2. College mates: My friends from college were angry at me because I didn't help them with a report, but maybe they will think it again, maybe they are truly sorry, and willing to do anything in order to have their good friend back.*\n\n*3. Best friends. Maybe my best friend and I tried to have something but didn't work due to society's labels. That doesn't mean sex slavery is out of the table for him, right? Maybe my childhood friend grew up to be a bratty bitch.*\n\n*4. Professors: Maybe Mr. Garrick secretely craves for cum, or maybe Ms. Dimm has trouble having a child due to her husband fertility problems.*\n\n*5. Swim teachers. I love swimsuits. Do I have to say more?*\n\n*6. The church. (I wrote nuns above, remember?) Maybe, this college is a religious one. Maybe a nun discovers me and tries to go against me.*\n\n*7.

            "selftext": " \n\n**READ ALL**\n\nI'm Dan, I'm an american on the east coast and i'm looking for someone literate to RP with. I'm good with anything from 5-6 PC lines to multi paragraphs but the longer the messages the longer it will take me to respond, I can only do so much heheh.\n\nI love average sized cocks, which is what my sona has, 5.3 inches to be exact, with huge hyper sized breasts and\\\\or asses, and I'll fuck anything with that size of ass and tits. So please no normal proportioned characters aside from my sona, it's just not as interesting for me then. I like Anthros, ferals, sometimes humanoids but that is rare, I prefer more animal looks so keep that in mind, but if you think I may like it feel free to show me.my Sona is a friendly but timid Wolfdog, but he can also be fairly dominant when he wants to. I love grinding moreso then peneration but I do both, and I love cum outside and on clothes, coating someone rather than filling.\n\nAs for what I want from a GM, as I said before I want someone literate and willing to do a lot, as much as you're willing for, I'm into a whole lot so I'll list off my main kinks and main hard passes just so that you know what you're getting into:  \nLikes:  \n\\-Hyper (For everyone except me basically, and not really for cocks in general, mostly just butts and tits)  \n\\-Emotionless (Time stop, Non existence, Mervas, No hypnosis)  \n\\-Watersports (sometimes)  \n\\-Well known characters (Pokemon, star fox, etc)  \n\\-Gore (sometimes)  \n\\-Watersports (Giving)  \n\\-Ferals (normal, but mostly Thicc and/or busty)  \n\\-Grinding (I.E. Titfucking, hotdogging, thighjobs)\n\nNo-s:  \n\\-Vore  \n\\-Micro/Macro  \n\\-Non-consent (outside of emotionless stuff like time stop or non existence, I don't count those as the same)  \n\\-Cucking (Same as Non-consent)  \n\\-Huge muscles  \n\\-Filth-Scat\n\nAnything other than those is free game for me and I'll probably touch on it. Of course being a GM I also expect you to know what you're getting into in terms of what you'll be playing, you won't be sticking to one character instead moving between different ones or even groups which I prefer. They will not interact with me and there will be nothing personal going on, unless you have someone tagging along with me to help with my emotionless stuff, maybe to cheer me on, to watch, or to help me get more intimate, up to you. And finally I would love if you could grab reference pictures for any new characters that I'm going to have fun with for a while, so don't worry about any minor things like if I were to toss something on someone for them to not notice you don't need to grab a pic for that.\n\nFinally I'll do a brief explanation of the three emotionless things I want\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.  \n(For this I have the idea that the whole world will basically be about me, every company, ad, art piece, commercial, TV show, video game, etc. and I'm just basically a god and such, so I get to have and do whatever I want)\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: @ DanTheCzechWolfDog  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA  \nOr just PM me!",

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\n\n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home alone randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of FurryRP! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main cheerleader. Velvet could be shared or pimped out.\nThey characters themselves could be throwaways or permanent. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed!\n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks!  \n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building and if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well) So I'm looking for a good 60/40 when it comes to smut vs story. \n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 3-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*The keyword I've left amidst my silly prompt. \n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that.\n\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n***In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n***I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer), wrestler, track and field. Dancer, acting, arts, etc. The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\n\n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home alone randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of FurryRP! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main cheerleader. Velvet could be shared or pimped out.\nThey characters themselves could be throwaways or permanent. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed!\n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks!  \n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building and if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well) So I'm looking for a good 60/40 when it comes to smut vs story. \n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 3-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that.\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n**In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n**I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer) track and field. Dancer, acting, arts,  The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

For a time, she was happy, but several years after Christopher returned home he began to spend less and less time with his family. Consumed by work and prestige he neglected his wife, his daughter. He was to busy to notice the needs of his wife. So she decided to take matters into her own hand and look for a secluded spot to pleasure herself. But a secluded spot was hard to come by, hence she went to the only place she knew would be able to give her the required privacy. The 100 acres wood, was previously shown to her by her husband and he even introduced her to the residents there including Tigger. What she didn't know however was that, the 100 acre woods have this quality that whoever visits there, their mood impacts the entire nature of the woods, for instance when Christopher Robin was stressed out and visited there, the weather there was gloomy, the residents sad.*\n\n*So what happens if Evelyn Robin, after enduring so much of ignorance from her husband and unable to find a quite place, where she could practice some self love, decides to go down to the woods for some...privacy? The over-eager tigger would surely get impacted won't he? He might get effected and turn into a taller and muscular version of himself, who is tremendously horny. Putting Evelyn, the conservative 1940's English wife in a predicament, where despite being a loyal and loving wife, she would struggle as she is tempted to give in to her desires.*\n\nRegarding post lengths - I like to keep it quick flowing, so I tend to do 2-4 sentences per post, but I also try to keep it detailed.

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\n\n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home alone randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of FurryRP! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main cheerleader. Velvet could be shared or pimped out.\nThey characters themselves could be throwaways or permanent. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed!\n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks!  \n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building and if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well) So I'm looking for a good 60/40 when it comes to smut vs story. \n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 4-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that.\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n**In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n**I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer) track and field. Dancer, acting, arts,  The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

Male, female, shemale. I don\u2019t really care for kinks. I\u2019m fine with most kinks but some are a bit to much. We can discuss what kinks you have in discord. \n\nI rp as a dragon/snake hybrid, age depends on rp but he\u2019s mostly in his 20s. If i suddenly stop talking it\u2019s not because I dislike the rp, it\u2019s because I got sleepy and feel asleep or was busy with something else.\n\nSome of my favorite kinks are \nWatersports \nBeing called \u201cdaddy\u201d or \u201cmaster\u201d\nBegging\nCreampies\nPetplay\nCollers\nBdsm\n\nHere\u2019s my discord \n\n\ud83d\udc09\ud835\udd6e\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd99\ud835\udd9e\ud835\udd8a \ud835\udd92\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd8c\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd88 \ud835\udd89\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd8c\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd93\ud83d\udc09#7076",

            "selftext": "\nRei and I had been friends for as long as I could remember. We were both born on the same day, grew up in the same neighborhood, went to the same school, and were basically sisters as far as anybody was concerned. So whenever she told me she was pregnant, I was shocked and was jealous, I mean we were only recent graduates from highschool and were both taking a gap year, so while she could\u2019ve gotten knocked up safely, I didn\u2019t think she had it in her! Once I found out, baby fever started hitting me hard and I accidentally let it slip to her that I wanted a baby as well. She asked me what I\u2019d do to be knocked up and I foolishly answered \u201canything.\u201d She grabbed my hand and pulled me upstairs, to her brothers room.\n\n\n\n\nShe opened the door and her brother stood up, he was a few years older than us, 21 to our 18, but I was still a distant friend to him. \u201cAlright, here\u2019s my brother, Zen, he\u2019s like me, but single and hopeless.\u201d She said, smiling, rubbing her bump up against my back. \u201cHey!\u201d Zen said, clearly embarrassed at being intruded on. \u201cZen, this is Kat, she really needs to get pregnant.\u201d She said, I blushed, my heart raced faster with adrenaline. \u201cI\u2019ll go to your place and pack you a suitcase Kat, you can have the room down the hall... you\u2019ll look so cute when you\u2019re knocked up!\u201d She waddles out with her 6 month belly and shuts the door, leaving me and Zen alone. I back against the wall and blush furiously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey all! I\u2019ve been wanting to do this RP for a while but finally worked up the desire to post it. Rei and Zen are wolf anthros and I\u2019m a spotted Leopard anthro\n\nTo prove you\u2019ve read this far put \u201cyou will never reach the truth\u201d somewhere in your reply!",

If you feel inclined to do so, they might not be for everyone, so.\n\nWell, suppose I'll get into the details of what we'll do, yeah?\n\nWell, I'm a switch myself, so I'm a little picky about how I'll roleplay, so let me explain:\n\nWhen  subbing, I usually prefer to be more cute, playing as smaller beings,  like a slugcat, dewott...Oshawott, and such. I have a few character  ideas for myself, regarding subbing, heh.\n\nSo, with that being said...Now onto my trainwreck opinions when it comes to domming\n\nI,  uh...Prefer to be weird or spooky things, y'know...Gorillas, horses,  giant fuckin' insects, werewolves, creepy perverts, ghosts, maybe...Etc,  it's quite weird, so. Not sure why, I just find it really hot when a  girl does stuff to one of those-...So, there's that.\n\nThat's about it for the roleplay bits, I'll list my kinks and dislikes below:\n\nKinks:\n\n* Huge breasts, of course! I can't get enough of 'em.\n* Outfits,  ranging from cute to lewd...Lewd being, like...Bikinis, towels,  underwear, etc. Cute being dresses, hoodies, sweaters and so on! I  suppose glasses are kinda hot too.\n* Undressing via unique ways, like having your clothes torn off or blasted off, etc.\n* Foreplay! I prefer it over normal sex for...Some reason, I guess it's just more entertaining\n* Tittyfucking\n* Face-sitting.\n* Creepy locations are fun! Like abandoned houses or creepy schools, etc. I'm a fan of spooky stuff.\n\nThat's all of my favorites, I could list more if you want, just ask.\n\nLimits:\n\n* Scat, farting or vomiting, the u s u a l.\n* Pregnancy\n* I dislike lactation for...Some reason, I really don't know why honestly-\n\nWell, that's really about it for my major dislikes\n\nTo anyone who's interested, feel free to give me a message at:\n\nKik: Agif11214\n\nOr\n\nDiscord: Razor#8751\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Oh, here's the imgur.](https://imgur.com/a/yVfauOV)",

Wether you have kids or not is not my issue, you get to choose how your character lives.\n\nNext door lives a pretty familiar neighbor and his daughter (me). Recently, the neighbor's daughter has really been starting to get a bit touchy feely with you and it's really been starting to make you feel uncomfortable.

The TV crackles with electricity as an older white man in a safari outfit comes into frame in front of a rain-forest background.\r\n\r\n\"Hello there, Welcome to Discovery Park, the world's first Animal kin sanctuary and Zoological gardens. We're so happy to have you on board.\" The camera zooms in more \"This is an informational tape to help you decide, what you want to do here.\" Pan to a path where the host begins to walk down \"Discovery Parks wants Staff that are passionate and engaging with our animal-kin. We like to look for candidates that demonstrate leadership, kindness, passion, and creativity when it comes to the care, handling, and showmanship of our animal kin.\" Hard cut to a large fountain with many animal head spitting out water. \"If you're seeing this tape, that means there's a few jobs open to the zoo. Let's go over them now!\"\r\n\r\nA list forms of occupations\r\n\r\nZookeeper-\"Zookeepers are the bread and butter of our mission to provide the absolute best care to our animal-kin here at our Zoo. This job entails some long hours but the experience is truly rewarding. You'll be responsible for feeding and cleaning the animal-kin. your observation will help our Vet techs with their work. Beyond that, you are to also aid other staff members and interact with the public with information about the animal-kin.\"(kinks: semi-free use, public play, anal, oral.)\r\n\r\nVeterinary technician-\"Being a Vet Technician is hard work as such is one of the hardest jobs to do in this zoo. Your responsibility is to take care of and tend to ill or wounded animal kin that we take through our doors. It is an unfortunate fact that like all things, animal kin do die, sometimes beyond our own circumstances. If you decide to work as a Vet tech, you'll be taught how to administer euthanasia to animal-kin we cannot help any longer.\" (kinks: gentle dom, medical play, toys, bondage, milking.)\r\n\r\nBreeder and orphan care specialist-\"This is a unique position in our program as many of the animal-kin we get do not have natural partners for breeding. We certainly try and deal with obtaining proper female or male partners for our animal-kin, we're not always able to do that. So our group of zoological scientists have worked to make this a position where you can interact directly with the animal-kin and help preserve their population. You'll also be responsible to raising and taking care of smaller animal-kin who have been rejected by their mothers. For this aspect of this job, please talk to the staff member showing this tape and see if you're right for this job.\" (kinks: impregnation, lactation, and rapid gestation.)\r\n\r\nAnimal kin trainer- \"Last but certainly not least for entry positions, we have our animal-kin trainers. These folk work hard to train the animal kin to exhibit behaviors and do tricks for our public shows. You won't need as much scientific background here but a strong showing in public speaking and stage presence is sure to get you good marks. Many find that this job can be rewarding as you create more of a personal bond with your animal kin. (kinks: public play, toys, D/s relationship, power play.)\r\n\r\nAnimal-kin supervisor- \"This job is only for those who have experience with all four jobs. You'll be training other staff members in all areas of the Zoo and you'll be looked to handle the tougher animal-kin and carry responsibility for an entire area of the Zoo.(kinks: open to anything.)\r\n\r\nCuts back to host sitting on top of a picnic table with a slight breeze moving through his hair.\r\n\r\n\"That covers the section on job opportunity, let's talk safety. Animal-kin here are generally very tame. They have either been raised by humans or have enough exposure to them that they aren't vicious. But remember, animal-kin are stronger than humans and sometimes will lash out if threatened or stressed. It's important for your safety and the safety of our furry, scaly, and feathered friends that you comply to all the specific guidelines in the employee handbook. If you have any questions please contact the staff member nearby.\" Zoomed in so that just his face is on screen. \"I want to tell you again, how thankful we are to have you here at Discovery Park. We hope to see you-\" he points at the screen \"Have a wild day!\"\r\n\r\nExit music plays and tape stops.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, so this prompt was originally written with me as the GM of sorts in mind but frankly I wasn\u2019t interested in it from that perspective so you will be the GM, we can choose any route but personally I prefer breeder as it\u2019s by far the most fun.

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home at (if you've read this far, in your first message include the word, pineapples) randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of Furryrp! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story (if you've read this far include, caramelldansen) we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main cheerleader. Velvet could be shared or pimped out.\nThey characters themselves could be throwaways or permanent. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed!\n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes (if you've come this far, H2O) to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks! \n\n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building and if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well) So I'm looking for a good 60/40 when it comes to smut vs story. \n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 3-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that.\n\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n***In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n***I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer), wrestler, track and field. Dancer, acting, arts, etc. The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

I have some real popular characters, I have some unheard of characters (I am not a real artist).\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

Selfish, I know I know. but that's the whole point of a fantasy eh? Anyways for this I'd need you to be detailed, maybe not multi-paragraph but usually at least one paragraph per response but it doesn't need to be consistent. You'll also need to be good with size different since the size of my sona and the residents are very much different and also alright with hyper/huge assets for them, but not myself, if you are ok with that then good\n\nWhat I want out of it is for my sona, a fairly averaged sized wolfdog, averaged in every way, and that will not change. to have his own world, cities, towns, kingdoms, anything, all of which have him at it's center, all of them full of thick, and/or busty inhabitants, can be both Anthro and Feral or just Feral, whichever you'd prefer. and in which I'd go around and just enjoy whatever I'd please to, looking at how every TV show no matter what has me staring in some prominent and lewd way, such as a cooking show with me fucking the host or some advertisement for movie in which I play with the cast, not only fucking them but making just playing around with their thick bodies or anything else around. things of that sort, I'd even be on any product like bottles of water or video games.\n\nThough mostly when I go out and walk around I'm not noticed unless I want to be so I can really take in and watch everyone go about normally through this all, of course in an instant I can make any of them do whatever I want, like make them all notice me intently and such, but that cums later. This doesn't have to be in a modern setting per say, though I prefer it, it could be more futuristic, or maybe more medieval though that would be harder to do for sure.\n\nAnyways we can dicuss kinks and ideas and plots more once you contact me, I'd like you to do so at any of my following accounts but through reddit can work. When you do please message me with \"Hello small woof\" So I know you have read everything, thank you for reading, please message me if interested\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: @ DanTheCzechWolfDog  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA",

In this strange box lays an amulet. This amulet has the power to change reality as we see fit, and with our changes, come an acceptance of how things are now without others questioning it. Those of whom were there for the finding of the amulet (you and I), are and will always only be able to activate the amulet's power. We can decide how loose our words need to be to transform/change reality but in turn we can change ourselves into whatever we want, dragons, animals, you name it. The more that we come too learn about our power, the greedier we soon  become, wanting to change other people to do our bidding. As we delve deeper into changing other people, we become to transform irreversibly into dragons (possibly baby dragons in body, older in mind, or both young if you're down). We have started a club at the college, in order to bring people in, promising change but in the end make them happy with their new forms, and/or make them believe they are fine the way they are (That we just turned them into), and provide mental help instead! **((Wanting weight gain, transformation, gender TF, heavy slob(scat, wetting), possibly diaper usage, age regression))**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCow Job RP\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK    so, essentially I have this idea  where a couple of dudes (or girl  and   dude) are down on their luck for.  Jobs, just out of college, and  are   given the opportunity or possible  opportunity of their lives. A    interview is setup with one of the most  important milk farms in the    country. What they don't know is that deep  within this highly secretive    company is a deep, massive underground cow  society, built miles into    the earth housing living Spaces, stores,  entertainment, the    factory/work area, etc. We think we're going in for  desk jobs or IT    work, but we're promised a huge salary, some benefits,  and without    really knowing what we're getting into we sign.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're     shown to our new living quarters, absolutely large living areas for    two  future cows. We share a two bed two bath apartment together. As    time  goes on, we get injections that gradually turn us into cows, and    we get  fatter and fatter too, building a romance as time goes on. I'd    like if  there were open defecation and urinating, but not absolutely    required.  The rp would be long term and involve romance, slice of  life,   and other  such things.",

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\n\n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n=================================================\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home alone randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of FurryRP! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main cheerleader. Velvet could be shared or pimped out.\nThey characters themselves could be throwaways or permanent. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed!\n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks!  \n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building and if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well) So I'm looking for a good 60/40 when it comes to smut vs story. \n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 3-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that.\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n***In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n***I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer), wrestler, track and field. Dancer, acting, arts, etc. The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

            "selftext": "I sat naked upon your lap, my cheeks a soft pink as my small erection stood up between my legs by no will of my own. Your own body was naked underneath me, your shaft rising between both of our legs far surpassing my own. You always loved to tease me about our sizes and how cute mine was. Your head laid upon my shoulder as you smiled and nuzzled into my soft skin giving my ear a playful little nip. I shuddered as my shaft twitched, feeling you breath into my ear. \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s mommy\u2019s good boy~? Is it you~?\u201d You teased playfully, needing to be careful with how close you got. I could only whine in response as I gave out a soft sweet moan of pleasure. My body shuddered as I fought of the urge to blow. \n\nWe had been dating for almost half a year now and in that tome you had learned something amazing. I was incredibly sensitive to both touch and sound but only in specific places. Feeling your hand between my thighs was enough to make me cream my pants somewhat, so was rubbing just behind my shoulder blades. But what really seemed to push me over the edge in a moment was whispering into my ears. You had discovered this by accident but that didn\u2019t matter to you. \n\nIt happened while we were watching a movie, I was sitting in your lap because you had pulled me in close. While the movie was starting to wrap up you leaned into my ear and whispered something that is lost to us both but I moaned sweetly in response, a patch of wetness appearing as I suddenly blew my load. Embarrassed, I left your apartment immediately and went home. You didn\u2019t bring it up the next day but silently you planned, waiting for the perfect time to use what you had learned. \n\nAnd tonight was the night. I sat on your lap panting softly as you hold me close and cuddled my naked body. Taking out an extra small condom you slipped it onto my shaft, ready to watch my explode as your head rested upon my shoulder once more.",

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home at (if you've read this far, in your first message include the word, pineapples) randomly when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of Furryrp! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests involves dub-con prostitution, she could be suggested or be *bullied* into it. This idea can also change to practically anything else that fits the theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\nVelvet also doesn't know about the cheerleader's dirty, big secret either. She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partners preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the\\-*ah*\\-servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers, this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story (if you've read this far include, caramelldansen) we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. And I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main cheerleader. Velvet could be shared or pimped out.\nThey characters themselves could be throwaways or permanent. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed!\n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want to be treated like trash. Like I'm worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to you. No I don't want to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a tad.*\n\nWe can converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how wet she gets hearing her bully's voice. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. \n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes (if you've come this far, H2O) to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would. So yes, this is a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks! \n\n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term so due to this I'm looking for buildup to smut. Don't get me wrong, I *love* smut and there will be plenty of it but I need it to slowly unravel into it for character and plot building and if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well) So I'm looking for a good 60/40 when it comes to smut vs story. \n\n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person, if 3-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that.\n\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n***In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n***I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer), wrestler, track and field. Dancer, acting, arts, etc. The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

            "selftext": "\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into my writing, and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to a lot of different suggestions when it comes to stories or whatever. Don't be afraid to ask if something sparked your imagination.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more like casual things, though. I personally don't have any fetishes, unless something such as titfucking counted. Other than that, I'm rather \"vanilla\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards like scalie characters, like sharks, dragons, etc. but only a little. Also does/deers. Like I said, not a deal-breaker whatsoever. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there. Though to be fair, I might prefer a little bit more detail, it helps keep it interesting. All I can say is the more detail the better. But don't stress about it!\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n   * *In summary, I love adding detail, and if you can add detail when you can, and write a lot, even though it's optional, it really improves the experience for the both of us. Who knows? It might even help you when you go to RP with others in the future! All I can say is just try your best, but don't overwhelm yourself. I apologize if my own writing might seem too long at times and it overwhelms you, so let me know if it does.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex, Remy, and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely. Not a deal-breaker whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before.\n   * He graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. He attended school in Los Angeles but graduated in Japan (he spent his senior year at a high school in Gunma). He then went back to L.A. and got a degree in computer science. He's a gamer and works part-time at home as a game developer, but he also has a YT channel for music and other content.\n   * His car is a 1983 Toyota AE86 Trueno Hatch. He bought one stock in Japan with a white and black two-tone (officially called \"High-Tech Two-Tone\" by Toyota), and a maroon interior. He then got it imported back in L.A. and made visual changes, mostly yellow foglights on the front and black Watanabe RS 8-Spoke rims.\n   * Jack has never been in a relationship before because he just figured he wasn't good with women. In high school he was also picked on quite a lot so his shyness just kinda stuck with him. He *loves* meeting new people though, he's just shy is all.\n   * Jack isn't much of a drinker, either. He only drinks in small amounts if at all.\n   * Jack is also a bilingual character. He speaks English, his main language of course, but while in Japan his senior year, he learned Japanese and likes to speak it. In some cases, he might say something or other in Japanese, mostly when he feels nervous or under pressure, but he tries to keep it to a minimum in public as it embarrasses him, and makes him feel like he stands out.\n   * *In summary, Jack's really a sweetheart. He just strives to be a good person and be good to others, especially in a society where people like him are rather rare.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. But I'm great with Telegram, too. My info is below.\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these, more specifically people like me, who enjoy the writing aspect and the build-up of the characters.\n\nIf my info above doesn't work or if you need assistance with adding me, you can send me a Reddit message.\n\nThanks, and have a great day, you amazing people. I've met some very creative and inspiring people on here and I just wanted to say how much a guy can appreciate that. Thank you.",

I live with you even though I barely know anything about you. I\u2019ve never seen your room, but the real important part is your secret room, with all your communications and technology. I find your secret room one day.\n\n3. I am an inventor and I have found a way to travel to other inhabited planets quick and in secret. During my exploration, the device apparently breaks on your home planet.\n\n4. Of course, I have to add that you crash land around my house and I take you in while you make repairs. It\u2019s a classic plot.\n\n5. A harsh ash starts to rain down onto the earth. Coming from giant ships in the sky. The women who breathe it in seem to change. Bigger busts, thicker lips, dumber minds. The men become violent, aggressive, with massive \u201ctools.\u201d I happen to have some sort of immunity to the ash (but still massive ;) ) Will I succumb to this new world? Will I find a cure? More immune humans? Will the aliens find me for my special dna? Only you can tell.\n\n6. Anything you want\n\nBonus points if you want to get really weird and kinky, like adding some of my worship kinks or having really long tongues. I dunno. \n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\n(Always Looking)\n\nI much prefer plot development and teasing over just pure sex.\n\nAnyway, the plot ideas:\n\nI am ok with any of your sizes, ranging from like 8 feet tall to mountain-sized.\n\n1. I am a human, lost in the woods, dizzy from dehydration and the like. After wandering through some (arguably strange looking) tree groves, I somehow finally pass out in the land of giants (and giantesses). Most of the inhabitants want to kill me, torture me, eat me, etc., but one gentle giant wants other plans.\n\n2. We have been dating for a while, and you want to try new things. You had bought a pill, advertised to make your \u201cassets\u201d much bigger. Outside my house, you take the pill, and then we go out on our date. During the date, though, it doesn\u2019t seem like just your breasts are growing...\n\n3. All my life, I have been told to never leave the outskirts of our town. And I hated it. I wanted to leave and explore. So one day I do. And I keep walking until I reach a mountain to climb. A very soft mountain. Almost felt like Skin. I found out the truth at the top. A Giantess sleeping on the earth was right under my feet. And hopefully my feet don\u2019t wake her up...\n\n4. I\u2019ve died. And I\u2019ve gone to either heaven or hell (your choice). Their absolute ruler happens to be a Giantess, a natural leader who knows everyone\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. You have seen many walk these lands, but I seem different. I have a different aura than the others. You treat me differently from the other souls (be it good or bad).\n\n5. You are an experimental woman in an underground facility who can shapeshift. To great lengths. You can become as small as a baby ant or as big as the earth if you wanted to. You can look like any man, woman, animal, even objects. And using these skills, it was easy to escape to the nearest surface home. To my home. I was tested on as a baby but I don\u2019t remember it. I have quick healing, precision accuracy, and the only downside is the fact that my semen is extremely addicting.\n\n6. Your ideas. Come to me!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale!\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do.
