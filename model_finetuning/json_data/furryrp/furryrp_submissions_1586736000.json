I\u2019d like to start this off by thanking you for even stopping to read this, it means a lot to me!!\n\nWhat I was thinking was we could do something like this...\n\nYou had been neighbors with Alexis in the same apartment building for a few years, and every 6 months, you hear her rustle around in her room, then zoom out the door. She would always come back a few weeks later. You never actually saw her leave, you just heard her, so you didn\u2019t know what exactly she was doing each time. \nOne day, you realized you were low on milk, so you decided to head to the grocery store. You come out of your room, and you hear Alexis rustling in her room again. You were walking past her door when it suddenly slams open, she comes running out, and accidentally running into you and knocking herself and you over. You look over at her to see she\u2019s wearing super short  shorts with a roll of condoms around each of her thighs, and a white shirt that says \u2018free sex\u2019. She looks at you, her face red as she says, \u201ch-heya..\u201d\n\nI can go into so much more detail, and I\u2019m open to lots and lots of kinks! \n\nMy kinks are: Groping, Spanking, fingering, lactation, milking, rough sex, large loads of cum, shy doms, small doms, dirty talk, anal, blowjobs, and toys!\n\nMy only limits are: blood, gore, watersports, feces, vore, abuse, drugs, and rape.\n\nSend me a DM if you\u2019d like to roleplay!!

            "selftext": "\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into my writing, and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to a lot of different suggestions when it comes to stories or whatever. Don't be afraid to ask if something sparked your imagination.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more like casual things, though. I personally don't have any fetishes, unless something such as titfucking counted. Other than that, I'm rather \"vanilla\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards like scalie characters, like sharks, dragons, etc. but only a little. Also does/deers. Like I said, not a deal-breaker whatsoever. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there. Though to be fair, I might prefer a little bit more detail, it helps keep it interesting. All I can say is the more detail the better. But don't stress about it!\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n   * *In summary, I love adding detail, and if you can add detail when you can, and write a lot, even though it's optional, it really improves the experience for the both of us. Who knows? It might even help you when you go to RP with others in the future! All I can say is just try your best, but don't overwhelm yourself. I apologize if my own writing might seem too long at times and it overwhelms you, so let me know if it does.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex, Remy, and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely. Not a deal-breaker whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before.\n   * He graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. He attended school in Los Angeles but graduated in Japan (he spent his senior year at a high school in Gunma). He then went back to L.A. and got a degree in computer science. He's a gamer and works part-time at home as a game developer, but he also has a YT channel for music and other content.\n   * His car is a 1983 Toyota AE86 Trueno Hatch. He bought one stock in Japan with a white and black two-tone (officially called \"High-Tech Two-Tone\" by Toyota), and a maroon interior. He then got it imported back in L.A. and made visual changes, mostly yellow foglights on the front and black Watanabe RS 8-Spoke rims.\n   * Jack has never been in a relationship before because he just figured he wasn't good with women. In high school he was also picked on quite a lot so his shyness just kinda stuck with him. He *loves* meeting new people though, he's just shy is all.\n   * Jack isn't much of a drinker, either. He only drinks in small amounts if at all.\n   * Jack is also a bilingual character. He speaks English, his main language of course, but while in Japan his senior year, he learned Japanese and likes to speak it. In some cases, he might say something or other in Japanese, mostly when he feels nervous or under pressure, but he tries to keep it to a minimum in public as it embarrasses him, and makes him feel like he stands out.\n   * *In summary, Jack's really a sweetheart. He just strives to be a good person and be good to others, especially in a society where people like him are rather rare.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. But I'm great with Telegram, too. My info is below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these, more specifically people like me, who enjoy the writing aspect and the build-up of the characters.\n\nIf my info above doesn't work or if you need assistance with adding me, you can send me a Reddit message.\n\nThanks, and have a good day.\n\n# IMPORTANT NOTICE! Read this, please.\n\nLook, I don't mean to rant, but this stuff just really bothers me.\n\nFairly recently, people on this subreddit have been constantly adding me on platforms such as Discord and Telegram, asking if I wanted to RP. Not even a minute later, I get blocked by the same person.\n\nThis has happened over 20+ times. I don't get it. I never did anything.\n\nI wish people would stop this. Everyone's always so friendly and kind and such in the beginning. And then for whatever reason I'm blocked and never hear from them again as long as I live.\n\nAll this does is just upset me, and it's making my depression spike. Don't fucking add me if you're gonna do that to me. I'm so fucking done with it. I try to be the nicest I can but then people just do this sorta shit. Because I don't know what I even did to begin with, and I can't fix what I don't know is broken. I want to stay on people's good sides, and make some friends. But apparently I can't even do that because literally everyone I meet on here will add me and then block me a minute later after a salutation. I feel horrible about this. I needed to speak up because this has happened too many times now.\n\nSo please, *please*, don't do this. All you're doing is just making me feel bad. Nobody deserves to be treated like this. All people do are either block me or in some cases just ghost me.\n\nI apologize for ranting, but when it happens several times it sorta gets to you. I hope you people can understand where I'm coming from. We're all human, we all make mistakes, we all have feelings. Please understand this.",

We can come up with some things together.\n\nMy References include two ferals and two anthro characters.\n\nFerals: Horse, Wolf (My personal OC) and another canine. For my Anthro's, it'll be another horse , and a dog. Pictures on request!\n\nIf you wish for me to play as any other species, let me know and I could dig around for something you'd like.\n\nHope to see you!",

Well, I'd like another species say a horse, feline, or perhaps a wild canine such as a wolf that can look down on my for my status as a canine/husky. For instance maybe I'm a BHC (Big Horse Cock) lover, complete with a horseshoe tattoo right above the base of my tail. Perhaps you're a feline that sees me a stupid doggy bimbo? Or maybe I get lost in the wrong part of town/the forest and run into a pack of wolfs that want to have their way with a pretty little thing like me. \n\nKINKS: Pretty much a little bit of everything: if there's something that turns you on feel free to ask. Heck even if furry race play sounds awful to you still message me, I'm extremely open.\n\nLIMITS: You (and your character) must be 21 years or older.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHeya! My name is Dan! I'm looking for a sub willing to play Multiple characters for my sona, he's an anthro Czechoslovakian wolf-dog even if he doesn't look it. He's 5\"9 with a 5-6 inch cock. I'll show his references and bio when you message me. He loves to either dominate huge partners or be smothered and cottled by them\n\nFor the subs I want Multiple, at least 3, for my sona, I love having two big asses or sets of tits pressing against me, or a mix of the two. I'd also like that this could be a canon character situation or you can find refs of randoms. If we do canon characters it could be something like my boy getting a team of thick pokemon. Or maybe he is in some other game like Star fox or Paladins and the characters there have a crush on him. We can brainstorm plot and characters when we chat  \n\n\nThere is also the option for doing an RP more about emotionless and public sex, not with hypnosis or non con or anything, though sorta I guess? This would be with time stop, non existence, Mervas, or an NPC game world type thing? If that interests you we can definitely try to do it but you'd be GMing a whole world where I go around do whatever I want basically do people who do not react to me, I could do violent things or just only lewd stuff, it can get pretty weird so it's only if you think you'd be interested, if not we can do the other ideas or brainstorm something\n\nI'd also like this to be a daily thing, every day you come to me with new characters and refs for me to play with, making starting the RP yourself with something and I'll continue it. For the refs I'd like pics from artists like SSSonic2 or Miso Souperstar unless you have made pictures with characters similar in thickness. For characters I want ONLY ANTHRO, no Humans or humanoids like goblins or robots or anything, though robots really depend on their looks I suppose.\n\nFor the RP also make sure to really describe and show just how bouncy and jiggly all that fat on ass and tits will be and how it squishes, all that, that's what I really like. I love to grind and pound my cock between assets, not so much penetration but I'll still do it. If I do and your into incest we could even do pregnancies and skipping later to when I'll have fun with my son/daughter when ther are older.\n\nMy kinks are:  \nEmotionless sex, time stop/non existence etc.  \nLactation &amp; breastfeeding  \nTitfucking, thighjobs, hotdogging  \nHarems  \nWatersports  \nHyper tits/ass  \nGrowth  \nIncest\n\nLimits:  \nVore  \nMacro/micro  \nCuckolding (unless it's not happening to me)  \nSweat, farting, scat, etc.\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA",

One being much larger than the other and the other getting a bit too curious for their own good. As the name implies I\u2019d prefer to be torn up and ruined by an absolute beast of a dragon.\n\nFun on the farm: I\u2019d love to see a skinny horse boy with a massive cock fucking a much larger partner if we go anthro on anthro. If not, then the human farmhand on a horse run farm is in some deep trouble.\n\nRivals: I imagine humans and Anthros would have a bit of a rivalry.

So, I'd like to return to roleplay after a brief break. \n\nWhat I'm looking for is any incest related relationship! I know its taboo, but due to a lack of knowing my mom and dad has led me to this. These relationships could be gay (dad x son, uncle x son, brother x brother, so on) or straight (son x mom, dad x daughter, so on). However, the closer the relationship the better, so the tighter the blood the more enjoyment I'll find. That's pretty much my only requirement besides literacy. I ask that you can produce at least 6+ lines per post. The story can be set in any time, under any circumstance, with most kinks. Just shoot me a message on Telegram (heavily prefer) or Kik. \n\nTelegram- ZippyZed\nKik- hish_qu_ten\n\nAsk me about anything you wish and we can set this story up and get going!

            "selftext": "I'm a fan of chatting with people, always have been always will be. My fiance was a bit worried about it at first, but after years together it's more than obvious that my online interactions always end in nothing more than friendship. Plus he knows I'll be sure to text him if he's on a work trip, being on my phone and all.\n\nStill, I'm also curious about new apps, maybe something that won't make me sift through a sausage party to get to one decent person. So when MalO showed up on my suggested list I of course gave it a look.\n\n&gt; Never settle for those awkward feelings of being alone ever again. MalO is an exciting and interactive experience that will keep you engaged and intrigued. The anxiety of social situations can be nerve-racking, but after just a few hours of MalO you will soon forget all about those painful emotions of disappointment. Be part of the new craze that is quickly becoming the next social substitute. Remember, the more you participate, the more MalO will engage you. Your experience is completely up to you. Absolutely NO ADS. Enjoy!\n\nI scrunched my eyebrows a bit. This didn't seem like a normal chat app, more one of those automated response bots. Still... those could be fun sometimes, and I was bored.\n\nThat was three days ago. The app never showed up on my phone, and virus scans weren't picking up anything either. I let it go, thinking it was just a fluke. Then I started getting the pictures, they were random and obscure with nothing I could make out. Lately though, I swear I can see a face of some sort in the background of them. I tried showing them to Sam, but he just uses it to remind me not to download random apps before going about his day.\n\nI've been seeing something in the corner of my eye as well. I feel like it's connected, and I'm not sure how I should be dealing with this.\n\n*buzzbuzz*\n\nSpeak of the devil, another picture.\n\n____\n\nHey hey, I'm Jen! Saw a lewd of 1471 the other day and I knew I was doomed to write this haha. No worries if you aren't familiar with the SCP, honestly I had to look her up to make sure I was doing her justice lol. \n\nI want to leave this fairly open ended for how we go forward, but the gist is that we start interacting more and more, possibly to the point of you fully manifesting (at least for me). Only me being able to see you could be fun, especially while keeping this hidden from my fiance.\n\nI also have a gallery of refs I liked that you can look at [here](https://imgur.com/a/2VY2BtA).\n\nIf you're interested, PM me with what you liked about it and any ideas you might have. All of my prompts are always open so no need to ask lol. No reddit chat or commenting below asking me to message you (unless you legit cannot message for some reason). Also, I only play on Discord, please keep that in mind and ideally include your user in your message.",

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef, originally, but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. If you've read this far, in your first message include the word, pineapples. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home at random when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of DirtyKikRoleplay! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests would slowly move into dubcon acts for money. My character would be toyed, treated like a plaything for the amusement of her bully while the goth is filled with utter self disdain at what she would have to do and be doing for some money. In time this would slowly move into dubcon prostitution as your character begins to understand better about just how desperate my character is for cash. This is just the basis for the rp and in time will move onto other things as you'll find out when you continue to read. This is also just the theme I want the rp to fall into and this idea can also change to practically anything else that fits this theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\n\nNow for the goth in question, She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partner's preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers: this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this I've written, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. Also I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. This of course applies to not only kinks but even parts of the roleplay! As much as it seems like this is an already set out plan, this roleplay will be customised to you and I given your lovely preferences. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main bully. The characters themselves could be throwaways or properly fleshed out characters just like the main bully. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed! Yet if it's bullying, slice of life and smut involved with someone who's not the head bully then I'd much perfer them having their own personality and traits aside the main cheerleader (especially enamored with the people who are adeptly capable of doing this &lt;3). Since there can never be more than one true alpha domme-  the head would have to be...well...the head. And others would have to follow suit. If you've gone this far include, caramelldansen. But this doesn't mean they will be lackeys all the time. There can be moments where the 'lessers' step up when it comes to Velvet yet not against each other. I don't want any sort of conflict to happen between the bullies themselves. \n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want my character to be treated like trash. Like she's worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to your character in every way imaginable in the manner you bully and belittle her. If you're thinking it, no no I don't want her to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a smidge.*\n\n\n\n\nSo this will be a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. And no, it won't just be the bullying scenes (or the smut for that matter) though those would be a very impactful in shaping our story. Well we will be exploring their lives around the campus grounds. Perhaps they share a class? Mandatory PE. They run into each other by accident in the gym (and I say accident because Velvet doesn't do anything remotely close to working out), moved into dorms, Put into group projects together, library, some sort of college championships/tournament, etc. \n\nNow what about outside these college grounds? Meeting at the local groceries mart, local fair, perhaps Velvet's mother works in the bully's parent's company and thereby accompanies her mother to the company galas where the bully and Velvet meet. The shopping mall, makeup store, maybe they do this together much later down the line? Etc. \n\nAs for the bullying we have a plethora of ways to do this. From your classic wedgies, swirlies to rude words written in lipstick on the walls and mirrors of Velvet's dorm. To maybe a final project of hers is sabotaged or damaged before handing it in? A dye being added to her shampoo. Depantsing, shoved into the garbage can, stuffed in her locker, tripped as she's walking, paper pellets shot at her from a rubberband, her jeans mysteriously rip as she sits down, her stuff goes missing, pudding slathered in her room bedsheets, etc. You get the gist of it! \n\n\n\nWe can also converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Allow me to elucidate this. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how she gets hearing her bully's voice with the passing present. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. (Especially when the smut starts to begin) That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. Of course the bullying doesn't really stop but Velvet doesn't mind it as much then.\n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! If you've come this far, water. It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks! \n\n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term. Since this, I'm looking for a good 60:40 when it comes to story vs smut and I'm looking for buildup to smut. So, indeed, getting to the point where where we can actually incorporate that lovely ratio I mentioned *will take time.* Don't get me wrong however, I *love* smut and there will be a decent amount of it but I need it to be slowly budding into it for character and plot building also if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well, trust me). This is a story on the lives of two individuals and the paths they've forged. Who are clear opposites on the spectrum and how their lives find a strange common ground and get entangled into each other due to intense hatred for one another and the path paved for the both of them that they would have to take together because of it. This is... their story. If you've understood this, courage. \n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person and if 3-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you with literacy, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that. Seriously, if you do this you're practically letting me know you aren't creative at the very start. \n\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n***In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n***I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer), wrestler, track and field. Dancer, acting, arts, gymnast, etc. The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

Id like to start this off by thanking you for reading this, it means a lot to me!!\n\nSo I\u2019m thinking of having the scenario being something like this...\n\nYou had been best friends with Alena for basically your whole life, and you regularly hung out with her, almost every single day. This day was no different, except you were sleeping over tonight, which you had done countless times before. You spend the day watching tv, playing video games and just talking. \nIt had now gotten late at night, and so you both head up to her room. After some more talking and sharing memes, she says she\u2019s gonna go to sleep. She quickly falls asleep, leaving you awake and bored. A journal falls off her nightstand, so you curiously pick it up. \u2018Diary\u2019, it says on the cover. She must\u2019ve forgotten to hide it tonight, because you had never seen it before. You open it, and begin to read. You blush as you read all the lewd things she\u2019s written in it, but one thing sticks out. She keeps writing about how amazing it is to rub her...snout? It seemed a bit weird, but you realize that when you\u2019ve seen her scratch her snout or maw, her face goes a bit red. The diary keeps going on and on about how she absolutely loves rubbing it, so you decide to close it. You also decide that tomorrow, you want to see how she reacts to you rubbing her maw and snout. You put her diary back on her desk and go to sleep. \n\nYou wake up the next morning with her out of her bed. You head to the kitchen to see her making breakfast for both of you. \u201cGood morning sleepyhead! Breakfast\u2019ll be ready in a few minutes!\u201d She says with a smile. You go sit down on the couch, and a few minutes later, she brings out two plates. \n\nHere\u2019s my ref: https://imgur.com/a/9IHcQkD\n\nJust send me a DM if you\u2019d like to roleplay, then we can move over to discord or kik to discuss the details. ^^\n(Bonus points of you can *slide* into my DMs!~)\n\nSee ya there!~",

I feel really bad when the  image is incredibly large.)\n\nSaid  gengar is rather mischievous and a bit of a jokester, enjoying messing  with others or being a bit of a nuisance. Along with this he does have  illusionary powers, being able to spawn things in, and change his  appearance if he wanted to\n\nSo,  that's his general personality, as for his function in the roleplay,  he's essentially something of a gatekeeper to the underworld,  kinda...It's kinda complicated, he's essentially in a black abyss which  some people might appear in when they die.  \nSo, essentially the  roleplay has my character be dead, and appear in the void where the  gengar resides in confused as to where he is...And we'll go off of that!  A rather simple start, yeah? Because of this we could discuss a little  bit of extra things, like if we should develop a full underworld, and  whatnot. Or just have the void be a one-off area.\n\nAs  for my character, well he's just a slugcat, a small, rather cute one  who's a huge pervert, but generally a little shy. He's like this because  I prefer to be \"cute\" while subbing\n\nNow,  that's about it for the roleplay to an extent, there's one thing I  would like to add which is, uh...The Gengar getting genderbent sometime,  weather it would be on accident, or my character winning a bet against  him, whichever you would prefer. Now, why is this? Well, because breasts  are a huge fetish of mine, I can't get enough of 'em, and seeing thicc  boys get genderbent and having a massive pair of tits is really hot,  especially when the person being changed reacts in a smug, nervous or  even angry way.\n\nOh,  I also dom as well, not just being a sub, hence why I'm a switch...Now,  when domming I'm pretty weird about it, I usually prefer playing as  more weird things  Y'know...Gorillas, orcs, trolls, monsters...Horses,  giant flys, bugs, and so on.\n\nPretty weird, yeah?...This is more of a side-thing, so we won't HAVE to do it.\n\nSo...That's about it for my idea, I'll just throw in my kinks:\n\nMy kinks:\n\n* Boobs, of course!\n* Lewd clothing? Like virgin killer sweaters, bras and panties, swimsuits, towels, etc.\n* Accidental   stripping! (Like having your clothes get stuck in a door and torn   off...B u r n e d off, etc...Dumb stuff like that, why? Cause I think   it's c u t e. Though this...Probably doesn't apply to the gengar,  because I'd say he's a nudist)\n* Unique locations!...Like aquariums, abandoned places...Creepy mines, spooky forests, etc!\n* Naive or gullible characters, probably.\n* Using    weird or strange items as dildos or in a lewd fashon!...Like a  shovel,   pencil...Remote, etc-...Dunno why, that's just really hot to  me for  some  reason!\n* Cartoon        physics, like...Uh, getting hurt?...A dumb example would be   like-   say...A stick of TNT explodes nearby someone, or, well...The  lugia   Instead of being blown to bits, they'd just lose their  clothes,  while   being charred black. Stuff     like that! Not sure why that's  hot, I   guess I think  it's just really     cute, I suppose? As stated  plenty of   times  before...I'm a fucking     weirdo.\n* Swearing, I find it oddly hot!\n\nNow...As for my dislikes:\n\n* Scat, obviously.\n* Pregnancy\n* Lactation...Sort of? I personally dislike, and would prefer to not have it, ironic given my love for tiddies.\n* Vore, sorta.\n* Farts too.\n* Futas, I dislike them for...Personal reasons.\n\nThat's about it.\n\nWell, here's my info:\n\nKik: Agif1121\n\nDiscord: Rivy#8751\n\nHope to get some people who are interested!",

            "selftext": "As the population of the earth grew beyond what our normal agricultural and water supply was able to hold, drastic changes needed to be implemented to allow the human race to continue to survive on earth.\n\nWith a shortage of easily accessible protein, as livestock meat had grown expensive, and clean water becoming a pricey commodity, combined with a rising crime rate, there was only one easy solution to solve all the problems at once.\n\nA massive overhaul of the criminal incarceration system. All criminals are now places in a single massive prison off of the coast of Alaska. Modeled from fifteen oil rigs put together to create a massive complex.\n\nUnlike a normal prison however, all of the prisoners are working, constantly at all times. This is because every prisoner here is livestock of some kind, or care for the livestock.\n\nOnly about 5% of prisoners are male, as when you arrive on the platform, unless you are much, much more physically capable than the average man, all men are forcibly turned into women. The procedure is not pleasant, but it is fast and works 99% of the time.\n\nAfter being turned into a woman, or if you are already a woman, you are selected as a livestock type. There are three types, and which you end up depends on which type is more in demand at the time. There are three types of livestock currently detained on the prison, though research is being done to create more. When you are selected, you are spliced with the dna of the chosen animal, creating a semi anthropomorphic version of you, so that you may fill the role of the chosen animal.\n\nThe first and most demanded type is Cow. With the massive clean water shortages, the next best solution is milk. The cow\u2019s body filters out all of the toxins and pollutants of the water, giving fresh clean milk. Once you are spliced, a few changes occur right away that happen to all cows. Firstly, your feet and hands are turned into hooves, then you grow horns, your body becomes slightly better structured for being on all fours, but still retains its general human shape. Then your breasts grow to a minimum of a GGG cup.\n\nIn some cases, depending on the genes of the hucow, you may grow additional breasts, up to as many as six additional breasts, growing in rows down the front of your chest and belly. Or in other cases, you may grow an udder, either on the front or bottom of your belly. Immediately after transformation is complete, the prisoner is inseminated with a calf, and is placed in the feeding pens. Long lines of cows shackled to the ground, with a trough of water and food in front of them. Lines of hundreds of cows, all of them having every nipple milked at maximum pressure at all times, their stomachs bloated with calves. Kept pregnant at all times, their calves, which are born as full cows, being taken away to be raised for beef, cows are milked for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe second type are the chickens. After being spliced, all chickens grow some rows of feathers on their arms and head, and a full coat of feathers on their thighs. Arms turn to vestigial wings, and feet replaced with birds feet. Then the legs and abdomen over quadruple in muscle size and density. Just hours after splicing, eggs will begin to grow inside the prisoner\u2019s womb. The eggs are never fertilized, and at full size, are about the size of a basketball. After about two weeks, the prisoner will start to lay her eggs. Once this starts, she will never be able to stop. Chickens live the entire rest of their lives in labor, birthing an enormous egg every few hours.\n\nThe third, and most recent addition to the prison, are the pigs. The meat output of the cows isn\u2019t fast enough to keep up with the food needs of the planet, so the pigs are designed to fix that. The prisoner will experience a few things from being spliced, but the main thing is that they will gain several hundred pounds. Their skin will toughen and turn pink, their arms and legs turning to stubby partial hooved legs. Multiple sets of nipples will grow all across the prisoner\u2019s belly, and a hog nose and ears will form on their face.\n\nOnce spliced, they are put into the hog pens. Huge rooms with dirt or mud floors where dozens of pigs are fed constantly. For the first year or so, a feeding tube is permanently affixed to their throats, ensuring maximum possible weight gain. After the first six months, male pigs are released into the pens, which impregnate all prisoners that are fat enough. This cycle is repeated as needed to keep the prisoners pregnant and nursing at all times. Ones the piglets reach adolescence, they are taken away to just be replaced by the next litter of piglets. The piglets are born as full pigs, and are slaughtered a few months later.\n\nThe facility itself is is 5 main areas. One for each of the livestock, one for handling and splicing new prisoners, and one for the security force of 6,000 guards, and the management staff of the prison. This single prison provides milk, eggs, and meat for nearly the entire world, so it is the most heavily defended place on earth. \n\nThe secondary, much smaller purpose, is the prison allows VIP access to the prisoners by rich folks who wish to enjoy the bodies of the prisoners. All prisoners at almost all times, save for the cows while they are in labor, are always available to be fucked if you have a VIP pass for the prison.\n\n------\n\nAlright, apparently I am in a dark and depraved mood for this one. I\u2019ve had a hucow/huchicken prompt on the mind lately, but this is my take on it. Throw a little dystopia and forced gender change into it, and you have a proper smutwitch prompt. Of course there is plenty of pregnancy and fatness, plus even a little dash of furry, though not in a standard way.\n\nI tried to leave this pretty open ended. Are we both prisoners, possibly you are the new chicken, and I\u2019m the chicken in same cell as you? Or are you the cow next on the line, and you are about to pop? Or am I the rich VIP come to fuck some of the animals? Be creative, there is a lot of things that can be done with this.\n\nI know this one is really dark, but I have other prompts! Much more light hearted, but just as indepth, I promise you can find something in my subreddit [r/SmutCollection](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmutCollection/)",

However I've found hope for my sanity, more specificly a place that I don't have to be afraid of anything and I can have an actuall fun time. This place is a nightclub not far from where I live, I've been going there for half a year now on every saturday... but this savage ruined this place for me, and because of what it did... I finally broke\"\n\nBasicly I'm a weak 20 years old canine that dresses up as a girl and goes to this club, but this day YOU stole my purse and ran out. I've chased you and either for a (long term) you kidnapped me to your van and used me however you've wanted (short term) or you had your way with me in the black alley, The choice is your's.\n\nMessage me on  discord:  Anri#8601\n\nMy kinks: BDSM, cum related kinks (heavily excesive/excesive semen and preecum, snowballing, swallowing etc.) non-con, bad end (preferable after a long RP), oral, anal etc.\n\nLimits: scat, vore,",

So, I'd like to return to roleplay after a brief break. \n\nWhat I'm looking for is any incest related relationship! I know its taboo, but due to a lack of knowing my mom and dad has led me to this. These relationships could be gay (dad x son, uncle x son, brother x brother, so on) or straight (son x mom, dad x daughter, so on). However, the closer the relationship the better, so the tighter the blood the more enjoyment I'll find. That's pretty much my only requirement besides literacy. I ask that you can produce at least 6+ lines per post. The story can be set in any time, under any circumstance, with most kinks. Just shoot me a message on Telegram (heavily prefer) or Kik. \n\n\nKinks: incest, excessive cum, handjobs, watersports, cock worship, public/risky, gloryhole, semi hyper, growth, size diff\nLimits: rape, abuse, scat, hard vore, vomit, any sorta pain kink\nTelegram- ZippyZed\nKik- hish_qu_ten\n\nAsk me about anything you wish and we can set this story up and get going!

            "selftext": "My hope is to keep this short and sweet so I don't bore anybody to death.\n\nI'm a very experienced roleplayer that's been on hiatus for a considerable amount of time, but considering the sheer amount of free time that I've been left with due to recent events, the sheer boredom that has resulted from this free time has more or less piqued my interest to get back into writing raunchy smut. I have over a decade of roleplaying experience, most of it revolving around the erotic side of things. I'm also proud to say that I can be an exceptionally detailed roleplayer, as I am more than capable of providing my partners with multi-paragraph posts/responses. However, I do expect this effort to be returned.\n\nWhat may set me apart from most other players on this subreddit is that I am more than willing to sate any cravings that any of my potential partners may have. I can fill any role, whether it requires me to be submissive, a switch, or just outright dominant. Character-wise I have plenty of experience with just about anything someone may be desiring. Perhaps you're looking to play with a submissive, bottom-heavy femboy that's eager to slobber on a long, thick shaft. Some of you may want a big, muscular dickgirl to forcefully pin you down and rearrange your organs. Others may just want a large, intimidating male to brutally dominate them. A few of you may want a fit/sporty girl with a bubbly personality to cuddle up with. Maybe some may want a curvy MILF to mercilessly grope and molest. Or you may just be looking for something else entirely. No matter what it is - I'm more than likely going to be capable of playing as it.\n\nWhen it comes to kinks/fetishes, my interests are both varied and quite vast. While not truly 'limitless', I find that it's the best term to use to describe myself. It's going to be quite likely that I'm going to be into the things that you are into, whether it's tame or extreme. Taking into account the considerable amount of time that I've devoted to roleplaying with others, it should come as no surprise to anybody that I've had plenty of chances to experiment with a lot kinks. I'm also very open-minded, and if it so happens that I'm asked about a kink that I have no experience with, I'm probably going to be willing to try it out.\n\nWhile I have a lot of \"favorite\" kinks, it's probably best that I include a list of my top favorites. The kinks that I consistently and primarily enjoy include: All kinds of anal play, all kinds of oral play, all kinds of cum play, all kinds of breath play, muscular characters, muscle worship, hair/tail pulling, large endowments of any kind, sadism, masochism, bondage, pinning, hypnotism/mind control, corruption musk, handjobs, intercrural sex, titfucking, unique sex positions, face sitting, face fucking, size difference, intimidation, spanking, manhandling, molestation, sloppy kisses, long tongues, lipstick marking/smearing, makeup ruining, revealing outfits, sweat, quicksand, watersports and smegma. Keep in mind that this short list hardly scratches the surface of the kinks that I enjoy, and that there are so many more things that I enjoy.\n\nAs with just about anybody else in the world, I do have a few \"dislikes\". I don't hate these kinks by any means, but they do absolutely nothing for me. Some of these kinks include: Vore, diaper fetishism, very fat characters and obese characters.\n\nWhile it may seem that I'm looking for and/or have a preference for kinkier individuals, I don't mean for my list of kinks to be intimidating by any means. I'd be more than happy to play with even the most vanilla of you. The only thing that I require from anybody is a decent amount of detail, and the willingness to put in some effort into a roleplay.\n\nIf you somehow didn't die of boredom from reading my wall of text above, and find me interesting enough to roleplay with, please add me on Discord. Unfortunately I'm not willing to utilize any other means of communication for the purpose of roleplaying. I'll leave my Discord tag below.\n\nSilver#1279",

            "selftext": " \n\nHeya! My name is Dan! I'm looking for a sub willing to play Multiple characters for my sona, he's an anthro Czechoslovakian wolf-dog even if he doesn't look it. He's 5\"9 with a 5-6 inch cock. I'll show his references and bio when you message me. He loves to either dominate huge partners or be smothered and cottled by them\n\nFor the subs I want Multiple, at least 3, for my sona, I love having two big asses or sets of tits pressing against me, or a mix of the two. I'd also like that this could be a canon character situation or you can find refs of randoms. If we do canon characters it could be something like my boy getting a team of thick pokemon. Or maybe he is in some other game like Star fox or Paladins and the characters there have a crush on him. We can brainstorm plot and characters when we chat\n\nThere is also the option for doing an RP more about emotionless and public sex, not with hypnosis or non con or anything, though sorta I guess? This would be with time stop, non existence, Mervas, or an NPC game world type thing? If that interests you we can definitely try to do it but you'd be GMing a whole world where I go around do whatever I want basically do people who do not react to me, I could do violent things or just only lewd stuff, it can get pretty weird so it's only if you think you'd be interested, if not we can do the other ideas or brainstorm something\n\nI'd also like this to be a daily thing, every day you come to me with new characters and refs for me to play with, making starting the RP yourself with something and I'll continue it. For the refs I'd like pics from artists like SSSonic2 or Miso Souperstar unless you have made pictures with characters similar in thickness. For characters I want ONLY ANTHRO, no Humans or humanoids like goblins or robots or anything, though robots really depend on their looks I suppose.\n\nFor the RP also make sure to really describe and show just how bouncy and jiggly all that fat on ass and tits will be and how it squishes, all that, that's what I really like. I love to grind and pound my cock between assets, not so much penetration but I'll still do it. If I do and your into incest we could even do pregnancies and skipping later to when I'll have fun with my son/daughter when ther are older.\n\nMy kinks are:  \nEmotionless sex, time stop/non existence etc.  \nLactation &amp; breastfeeding  \nTitfucking, thighjobs, hotdogging  \nHarems  \nWatersports  \nHyper tits/ass  \nGrowth  \nIncest\n\nLimits:  \nVore  \nMacro/micro  \nCuckolding (unless it's not happening to me)  \nSweat, farting, scat, etc.\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA",

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef, originally, but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. If you've read this far, in your first message include the word, pineapples. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home at random when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of DirtyKikRoleplay! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests would slowly move into dubcon acts for money. My character would be toyed, treated like a plaything for the amusement of her bully while the goth is filled with utter self disdain at what she would have to do and be doing for some money. In time this would slowly move into dubcon prostitution as your character begins to understand better about just how desperate my character is for cash. This is just the basis for the rp and in time will move onto other things as you'll find out when you continue to read. This is also just the theme I want the rp to fall into and this idea can also change to practically anything else that fits this theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\n\nNow for the goth in question, She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partner's preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers: this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this I've written, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. Also I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. This of course applies to not only kinks but even parts of the roleplay! As much as it seems like this is an already set out plan, this roleplay will be customised to you and I given your lovely preferences. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main bully. The characters themselves could be throwaways or properly fleshed out characters just like the main bully. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed! Yet if it's bullying, slice of life and smut involved with someone who's not the head bully then I'd much perfer them having their own personality and traits aside the main cheerleader (especially enamored with the people who are adeptly capable of doing this &lt;3). Since there can never be more than one true alpha domme-  the head would have to be...well...the head. And others would have to follow suit. If you've gone this far include, caramelldansen. But this doesn't mean they will be lackeys all the time. There can be moments where the 'lessers' step up when it comes to Velvet yet not against each other. I don't want any sort of conflict to happen between the bullies themselves. \n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want my character to be treated like trash. Like she's worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to your character in every way imaginable in the manner you bully and belittle her. If you're thinking it, no no I don't want her to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a smidge.*\n\n\n\n\nSo this will be a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. And no, it won't just be the bullying scenes (or the smut for that matter) though those would be a very impactful in shaping our story. Well we will be exploring their lives around the campus grounds. Perhaps they share a class? Mandatory PE. They run into each other by accident in the gym (and I say accident because Velvet doesn't do anything remotely close to working out), moved into dorms, Put into group projects together, library, some sort of college championships/tournament, etc. \n\nNow what about outside these college grounds? Meeting at the local groceries mart, local fair, perhaps Velvet's mother works in the bully's parent's company and thereby accompanies her mother to the company galas where the bully and Velvet meet. The shopping mall, makeup store, maybe they do this together much later down the line? Etc. \n\nAs for the bullying we have a plethora of ways to do this. From your classic wedgies, swirlies to rude words written in lipstick on the walls and mirrors of Velvet's dorm. To maybe a final project of hers is sabotaged or damaged before handing it in? A dye being added to her shampoo. Depantsing, shoved into the garbage can, stuffed in her locker, tripped as she's walking, paper pellets shot at her from a rubberband, her jeans mysteriously rip as she sits down, her stuff goes missing, pudding slathered in her room bedsheets, etc. You get the gist of it! \n\n\n\nWe can also converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Allow me to elucidate this. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how she gets hearing her bully's voice with the passing present. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. (Especially when the smut starts to begin) That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. Of course the bullying doesn't really stop but Velvet doesn't mind it as much then.\n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! If you've come this far, water. It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks! \n\n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term. Since this, I'm looking for a good 60:40 when it comes to story vs smut and I'm looking for buildup to smut. So, indeed, getting to the point where where we can actually incorporate that lovely ratio I mentioned *will take time.* Don't get me wrong however, I *love* smut and there will be a decent amount of it but I need it to be slowly budding into it for character and plot building also if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well, trust me). This is a story on the lives of two individuals and the paths they've forged. Who are clear opposites on the spectrum and how their lives find a strange common ground and get entangled into each other due to intense hatred for one another and the path paved for the both of them that they would have to take together because of it. This is... their story. If you've understood this, courage. \n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person and if 3-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you with literacy, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that. Seriously, if you do this you're practically letting me know you aren't creative at the very start. \n\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n***In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n***I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer), wrestler, track and field. Dancer, acting, arts, gymnast, etc. The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello, \n\nI'm peachy and I have some...odd ideas for a RP.  a bit about me first. I'm a shapeshifter though that wont come into affect for our RP session. but it does mean im comfortable playing any gender. I would like to think of myself as a skilled RP player with almost 15 years under my belt. i post 2-3 sentence replies or more if the scene requires it. i don't ask that you write paragraph but i do ask that you write more then 1 word responses. \n\nI'm also a story teller. so i love plot and story in the sessions. smut is fantastic and the more the better, but its boring quickly if there's no plot to hold it together.  i ask that you be into the same thing.  I work night shifts pacific time so im up overnights the beginning of the week and up days on weekends. I can MIA randomly as life happens and i cant always give you a warning. i hope you understand that and i will give you the same understanding. life happens, and there not much you can do about it. \n\nI will not accept anyone under the age of 18 for this. PERIOD. \n\nnow for the ideas. \n\ni was thinking some thing along the lines of unbirthing. you would be playing a female or a herm. you where unable to have children of your own with your mate.  now, you have the unique ability to unbirth someone and it would make you pregnant with me. changing me slowly until i became your species and then you would give birth to me as a cub. then it would be a slice of life story.  raising a child.  we could play this as i am a human and you come to earth and choose me as your new off spring? or possibly its part of our society. all woman or most woman have this ability and its common place. where a woman would go and pick out a unwanted child of any species and be able to convert them to their own species. \n\nkinks for this would include but are negotiable:\n\n\\* unbirthing, pregnancy, breast feeding, child raising, incest,. \n\n\\* this RP would likely run for some time if we like it. it cn of course terminate early if it doesnt do well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanother idea:\n\nmotherly character is recently divorced and now having to raise their child on their own. again a herm or female character. i would prefer to play male if your female, and im open to male or female if your herm. The ideas of this would that you as a mother would have to struggle with raising a young cub or teenager. again, i would hope for this to be a longer term RP. again, the idea of incest would be dominant in this story. that said, the story can be adjusted to to allow for being adopted if incest leaves a bad taste in your mouth. \n\nI'm generally a open book for kinks so im onboard with most ideas. We can discuss what you want in chat. \n\nplease reach out to me at peachy#3829",

            "selftext": "Velvet slugged towards her locker in tattered, bedraggled sneakers at the back of the school, the bell had rung hours ago as she had stayed for extra after school classes. Running a hand through her smooth, short length, pixie-cut jet black hair she sighed out. She had hoped she could do a little bit of freelance work around the school to earn a little bit of extra money but the principal had found out and forbade it from happening on the school grounds. \n\nOnce she arrived at her locker, she kicked it out of frustration. She exhaled out a long, warm breath with her face slightly falling, her lips slowly curling inwards, she took a moment to take a sharp, cold breath from the evening air to tranquil her senses. Shaking her head back to reality she placed a few books inside before locking it and heading towards the grounds, a pathway she had to take to get to the exit/entrance of the school, wearing slightly faded out black jeans with artistic rips that she passionately created by herself. \n\n\nYet something caught her attention, her eyes flickered to place that disturbed her mind till she grimaced, her dead eyes being mirrored by the look she was giving. \n\n*Great...the cheerleaders*, she thought to herself with surmounting dread as she saw the silhouette of two girls loom in the distance near the exit as she rubbed along the cold metallic piercings in her right ear, a sign of prodigious distress. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n(All characters are aged 18+)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\nVelvet is a loner. She has no friends, she sits by herself all day no matter where she is. Barely talks to anyone except for when a teacher asks her a question directly and such but she isn't your egdy wannabe and never has been. She's antisocial and thereby has had trouble making friend or speaking to people in general unless they approach her first. Now was she always a loner or as there an incident that made her that way? Perhaps she was born with disliking people or maybe just maybe with how the others in school, and now college, treated her by considering her weird and a freak and felt unnerved being around her. Perhaps she adopted the darkness and allowed it to consume her and found peace in it than break and destory her. Alas we may never know. \n\n\nShe's your gloomy, moody, emo, hates everyone and everything, heavily introverted, constantly on existential crisis, negative chick\n\n\n\nVelvet is actually a half dom, she has learned to be in this cold harsh world. She will fight on things she seems unfit to her or in general. Even going as much as to talking to people when she has to. Yet she's easily susceptible to strong dominance, unlike her fake domness, she can't handle it when dealing with a true dom who already knows their place. Quite unlike poor Velvet. \n\nVelvet's wanted to be a lot of things growing up. She loves to cook so she would love to be a chef, originally, but she understands just how hard the hotel/restaurant life really is. Besides she can't handle the heat, can't stand it, so being next to a grill or fire in general would be too much. If you think she's exaggerating she perfer rainy days and not because of the gloom that mirrors her heart but because it's cooler. She finds tranquility in it. Perhaps she relates to it with how everyone hates on rainy weather ruining their day. Perhaps she'd be good in a cold kitchen? Who knows? What she is decent at is singing. She has a pretty good voice but not amazing to break the Internet sadly. If you've read this far, in your first message include the word, pineapples. She just doesn't know how well she does sing and sadly is stuck to singing home at random when she feels like it with nobody to appreciate it. The rare times she has done it in public some have made good comments about it but she just felt they were being nice.\n\n\nVelvet grew up with a father who wanted to be in her life yet left at the tender age of three due to a very difficult woman of a mother. A mother who has been emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive towards her all her life and just never giving her the feeling of being appreciated, nutured and loved.\n\n\nIn short, she is a lost soul. She's in need of a saviour but she isn't asking for favours. \n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\n\nHello all you enchanting creatures of DirtyKikRoleplay! So my roleplay idea is pretty simple, [Head Cheerleader Bully X Loner Bullied Girl](http://imgur.com/a/TMdEhQw) in a college setting. However it has a number of different layers within the idea and as the title suggests would slowly move into dubcon acts for money. My character would be toyed, treated like a plaything for the amusement of her bully while the goth is filled with utter self disdain at what she would have to do and be doing for some money. In time this would slowly move into dubcon prostitution as your character begins to understand better about just how desperate my character is for cash. This is just the basis for the rp and in time will move onto other things as you'll find out when you continue to read. This is also just the theme I want the rp to fall into and this idea can also change to practically anything else that fits this theme. Getting blackmailed, etc. If you have any suggestions on why my character is forced to submit to her disdainful bully please shoot me your ideas so we can discuss about it! \n\n\n\n\nNow for the goth in question, She can have her appearance changed to suit my rp partner's preferences (e.g. thicc, slender, slim but busty, etc) as you can choose from my list of refs or if you have any better I'd be more than happy to play her! \n\n\n\nNow what I'm looking for in the cheerleader is an ***actual*** bully. Your alluring species *doesn't matter* yet what I care about is I want to feel genuinely bullied, demeaned, humiliated. Especially when the servicing starts. So she would have to be mean and somewhat sadistic, you can get a gist of this from my list of kinks. So abusive, *moderately* sadistic, roleplayers: this is your time to shine!\n\nAs for some of my [kinks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521180547935109140/692079415399546880/IMG_20200325_000325.jpg), Most are based on this roleplay. *Don't see a kink you like?* Fret not! I'm probably most likely into it and I just haven't remembered to write it! *See a kink you don't like?* Brood not, precious! I don't mind leaving out kinks for those who aren't comfortable with certain things. I want us both to be comfortable with the story we are writing together. So communication is key and as much as an uptight bitch I seem to be when you're reading all this I've written, I'm ridiculously empathic and understanding. Also I'm pleaser, so I want *you* happy. This of course applies to not only kinks but even parts of the roleplay! As much as it seems like this is an already set out plan, this roleplay will be customised to you and I given your lovely preferences. \n\n\nThese aren't lovers. These are two people who absolutely loath and despise each other, at least at the *start*. Another thing I originally intended was this rp to be a more than one cheerleader thing. I'd never force anyone to play more than one character at a time if they couldn't manage it but would enjoy it if there would be more characters involved later on other than just the main bully. The characters themselves could be throwaways or properly fleshed out characters just like the main bully. Just to keep things fresh if it's ever needed! Yet if it's bullying, slice of life and smut involved with someone who's not the head bully then I'd much perfer them having their own personality and traits aside the main cheerleader (especially enamored with the people who are adeptly capable of doing this &lt;3). Since there can never be more than one true alpha domme-  the head would have to be...well...the head. And others would have to follow suit. If you've gone this far include, caramelldansen. But this doesn't mean they will be lackeys all the time. There can be moments where the 'lessers' step up when it comes to Velvet yet not against each other. I don't want any sort of conflict to happen between the bullies themselves. \n\n\nIf it wasn't obvious with what I've written and my kinks, I want my character to be treated like trash. Like she's worthless. I want it to be just like the real dynamic between a bully and her bullied. To be treated like the lowest of scum, like she isn't even worth the cheerleaders time. Make my goth feel inferior to your character in every way imaginable in the manner you bully and belittle her. If you're thinking it, no no I don't want her to be \"broken\" even though that would be happening *just a smidge.*\n\n\n\n\nSo this will be a longterm, slice of life, roleplay. And no, it won't just be the bullying scenes (or the smut for that matter) though those would be a very impactful in shaping our story. Well we will be exploring their lives around the campus grounds. Perhaps they share a class? Mandatory PE. They run into each other by accident in the gym (and I say accident because Velvet doesn't do anything remotely close to working out), moved into dorms, Put into group projects together, library, some sort of college championships/tournament, etc. \n\nNow what about outside these college grounds? Meeting at the local groceries mart, local fair, perhaps Velvet's mother works in the bully's parent's company and thereby accompanies her mother to the company galas where the bully and Velvet meet. The shopping mall, makeup store, maybe they do this together much later down the line? Etc. \n\nAs for the bullying we have a plethora of ways to do this. From your classic wedgies, swirlies to rude words written in lipstick on the walls and mirrors of Velvet's dorm. To maybe a final project of hers is sabotaged or damaged before handing it in? A dye being added to her shampoo. Depantsing, shoved into the garbage can, stuffed in her locker, tripped as she's walking, paper pellets shot at her from a rubberband, her jeans mysteriously rip as she sits down, her stuff goes missing, pudding slathered in her room bedsheets, etc. You get the gist of it! \n\n\n\nWe can also converse about how their relationship unfolds with mutual agreement. And yes, *there will be a relationship unraveling between them*. Allow me to elucidate this. Years of wallowing in self loathing, Velvet has been unable to face the fact that she's *slightly* a sick little masochist and *loves* feeling like dirt and hates how she gets hearing her bully's voice with the passing present. Yes, Velvet will fall for her bullies, eventually. (Especially when the smut starts to begin) That's been my end goal anyway. So, remember all that abuse from before? Yeah, they all simply turn into rough love which Velvet enjoys with immensity but she just might pretend otherwise even with her sweet nectar dribbling down her soft, supple thighs. Of course the bullying doesn't really stop but Velvet doesn't mind it as much then.\n\n\nNow their relationship can go from just abusive: masochist sadist, to loving, to soulmates, Mommy dom, manipulation, corruption, etc... so this would depend on you and how you want to take their relationship further, any other paths I haven't suggested but you have an idea of please don't hesitate to suggest here! If you've come this far, water. It would be rather lackluster if there's isn't character development for either of the characters we are playing when it comes to our relationship, which is why I find this of the of most importance. Yet of course it would have to at least start like how two people who hate each other would.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nAs for you lovely males of the subreddit, I'm sadly **not** looking for any sort of male character's for roleplay but if you wish to rp I have no quarrels with a MplayingFuta however... only if you know *how* to play your role in Roleplay and Out Of Character as well. I can't stress this enough. Please understand what I'm saying here, *genders don't matter **if** you know how to play your role.* So I'd rather not know about your irl gender, this is about our characters and nothing more so please don't make it obvious when talking to me, thanks! \n\n\n\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\n\n\nI'm looking for good, detailed, literate roleplayers with experience who can maintain multi-paragraph writing, are creative and who I'll have great chemistry with! I'm looking for this roleplay to be long term. Since this, I'm looking for a good 60:40 when it comes to story vs smut and I'm looking for buildup to smut. So, indeed, getting to the point where where we can actually incorporate that lovely ratio I mentioned *will take time.* Don't get me wrong however, I *love* smut and there will be a decent amount of it but I need it to be slowly budding into it for character and plot building also if it's going to be smut every scene that's going to get stale rather quick (I know about this too well, trust me). This is a story on the lives of two individuals and the paths they've forged. Who are clear opposites on the spectrum and how their lives find a strange common ground and get entangled into each other due to intense hatred for one another and the path paved for the both of them that they would have to take together because of it. This is... their story. If you've understood this, courage. \n\n\nFor this rp I'm looking to have it in third person and if 3-5 paragraphs per reply isn't an issue to you with literacy, then great! If it is, however, then I'm sorry but we probably *won't* be a suitable pairing. \n\n\n_______________\n\n\nWhen you first message me please give me:\n\n*Your kinks\n\n*Your limits\n\n*Your Lovely Futa ref/s you'll be playing as\n\n*Your creative ideas on what else could be added to make this more spicy before starting the rp other than my own, of course. \nI'd love nothing better than your views and input into my silly roleplay plot. Your feedback means a lot to me. \n\n*No low effort. It's tiring, it's tedious, nobody want that. Seriously, if you do this you're practically letting me know you aren't creative at the very start. \n\n\n--------------\n\nImportant things to note:\n\n***In the past I've gone with goth but now I've decided to open the doors to practically anyone. Stereotype dictacts the next best option to be a nerd but she could just be practically anyone, even just a simple normal girl with no labels except for loner and unpopular. So just specify if you perfer a goth or non goth. \n\n\n***I know I specifically wrote cheerleader but that's only to have the hightened juxtapose of unpopular and loner x Preppy, popular and social. She can be anyone in the school. Any sports like basketball, football(rugby), football(soccer), wrestler, track and field. Dancer, acting, arts, gymnast, etc. The point being she would have to be preppy, popular: the polar opposite of my character and her bully. \n\n------\n\nI'm looking to roleplay on re.ddit itself or disc.ord\u00a0but if it needs be- willing to explore other options as well if it's worth the effort... \n\nAnyway, I think I've covered most of it all, thank you for reading all my silly babbling.\n\nSee you soon~!",

            "selftext": "\nThis takes inspiration from the Rise of the Wolf Queen series of comics by Jay Naylor, I make no claim to his work and am just a fan who wanted to expand and make her own RP based off of the world.\n\n\n\n\nI was a young woman who lived in a small village outside of a vast human kingdom. It was my 19th birthday and yesterday I had been allowed to become an inquisitor. I had trained for years to become one, steeling myself to be prepared to fight the wolf cults who took us women and used us to raise armies of their own. I took my first life on that day, a life that would haunt me forever, albeit I didn\u2019t know it.\n\n\n\nTwo years later\n\n\nI was on a standard patrol, seeing if any wolves had tried to sneak into the kingdom when suddenly a wolf rushed me, stabbing my horse, killing it instantly with a spear thrust right to the heart. Im thrown to the ground, a crack in my leg followed by searing pain telling me it had been broken. The wolf stood over me, grabbing something from its satchel... cottonwine, a naturally occurring hallucinogen that commonly caused women to forget themselves and focus on breeding and caring for men near them, thankfully it could be cured but this wolf was clearly trying to use it to make me pass out. I try to struggle, kicking at him with my good leg, but it was too late, he plunged the device into me and I felt the world slip away from me, howling heard all around me.\n\n\n\n\nAn unknown amount of time later I woke up, entirely nude, my bush and a splint the only things even remotely covering me. I looked at my body in a pool of water on the ground, my blonde hair was matted and dirty, my face had four marks on it, just below my eyes. A white strip was on my throat, a tooth collar esque design along my upper chest and shoulders, and two thick strips along my arm. There was a crescent moon design where my womb was, stopping just at my belly button, two designs tracing my pelvis were also there, and there was a stripe and claw mark drawings along my left leg. Both legs were painted entirely white from the knee to the foot. I knew I had been captured and marked by the wolves, but I was just happy to be alive still. I eagerly lapped at the pool of water, wetting my hair in the process. The water tasted off and a fire quickly grew in my belly, but I didn\u2019t care. All I could do now was wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey all! Current kinks for this are:\n\nBreeding, BDSM, scratching, pregnancy, birth, rimming.\n\n\nLimits: none\n\n\n\n\nAll I ask is you can write 2+ paragraphs per response, however if you can only do a little over one then I can negotiate.",

            "selftext": "\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into my writing, and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to a lot of different suggestions when it comes to stories or whatever. Don't be afraid to ask if something sparked your imagination.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more like casual things, though. I personally don't have any fetishes, unless something such as titfucking counted. Other than that, I'm rather \"vanilla\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards like scalie characters, like sharks, dragons, etc. but only a little. Also does/deers. Like I said, not a deal-breaker whatsoever. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there. Though to be fair, I might prefer a little bit more detail, it helps keep it interesting. All I can say is the more detail the better. But don't stress about it!\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n   * *In summary, I love adding detail, and if you can add detail when you can, and write a lot, even though it's optional, it really improves the experience for the both of us. Who knows? It might even help you when you go to RP with others in the future! All I can say is just try your best, but don't overwhelm yourself. I apologize if my own writing might seem too long at times and it overwhelms you, so let me know if it does.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex, Remy, and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely. Not a deal-breaker whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before.\n   * He graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. He attended school in Los Angeles but graduated in Japan (he spent his senior year at a high school in Gunma). He then went back to L.A. and got a degree in computer science. He's a gamer and works part-time at home as a game developer, but he also has a YT channel for music and other content.\n   * His car is a 1983 Toyota AE86 Trueno Hatch. He bought one stock in Japan with a white and black two-tone (officially called \"High-Tech Two-Tone\" by Toyota), and a maroon interior. He then got it imported back in L.A. and made visual changes, mostly yellow foglights on the front and black Watanabe RS 8-Spoke rims.\n   * Jack has never been in a relationship before because he just figured he wasn't good with women. In high school he was also picked on quite a lot so his shyness just kinda stuck with him. He *loves* meeting new people though, he's just shy is all.\n   * Jack isn't much of a drinker, either. He only drinks in small amounts if at all.\n   * Jack is also a bilingual character. He speaks English, his main language of course, but while in Japan his senior year, he learned Japanese and likes to speak it. In some cases, he might say something or other in Japanese, mostly when he feels nervous or under pressure, but he tries to keep it to a minimum in public as it embarrasses him, and makes him feel like he stands out.\n   * *In summary, Jack's really a sweetheart. He just strives to be a good person and be good to others, especially in a society where people like him are rather rare.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. But I'm great with Telegram, too. My info is below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these, more specifically people like me, who enjoy the writing aspect and the build-up of the characters.\n\nIf my info above doesn't work or if you need assistance with adding me, you can send me a Reddit message.\n\nThanks, and have a good day.\n\n# IMPORTANT NOTICE! Read this, please.\n\nLook, I don't mean to rant, but this stuff just really bothers me.\n\nFairly recently, people on this subreddit have been constantly adding me on platforms such as Discord and Telegram, asking if I wanted to RP. Not even a minute later, I get blocked by the same person.\n\nThis has happened over 20+ times. I don't get it. I never did anything.\n\nI wish people would stop this. Everyone's always so friendly and kind and such in the beginning. And then for whatever reason I'm blocked and never hear from them again as long as I live.\n\nAll this does is just upset me, and it's making my depression spike. Don't fucking add me if you're gonna do that to me. I'm so fucking done with it. I try to be the nicest I can but then people just do this sorta shit. Because I don't know what I even did to begin with, and I can't fix what I don't know is broken. I want to stay on people's good sides, and make some friends. But apparently I can't even do that because literally everyone I meet on here will add me and then block me a minute later after a salutation. I feel horrible about this. I needed to speak up because this has happened too many times now.\n\nSo please, *please*, don't do this. All you're doing is just making me feel bad. Nobody deserves to be treated like this. All people do are either block me or in some cases just ghost me.\n\nI apologize for ranting, but when it happens several times it sorta gets to you. I hope you people can understand where I'm coming from. We're all human, we all make mistakes, we all have feelings. Please understand this.",

            "selftext": "\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into my writing, and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to a lot of different suggestions when it comes to stories or whatever. Don't be afraid to ask if something sparked your imagination.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more like casual things, though. I personally don't have any fetishes, unless something such as titfucking counted. Other than that, I'm rather \"vanilla\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards like scalie characters, like sharks, dragons, etc. but only a little. Also does/deers. Like I said, not a deal-breaker whatsoever. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there. Though to be fair, I might prefer a little bit more detail, it helps keep it interesting. All I can say is the more detail the better. But don't stress about it!\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n   * *In summary, I love adding detail, and if you can add detail when you can, and write a lot, even though it's optional, it really improves the experience for the both of us. Who knows? It might even help you when you go to RP with others in the future! All I can say is just try your best, but don't overwhelm yourself. I apologize if my own writing might seem too long at times and it overwhelms you, so let me know if it does.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex, Remy, and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely. Not a deal-breaker whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before.\n   * He graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. He attended school in Los Angeles but graduated in Japan (he spent his senior year at a high school in Gunma). He then went back to L.A. and got a degree in computer science. He's a gamer and works part-time at home as a game developer, but he also has a YT channel for music and other content.\n   * His car is a 1983 Toyota AE86 Trueno Hatch. He bought one stock in Japan with a white and black two-tone (officially called \"High-Tech Two-Tone\" by Toyota), and a maroon interior. He then got it imported back in L.A. and made visual changes, mostly yellow foglights on the front and black Watanabe RS 8-Spoke rims.\n   * Jack has never been in a relationship before because he just figured he wasn't good with women. In high school he was also picked on quite a lot so his shyness just kinda stuck with him. He *loves* meeting new people though, he's just shy is all.\n   * Jack isn't much of a drinker, either. He only drinks in small amounts if at all.\n   * Jack is also a bilingual character. He speaks English, his main language of course, but while in Japan his senior year, he learned Japanese and likes to speak it. In some cases, he might say something or other in Japanese, mostly when he feels nervous or under pressure, but he tries to keep it to a minimum in public as it embarrasses him, and makes him feel like he stands out.\n   * *In summary, Jack's really a sweetheart. He just strives to be a good person and be good to others, especially in a society where people like him are rather rare.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. But I'm great with Telegram, too. My info is below.\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on for a long time, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these, more specifically people like me, who enjoy the writing aspect and the build-up of the characters.\n\nIf my info above doesn't work or if you need assistance with adding me, you can send me a Reddit message.\n\nThanks, and have a good day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# IMPORTANT NOTICE! Read this, please.\n\nLook, I don't mean to rant, but this stuff just really bothers me.\n\nFairly recently, people on this subreddit have been constantly adding me on platforms such as Discord and Telegram, asking if I wanted to RP.

But apparently I can't even do that because literally everyone I meet on here will add me and then block me a minute later after a salutation. I feel horrible about this. I needed to speak up because this has happened too many times now.\n\nSo please, *please*, don't do this. All you're doing is just making me feel bad. Nobody deserves to be treated like this. All people do are either block me or in some cases just ghost me.\n\nI apologize for ranting, but when it happens several times it sorta gets to you. I hope you people can understand where I'm coming from. We're all human, we all make mistakes, we all have feelings. Please understand this.",
