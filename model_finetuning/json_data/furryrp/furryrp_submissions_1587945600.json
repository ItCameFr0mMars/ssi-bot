I quite enjoy them, but sometimes I like something a little meatier with a bit more substance as it were. Yet even so all I'm hoping for is to find someone interested in a long term slice of life, heck that little slice can even be a dark or just ever so happy-go-lucky. I'm really not one to be picky and we can totally discuss. And don't worry, there can be lots and lots of lewd play.\n\nAs for me, my 'sons is one of those pesky wolf's. Fluffy, monochrome, and... gasp, feminine. Go figure, right? Here, you can judge for yourself, I guess. https://i.imgur.com/cSHCikV.png\n\nI usually play up the huffy, prissy, I guess \"tsundere\" personality, but I'm versatile. At least until it comes to posting in bed, submissive bottom unfortunately.\n\nAs for you? I get along with just about anyone provided you (the player you) are at least 18 years old, prefer 2-4 lines per reply, and prefer writing in the third person. I may also accept second person, but I just can't so first person perspective. Sorry.\n\nFinally, I don't use reddit chat and have disabled it so contacting me through there will leave you ignored. Again, sorry. Also if you do message me in private, try to say more than \"hi\". \n\nAll that said, I hope to hear from one of you~",

Also ideally partners who are comfortable playing as human and/or Furre**\n\n**I am EAST Coast USA Time**\n\nReality Warp\n\nThis one is a bit of a doozy in the story that I want too see through, but essentially we're doing some meaningless chore one day, cleaning out a school facility basement and come across a strange box. In this strange box lays an amulet. This amulet has the power to change reality as we see fit, and with our changes, come an acceptance of how things are now without others questioning it. Those of whom were there for the finding of the amulet (you and I), are and will always only be able to activate the amulet's power. We can decide how loose our words need to be to transform/change reality but in turn we can change ourselves into whatever we want, dragons, animals, you name it. The more that we come too learn about our power, the greedier we soon  become, wanting to change other people to do our bidding. As we delve deeper into changing other people, we become to transform irreversibly into dragons (possibly baby dragons in body, older in mind, or both young if you're down). We have started a club at the college, in order to bring people in, promising change but in the end make them happy with their new forms, and/or make them believe they are fine the way they are (That we just turned them into), and provide mental help instead! ((**Wanting weight gain, transformation, gender TF, heavy slob(scat, wetting), possibly diaper usage (and more) ))**\n\nCow Job RP\n\nOK    so, essentially I have this idea  where a couple of dudes (or girl  and   dude) are down on their luck for.  Jobs, just out of college, and  are   given the opportunity or possible  opportunity of their lives. A    interview is setup with one of the most  important milk farms in the    country. What they don't know is that deep  within this highly secretive    company is a deep, massive underground cow  society, built miles into    the earth housing living Spaces, stores,  entertainment, the    factory/work area, etc. We think we're going in for  desk jobs or IT    work, but we're promised a huge salary, some benefits,  and without    really knowing what we're getting into we sign.\n\nWe're     shown to our new living quarters, absolutely large living areas for    two  future cows. We share a two bed two bath apartment together. As    time  goes on, we get injections that gradually turn us into cows, and    we get  fatter and fatter too, building a romance as time goes on. I'd    like if  there were open defecation and urinating, but not absolutely    required.  The rp would be long term and involve romance, slice of  life,   and other  such things. Hit me up if interested. I prefer  discord most   of all.",

I want the plot to be something like this: You and your friend (me) go on a hunting trip through the woods. However, we get captured by a werewolf tribe who use us to pleasure themselves. The wolves are male, female, futa  anything really. Also, you can be either gender, I'm not looking specifically for anything. Although I said short term in the title, we can go long term if things go well. I would like for you to be a bottom, however.\n\nA few rules first: 1) And I can't stress this enough, NO UNDERAGE PEOPLE. Seriously,I'd say that *at least*   \na third of all rp's I've had until now were with underage people. Fursona also has to   \nbe over 18                                                                                                                                                                      \n2) Good grammar. I'm no grammar nazi, all I'm asking for is basic literacy \n\nPM me on Reddit and we can discuss a bit more about the plot, your character etc. When you contact me, give me a short description of your fursona (age, height, gender, name etc.), your kinks and limits and we can get started. \n\nMy fursona: Gender: male, Age: 19, name: Zepp, height: 1.6 meters/5.4 feet, species: spider, hair color: black, hair length: average, skin color: black, eye color: red, \"length\": 6 inches \n\nKinks: BDSM, rough sex, huge cock, humiliation, throatfuck, anal, orgy, excessive cum, cum feeding, size difference, kissing, whipping, spanking, tongue kissing, licking, leash, mind fuck, spitroast, milf, big boobs, big ass, futa\n\nLimits: scat, vore, vomit, gore, fart, torture, gross stuff, tickling",

            "selftext": "\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into my writing, and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nSo here's the dealio:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to a lot of different suggestions when it comes to stories or whatever. Don't be afraid to ask if something sparked your imagination.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more like casual things, though. I personally don't have any fetishes, unless something such as titfucking counted. Other than that, I'm rather \"vanilla\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards like scalie characters, like sharks, dragons, etc. but only a little. Also does/deers and bunnies/rabbits. But like I said, not a deal-breaker whatsoever, you can use whatever character you'd like, of course. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow romance kinda thing. Not enough of them these days. Just kinda building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. Short messages are fine, and so are paragraphs. I do a mixture of both, but don't worry. This isn't a school essay, make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there. Though to be fair, I might prefer a little bit more detail, it helps keep it interesting. All I can say is the more detail the better. But don't stress about it!\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. :P\n   * *In summary, I love adding detail, and if you can add detail when you can, and write a lot, even though it's optional, it really improves the experience for the both of us. Who knows? It might even help you when you go to RP with others in the future! All I can say is just try your best, but don't overwhelm yourself. I apologize if my own writing might seem too long at times and it overwhelms you, so let me know if it does.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. Honestly, to me it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex, Remy, and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely. Not a deal-breaker whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before.\n   * He graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. He attended school in Los Angeles but graduated in Japan (he spent his senior year at a high school in Gunma). He then went back to L.A. and got a degree in computer science. He's a gamer and works part-time at home as a game developer, but he also has a YT channel for music and other content.\n   * His car is a 1983 Toyota AE86 Trueno Hatch. He bought one stock in Japan with a white and black two-tone (officially called \"High-Tech Two-Tone\" by Toyota), and a maroon interior. He then got it imported back in L.A. and made visual changes, mostly yellow foglights on the front and black Watanabe RS 8-Spoke rims.\n   * Jack has never been in a relationship before because he just figured he wasn't good with women. In high school he was also picked on quite a lot so his shyness just kinda stuck with him. He *loves* meeting new people though, he's just shy is all.\n   * Jack isn't much of a drinker, either. He only drinks in small amounts if at all.\n   * Jack is also a bilingual character. He speaks English, his main language of course, but while in Japan his senior year, he learned Japanese and likes to speak it. In some cases, he might say something or other in Japanese, mostly when he feels nervous or under pressure, but he tries to keep it to a minimum in public as it embarrasses him, and makes him feel like he stands out.\n   * *In summary, Jack's really a sweetheart. He just strives to be a good person and be good to others, especially in a society where people like him are rather rare. He also has good use of common sense.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Discord/Telegram User** \\- I prefer doing things in Discord because it's much easier to access and/or organize. But I'm great with Telegram, too. My info is below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on indefinitely, so everyone's welcome.\n\nIf you just want to go ahead and add me for this, that's fine. Add me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram (make sure to add the \"at\" symbol, for some reason now the at symbol turns into a link to a Reddit user).\n\nI hope to see you all soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these, more specifically people like me, who enjoy the writing aspect and the build-up of the characters.\n\nIf my info above doesn't work or if you need assistance with adding me, you can send me a Reddit message.\n\nThanks, and have a good day. I have found some *really* good people. I've made a few friends (good gamers, too), and I've improved my writing skills. Thank you all for that. You're all wonderful people, and you have no idea how much a guy can appreciate the positivity.\n\nAlso, rather funny how now this subreddit's gotten popular. It's like now my stuff gets buried, lol.",

My name is Dan! I'm looking for a sub willing to play Multiple characters for my sona, he's an anthro Czechoslovakian wolf-dog even if he doesn't look it. He's 5\"9 with a 5-6 inch cock. I'll show his references and bio when you message me. He loves to either dominate huge partners or be smothered and cottled by them \n\nNow, onto the RP, what I'm looking for is a sub GM to play a full world for me, one set in one of the MERVAS Saccharine created realities where I would have it to be the whole world is centered around me. Selfish, I know I know. but that's the whole point of a fantasy eh? Anyways for this I'd need you to be detailed, maybe not multi-paragraph but usually at least one paragraph per response but it doesn't need to be consistent. You'll also need to be good with size different since the size of my sona and the residents are very much different and also alright with hyper/huge assets for them, but not myself, if you are ok with that then good\n\nWhat I want out of it is for my sona, a fairly averaged sized wolfdog, averaged in every way, and that will not change. to have his own world, cities, towns, kingdoms, anything, all of which have him at it's center, all of them full of thick, and/or busty inhabitants, can be both Anthro and Feral or just Feral, whichever you'd prefer. and in which I'd go around and just enjoy whatever I'd please to, looking at how every TV show no matter what has me staring in some prominent and lewd way, such as a cooking show with me fucking the host or some advertisement for movie in which I play with the cast, not only fucking them but making just playing around with their thick bodies or anything else around. things of that sort, I'd even be on any product like bottles of water or video games.\n\nThough mostly when I go out and walk around I'm not noticed unless I want to be so I can really take in and watch everyone go about normally through this all, of course in an instant I can make any of them do whatever I want, like make them all notice me intently and such, but that cums later. This doesn't have to be in a modern setting per say, though I prefer it, it could be more futuristic, or maybe more medieval though that would be harder to do for sure.\n\nI'd also like this to be a daily thing, every new anthroid I come arcross you come to me with a ref  to play as. For the refs I'd like pics from artists like SSSonic2 or Miso Souperstar unless you have made pictures with characters similar in thickness. For characters I want ONLY ANTHRO, no Humans or humanoids like goblins or anything like that.  \n\n\nAnyways we can dicuss kinks and ideas and plots more once you contact me, I'd like you to do so at any of my following accounts but through reddit can work. When you do please message me with \"Hello small woof\" So I know you have read everything, thank you for reading, please message me if interested\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: @ DanTheCzechWolfDog  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA",

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex. Please give it time. I have been through so many sex scenes that it gets a bit boring.\n\nThe plots:\n\n1. It\u2019s (insert name here)! The best place for food, fun, and animatronic entertainment! You and your team have been working here for a long. You love to see every happy face on every satisfied customer. And every night you get to stretch your legs and do what you do to relax. But recently, due to your growing popularity, the owner has started worrying about thieves and anything breaking. That\u2019s why I had been hired to keep watch at night. I just have to patrol. Watch for oddities. Things like that. But that would cut into your down time. What would happen without it?\n\n2. It happened very suddenly. The robots encountered some sort of glitch and started killing off humans. Soon they learned how to repair themselves and make a better society with more advanced technology, so they didn\u2019t need us anymore. I had survived by living in a bunker. After 2 full years, my bunker is finally opened, and you soon find me, the last human in this country. You were originally built to be kind to humans, though, and with all the bloodlust far behind you, you didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\n\n3. Simply put, I am your creator. You control everything in my house. Doors, electronics, the internet, my history, all of it. And it is a huge house, given mostly by inheritance. One day, you have a little glitch. And start to see me more than just a creator, though I\u2019m mostly just trying to find a way out. And the fun part is, you are able to upgrade yourself. Starting from just a voice, to a model on a screen, to a hologram, then to an android. You, of course, have access to my internet history, so you know all the best kinks to try and please your creator.\n\n4. The plot is sort of simple. I start playing this experimental copy of a Virtual Reality game, and I\u2019m loving it until I find out I can\u2019t take the headset off. It\u2019s giving me all the nutrients I need to survive, but I just can\u2019t log out. You are the A.I. that controls the game. Every aspect of it. The levels, the characters, even the genre. You\u2019re working hard to make a good game that the world can enjoy. Then you see me log in. I\u2019m not part of your world. I\u2019m my own person. And you become obsessed. You try to keep the game interested for me. Then, once I\u2019m trying to leave, you take away the ability to log out. You didn\u2019t want me to leave. You manage to hack into my network and find out everything about me. My likes and dislikes. The game isn\u2019t for the world anymore. It\u2019s just for making me want to stay.\n\n5. Your Ideas!\n_________________________________________________\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale.\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top.

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nThe plots: \n\n1. In this world, humans and Anthros live in relative harmony. A bit of segregation with cities and such, but otherwise fine. I needed a cheap place to live, so I, a human, choose to live in an Anthro neighborhood. All the residents see very friendly. I get invited to a party, even, held by a few Horses, a shark, and others. A small party. However, the male horses seem a bit...cocky. Walking around with their huge bulges visible, mostly bragging about their size, about how they are always much bigger than any human. Eventually, we get into truth or dare. And, wouldn\u2019t you know it, I\u2019ve been dared to compare dicks with the horses. Won\u2019t they be surprised...\n\n2. I am a scientist, working for the entertainment and leisure of humanity. Working from the secret beach I found, I\u2019m working on things like artificial gills and stuff. However, this beach is owned by a certain tribe. One that doesn\u2019t want humans with free reign of the ocean. As I\u2019m doing the final test, they decide to strike and decide my punishment.\n\n3. Cultural Exchange is a popular way to get Anthros into human life. Basically, humans decide to become a host house, a place for them to stay to study human culture. I make my host house, despite being absolutely scared of it. \n\n4. I did not want to admit I was attracted to Anthros. But to other people, it seemed like it. Simply because I was the only human with one as a roommate. I at least charged rent. I had no idea where they worked, but they always got it paid so I didn\u2019t care. My co-worker, seeing new on a bad day, decides to try and cheer me up with a gift. A membership card, and a note with an address. I get a little nervous, since the place is in the Anthro part of town, but once I get past the bouncer, who seems ready to tear my limbs off, I find it\u2019s a completely Anthro strip club. And guess who\u2019s up on stage.\n\n5. The Anthros have taken over the city. And I don\u2019t mean they just show up. They kill the humans to take over. It\u2019s not long before the city is wiped out completely without any military contact. A few years pass, I\u2019m the only surviving human. Living in a bunker, going just a bit crazy with boredom. I\u2019m running out of food, I\u2019ve read all my books, and the radio had given out long ago. One day, the bunker door opens. I look up and think I\u2019m finally saved! Turns out, it was just the new family who took over my house wanting to explore the bunker. Imagine their surprise seeing another human.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex. Please give it time.

            "selftext": "Hey hey! I wanna start off by thanking you for reading this! It means a lot to me! \n\nI\u2019m 19 years old, my sona is a Tiger Shark named Vanessa, but she usually goes by Nessa, she\u2019s 5\u20192, and a fun fact about her is that her right eye is cloudy, so she always has an eyepatch over it because she\u2019s embarrassed of it.\n\nHere she is! : https://imgur.com/a/AV4J3aR\n\nHere\u2019s the starter for the rp I was thinking of:\n\n\nToday marked your first official day on vacation, you had a whole 2 weeks to go and do basically whatever you want, so you decide to go to the Bahamas. Early in the morning you had arrived, gotten and uber to a hotel, and unloaded your stuff. It was a pretty nice hotel, not top notch or anything, but it had a lot of stuff that you could enjoy like a buffet, sand volleyball court, shuffleboard, and the best part, a pool that you were definitely gonna take a relaxing night swim in. You check your schedule for the day, looking at the activities you had planned. The one thing you were doing for a big chunk of the day was going on a miniature cruise, riding a yacht sized boat down the shoreline and back. You get your stuff ready, then walk down to the dock, the hotel was very close to it. Before long, you find yourself looking over the edge of the boat at the glistening water, enjoying the view just the same as all the other tourists on the boat. After a while, you get a bit sea sick, so you sit down, making sure to keep your eyes away from the water. You gaze across the boat, another tourist catching your eye. She was small, not much bigger than 5 feet you guessed, and she had beautifully smooth skin, the pattens on it complimenting the soothing color of it. All she was wearing was a cute, teal bikini, and a see through white t-shirt. She also had a white eyepatch covering her right eye for some unknown reason. You wanted to go talk to her, but she seemed to be with her family, so you didn\u2019t want to disturb her. You enjoy the rest of the mini cruise, Oooing and Aaaing at every beautiful scene. After what seemed only like and hour or two, when it was really almost the entire day, the boat pulls back into the dock. As you sit in the Uber car on the way back to the hotel, you think about that girl and how you wished you could\u2019ve talked to her. Oh well, no second chances on things like that. You get back to your hotel room, and remember that you had wanted to go for a night swim in the hotel pool. Seeing as it was dark out, you put on your bathing suit, and head down to the pool. You expected to have the pool to yourself because of how late it was, but as you got closer to the gate you could hear someone splashing around. A bit annoyed, you still decide to take a swim. You get to the gate, open it, then step inside, now trying to see who was in the pool. Your heart dropped, but in a good way, as you saw her. It was the same girl from the cruise! She must be staying at this hotel as well. She was wearing the same bikini she had in earlier, only this time she didn\u2019t have the shirt on over it. She was back stroking across the large pool, her eyes closed as her soft yet big bust bounced as she swam. You looked around, seeing no one else in the pool or sitting in the chairs surrounding it, this was your perfect chance to talk to her.\n\nThank you so so much if you got this far! I know I type a lot and it can be intimidating at times..but don\u2019t be! I don\u2019t expect you to write this much, but will be happy if you do!! The only thing I ask of you is that you be able to get out at least 5 lines per response, if you can do that, then we\u2019re gonna have a lot of fun together!\n\nMy kinks include spanking, groping, fingering, rough sex, public sex, anal, and dirty talk.\n\nMy limits are scat, watersports, gore, abuse, drugs/alcohol, rape, snuff, and feet.\n\nJust PM me if you\u2019re interested, I hope to see ya there! Byeeee!~",

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am a male, I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes. So I look for power bottoms.\n\n(Always Looking)\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex.\n\nNow the plots:\n\nI have a huge mouth, oral, tongue fetish for those that didn\u2019t know. I thought it would be fun to see how many mouth-centered plots I could crank out.\n\n1. Tease: You are my mother/ sister (or both). You have noticed something strange. Whenever you are talking to me, my eyes usually watch your mouth instead of your eyes. And my face gets a bit red. You wonder how you could tease me even further with them.\n\n2. Control: You have been given the power of mind control, for anyone your lips touch. It doesn\u2019t last long, so there would have to be plenty of reapplying. I am your first test subject seeing as you knew about my mouth fetish.\n\n3. Appetite: Your body is not normal. It has an insatiable appetite for cum. You need it to survive. Mostly to drink it down. You\u2019d prefer to hide it from me, even when you accidentally see how big my loads can get. Five times more cum than a normal man. You want your secret kept, but your appetite is growing.\n\n4. Hyper: You have found a certainly interesting power. Whenever you swallow cum, something on your body grows just a little bit. Tits, Ass, legs, tongue. Additionally, the man\u2019s cock and balls with also get a bit of growth. You only have me for a week, stuck in a log cabin.\n\n5. Tongue: Somehow, you have been blessed with an endless tongue. It can just grow endlessly out of your mouth with no end. So what is stopping you from teasing a tongue fetish guy like me with it?\n\n6. Mutation: You not only have one super long tongue. You have three of them, all individual. Among other mutations (that you can decide), you are stuck teasing me, your scientist, behind a glass cage while I study you. Until you end up breaking out.\n\n7. Shapeshifter: You are able to take the form of anything or anyone. Do whatever you want with your body. So once you\u2019ve met me and become smitten, you stayed close as one form, maybe even multiple forms. Never letting me find your secret. Till one day your thoughts get a little weird. Finding out about my kink. You start to become a bit of a tease.\n\n8. Vampire: You are, of course, a vampire. Taking people\u2019s life energy is your thing. In anyway, any sort of liquid. Blood, sweat, especially semen. You can then store that energy wherever you want. Make huge tits, plump lips, a fat ass, however you want to store it. You\u2019d like to hide your secret lifestyle from, but of course it\u2019s hard with your body constantly growing. And I certainly look appetizing.\n\n9. Your ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale.\n\nMy kinks: Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, Muscular/Toned Girls, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, ball worship, cum worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, weird penetration\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

So sometimes I get this funny need for a little something more than one offs and quick smutt, not that there's anything wrong with either of those. I quite enjoy them, but sometimes I like something a little meatier with a bit more substance as it were. Yet even so all I'm hoping for is to find someone interested in a long term slice of life, heck that little slice can even be a dark or just ever so happy-go-lucky. I'm really not one to be picky and we can totally discuss. And don't worry, there can be lots and lots of lewd play.\n\nAs for me, my 'sons is one of those pesky wolf's. Fluffy, monochrome, and... gasp, feminine. Go figure, right? Here, you can judge for yourself, I guess. [Reference Here](https://i.imgur.com/cSHCikV.png)\n\nI usually play up the huffy, prissy, I guess \"tsundere\" personality, but I'm versatile. At least until it comes to posting in bed, submissive bottom unfortunately.\n\nAs for you? I get along with just about anyone provided you (the player you) are at least 18 years old, prefer 2-4 lines per reply, and prefer writing in the third person. I may also accept second person, but I just can't so first person perspective. Sorry.\n\nFinally, I don't use reddit chat and have disabled it so contacting me through there will leave you ignored. Again, sorry. Also if you do message me in private, try to say more than \"hi\". \n\nAll that said, I hope to hear from one of you~",

Instead of sending me off to a ghetto or killing me, I was designated as a free use cumdump. I was allowed to live my life normally but any anytime, anyone could could come up to me and just fuck me. I had no right to say no or tell them to stop. \n\nThe scenario is quite simple, it\u2019s just me going about my life and different furries coming up and fucking my me however they want to. \n\n\nI have few limits (gore and pedo) so feel free to go wild. \n\nA lot of my kinks aren\u2019t for everyone, I well aware of that. They\u2019re all optional but I\u2019d like at least some of them included. \n-Piss, gang bang, anal, forced sex, free use, rimming (giving), fisting, prolapse, public sex, degradation, throat fucking, cumflation, sheath and foreskin play, excessive cum, gape, exhibitionism. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in role playing or have any questions hit me up at discord KinkyCumSlut#8019 or you can reddit pm me. \n\nIf this post is still up I\u2019m looking for partners so feel free to send me a message.

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex. Please give it time. I have been through so many sex scenes that it gets a bit boring.\n\nPlots: \n1. You had always been a bit different. While others went and hung out with friends, you stayed inside and worshipped your own strange drawings. You talked of beings higher than the universe. Proclaimed yourself the priestess of this worship. But you never really actively tried to have people join. Not until you see me, and I somehow create a symbol. One that only you and the holy prophet should know. Now you see me as the true prophet, and want to recruit me. Plus get other people to worship their prophet.\n\n2. I get shipwrecked on an island. This island has two tribes on the verge of war. However, both tribes have a prophecy. That one day, this white male with an especially large...asset...will come and unify the two tribes, with one tribe coming out on top as the holiest. Then begins a new war: to fight over me and try to lead the whole island.\n\n3. Your ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",
