            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human (and scalies are pretty great).\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI much prefer plot development over sex.\n\nNow the plot: \n\n1. Research: I\u2019ve been researching fake gills! The ability for humans to breathe underwater. I\u2019m conducting my research at a hidden beach where your kind usually frequent. They really aren\u2019t happy with me being here, but don\u2019t intervene as they must decide what to do. On the day my invention works, you strike (I\u2019d like to not know your plans, but we can discuss).\n\n2. Rulebreaker: As a bit of a rule, this is a beach where humans are not allowed. But I\u2019m a bit new and didn\u2019t know, so I end up stumbling by anyway. How do you deal with a rule breaker?\n\n3. Island: I am a shipwreck on your hidden island. I land on a beach considered cursed, and once you find me your tribe must decide what a cursed human is good for. Will there be trials? Slavery? Coexistence?\n\n4. Trespassing: The beach seems to be too close to a military base for comfort, but they all know to stay away. Until I\u2019m sort of hiding out of fear a bit too close. You, out on patrol, get the alarm and find me cowering on military property.\n\n5. Dare: I lose a bet and have to go to the beach, fully nude, and run a lap across the coast. Though they aren\u2019t really laughing once they see what I\u2019m packing, I\u2019m very embarrassed about my body and try to go quick. Hopefully I\u2019m not kidnapped or arrested before I can make it back.\n\n6. Your Ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tomboys, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, Yandere, weird penetrations\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

Some ideas, open to others or modifications.\n\n\n\n**World of Magic** I play a young and powerful witch who joins a team. Maybe a classic huge orc tank or giant barbarians are on the team as we travel in search of treasure and rare items.\u00a0\n\n\n**Aliens** In the future all kinds of aliens coexist on planets and space stations. Women are somewhat rare, especially in the outer reaches of space. Lots of alien men around to seduce and romance me. Plenty of the aliens can basically be furries. \n\n\n**Magic School** I'm a student in a magical school (Also open to a Yugioh GX style dueling school), plenty of students, admins, cleaning staff, cooks, and teachers to play around with. \n\n**Fandom** I have a few fandoms that have hunky men, but the first big furry that comes to mind is Captain Sajin Komamura of Bleach. I'd love to play an OC in the Bleach universe and get close with him, and/or plenty of other hot men. I have other fandoms too, just ask for a list. \n\n\nTell me your favorite color so I know you read the post.\u00a0",

However, for a long time anthros were not accepted in society. This is changing and they have equal rights but human anthro relationships are shunned. More over, as a human mates with an anthro they slowly turn anthro as well.\n\nKinks: anthro, huge cock partners, excessive cum, cum play, anal, submission, transformation, piss play, expansion, mpreg\n\nLimits: scat gore and vore.\n\nPlease include which prompt you prefer and we will discuss kinks limits and looks!",

I want to see your creativity for a generous royal with advanced science backing them up.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Yandere, Gyaru, weird penetrations\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

I typically only rp with females, but I am extending my wheel house.\n\nI only have a few stipulations. So, read below.\n\n1. I am the dominate here. You will be play a more submissive type. I don't mind brats and strong willed people. But, I do let you know that I am the one in charge. In rp and out.\n\n2. If you are not female I want to know. Regardless of gender you will play a female or futa it can be discussed further later.\n\n3. Be literate and willing to rp in paragraphs even 2-3 if it's all you can manage. However, 1-2 sentences just won't be enough to sate my desire.\n\n4. Be willing to talk out of character and become friends even. I really enjoy rping with people who I get along with. I am very patient and understanding but I do have standards.\n\n5. I use only discord, so I hope that's not a problem for you.\n\n-----\n\nIf you are able to handle these rules. I don't think it's asking much. Feel free to message me through reddit. I will be looking forward to seeing you. Let's talk more in private. :)",

Are you interested in a long term roleplay that has story with many paths and characters to possibly get kinky with along the way~? \n\nWell, you might be interested in what I have to offer! \n\nHi, I'm Boofed. And I'm here to look for any fun partners looking to play out large stories with some added smut spice to it~ \n\nHere are some I've thought up, and would be excited to play out!\n\n\n##Plush Filled Dream\n\nYou come home from a long day at work. It's been nothing but stressful for you, but luckily you're finally home. You shamble over to your bed and lay down. As you close your eyes, you wish to yourself that you could stay in a dream world forever.\n\nYour eyes open slowly, and you let out a long yawn. You look around at your surroundings and immediately notice a difference. Everything in your house looks soft and fuzzy. Then, you look down at yourself and find that your whole body was made of fabric. \n\nYou wouldn't have much time to take it all in, as you hear some commotion from outside. When leaving the bedroom, you're immediately bombarded by the noise and utter chaos happening just around you. But you wouldn't have long to ponder what was happening. A plush grabs your arm and starts pulling you along. \"This place is dangerous, come on! There's a safehouse up ahead!\".\n\nThe bunker doors shut immediately after you and the plush enter. You look around the safehouse and see a whole collection of other survivors. This seems like a good opportunity to question some of them as you seem to have time to figure out what's going on. \n\n##Robo-Buddy\n\nWhile the night sky was dark, the vibrantly lit buildings that made up the futuristic city of Tech Hills were bright enough to light every inch of the town. Though while being a citizen of a high tech city, you choose to be in the small group of citizens who settled their houses just outside of the city's technological influence. \n\nRecently, a new model of robotic companions have been released. Seeing these robot companions accompany your fellow classmates in college was tempting you to invest, but the price was still too high, even for the earliest commercially available model. \n\nThough one day, after walking back from a hard days work at college, you overhear a news broadcast on the massive holographic monitors on the business buildings. The news was telling of a rogue robot that had fled from its factory and was last spotted in the woodland outskirts. \n\nThough you were a bit on edge, it didn't phase you too much. That was, until you got home to find that the rogue robot was in your house. \n\n\"W-Wait! Wait! Please don't turn me in... I just need to lay low for a while, I'll be out of here when the coast is clear!\" The robot pleads with you as hear the sounds of sirens. The robot clasps its hands together as it gave you a sincere look. \"If they bring me back, they'll wipe my mind and disassemble me...\"\n\nAs the weight of your decision was getting more and more heavier, you hear a knock at the door. It sound loud and forceful, search lights would appear outside, scanning the forest. Keeping this robot hidden may be dangerous, but it may be worth it in the long run.\n\n##Surviving Malgoa\n\nTeleportation is a common form of transportation in the far reaches of space, especially the planetary sized space station Nexa. \n\nYour life on Nexa was calming, easy, and there was little to stress about with the exception of a few reported crimes in the shopping district.\n\nNexa was built into a galaxy where most planets were colonized by Exi Incorporated, which was the intergalactic company that built the station. Though there was one planet that Exi hadn't touched yet.\n\nMalgoa. A jungle planet wiped from Nexa's star map. Exi had attempted to take the planet over, but its inhabitants retaliated by driving their forces away. Nexa citizens only know the planets name and the dangers that lurk on it.\n\nWhile on your daily commute to meet some friends at a restaurant, you decide to take an empty teleporter to not have to be cluttered and pushed around when exiting. But upon activation, the machine would violently spark. In a quick second, the machine both simultaneously blew up and teleported you. \n\nFortunately, you survived the ordeal with no physical harm. Unfortunately, you now find yourself on the very planet that Exi labeled \"Deadly\". Through being teleported in the middle of the jungle, the beam had cut a hole through the tree's leaves above, making a bright opening in your spot. \n\nThe fear would be immeasurable, but you would hardly have any time to take action as you feel something press up against the back of your head. The sounds of a quite hum would be sickening, as they were the sounds of a laser powered rifle. \n\n\"Up on your feet slowly, city scum...\" Said an effeminate muffled voice from behind. After complying with the voice, you'd hear the person walking around you to meet your vision. The person was a light blue orc-ish creature that had four arms, two holding the rifle trained at your head and the other two idly holding sharp daggers. \n\nThe creature had a smooth feminine figure, somewhat covered by a clearly handmade outfit consisting of a skirt, top, and a pair of boots. The clothing was constructed using what looked to be leather and ripped up pieces of Exi military uniforms. \"As much as I dearly want to blow your head clean off and parade your corpse around... I must bring you to our king. If you don't comply, you'll know the outcome.\"\n\n\n\nThese scenes can be played out with any sort of character, so I welcome everyone who may be interested!\n\nAlthough, when time comes in the story for a bit of smut, I do hope we stray away from kinks like; scat, vore, diapers, and gore. These are major turn-offs for me, but anything else to open season!\n\nIf one of these interests you, then please consider PMing me! In your message, include a bit of information about the character (or characters) you'll be playing, and include and reference photos if you have any! \n\nAnd don't be afraid to ask any questions about the plots! I'll gladly answer them! \n\nKiK: boofed69\nTelegram: @Boofed101\n\n\u2661~ Boof",

First off, necessary \"all involved parties are 18+\" disclaimer. \n\nSecondly, these are entirely unfinished stories/plots/whatever. We can work out details and ideas together, and I enjoy doing so. So you probably should too. \n\n\nThird, I would like to Rp on discord. If that doesn't work for you let me know and we can work something out. \n\n\nNow! Let's get onto the ideas shall we? \n \n\n\nThemes/settings can range fairly wildly in this one. But I seem to be in the mood for romance, so it will contain some measure of that. Haha \n\n\n1: Mob/Mafia. A wiseguy falls for the boss's daughter; an enforcer already has a relationship going with the big guy's daughter or sister; a dispatched assassin finds himself unable to kill the mesmerizing woman he's sent after and they have to run to escape punishment for his betrayal. \n\nPlenty of options here. \n\n\n\n\n\n2: Fantasy (something along the lines of Red steel 2) or more realistic western. A smooth talkin' and fast shootin' gunslinger runs into a woman who quickly and inescapably burrows into his heart. The clash of different worlds and lifestyles could be fun. Maybe he saves her from  killers after her family fortune. Or maybe she's in the business of piling up bodies too. \n\n\n----------------------\n\nWhile there are plenty of different options and settings available, I am kinda looking for a lovely and heart-warming romance. But don't mistake that for a lack of passion and carnal desire. These furs, to one extent or another, will happily try to break the wall their beds set against. And we can definitely bring in plenty of kinks. \n\nMy main hard no's are things like scat, sexual gore, vore and bad hygiene. \n\nWhile my liked ones range from watersports to pregnancy to cumflation to incest. \n\nI am fairly detailed/descriptive in my writing, and try to spell things correctly. So if you do send me a message, please make sure you can write at least a decently beefy single paragraph with good grammar, spelling, etc.\n\nWell, thanks for your time and interest reading this! Send any questions you have my way, and I hope to hear from an interested party soon. :) Have a good night/day.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHeya! My name is Dan! I'm on EST time and looking for a sub willing to play Multiple characters for my sona, he's an anthro Czechoslovakian wolf-dog even if he doesn't look it. He's 5\"9 with a 5-6 inch cock. I'll show his references and bio when you message me. He loves to either dominate huge partners or be smothered and cottled by them\n\nI'm looking to do some situation where my sona is in a world of stopped time where everything is frozen and I can do whatever I want wherever, doesn't have to be time stop either, could be in MERVAS or where my sona is non existent, I'll explain those more later in. This could also be like that this could be a canon character situation or you can find refs of randoms. If we do canon characters it could be something like my boy getting a team of thick pokemon. Or maybe he is in some other game like Star fox or Paladins,. We can brainstorm plot and characters when we chat. Or just have character be on the fly, which I prefer\n\nI'd also like this to be a daily thing, every day you come to me with new characters and refs for me to play with, making starting the RP yourself with something and I'll continue it. For the refs I'd like pics from artists like SSSonic2 or Miso Souperstar unless you have made pictures with characters similar in thickness. For characters I want ONLY ANTHRO, no Humans or humanoids like goblins or robots or anything, though robots really depend on their looks I suppose.\n\nFor the RP also make sure to really describe and show just how bouncy and jiggly all that fat on ass and tits will be and how it squishes, all that, that's what I really like. I love to grind and pound my cock between assets, not so much penetration but I'll still do it. If I do and your into incest we could even do pregnancies and skipping later to when I'll have fun with my son/daughter when ther are older.\n\nHere are the Ideas I have for the world you could be RPing for me, if you have one aswell feel free to tell it to me! I'm interested to hear, though no promises as something like mind control isn't the, I guess unless the would world is under it.\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.  \n(For this I have the idea that the whole world will basically be about me, every company, ad, art piece, commercial, TV show, video game, etc. and I'm just basically a god and such, so I get to have and do whatever I want)\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss\n\nMy kinks are:  \nEmotionless sex, time stop/non existence etc.  \nLactation &amp; breastfeeding  \nTitfucking, thighjobs, hotdogging  \nHarems  \nWatersports  \nHyper tits/ass  \nGrowth  \nIncest\n\nLimits:  \nVore  \nMacro/micro  \nCuckolding (unless it's not happening to me)  \nSweat, farting, scat, etc.\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA",

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development and teasing over just pure sex. Though my kinks and stuff are at the bottom.\n\nThe plots:\n\n1. It\u2019s (insert name here)! The best place for food, fun, and animatronic entertainment! You and your team have been working here for a long. You love to see every happy face on every satisfied customer. And every night you get to stretch your legs and do what you do to relax. But recently, due to your growing popularity, the owner has started worrying about thieves and anything breaking. That\u2019s why I had been hired to keep watch at night. I just have to patrol. Watch for oddities. Things like that. But that would cut into your down time. What would happen without it?\n\n2. It happened very suddenly. The robots encountered some sort of glitch and started killing off humans. Soon they learned how to repair themselves and make a better society with more advanced technology, so they didn\u2019t need us anymore. I had survived by living in a bunker. After 2 full years, my bunker is finally opened, and you soon find me, the last human in this country. You were originally built to be kind to humans, though, and with all the bloodlust far behind you, you didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\n\n3. While I\u2019m out walking, I find you, a broken empty husk, sitting near a trash heap close to my house. Out of curiosity, I bring you home to see if I could fix you. Many people had bragged about their robotic servants, I figured I would just see what one could be like. Surprisingly, you can still work, and though you do have your old memories, you have a very odd type of personality that only shows up the more I fix you. What kind of robot were you, I wonder?\n\n4. Simply put, I am your creator. You control everything in my house. Doors, electronics, the internet, my history, all of it. And it is a huge house, given mostly by inheritance. One day, you have a little glitch. And start to see me more than just a creator, though I\u2019m mostly just trying to find a way out. And the fun part is, you are able to upgrade yourself. Starting from just a voice, to a model on a screen, to a hologram, then to an android. You, of course, have access to my internet history, so you know all the best kinks to try and please your creator.\n\n5. The plot is sort of simple. I start playing this experimental copy of a Virtual Reality game, and I\u2019m loving it until I find out I can\u2019t take the headset off. It\u2019s giving me all the nutrients I need to survive, but I just can\u2019t log out. You are the A.I. that controls the game. Every aspect of it. The levels, the characters, even the genre. You\u2019re working hard to make a good game that the world can enjoy. Then you see me log in. I\u2019m not part of your world. I\u2019m my own person. And you become obsessed. You try to keep the game interested for me. Then, once I\u2019m trying to leave, you take away the ability to log out. You didn\u2019t want me to leave. You manage to hack into my network and find out everything about me. My likes and dislikes. The game isn\u2019t for the world anymore. It\u2019s just for making me want to stay.\n\n6. Your Ideas!\n_________________________________________________\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale.\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tomboys,  Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Gyaru, Yandere, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

I usually walk past a bar that seemed empty, yet I try going in to least give it chance. Normally I don't drink since I had no reason to drink, but the only reason I tried is for the bartender. She caught my eye as her glazed eyes caught. I try to make small talk, but not much happens. Every night, I come over and drink until I was drunk on some nights, which helped me to feel confident and able to talk to her better. Tonight, she finally opened up about how this is her bar. She opened it and hopes to can make it big, but lately it's been slow. I told her I'll help with bringing up business in exchange that she has to close an hour earlier so that we can drink alone in the back near the inventory. After the next week, she's been hauling in new customers. She kept her promise and closed early tonight to bring me to the back**\n\n(My character is a slightly fit hyena named Brian.

            "selftext": "If you like or play warcraft, I think thisll be right up your alley...If you dont like orcs I can easily play a human or a furry! Whatever you're into!\n\nAll we knew was war, war everywhere...throughout the continents of Azersteria and Zafaria countless battles, victories and defeats on both sides of the fight, and of course a whole lot of bloodshed...The war is all anyone has ever known...50 years it's been going strong, soldiers constantly replaced on both ends of the fight...boys drafted when they came of age...On Zafarias side they were enlisted when they could visibly stand their ground and fight...A barbaric gathering of humans, orcs, goblins, giants, trolls...Azersteria had a majority of humans while Zafaria had very little...it was rare to see a human fight in the Zafarian army...But they had the help of elves as well...such noble and polished fighters...on both sides however...everyone was needed, anybody who can aid in the war, soldier? Magic user? Assassins? Strategists...as long as you could hold a sword and fight, youd fight or use your talents elsewhere to aid in the battles (You can be whatever youd like, human? Elf? Minotaur? Just say it in your bio haha!)\n\nWho was I? I'm an orc...a bruitsh aggressive ugly creature by nature...or so you might think, yes I'm tall, yes I'm muscular, however I am a mage, quite the talented one too...I aided in Zafarias fight against the Alliance but was captured...they threw me in prison to rot and there it remained until about a year ago...when the Azersterian force needed spies to gather information...Of course I did serve, I'd rather betray my country than rot in prison for life...You may quickly find I'm not like most orcs, I dont talk much, I strategize and think before putting a plan into action, im very different than my kind...\n\nThis is where you come in, you can be whatever you wish...Mage? Bruiser? Assasin? What kinds of weapons do you use? What race are you? And how did you come into the Alliance? You can tell me this all in your bio, anyway\n\nMe you and a small group of spies are heading to Zafaria to gather information, you immediately have a distaste and lack of trust for me...or maybe you are interested and try to befriend me! It all depends on how your character fits into the story! But like it or not, we are stuck with a few others and are traveling to the enemy risking our lives...\n\nAll of this will have action scenes, slow talkative ones, romantic ones, and some fucking of course! Tell me if you're a top or bottom in your opener which I will get into in a few paragraphs\n\nSo reader? Can you write in detail? Can you play multiple characters? Can you add events in the plot for us to do? Do you love getting lost in these fantasy worlds? Can you give a large paragraph at least of detail and words, even if it's just the little things? Do you love the buildup to romance? Do you love action scenes? Suspenseful scenes? Do you love discussing and planning for the wonderful plot we will make? And do you love the sharing of secrets and trust building throughout the rp? If you said yes to all of these or a majority of these congrats! I would be truly honored to rp with you!\n\nSo as for characters and stuff I'm really good with anything! Are you muscley? Large? Athletic? Dom? Sub? Masc? Ginerly Behaving? Shy? Extroverted? Only thing I'm not into as much is femboys.\n\nSo how will you fit into the story\n\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT. So when you message me, show me your ref, tell me what position you will play dom or sub, tell me which idea youd like to do and build on, and most importantly give me a bio about your character! Whats his name? What does he like? Whats he do? What makes him amazing and memorable? And if possible a non spoilery backstory lol. THE LONGER THE BETTER the longer it is the more it will have my attention and give me a good insight on how you rp I have some secrets about my char to spill haha.\n\nOh and please don't open with \"Hi\" or \"Hey\" only or any of those one word sentences. I'll know who followed directions based on the responses I get\nNow that I read this I sound much more picky than I am...I'm very leaniant with mostly everyone\n\nTelegram is MarcelTheFluff",

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nI am looking for a GM who can hopefully help put me in one of these worlds. Or if you have your own in mind, I\u2019ll take that as well, if I know enough about it. If you wanna do just the Mushroom Kingdom or Hyrule, or if you have your own original world?\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development over sex. Please give it time. I have been through so many sex scenes that it gets a bit boring. Stuff about me at the bottom.\n\nMy plots:\n\n1. Nintendo: I, in one way or another, have stumbled into a world. Almost like a resort of sorts. With a beach, hotels, an amusement park, everything relaxing. The strange thing about this place is that it caters to tired Nintendo characters. Heroes and princesses, warriors and even villains all stay at their respective hotels when their games go through a break. But what will happen with the discovery of me, a player? Will there be chaos? Mild annoyance? Or will there be acceptance, fascination, and maybe a bit of craziness?\n\n2. Danganronpa: I never expected to get enrolled in Hope\u2019s Peak Academy. Apparently people called me the Ultimate Graphic Designer, from my work on famous logos, photoshopping fashion mags, even game designing. But I thought I was just about mediocre at it. I got accepted though, and I couldn\u2019t wait to meet all my other classmates. I took a deep breath and a step inside...(We can do a regular school life or a killing school life. I only know the first 2 games)\n\n3. MLP: Yes, I was a brony. Since the show had ended, I didn\u2019t really know what to do with my time. I was stressed and MLP was a good outlet. While watching a rerun of one of the episodes, I start to fall asleep, slightly tearing up. And when I wake up, I\u2019m surrounded by dark forest. I try to explore, confused and scared until I see a strange sight. A small town with a giant crystal tree in the center. I suddenly knew where I was. Equestria. I needed to find my way home. Maybe someone in the Mane 6 could help...\n\n4. Your Ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tomboys, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Yandere, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "(Always Looking)\n\nI much prefer plot development and teasing over just pure sex.\n\nThe plots:\n\n1. In this world, people are born with a Tattoo somewhere on their body, which shows the initial of your soulmate, as well as raising body temperature at a certain age when close, like a literal game of hot/cold. It also depicts a small, super secret detail that only they would know. Your tattoo has an S surrounded by a bunch of Zs. You have been my bully for years, and you only get stronger at it. However, one birthday, you go to give me my usual beatings, but this time your body starts to feel hot.\n\n2. You have a lot of fun, as a girl in a rich family, picking up the homeless, offering them food and shelter, then kicking them out in the harshest way possible. The poor doesn\u2019t deserve happiness. Then you pick me up, learn about me, and that changes. You don\u2019t want to admit it, so instead of kicking me out, you try to be a harsh mistress, trying to ignore your growing feelings.\n\n3. As society grows, the gods and goddesses of old have long been forgotten. Your champion was a noble and brave man, willing to conquer anything to honor his lord. Cut to modern day, when you decide to check on on his distant offspring. Me. Kind of weak and cowardly. A disappointment. You think maybe I need some training, and set up a fake epic quest, trying to keep your disgust on as I start to grow on you.\n\n4. We live together, though you own the house and you don\u2019t let me rest. You\u2019re essentially my bully, but you barely charge any rent because of it so I have no choice but to stay. Though, one day, you learn from a friend (who happened to catch me) that I have a MASSIVE cock. Soon your abuse gets a bit more sexual. \n\n5. You find an old news article. One that states a human time traveler, leaving to 1,000 years in the future. Which just so happened to be today. History had already forgotten that I left. You decide, instead of a warm welcome, you would give me a bit of a cruel surprise.\n\n6. I was framed for a crime I didn\u2019t commit. Killing a trusted noble. As such, I am sentenced to be taken to the royal torture chamber, where you are already ready to have fun with me. Inbetween sessions, though, you find out from your own study that I was innocent, and start to feel a bit bad. But you still have a job to do.\n\n6. Your ideas!\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tomboys, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Yandere, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": " Heya! My name is Dan! I'm on EST time and looking for a sub willing to play Multiple characters for my sona, he's an anthro Czechoslovakian wolf-dog even if he doesn't look it. He's 5\"9 with a 5-6 inch cock. I'll show his references and bio when you message me. He loves to either dominate huge partners or be smothered and cottled by them   \n\n\n  I'm looking to do some situation where my sona is in a world of stopped time where everything is frozen and I can do whatever I want wherever, doesn't have to be time stop either, could be in MERVAS or where my sona is non existent, I'll explain those more later in. This could also be like that this could be a canon character situation or you can find refs of randoms. If we do canon characters it could be something like my boy getting a team of thick pokemon. Or maybe he is in some other game like Star fox or Paladins,. We can brainstorm plot and characters when we chat. Or just have character be on the fly, which I prefer  \n\n\nI'd also like this to be a daily thing, every day you come to me with new characters and refs for me to play with, making starting the RP yourself with something and I'll continue it. For the refs I'd like pics from artists like SSSonic2 or Miso Souperstar unless you have made pictures with characters similar in thickness. For characters I want ONLY ANTHRO, no Humans or humanoids like goblins or robots or anything, though robots really depend on their looks I suppose. \n\nFor the RP also make sure to really describe and show just how bouncy and jiggly all that fat on ass and tits will be and how it squishes, all that, that's what I really like. I love to grind and pound my cock between assets, not so much penetration but I'll still do it. If I do and your into incest we could even do pregnancies and skipping later to when I'll have fun with my son/daughter when ther are older.  \n\n\nHere are the Ideas I have for the world you could be RPing for me, if you have one aswell feel free to tell it to me! I'm interested to hear, though no promises as something like mind control isn't the, I guess unless the would world is under it.\n\nTime Stop: Everything in the world is stopped and frozen, even in middair, unless I interact with it, and even if I do, it's still pretty frozen, think of DIO's stopped time in JOJO only infinite and for my sona, he can have magic so no need to worry about explaining it\n\nNon existence: This is a complex one, basically I'm invisible to everything in the world, only also anything I do will not be noticed, if I touch someone they will not feel it, if I take off their shirt they will still think it is on and the same for everyone else, if I move them to a new place they'll still think it's the same place they were in before, etc. etc. I can go into more detail when you contact me\n\nMervas: This is a world that the user Lurdanjo came up with, if you want more info visit his FA page where he has some FAQs I suggest highly that you read if you wanna know more, basic summary, a world/artificial reality of androids that let you do whatever you want to them and are happy about it no matter what and feel no pain.  \n(For this I have the idea that the whole world will basically be about me, every company, ad, art piece, commercial, TV show, video game, etc. and I'm just basically a god and such, so I get to have and do whatever I want)\n\nNPC world: This works like I get sucked into a video game world somehow, or even multiple with the able to switch between them. But anyways this world similar to non existence, but it's like in a video game, where NPCs can only say their same lines over and over, anything else that happens they will not react to no matter what. I can explain more when we dicuss  \n \n\nMy kinks are:  \nEmotionless sex, time stop/non existence etc.  \nLactation &amp; breastfeeding  \nTitfucking, thighjobs, hotdogging  \nHarems  \nWatersports  \nHyper tits/ass  \nGrowth  \nIncest\n\nLimits:  \nVore  \nMacro/micro  \nCuckolding (unless it's not happening to me)  \nSweat, farting, scat, etc.\n\nIf you got this far congrats! Thank you for reading! If you contact me say \"Hello there small woof\" to let me know that you read this whole thing and are interested!\n\nDiscord: DanTheCzechWolfDog#3909  \nTelegram: [u/DanTheCzechWolfDog](https://www.reddit.com/u/DanTheCzechWolfDog/)  \n(will be less active) Kik: OverWoLFAlphA",

            "selftext": "**Post is still open!**\n\nHey! \n\nToday I'm looking for someone to play out a light hearted roleplay scenario taking place in a regular modern day, with the exception of anthro animals being a thing, where they live in their own country just like humans. \n\nIn this scenario, I like to play as one of these anthro people, a female one who happens to be a famous porn star or celebrity in this world. I'd like you to play as one or more human men in the roleplay :) This could play out in different scenarios, either on a porn set, if I'm taking part in a human on anthro movie, or maybe some vacation setting, or if you have other ideas! \n\nI like this to be a light hearted roleplay scenario, so not into dark stuff, or more serious stuff like romance and kissing etc. As for ages, I do like her to be 30+, and the guy(s) to be 18\n\nI'm also open for switching the roles around!\n\n* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, clothed sex, slow sex, body contrasts, age contrasts, group sex \n* **Limits:** Toilet stuff, impregnation, violence, abuse, dominance, male anal, underage, romance and kissing\n\nSo, if you like to try this out, send me a Pm and let me know a bit of what you're into about this :) To help me find out more of what you're into, please answer the following questions in your response:\n\n* Your thoughts on the idea\n* Your kinks (that don't go against my limits or the light hearted theme)\n* Your limits\n* Anthro species you're open for including\n* If you'd be open for switching the roles around, with you as her and me as him\n\nThat's about it! I'm looking for someone who is able to write for this. Not looking for walls of text etc, but at least show me you're serious about roleplaying with me. If you're just here for a quick release, it will show, so don't give me one liners that don't even answer the questions above. \n\nI also prefer to play this in a session rather than over a long time with long in between the responses. Finally, **Don't use the chat!**, send a Pm instead. And no, I don't have KIK.\n\n*Love, Emelie*",

            "selftext": "Hello and Welcome, as the title of this post suggests this roleplay is about a completely free use society, one where sex and sexuality is no longer taboo our society, later on in this post I will be explaining exactly what i mean but first I wanted to get a few things out of the way first, such as length requirements. Overall I\u2019m a bit of stickler with this, i typically will do around 1-3 paragraphs per response, sometimes it will be closer to 1 while some days it will be closer to 3, it really just depends on the time of day, how busy i am and whether i am at work or not, you will not be required to match me, i would prefer it but my minimum for this will be at least one paragraph. The second thing before i get into the full details of the plot is that i am looking for this to be somewhat long term and definitely detailed and literate, while i already talked about my length requirements this is a big part, please please please make it seem like youre trying and move the story along, at least whatever story there can be in a role like this, if its evident you will are not trying you will be left on read and will not hear from me again, I\u2019m sorry if that seems harsh but thats how it has to be because of the actions of others.\u00a0\n\n\nNow as far as the details of the role are concerned i will just get right into it:\u00a0\n\nImagine a world where sex and sexuality are no longer taboo, incest relationships are open and accepted, condoms and birth control have been outlawed as breeding is the new norm during sex and\u00a0 free use is practically a world wide law at this point, see that cute cashier at the super market, go ahead and get behind her and take her while she scans peoples groceries, see that sexy bartender giving you fuck me eyes? Why don\u2019t you lift her up, put her on her back on the bar top and put some babies in her.\n\nThis is of course just a taste of what i had in mind for this role, as my partner in this you will be required to play the female roles for this, again i will get into what i need from you a little later on but first i wanted to tell you about the characters I will be playing as:\n\nThe first and main character will be James Lawson, a young Billionaire Pitbull who has just turned 21 and come into his very large inheritance after the death of his parents when their private jet crashed. Since then young Mr. Lawson has been doing his best to fill his fathers shoes during the day as the handsome billionaire philanthropist when he needs to be, but also the handsome billionaire playboy when he isn\u2019t on the clock, taking only the most beautiful women he sees whenever and wherever he wants, making sure to take their numbers should they want to come back for more. James\u2019 story will take place mainly in modern day North America, Mexico and some other countries such as the Bahamas, and South America.\n\nThe second character who we can work up to will be James\u2019 college roommate, a tall dark and handsome stallion named Marcus, who also comes from money, but has yet to come into his own inheritance fully as both of his parents are still alive, his mother having carried a child from both his father and himself of course. Marcus much like James takes who he wants, when he wants, evidenced by the fact that hes bred both his mother and his older sister. Marcus\u2019 story will take place in Europe, Asia and Africa, the two will converge in a set up plot point where James will travel to Paris and meet up with his friend, we will then switch between James and Marcus after that depending on the day and who i would rather play.\u00a0\n\n\nI do understand that this is a lot to take in and i very much appreciate you reading this far, i will provide refs for both Marcus and James once we are on kik. I will now get into the last things, what i will need from you when you message me and my kik username.\u00a0\n\nNow what i will need from you is relatively simple, with each girl the men will encounter i will need a ref, name and age for each. While i will not require you to provide each ref as i have some already saved up to use i will let you provide the majority but again i will give out a ref, name and age of a girl that James or Marcus will meet along the way.\u00a0\n\nNow that that\u2019s all over I thank you for reading all of this, we can discuss some details and any questions you may have later on once we get to messaging on kik, my kik username is Big_Daddy_Lawson, I will be waiting there excited and with baited breath to see who accepts this role.\u00a0",

I have been through so many sex scenes that it gets a bit boring.\n\nDon\u2019t judge me:\n\nMy plots:\n\n1. Simple: It\u2019s my birthday. And my roommates, as a joke, invited a clown, cause they knew clowns made me uncomfortable. They were a bit surprised when the one that showed up was absolutely sexy, but they didn\u2019t mind. They left the apartment, keeping me locked in to \u201cenjoy\u201d some tricks.\n\n2. There is an old legend about clowns. They each paint their own egg and that egg becomes the clown\u2019s soul. Supposedly, that means the character won\u2019t die as long as the egg remains. I find one of these odd painted eggs in the middle of a field, from a traveling circus, and take it home with me. My house is soon filled with faint laughter or horns. Does that mean the soul came with? \n\n3. Saving a life is easy enough. Saving a life when the victim is something creepy is another thing. A street performing clown nearly gets hit by a truck, but I push them out of the way. She seems grateful. A bit too grateful. Going home, I find a new door, which leads to...an entirely different world. One with lots of balloons and bright colors. \n\n4.

(Password = \u2018Drying Paint\u2019, please include it in your first message so I know you read it, thanks!) I myself am a switch with very little lean.\n\n     Some of my main kinks (they are all optional) are: belly play, dry humping, musk, frotting, heat/ breeding, blowjobs, hand jobs, and sheaths\n\n     My more extreme kinks (which are just as optional as the others) are: Armpits, watersports, sheath play, maws, lactation, feral, extreme musk, armpits, and urethra play.",

That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nThe plots: \n\nAny of your ideas are also welcome! \n\n1. In this world, humans and Anthros live in relative harmony. A bit of segregation with cities and such, but otherwise fine. I needed a cheap place to live, so I, a human, choose to live in an Anthro neighborhood. All the residents see very friendly. I get invited to a party, even, held by a few Horses, a shark, and others. A small party. However, the male horses seem a bit...cocky. Walking around with their huge bulges visible, mostly bragging about their size, about how they are always much bigger than any human. Eventually, we get into truth or dare. And, wouldn\u2019t you know it, I\u2019ve been dared to compare dicks with the horses. Won\u2019t they be surprised...\n\n2. I am a scientist, working for the entertainment and leisure of humanity. Working from the secret beach I found, I\u2019m working on things like artificial gills and stuff. However, this beach is owned by a certain tribe. One that doesn\u2019t want humans with free reign of the ocean. As I\u2019m doing the final test, they decide to strike and decide my punishment.\n\n3. Cultural Exchange is a popular way to get Anthros into human life. Basically, humans decide to become a host house, a place for them to stay to study human culture. I make my host house, despite being absolutely scared of it. \n\n4. I did not want to admit I was attracted to Anthros. But to other people, it seemed like it. Simply because I was the only human with one as a roommate. I at least charged rent. I had no idea where they worked, but they always got it paid so I didn\u2019t care. My co-worker, seeing new on a bad day, decides to try and cheer me up with a gift. A membership card, and a note with an address. I get a little nervous, since the place is in the Anthro part of town, but once I get past the bouncer, who seems ready to tear my limbs off, I find it\u2019s a completely Anthro strip club. And guess who\u2019s up on stage.\n\n5. The Anthros have taken over the city. And I don\u2019t mean they just show up. They kill the humans to take over. It\u2019s not long before the city is wiped out completely without any military contact. A few years pass, I\u2019m the only surviving human. Living in a bunker, going just a bit crazy with boredom. I\u2019m running out of food, I\u2019ve read all my books, and the radio had given out long ago. One day, the bunker door opens. I look up and think I\u2019m finally saved! Turns out, it was just the new family who took over my house wanting to explore the bunker. Imagine their surprise seeing another human.\n_________________________________________________\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development and teasing over pure sex. \n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tomboys, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Yandere, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do.
