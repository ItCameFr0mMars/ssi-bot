            "selftext": "**Prompt is still open**\n\nHi there!\n\nI've been into anthro animal roleplaying a lot lately and I'd love to do a roleplay again on the theme!\n\nThe idea for this roleplay scenario is that I'm a rather strong and fit girl, age around 25, who works together with other even stronger anthro animals in an alternative world where they exist. \n\nI don't want to be strong int he bodybuilder sense, but I like to be a bit thicker, larger thighs etc, not the petite girl, but not fat or anything. Strong enough to be able to handle the largest animals when I decide I want to have a fuck ;)\n\nI'd prefer this to take place on a workplace requiring good physique, like a construction site, motor garage, fire station etc. Open for ideas there :) \n\nThis workplace would of course have a lot of anthro animals, and a fun, flirting and teasing macho culture which I've managed to become a part of(as these anthros respect strength, even if I'm a human and a woman) with the occasional ass slap, playful banter, and of course lots of sex when more in private!\n\nThis would play out as just a regular day at work, a monday morning a month after I moved there and started working with the anthros. \n\nI would prefer if you could play the males in third person, as I prefer to do shorter scenes with different guys, switching between them, and maybe if you can control more than one at once for the start of the scenes, bit only one as we go along to the sex part.\n\nI want this roleplay top be a fun and light hearted one, leaving out dark themes, dominance, bondage etc!\n\nSome animals for inspiration: Horse, zebra, bull, tiger, lion, bear, deer, dragon\n\n* **Kinks:** Vaginal, anal, large cocks, light hearted fun, multiple shorter scenes, some dirt(no smells though), group sex\n\n* **Limits:** Impregnation, toilet stuff, dark stuff, male anal, underage\n\nSo if you're interested in trying out this roleplay, please let me know what you think about the idea :)\n\nTo show me you've read this far, could you please let me know:\n\n* your thoughts on the idea\n* what of my kinks you like\n* what kinks you like to add(that don't go against my limits)\n* what limits you have\n* animals you're ok with playing as(I prefer some to choose between :) )\n* If you have the time to play this out now in a more rapid response kind of roleplay\n* If you're open for role reversal, with you as her and me as him\n\nPlease take your time to respend. i don't expect any walls of text, but please let me se you've read my prompt :) Oh and please,  **send your response as a PM, and not in the chat**\n\n*Love, Emelie*",

The cloning efforts have led to hybrids with various forms, reproduction drives, humanoid genatalia, and of course violent instinct. The biggest issue has been the lack of a true queen, stifling the efforts to breed and produce a pure, full-blooded Xenomorph.\n\nSo I'm looking for a penpal who is willing to roleplay multiple genders and people.

This is the Alien universe, if you haven&amp;#39;t seen any of the movies or uncomfortable with gore and violence this isn&amp;#39;t the RP for you. I&amp;#39;m looking to play out the beginning of the fall, starting with the first colonist awakened from hyper sleep, and progress from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kinks for this include bad ends, non con, beast, transformation, impregnation (male and female), oviposition, gore, and other dark stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no limits and prefer you don&amp;#39;t either. Looking for like minded pen pals. Message for rp, don&amp;#39;t like chat feature.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It\u2019s only until recently that it\u2019s begun to really turn me on! Now I am trying to find all the subreddits I can cause this is so hot!!! \n\nWould love to chat with someone more and hopefully Rp. I\u2019m down for about a thousands roles. What I am really hoping to find is a fellow flirt who likes to play very curvy females and likes her males big and powerful. Other than that I am super open to all kinds of roles and kinks.   But the over sized body types is definitely something I find super SUPER hot. \n\nSo take a look at my kinks and let\u2019s have some fun! \n\nGuys who like to play females. Don\u2019t be shy, I\u2019d love to talk to you as well ;) \n\n\n\nProbably the thing I miss most about Roleplays is the excitement and the hotness of finding someone that shares similar kinks as you. When you find that right person it\u2019s down right exhilarating.  both of you in the edge of the seat waiting for the other to respond. The kind of turned on you haven\u2019t been for years. Obviously that\u2019s never easy to find in a sea as vast as the internet. Filled with thousands of others with their own ticks and kinks. But Damn the odds I\u2019m determined to find that thrill once again. \n\nTo find someone that enjoys flirting back and forth both in and out of Roleplay. One who wants to turn me on as much as I want to turn them on. I want to blow you out of the water. Someone who likes a good back and forth of setting up a hot role. Who likes to ask question to get to know my turn on better. That\u2019s what I love to do. \n\n\nHuge Tits\nPhat Ass \nMonster sized cocks \nSlightly unrealistic sizes \nDirty talk \nDirty nick/pet names \nHigh Heels! \nSlutty clothes (seriously love the details) \nHeavy make up \nCheating \nCock worship \nMuscle worship\nLoud sex\nMessy sex\nRough sex\nThe incredibly rare slow blow\nRisky sex (cheating wise, behind the back kind of deal) \nMilfs\nDilfs\nSIZE Queens \nBimbos (love the looks. It when they are airheads)\n\nSo many more I could possibly list them all. So ask me about them! \n\nOnly a few limits. \nToilet play \nNon con \nFutas\n\nBonus points if your subject line is something hot ;)",

If you're reading this I assume the title was enough to interest you. I promise, I won't keep you here very long.\n\nAnyways, I'm searching for some dominant males who would like to set-up a literate role-play that's focused more on plot/world building/development and character development than smut. I'm looking for someone who's equally as dedicated as I am to the RP. \n\nI'm not necessarily looking for anything in specific, I'd love to set up a RP that the two of us both enjoy though. I'm of course hoping to inherent a bit of romance into the RP, as long with a little bit of smut; but I would love to set up a RP where we can create lore - a fictional world: our own story.\n\nPosting length isn't too big of a deal with me, as long as your putting dedication into your replies; grammatical mistakes are fine too- it happens sometimes! Overall, as long as your not posting one or two lines each post; I believe we'll get along just fine. - I can write multi-paragraph responses, though, I'll try my best to match how you write so we can keep consistency between each other. - If you're reading this, send *SpaceX* in your first post. d: \n\nIn this Imgur Link you can find a Kink-List, and the character I'll be playing: [https://imgur.com/a/u4lgj6s](https://imgur.com/a/u4lgj6s) .\n\nI do in-fact have my own OC, and though I've been in the mood to play the character shown in that Imgur Link, I wouldn't mind showing my character and maybe playing as him instead (just ask about him!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you message me, please supply me with your REF/OC, A few Kinks, Maybe some ideas you have for a plot/setting or something you're looking for in specific, your time-zone, and any questions you may have for me!",

Naturally, you don't have to comply to any of these kinks should you so wish! \n\nFeel free to message with any ideas for roles or scenes, because I love to make them up with my partner as it\u2019s much more interesting! If you really do not like discord, then you can message me asking for my kik - but I definitely prefer it less. \n\nI do appreciate detail in my roleplay, which means that you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if you get ignored if you give me a one line answer, but provided that\u2019s all good then we should be able to have some good fun!

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks for stopping by.\u00a0 As the title suggests I'm looking for a bit alpha dom to come and claim me as his pet.\u00a0 I am a very literate role player with over 10 years experience. I can be slow, I prefer to take time developing the posts I send and my IRL is fairly hectic.\u00a0 I usually post a few times per day, sometimes more, I will let you know if it's going to be extended, but if you proceed to reach out (still hope you do,) know that going into it. I also post in first person and usually do a multiple paragraphs per post.\n\nI have many kinks, specifically I'd like to include Size Difference (1-5 feet), Bondage, Musk, Humiliation and After Care (cause who doesn't like a caring brute!) As for limits, I have very few.\u00a0 Females, Scat, Vore and gore are top of the list.\u00a0 I will let you know if I'm not into something, just ask!\n\nThat being said, and without further adieu, my plot ideas.\u00a0 These are super flexable and can be worked or molded to fit your preferences.\u00a0 I'm also always open to suggestions, so if the below aren't to your liking, feel free to suggest some, chances are I'll be up for playing them!\u00a0 \n\n1. I am your average fur, living a mundane life oblivious to the seedy world just under the surface. That was until I saw something I truly shouldn't have and thrust into the bizaar and ancient world of legend. This world run by the monsters and magic, I couldnt just go about my life anymore. Normally a mortal in my position would be killed, but you, an imposing creature m, takes a liking to me and decide to take me on as a pet.\n\n2. I fell on some hard times. I was in desperate need to find a roommate, and unfortunately inwasnt getting much interest.  You are one of the few that replied to my add, meeting me you know you are gonna make me your beta. This would be more of a slow slice of life story, corrupting me and subtly changing em to a sub beta for you to control.\n\n3. I live in a small little village in the outskirts of the kingdom.\u00a0 We are a proud people, more like a tribe then a city.\u00a0 I am one of the elder's sons, the runt of the litter.\u00a0 I had something to prove.\u00a0 When your forces invade, pillaging and burning our tribe's homes, I stand against you.\u00a0 My brothers and neighbors all submitted, but I would take a little doing, that's your job.\u00a0For this prompt, if you want to go rougher and  more non con, you can play as a member of the invading forces that pillaged and destroys the town. My character would be the spoils of the raid.\n\nSome of these plots can be more of a slice of life style, can be set in the future, present or a fantasy.\u00a0 Send me a message on Kik at JumpinJax95, or ask for my Telegram or Discord!",

            "selftext": "Here is the dealio! I am a male, a submissive top because I like to take orders and be less aggressive but I don\u2019t like it up the butt.\n\n(Always Looking)\n\nYou can be female or futa, even male, as long as you are a power bottom. And you can play one member of the tribe, a few members, the whole tribe, I don\u2019t mind!\n\nYour species also doesn\u2019t matter. I would love buff shark women just as much as buff human women.\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development and teasing over just pure sex.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale \n\nThe plot:\n\nI am a (very hung) man who has shipwrecked on a small island somewhere in the middle of the pacific. After about a week of staying on the eastern beach and fishing, I decide to go into the jungle to get some different food and better-filtered water. I still have guns, so that really helps.\n\nNow to your tribe, you have learned that the southern and eastern beaches are where evil comes from, which is why I hadn\u2019t been found yet. But once I set foot in the jungle, I can be easily caught and brought to your village for judgement from your leader. Since I came from the south and I am clearly not a giant warrior anthro.\n\nNow here\u2019s a few choices for your leader to determine:\n\n1. If I need anything from the tribe, I must complete a set of trials to determine life or death. By surviving, I become an honorary part of the tribe. Failure is death. I am to stay in a very public jail cell between each trial.\n\n2. I am immediately deemed as a slave worker. I must go around the tribe and do whatever the village asks of me, or death is sure to follow. On the bright side, I get my own hut. And maybe there are a couple who do not wish to see me slaved.\n\n3. I am seen as a sign of god and am to be treated as such. I am basically your god\u2019s messenger and you want me to bring good word of your tribe to them. The downside is I must sleep in a cave outside of the village, and there are some skeptics...\n\n4. I am absolutely the first human ever seen. As such, I am to be studied. I am given to the tribe\u2019s most scientific members (be it real science or just witch doctor stuff) to partake in any experiments or examinations. At least I get a bed in their place.\n\n5. Anything else you can think of.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale.\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Tomboys, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, cum worship, ball worship, tit worship, expansion, vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Yandere, Gyaru, weird penetrations (Nipple, Ear, etc.)\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "It's Christmas season again, and I've been grouchy all month. The reason was simple: I wasn't going to be getting, or giving, any presents this year, like last year and the year before that. All of my friends have moved on with their lives, and I haven't heard from my family since falling out with them eight years ago. It seemed likely to be another lonely Christmas.\n\nBut this year was different, for when I wake up that Christmas morning, I find a large box with a bow on top. The tag read \"From Santa\". Thinking it was a prank, I open the box expecting a custard pie, or a giant boxing glove to hit me in the face. Instead, I see you, naked as the day you were born. Your eyes flutter open, and you say \"Merry Christmas, Master.\"\n\nMy character is named Solomon, or Sol for short. He's a grey wolf hound with black stripes going down his back, and has striking blue eyes.\n\nI like to play the top in the pairing, so I'm expecting you to be submissive. I like to rp with women, femboys, and MtF trans girls (preferably who haven't had Gender Reassignment Surgery and are on HRT).\n\nMy kinks include anal (Giving), Blowjob (Receiving), Deepthroat (Receiving), Crossdressers, small cocks, etc.\n\nMy limits include scat, blood, vomit, watersports, snuff, gore, etc.\n\nA full kinklist is [here](https://i.imgur.com/Aox81dt.png).\n\nIf you're interested, hit me up in chat or a PM with an answer to this question: What was your favorite Christmas gift? Have a character description, as well as kinks and limits. Hope to see you soon!",

            "selftext": "# PLEASE READ THE FULL POST BEFORE RESPONDING.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"*\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into my writing, and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nI know what I've wrote down below seems like an awful lot, but just bear with me here, lol.\n\nAnyways, here's what I've got laid out:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to a lot of different suggestions when it comes to stories or whatever. Don't be afraid to ask if something sparked your imagination.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more \"casual\" sort of things, but no weird stuff.\n   * I personally don't have any fetishes, except for titfucking. Other than that, I'm rather \"vanilla\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards other types of species, though. My favorites are does, bunnies, sharks, avians, dragonesses, mice, that sorta stuff. :P Like I said, not a deal-breaker though. It's just that an interspecies relationship can make it all the more interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I tend to add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow-burn romance. There's not enough of them these days. It's interesting actually building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. I *prefer* longer messages, but it doesn't have to be paragraphs, of course. Just, enough to make things interesting, and to show effort. I do a mixture of both short and long, so don't worry. Just keep in mind, this isn't a school essay, so make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there. But I *do* recommend you try to put a fair bit of effort in to keep things interesting and fun. All I can say is, the more detail, the better. But don't stress about it!\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. I'd prefer if people also roleplayed in thirdperson. :P\n   * *In summary, I love adding detail, and if you can add detail when you can, and write a lot, even though it's optional, it really improves the experience for the both of us. Who knows? It might even help you when you go to RP with others in the future! All I can say is just try your best, but don't overwhelm yourself. I apologize if my own writing might seem too long at times and it overwhelms you, so let me know if it does, and I'll try to tone it down some.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. I don't know entirely what the version was. Honestly, to me, it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex, Remy, and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely. Not a deal-breaker whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before. You can find more information in his character sheet. I made a screenshot of it, and you can find it [here](https://imgur.com/a/G0EKN3s).\n   * IMPORTANT: There's more information about him below the drawing of him, make sure to scroll down and read that too lol. Also, if you can't see the image in full, try opening the image in a new tab and zoom in so you can read it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Telegram/Discord User** \\- I used to use Discord a lot, and I got Telegram a while back. I'm starting to prefer Telegram over Discord though, so if you can use that, I'd appreciate it. Doesn't mean Discord is a no-go though. I just like Telegram's system better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on indefinitely, so everyone's welcome.\n\nAdd me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram.\n\nI hope to see you soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these, more specifically people like me, who enjoy the writing aspect and the build-up of the characters. Plus, here on FRP, my post gets IMMEDIATELY buried so people don't get a chance to see this.\n\nIf my info above doesn't work or if you need assistance with adding me, you can send me a Reddit message.\n\nThanks, and have a wonderful day, regardless of the pandemic. I have found some *really* good people. I've made a few friends (good gamers, too), and I've improved my writing skills. Thank you all for that. You're all wonderful people, and you have no idea how much a guy can appreciate the positivity.\n\n# One more thing. If you're the kind of person who likes to block or ghost people out of nowhere for no reason, then don't bother adding me. If you have a problem with me, or if we don't \"click\" in a roleplay, PLEASE talk to me. I cannot stress this enough. I'm tired of everyone blocking me within the first five minutes of even talking to me. But I'm an open individual and a good listener, and if you don't want to roleplay anymore that's fine, but please let me know beforehand because I'd rather not leave conflicts unresolved. I genuinely care about people, and I want to make sure everyone is happy. It's all I ask.\n\n# I'm also a little bit upset because it's hard for me to ever find anyone, and the ones I do find just disappear one day. Usually their accounts will just go permanently offline (and Telegram shows they were last seen on the day they disappeared). Most of the time they also end up deleting their Reddit, Discord, and Telegram accounts, whether it's all at once or whatever, and are never heard from again. No explanation, no informing beforehand, nothing. It's always the good people, the ones who are always so nice and caring, and are really great with RPing, that disappear. :(",

Furries and scalies can easily be aliens)\n\nI MUCH prefer plot development and teasing over pure sex. \n\nThe plot: \n\nWalking down the street one day, I spot somebody trying to cross the street at the wrong time. I try and call them back, but they don\u2019t listen. As a car is speeding down, panic takes over and I pull them out of the way.\n\nOnce we get up and I check if they are alright, they look me up and down, seeming to check me out. \u201c...I thank you. This will not go unrewarded.\u201d They say, as they begin walking away and seem to disappear from sight. \n\nA few days later, I\u2019m relaxing in the park, and I seem to notice some large breasted women I\u2019d never seen before. And by large, I mean massive. They all seem to be coming from the same direction, and they all seem to stare at me. Even flat-chested women who I\u2019ve seen before now have massive melons. I curiously follow the stream, the breasts getting bigger as I get closer to what looks like a futuristic, ship-like building.\n_________________________________________________\n\nIn short, I save alien royalty, and they would like to reward me. Maybe by altering the physical and mental states of earth women, or maybe that was just a lure into the true reward. Whatever the case may be, you know my kinks. I want to see your creativity for a generous royal with advanced science backing them up.\n\nMy kik is RevalisGale\n\nMy kinks: Muscular/toned girls, Tongues, Long Tongues, Multiple Tongues, Endless tongue, body licking, anything with oral, huge tits, titfucking, lactation, incest, piss, hypercum, all-the-way-through, cock worship, tit worship, expansion, cock vore, cosplay, futa, knife play, hypnosis, femdom, Yandere, Gyaru, weird penetrations\n\nI understand if there are some kinks you don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nLimits: Scat, pegging, being cucked \n\nI am a male, and I very much prefer to be a submissive top. That is, I like to be the one taking orders and being generally less aggressive, but I don\u2019t want things in my holes.\n\nAs always, I don\u2019t mind your species at all, but I am a human.\n\nAnd you can be a female, futa, anything like that, just stay as a bottom. You can even be multiple characters if you want.\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

Once thought to be little more than a lab focusing on developing new propulsion technologies, it has now achieved an almost legendary status as it\u2019s tail is told and retold by countless spacers in dimly lit bars.  While the details change with each retailing, some things stay the same and are considered to be the facts, or what passes for them when dealing with such myths.\n\nThe story goes that the lab\u2019s goals were not as simple as claimed, and instead of working on the latest phase drive they were instead preforming highly illegal experiments on captured alien creatures.  This is where the details usually begin to blur.  Some say that the labs were attacked by vengeful aliens, while others hint that whatever they had contained managed to break free of it\u2019s shackles.  Regardless of the exact circumstances, all who tell such stories all agree on two things; since the disaster no one  who has entered the lab has returned to tall about it, and that the data housed within the labs mainframe would be worth a fortune if recovered....\n\nHi,\nAs you might have guessed I am looking to play a sci-fi inspired role play that involves you, as female human, venturing into Station 32.  I hope to include a mix of both story and smut, as well as make this a longer term role play, but I am flexible in this area.\n\nI\u2019ve intentionally left both of our characters somewhat undefined so that we can build them together to suit our shared tastes and interests, but I will say that I hope to play as a xenomorph or something similar.  I am also willing to play a swapped version of this, with your playing a female alien and me playing a male human.\n\nMy kinks are pretty open, but I do enjoy teasing, titplay and creampies.  My limits include cheating, incest, bathroom stuff, gore and snuff.\n\nIf your interested, please send me a PM as chat does not work for me.",

Now I am trying to find all the subreddits I can cause this is so hot!!! \n\nWould love to chat with someone more and hopefully Rp. I\u2019m down for about a thousands roles. What I am really hoping to find is a fellow flirt who likes to play very curvy females and likes her males big and powerful. Other than that I am super open to all kinds of roles and kinks.   But the over sized body types is definitely something I find super SUPER hot. \n\nSo take a look at my kinks and let\u2019s have some fun! \n\nGuys who like to play females. Don\u2019t be shy, I\u2019d love to talk to you as well ;) \n\n\n\nProbably the thing I miss most about Roleplays is the excitement and the hotness of finding someone that shares similar kinks as you. When you find that right person it\u2019s down right exhilarating.  both of you in the edge of the seat waiting for the other to respond. The kind of turned on you haven\u2019t been for years. Obviously that\u2019s never easy to find in a sea as vast as the internet. Filled with thousands of others with their own ticks and kinks. But Damn the odds I\u2019m determined to find that thrill once again. \n\nTo find someone that enjoys flirting back and forth both in and out of Roleplay. One who wants to turn me on as much as I want to turn them on. I want to blow you out of the water. Someone who likes a good back and forth of setting up a hot role. Who likes to ask question to get to know my turn on better. That\u2019s what I love to do. \n\n\nHuge Tits\nPhat Ass \nMonster sized cocks \nSlightly unrealistic sizes \nDirty talk \nDirty nick/pet names \nHigh Heels! \nSlutty clothes (seriously love the details) \nHeavy make up \nCheating \nCock worship \nMuscle worship\nLoud sex\nMessy sex\nRough sex\nThe incredibly rare slow blow\nRisky sex (cheating wise, behind the back kind of deal) \nMilfs\nDilfs\nSIZE Queens \nBimbos (love the looks. It when they are airheads)\n\nSo many more I could possibly list them all. So ask me about them! \n\nOnly a few limits. \nToilet play \nNon con \nFutas\n\nBonus points if your subject line is something hot ;)",

            "selftext": "\"I am 18+ and all characters and participants must also be 18+\"\n\nHello There Everyone and welcome to my post. Judging by the fact that you are here reading this post you at least have some interest in the idea that was in the title so I won\u2019t waste too much of your time before we get into the starter. In this RP we will be playing as an Incestuous Family comprising of A father and his beautiful 23 year old daughter Sasha. Length Requirements and all that other stuff will be down below the starter which I will get into now.\u00a0\n\n________________________________________________\n\nSTARTER:\u00a0\n\nFrom the moment his daughter was born, she had John Frazier wrapped around her little finger. He and his wife Lana had been trying for almost 3 years exactly when she surprised him with a positive pregnancy test while he was at his office. And from the moment he held her in his arms, swaddled in the pink blanket he knew that from that moment on, that everything that he was and everything he had was hers\u2026.Forever.\n\nAnd that was the truth, from an early age John spoiled Sasha rotten, giving her anything she ever asked for and never telling her no. Lana wasn\u2019t a huge fan of it but she had been raised the same way so she really couldnt talk. In fact to this day, John still spoils Sasha rotten, having built her a huge walk in closet and vanity out of one of the guest rooms and her old bedroom.\u00a0\n\nSadly when Sasha was 7 years old, her mother Lana was killed in a car accident on the way home from picking up the last of the christmas presents from the store, having slid on some ice straight through a red light only to be T-Boned by a truck. Of course it took a few days for John to recover from losing the love of his life but he knew that for the sake of the billion dollar company that he runs and more importantly for the sake of his daughter, he couldn\u2019t wallow in self pity any longer.\u00a0\n\nA lot of credit for how he was able to pull through goes to Sasha herself, who matured quickly after her mother died, still having her bratty spoiled moments but she was John\u2019s little princess so what did you really expect. She stepped up in a big way with the chores around the house that her mother used to do, and anything she was physically unable to do, John did for her. In recent years she has even found time to start a pretty successful career as an Instagram model, who has just landed her first deal to start her own clothing line, and even runs her own OnlyFans which earns her close to $500,000 per month.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHowever chores isn\u2019t the only way Sasha has filled the void her mother left in her father\u2019s life. You see from almost the day she turned 18 (maybe a little bit before but we can talk about that) she had given her virginity to John and done so happily. Since then she has spent every single night in her fathers bed, which allowed him to expand her ever growing closet and vanity from just the guest room to her old bedroom next door to that as well.\u00a0\n\nThis morning is one like any other, John and Sasha naked in bed after a long night of love making. The morning of Sashas 23rd birthday in fact. John was the first to awake, smiling as he felt his daughter pressed against him, his arm wrapped tightly around her as she was nuzzled into his neck, shielding her from the light that leaked in through the blinds on the windows, slightly intensified by the fresh pure white snow that had fallen the night before. After staying still for a few moments John finally and carefully made his way out of bed, making sure not to wake Sasha as he slipped on his robe and made his way downstairs and into the kitchen where he would start on her favorite breakfast to surprise her with on her birthday.\u00a0\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\nAlright, now that the starter is out of the way, and i appreciate you reading it all now that you are down this far. The requirements won\u2019t be long and I will give you my Kik and F-List here shortly\n\n\nLength Requirement: While I will not require you to write a novel for each reply, I do expect you to at least try. I will write around 2-3 paragraphs per response and I would appreciate you attempting to match it, failing that one good size paragraph would suffice. One Liners will\u00a0\nbe ignored and or blocked\u00a0\n\nCharacter Requirements: Since I have already given you the girls\u2019 names and ages. All I will require from you for this is the reference picture and any added character traits that you would like to add.\u00a0\n\nFirst Message: In your first message, I would prefer it to be on Kik but i will accept a reddit chat, please come with your character references, the added character traits if that is something you are doing, and any questions you have for me about the RP. If you just come with \u201cHey\u201d or \u201cSaw you on Reddit\u201d You will be ignored.\u00a0\nI want to Thank you so much for reading my post. I know it was a lot but i wanted to get as much information out there before you message me as i can. Below will be my Kik username and my F-List.\n\n\nKik: JJ_Frazier\n\nTelegram: JJ_Frazier\n\nF-List: https://www.f-list.net/c/jj_frazier",

I want you to fuck me until I cry and degrade me until I\u2019m nothing!

As my teacher you decide to show me just where that gets me in life!\n\n-Bully: I\u2019ve never done anything wrong to you, although you certainly like to do plenty wrong to me!\n\n-Stranger: I\u2019ve never met you before, but all you care about is finding an easy target to take your stress out on!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMy character!:\n\nDani Cider is an 18 year old femboy or female from Canada, and they can either be an anthro or human!

            "selftext": "**The post is still open, please read the whole post first**\n\nHey DPP!\n\nToday I'd like to play out a roleplay scenario where I've gone on a vacation to either a sunny vacation resort, or a ski resort. The twist to this story is that I accidently booked my flight to a resort which has only anthro animals staying at it!\n\nIn this world, I see it like humans and anthros living in their own countries, making them a bit exotic to each other, and anthros living in modern societies just like humans do.\n\nIn this resort, I'd of course stand out a lot in the crowd, since anthros are all big and strong, and me being a normal human. My character having a weaknes for big strong beasts of course influense a bit of what is going to happen here! Maybe I even have a boyfriend at home, making me want to resist, but it's impossible after a while?\n\nOne aspect I like would be if the anthros know just how much humans in general like the anthro bodies, with their height, muscles and very large cocks as well, knowing they can get any human without much trouble at all, maybe even taking pride in fucking as many humans as possible, boosting their egos a bit, especially if that human already have a boyfriend\n\nI like this to be a fun and light hearted roleplay scenario, leaving out the rough and violent stuff. My character would be 20-25 years old.\n\n* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, clothed sex, casual sex, size contrast, muscle and cock worship, group sex, cheating, confident guys(but not acting like total douchbags)\n* **Limits:** Toilet stuff, impregnation, violence, abuse, male anal, guy on guy, people controlling my character, underage\n\nThere, hope you like the idea for this scenario! If you like to roleplay, please make sure you've read the post thoroughly so we're on the same page about the roleplay, and then also please answer the following questions in your initial response:\n\n* What are your thoughts on the theme and idea?\n* What are your kinks? (that don't conflict with my limits or the light hearted theme)\n* What are your limits?\n* If you're ok with playing this out now?\n* If you're ok with me playing as a more everyday looking girl, instead of a pornstar or model etc.\n\nThat should be a bout it! **Please send the response as a PM, and not in the chat** as the chat works horribly in the browser here. I'm also looking to play this out in a somewhat rapid response way. I still like details, but I don't want to wait all day for a response. I don't expect walls of text, but please don't go with one liner responses during the roleplay.\n\n*Love, Emelie*",

Naturally, you don't have to comply to any of these kinks should you so wish! \n\nFeel free to message with any ideas for roles or scenes, because I love to make them up with my partner as it\u2019s much more interesting! If you really do not like discord, then you can message me asking for my kik - but I definitely prefer it less. \n\nI do appreciate detail in my roleplay, which means that you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if you get ignored if you give me a one line answer, but provided that\u2019s all good then we should be able to have some good fun!

So now for the plot:\n\nIt was 1879, Christmas and my new slave had just arrived at my door step, it was going to be snowing all year round so I would normally keep the house warm for myself with a fire or aircon. I took you in side and opened the box finding you being asleep because of a gas tube they put on you, I took you out and laid you next to the fire on a dog bed and removed the gas from you, you woke up confused as you where taken from your farm without warning. I told you who I was and why you where her, you where confused at first but after leaning what I would do to you, you did your best to follow every order as the days went on.\n\nThat\u2019s just the start, I will think of more to go on for each day and hope to make it go as long as possible, I would also like if you had good reply\u2019s, being at least 2-4 sentences per reply, but more is better, detail is a big one, no detail, no rp, that simple. Well that\u2019s all please msg me on discord, Kik, reddit or telegram if you want to rp or just know more info.\n\ndiscord filthy_racoon#8095\nKik filthy_raccoon\nTelegram Jazzisdeer\n\n And as for my ref I have a couple so I will just get your preferred one and use it, unless you have one of your own that\u2019s cool too.

Regardless of the exact circumstances, all who tell such stories all agree on two things; since the disaster no one  who has entered the lab has returned to tall about it, and that the data housed within the labs mainframe would be worth a fortune if recovered....\n\nHi,\nAs you might have guessed I am looking to play a sci-fi inspired role play that involves you, as female human, venturing into Station 32.  I hope to include a mix of both story and smut, as well as make this a longer term role play, but I am flexible in this area.\n\nI\u2019ve intentionally left both of our characters somewhat undefined so that we can build them together to suit our shared tastes and interests, but I will say that I hope to play as a xenomorph or something similar.  I am also willing to play a swapped version of this, with your playing a female alien and me playing a male human.\n\nMy kinks are pretty open, but I do enjoy teasing, titplay and creampies.  My limits include cheating, incest, bathroom stuff, gore and snuff.\n\nIf your interested, please send me a PM (not Reddit chat) telling me about your kinks and limits as well as any ideas you have for your character.",

            "selftext": "***Both myself and all characters are 18+***\n\nWhat should have been a simple trip through the forested mountains has turned into a lifetime detour. Our car/bikes are useless and now, the hunger and thirst are kicking in.\n\nThe first sign that something was off *should* have been the malfunctioning navigation on our phones. The second sign was that we had gone in circles for over an hour. We noticed neither of these things.\n\nNow, we're at a humble stream. Drinking its fresh water. Man is it ***good***. Refreshing even. Possibly the best water you've drank your entire life! And that's the third sign.\n\n# Key Concept\n\n1. We're trapped in a bermuda-trianglesque location that ensnares travelers for a lifetime.\n2. By drinking and eating the bountiful harvests of this land, we truly become one with nature. Which leads to the following:\n   1. Our bodies start to turn into anthropomorphic creatures of the woods.\n   2. Whether we desired each other or not, we quickly develop needs, needs that our partner fulfills perfectly, and cement an eternal relationship with one another.\n      1. As we witness the startling changes coming over us; our new animalistic urges will ultimately override any reservations we had. Shame of our nudity. Shame of our lust. All gone.\n      2. Sexual Organs will become more exaggerated as we become reduced to our more baser elements. (Breast Expansion, Ass Expansion, Cock Growth, &amp; possible weight gain.)\n\n**Who are we?**\n\n* Are you into incest? Then maybe we're relatives? (Daddy/Daughter, Brother/Sister, etc.)\n* Are we just best friends who have never seen each other in that way before?\n* Maybe one of us was a hitch hiker that the other had casually picked up?\n* We could be an elderly couple that goes through drastic age regression as a result of the land's curse.\n* You decide!\n\n**What do we become?**\n\n* Does this invigorating stream give us the qualities of Bear-morphs? (Weight Gain, Feeding)\n* Who can forget the classic Wolf transformation? (Breeding, Rough Sex)\n* Maybe we develop avian traits? (Air Sex, Egg Birthing)\n* The spirit of land sees fit to turn us into Sylvans?! A race of tree-elves that protect the forest and stop others from disturbing our endless affair. (Shibari with vines!)\n* Any others you can think of!\n\n**Final Notes**\n\n* This is intended to be a **reasonably short rp.** Please - if you message me about any of my prompts, I expect that you actually try and put effort into your responses and ideas. That being said; please feel free to check out any of my other original prompts if you're interested in something else.\n* I'd like to iron out your character before jumping in.  :) You can likely infer some of the kinks above, but you're **free to suggest your own** if you have any other desires to include. My favorite kink is Breeding, and would love to see it incorporated if possible.\n* This is a very smutty roleplay (as are most of my prompts).\n* I can do either **first or third person** stories and easily do a **1-2 paragraphs** of detailed back-and-forth.\n\nLimits: Blood, Bathroom stuff, Snuff, Free-Use",

            "selftext": "So ive started to see a lot of bottoms looking for a top who isnt into femboys, well you found him! I got some rp ideas down below, hope at least one of them is to your liking\n\n- you\u2019re a regular college roommate/roommate in general, nothing too special. Sure you had a guy living with you that was absolutely perverted and what not, doing everything in his power to see you naked, or groping you at random times, normally you would\u2019ve beat this guy to a pulp but he did always get away with his actions due to his charms, but hey, rather have a fun roommate than a boring one right? One day it was extremely hot, and the air conditioning wasnt working properly, only leaving you with one option: strip. You were in your room so you figured you wouldnt need to deal with your roommate, but all that would soon change. While working on an important paper, your laptop had shut down. Looking all over for the charger now, you eventually found it under your bed. Getting it was an easy task, but you sadly got stuck, and wouldn\u2019t be able to get out with help. Your initial idea was to call your roommate for help, but then you remembered the position you were in, not to mention you were completely naked, that pervert would surely do something. But then again, your paper was due and it wasn\u2019t gonna do itself. What would you do?\n\n- \u201cIm straight\u201d you repeated that phrase over and over again one night during one of the biggest parties as another male pushed you against the wall and made out with you. The male then started breaking you back to your house, it was strange sense he seemed like a stranger, yet he knew where you lived. Getting pushed into the familiar position again you let him have his way with you. The memories from that night were a blurr, but you remembered the intense sensations you felt that night, it was without a doubt the best sex you ever had. It all started with a few drinks, but it soon became many, then a lot, and finally too much. You recall coming to the party with your roommate but you were certain he had already gone home. The scenes from last night unfolded and you were now awake. You then noticed your hole was..wet, soaked even. You then saw your roommate walk in, cock drenched in his creamy cum. You soon recalled all the events that happened last night, especially the sex part. Wanting to feel that same pleasure again, you laid there, spreading your roommate an invitation and urging him to come. \u201cDont you fucking tell anyone about this..now, round two?\u201d\n\n- your mom has hired a babysitter, nothing out of the ordinary. Usually she only tells the babysitter to clean and do other house chores since you were old enough to look after yourself. It was no different now, but the babysitter this time was younger and most definitely more attractive. He had to do some work outside, plus some other minor things. As he was working you noticed he had taken off his shirt, revealing his perfect chest and hard abs, you just couldn\u2019t stop staring. The fact that your parents would be gone for quite a while and left you alone with this hunk gave you some very lewd ideas. But now you have to figure out how would you even get him in the bed with you\n\n\n- You had invited your friend to come pound you again, nothing out of the ordinary. He cock was amazing, nice girth, perfect length, smooth shaft, it felt great to feel him drill into your insides and hit all the right spots. But one thing that was even more impressive was his stamina and the fact he had no refractory period. You could ask him to fuck you all night and he could without a problem \u201cAgain, bro?\u201d He would ask every time you pulled him back bed, but he definitely didn\u2019t mind\n\n-  You and david had been best friends for as long as you could remember, you knew him like the back of your hand. He was a fun guy to be with, just being around him could put a smile on your face. But he did do one thing out of the ordinary, david almost never wore underwear. It wasn\u2019t a big deal to you, but his cock could be distracting at some times. For one thing his cock was huge it definitely got in the way with focusing on your job or working out. One day while david was at your house he had dozed off again, still not wearing any underwear. You just couldn\u2019t resist now, having that huge cock to yourself while he was sleeping \n\n- a love/hate relationship between two college dorm mates that eventually ended up fighting, which also lead to sex. The info: it all started at the beginning at college, leo (you) tried something a friend told you and now you constantly do it, stripping down to basically nothing. It was always kind of hot in the dorm so there was always an excuse, but ryan (me) would constantly be annoyed with it, especially whenever leo scared away his one night stands. Finally getting fed up with it ryan confronted leo, which Inevitably led to things getting heated. A small brawling broke out, the end result being leo pinned down on the ground with his hips up. It didnt take long for ryan to noticed the position he was in, and he was gonna take advantage of it\n\n\n\n- a new, very buff guy has joined the team, your team to be specific. He (zane) was definitely big, charming, and quite possibly one of the best wrestlers on your team. Because of this, you always bore  jealousy towards the man. You two were kinda in a love hate relationship, you didnt like him, he didnt like you, but despite that you both did pretty well on the team, either alone or together. However, as he started to win more and more, the team\u2019s attention started shifting towards him now. You would always tease him about his size, calling him \u201cmonster\u201d but he didnt mind you much, but everyone has a breaking point dont they? It then came down to just you and him, moving cautiously across the ring floor. The bet was that the loser had to do what ever the winner said. You were thinking making him quit while he he probably thinking of getting you to stop calling him his nickname, but he had something else in mind. The match soon ended, zane clearly being the victor. He simply told you to go in the locker room, but zane had a lot more planned for you. He was gonna show you he was definitely big, in more ways than one\n\nHope at least one of these got your attention. \nJust so we\u2019re clear im a top, who\u2019s looking for bottoms to play out one of these ideas with me. Reference wise ill be anyone you want, just as long as its a masculine looking guy (note i only do drawn reference pictures). Want me to be slightly bigger than you? Sure! Maybe smaller than you? Of course! Or maybe you\u2019d prefer if we\u2019d be the same size? Alright by me! Im open to a lot of kinks, even a few taboo ones so dont be afraid to ask.\n\nIm not all that too picky when it comes to rp, however i only ask for two things\n\n- Im pretty much only attracted to muscular characters, meaning im not into twinks/twunks, of femboys. I like masculine-looking men\n- Overly submissive, shy or timid personalities are not really my thing. As i might have said before its cute at first but i tend to lose interest quickly, it just doesn\u2019t excite me. Other than that any personality is just fine by me!",

            "selftext": "\"I am 18+ and all characters and participants must also be 18+\"\n\nHey there everyone, since you're reading this you must be at least somewhat interested in my idea so I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet so that you can get right into reading the starter and my requirements will be below the start along with my usernames and my F-List. This will be a Story-Driven, Long-term, detailed and literate Free Use Family RP, in which I Will require at least one good sized paragraph per response. I will go into more detail about that requirement later on after you have finished reading the starter, which I will get into right now.\u00a0\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nStarter:\n\nJordan sighs softly as he makes his way out of his office and down to the parking garage where his private limo has been waiting for close to an hour to finally bring him back home for the day. Once inside he loosens his tie a bit and pours himself a glass of whiskey from the crystal, monogrammed decanter sitting on one of the small shelves in the back of the limo before pulling out his phone and smiling as he sees a few texts from his wife and daughter.\u00a0\n\nJordan was the Majority Owner, President and CEO of a large multi billion dollar corporation that had its hand in everything from Car manufacturing to high end restaurants and construction. Having grown up poor Jordan still knows the value of work and makes absolutely sure that his children, especially his son Marcus (23); his daughter (19) taking much more after her mother, learn the value of hard work as well.\u00a0\n\nYou see Jordan had, as he and honestly man in his situation would call it, the perfect family. His wife has been with him since the met when he was 19 and she was 16, few years younger than him but with the body and looks of a 22 year old, she was and still is an extremely popular fashion model, having done photoshoots for everyone from Maxim and Vogue to Playboy, and due to the fact that her husband was a billionaire and his company owned one of the largest and most expensive luxury clothing brands in the world, has her own clothing line.\u00a0 His daughter, as said before has taken right after her mother, having started as an instagram model from almost the exact day she turned 18, in only a year she's gotten over a million followers and has started to pose for real magazines, having been in a swimsuit calendar with her mother even being on the cover.\u00a0\n\nIn the public eye, the 4 are just a normal family, a handsome husband, his beautiful wife and daughter and his oldest son. However behind the closed double doors of their 3 story countryside mansion they are far from normal. You see it\u2019s not uncommon for Jordan to take his daughter into his bed or for Marcus to take his mother into bed or even for Marcus to take his sister to bed.\u00a0\n\nAs he grew closer to his home, he sent a quick text to his wife \u201cI will be home soon my love\u201d he sent and finished off his drink, straightening his tie back out and smiling as the limo pulled up to the front of his house as he saw his wife at the door waiting for him, knowing Marcus must be inside somewhere with his sister.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nNow that the Starter is finally out of the way and hopefully you\u2019ve read through the whole thing. I can get into my requirements for this role, and lucky for you there are only 3 pretty simple rules.\u00a0\n\nLength Requirements: As I said before, my main requirement as far as your reply length goes is that you provide at least a good length one paragraph response. I will do at least one but my typical reply length is from 2-3 paragraphs. And For fucks sake do not. And i mean DO NOT give one line responses, i have put quite a bit of work into this character and plot so giving me one line when i give at least a paragraph will just piss me off and our time talking will end instantly.\u00a0\n\nYour Character: This one is pretty easy. You will be providing your characters reference and name.\u00a0\n\nYour First Message: This last one is pretty easy as well, when you message me on Kik, Telegram or Discord, please come with your character info, reference and your kinks and limits. After that we can get into discussing the role and any questions you may have.\u00a0\n\nAlright. Now that all of that is out of the way, I will provide my Kik, Telegram and Discord Usernames and my F-List, I'm excited to talk to those of you who respond to this post.\n\nKik: The_Last_Kennedy\n\nTelegram: The_Last_Kennedy\n\nF-List: https://www.f-list.net/c/jordankennedy/",

            "selftext": "*\"Hi, my name's Jack Foxtrot! I'm an orange fox who's a writer, musician, and car enthusiast.\"*\n\nIce broken? Great.\n\nI'm looking for any RPers out there who would like to do an RP.\n\nIn real life, I am a writer, musician, and car enthusiast, just like my fursona.\n\nWhen it comes to my RPs, I put a lot of detail into my writing, and I'm fairly good at it. I used to write novels in Google Docs a lot, so that's probably where all my creativity stems from.\n\nI know what I've wrote down below seems like an awful lot, but just bear with me here, lol.\n\nAnyways, here's what I've got laid out:\n\n* **Open To Ideas** \\- I am open to a lot of different suggestions when it comes to stories or whatever. Don't be afraid to ask if something sparked your imagination.\n   * I don't really look for people with powers, transformations, whatever, it's just not really my kinda thing, I just look more towards the average everyday anthro.\n   * Fetishes... err... not really sure about that one. You could ask me if you're unsure. Just saying though it might be a \"No\". Usually okay with the more \"casual\" sort of things, but no weird stuff.\n   * I personally don't have any fetishes, except for titfucking. Other than that, I'm rather \"vanilla\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RPers** \\- Looking for any furry female RPers.\n   * Honestly, there's not enough of them on here.\n   * In terms of characters I'm pretty much open to whatever. I *do* sorta lean towards other types of species, though. My favorites are does, bunnies, sharks, avians, dragonesses, mice, that sorta stuff. :P Like I said, not a deal-breaker though. It's just that an interspecies relationship can make it all the more interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Type Of RP** \\- I like to do long-term, story driven ERPs (Erotic Roleplay). And like I said, I can get really good at them. I tend to add lots of detail.\n   * I also prefer it as a slow-burn romance. There's not enough of them these days. It's interesting actually building up a relationship with another character rather than just going straight-to-the-point. I usually go to the more realistic side of things, which means no medieval or something, rather just modern-day times, like a \"slice-of-life\" in a way.\n   * Another thing to point out is length. I *prefer* longer messages, but it doesn't have to be paragraphs, of course. Just, enough to make things interesting, and to show effort. I do a mixture of both short and long, so don't worry. Just keep in mind, this isn't a school essay, so make things however long you need them to be, there's no pressure there. But I *do* recommend you try to put a fair bit of effort in to keep things interesting and fun. All I can say is, the more detail, the better. But don't stress about it!\n   * I roleplay in thirdperson. It helps me add detail, and the omniscience helps too. Plus, it's become habit from writing a lot of Google Docs novels. I'd prefer if people also roleplayed in thirdperson. :P\n   * *In summary, I love adding detail, and if you can add detail when you can, and write a lot, even though it's optional, it really improves the experience for the both of us. Who knows? It might even help you when you go to RP with others in the future! All I can say is just try your best, but don't overwhelm yourself. I apologize if my own writing might seem too long at times and it overwhelms you, so let me know if it does, and I'll try to tone it down some.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Big Amorous Fan (This Is 100% Optional)** \\- I enjoy playing the game \"Amorous\" (though to be fair the latest version I've played was 0.7/8 which added Lex in the game. I don't know entirely what the version was. Honestly, to me, it's the best version of the game, especially Skye's date path). So I'm pretty hyped about that, too. If you like RPing as Skye, or maybe Lex, Remy, and even Mercy, then that's great (Skye's the best though). But if not, that's fine, too.\n   * Like I said, this is optional entirely. Not a deal-breaker whatsoever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Character** \\- Jack Foxtrot is an orange fox with brown hair and blue eyes. He's 22 and 5'11\". He's never been in a relationship before. You can find more information in his character sheet. I made a screenshot of it, and you can find it [here](https://imgur.com/a/G0EKN3s).\n   * IMPORTANT: There's more information about him below the drawing of him, make sure to scroll down and read that too lol. Also, if you can't see the image in full, try opening the image in a new tab and zoom in so you can read it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Telegram/Discord User** \\- I used to use Discord a lot, and I got Telegram a while back. I'm starting to prefer Telegram over Discord though, so if you can use that, I'd appreciate it. Doesn't mean Discord is a no-go though. I just like Telegram's system better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now, that's all there is to it. Let me know what you think. This request will go on indefinitely, so everyone's welcome.\n\nAdd me at **\ud83e\udd8a Jack Foxtrot \ud83e\udd8a#0589** on Discord or add me at **mrwallace888** on Telegram.\n\nI hope to see you soon! Wish there was more people on here to interact with, kind of a shame it's hard for males to find female RPers in places like these, more specifically people like me, who enjoy the writing aspect and the build-up of the characters. Plus, here on FRP, my post gets IMMEDIATELY buried so people don't get a chance to see this.\n\nIf my info above doesn't work or if you need assistance with adding me, you can send me a Reddit message.\n\nThanks, and have a wonderful day, regardless of the pandemic. I have found some *really* good people. I've made a few friends (good gamers, too), and I've improved my writing skills. Thank you all for that. You're all wonderful people, and you have no idea how much a guy can appreciate the positivity.\n\n# One more thing. If you're the kind of person who likes to block or ghost people out of nowhere for no reason, then don't bother adding me. If you have a problem with me, or if we don't \"click\" in a roleplay, PLEASE talk to me. I cannot stress this enough. I'm tired of everyone blocking me within the first five minutes of even talking to me. But I'm an open individual and a good listener, and if you don't want to roleplay anymore that's fine, but please let me know beforehand because I'd rather not leave conflicts unresolved. I genuinely care about people, and I want to make sure everyone is happy. It's all I ask.\n\n# I'm also a little bit upset because it's hard for me to ever find anyone, and the ones I do find just disappear one day. Usually their accounts will just go permanently offline (and Telegram shows they were last seen on the day they disappeared). Most of the time they also end up deleting their Reddit, Discord, and Telegram accounts, whether it's all at once or whatever, and are never heard from again. No explanation, no informing beforehand, nothing. It's always the good people, the ones who are always so nice and caring, and are really great with RPing, that disappear. :(",

            "selftext": "**Post is still open! Please read the whole post before responding**\n\nHey there! \n\nToday I'd like to play a anthro on human type of roleplay, with a little bit different focus than most other of my anthro roleplay scenarios. Rather than the anthro being big and intimidating, I like him to be a bit smaller, innocent looking, but hiding a longer cock. \n\nThe basic idea for this roleplay is that he's not seen as a threat to any human men, but in secret, he gets to have a lot of sex with the women at work, in the neighborhood etc. I want to make clear that this is not a cuckold scenario though, as no one finds out about him fucking peoples wives, women at work etc.\n\nSo, this roleplay can take place at different locations, like at work, at home, or maybe even some vacation resort! I'd prefer him to play as something like a zebra, a bit shorter than most humans, a bit thin, 20 years old. He'd not be cocky or obnoxious, not always the best confidence, except he knows how popular he is with the ladies, and has a lot of experience already. I also like if he's one of rather few anthros around this country, just to make him a bit more exciting and exotic for the ladies!\n\nAs for the women, I do prefer them to be older, 30+ for the most part. We could do different scenes as well if we have the time for that\n\nOverall, I like this to be a fun and light hearted roleplay scenario, leaving out rough or dark themes overall. I'm also not interested in love and kissing etc, as I do like it a bit more focused on sex for fun!\n\n* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, clothed sex, casual sex, anthro on human\n* **Limits:** Toilet stuff, impregnation, violence, abuse, male anal, cuckold, rough stuff, underage, dominance\n\nSo, that's abou it! If you're interested in playing this out with me, please make sure you read the whole post so we're both on the same idea about the roleplay, and then **send your response as a PM, and don't use the chat**. Also, to make it easier for me to see what you're into, please answer the following questions in your initial response:\n\n* Your thought on the idea\n* Your kinks(that don't conflict with my limits or the light hearted theme)\n* Your limits\n* If you're ok with a more rapid response roleplay, rather than long term roleplay with long in between the responses\n* If you'd be open for reversing the roles, with me as the male anthro and you as the human women\n\nHope to hear from you soon! And again, please make sure you've read the post, and please don't send any one liner responses. \n\n*Love, Emelie*",

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThanks for stopping by.\u00a0 As the title suggests I'm looking for a bit alpha dom to come and claim me as his pet.\u00a0 I am a very literate role player with over 10 years experience. I can be slow, I prefer to take time developing the posts I send and my IRL is fairly hectic.\u00a0 I usually post a few times per day, sometimes more, I will let you know if it's going to be extended, but if you proceed to reach out (still hope you do,) know that going into it. I also post in first person and usually do a multiple paragraphs per post.\n\nI have many kinks, specifically I'd like to include Size Difference (1-5 feet), Bondage, Musk, Humiliation and After Care (cause who doesn't like a caring brute!) As for limits, I have very few.\u00a0 Females, Scat, Vore and gore are top of the list.\u00a0 I will let you know if I'm not into something, just ask!\n\nThat being said, and without further adieu, my plot ideas.\u00a0 These are super flexable and can be worked or molded to fit your preferences.\u00a0 I'm also always open to suggestions, so if the below aren't to your liking, feel free to suggest some, chances are I'll be up for playing them!\u00a0 \n\n1. I am your average fur, living a mundane life oblivious to the seedy world just under the surface. That was until I saw something I truly shouldn't have and thrust into the insane and ancient world of legend. This world run by the monsters and magic, I couldnt just go about my life anymore. Normally a mortal in my position would be killed, but you, an imposing creature m, takes a liking to me and decide to take me on as a pet.\n\n2. I fell on some hard times. I was in desperate need to find a roommate, and unfortunately inwasnt getting much interest.  You are one of the few that replied to my add, meeting me you know you are gonna make me your beta. This would be more of a slow slice of life story, corrupting me and subtly changing em to a sub beta for you to control.\n\n3. I live in a small little village in the outskirts of the kingdom.\u00a0 We are a proud people, more like a tribe then a city.\u00a0 I am one of the elder's sons, the runt of the litter.\u00a0 I had something to prove.\u00a0 When your forces invade, pillaging and burning our tribe's homes, I stand against you.\u00a0 My brothers and neighbors all submitted, but I would take a little doing, that's your job.\u00a0For this prompt, if you want to go rougher and  more non con, you can play as a member of the invading forces that pillaged and destroys the town. My character would be the spoils of the raid.\n\nSome of these plots can be more of a slice of life style, can be set in the future, present or a fantasy.\u00a0 Send me a message on Kik at JumpinJax95, or ask for my Telegram or Discord!",

I&amp;#39;m looking to play out the beginning of the fall, starting with the first colonist awakened from hyper sleep, and progress from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kinks for this include bad ends, non con, beast, transformation, impregnation (male and female), oviposition, gore, and other dark stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no limits and prefer you don&amp;#39;t either. Looking for like minded pen pals. Message me for my discord.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

            "selftext": "\"I am 18+ and all characters and participants must also be 18+\" \n\nHey there everyone, since you're reading this you must be at least somewhat interested in my idea so I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet so that you can get right into reading the starter and my requirements will be below the start along with my usernames and my F-List. This will be a Story-Driven, Long-term, detailed and literate Father, Son and Daughters (where I will play the father and son and you will play the girls), which I Will require at least one good sized paragraph per response. I will go into more detail about that requirement later on after you have finished reading the starter, which I will get into right now.\u00a0\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nStarter:\nWhen his daughters were born Jordan couldn\u2019t have been happier, first were the twins, the girl being a beautiful blonde with deep blue eyes just like her mother, the boy, Marcus, was a spitting image of Jordan when he was born, with deep chestnut brown hair and eyes. His daughter was his princess and from the moment he held her in his arms she had Jordan wrapped around her finger, he spoiled the twins rotten for the first 4 years of their life, that was when their younger sister was born, deep chestnut brown hair and matching eyes, just like her father and older brother, his children were his everything, and with his wife by his side as well he had the perfect life. That is until tragedy struck.\u00a0\n\nOnly a few days after the twins turned 8, his youngest daughter being 4, his wife was in a terrible car accident heading back home from Jordans office, where he was the President and CEO of a billion dollar corporation, wrapping her Mercedes around a telephone pole killing her instantly. Of course Jordan was heartbroken, but his children needed him so rather than fall apart he stepped up, the twins helping him more and more as they got older, his oldest daughter maturing a lot more quickly than her younger sister who was now still in her rich spoiled brat phase, able to bat her lashes at her daddy or her older brother and get whatever she wanted.\u00a0\n\nIn public they were a normal family, but in private they were almost the opposite of normal. You see it was fairly common in the Kennedy household that the men were balls deep in the women, the twins both 25 and their younger sister having just turned 21, living outside of town, a 3 story mansion on 20 acres of land, allowed them to pretty much do whatever they wanted, wherever they wanted, without the fear of being seen by neighbors.\u00a0\n\nThis morning is one just like any other, a beautiful Saturday morning the day after Jordan\u2019s youngest daughters 21st birthday, Jordan woke up first, the light from the morning sun drifting into his eyes from the space between the blinds, his youngest daughter under his arm, naked and pressed against his own naked body, the only thing covering them being the thin silk top sheet, in just the next room the twins were stirring awake in their bed.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNow that the Starter is finally out of the way and hopefully you\u2019ve read through the whole thing. I can get into my requirements for this role, and lucky for you there are only 3 pretty simple rules.\u00a0\n\nLength Requirements: As I said before, my main requirement as far as your reply length goes is that you provide at least a good length one paragraph response. I will do at least one but my typical reply length is from 2-3 paragraphs. And For fucks sake do not. And i mean DO NOT give one line responses, i have put quite a bit of work into this character and plot so giving me one line when i give at least a paragraph will just piss me off and our time talking will end instantly.\u00a0\n\nYour Character: This one is pretty easy. You will be providing your characters reference and name.\u00a0\n\nYour First Message: This last one is pretty easy as well, when you message me on Kik, Telegram or Discord, please come with your character info, reference and your kinks and limits. After that we can get into discussing the role and any questions you may have.\u00a0\n\nAlright. Now that all of that is out of the way, I will provide my Kik, Telegram and Discord Usernames and my F-List, I'm excited to talk to those of you who respond to this post.\n\nKik: The_Last_Kennedy\n\nTelegram: The_Last_Kennedy\n\nF-List: https://www.f-list.net/c/jordankennedy/",

Requirements:\nLong reply\u2019s. this just means no one liners in the rp, I would like it to be 3-4 sentences as much as you can basically\n2. Limits. You can have some limits but the ones that I would like to use are all here below, just msg me if you don\u2019t like maybe 2 of them\nBdsm, forced, slave, torture, bathroom, blood play, breath play, cock ball torture, extreme anal (using things that should not be put in a anus), abuse, wiping, cuckolding (option), embarrassment, diaper, drowning play, heavy forced drinking. I might think of more but that\u2019s what I got for now.\n\nThe plot: It was Christmas and you had just woken up at the age of 17, the year was 1929 and slaves where legal in this world, You unwrap your gifts to find the key to a house, a minivan and a oddly large cage shaped present. You open it to find your brand new slave (me) inside, you just use me to move you into your new house, clean and do normal maid things at first, but then you get new ideas of all the kinks I listed, and use them on me when you are unhappy with anything, I mess up or you are just bored. I never get used to it and the torture gets worse by the day, this goes on for a while till you sell me off and that\u2019s where it ends.\n\nNow to make it long term, try to make it at least like 2 real days before you start to realise how bad I am, and just try to stretch it out as much as you can please, the longer the better.\n\nWhen you DM me please have your first msg being your kinks, limits(if any) and ref, and say you are from the slave post please, well I hope to you soon here is where you can find me\n\ndiscord filthy_racoon#8095\nKik filthy_raccoon\nTelegram Jazzisdeer\n\nAfter you send your stuff you can pick one of my femboy refs or you can get me to play as any of yours.",

            "selftext": "\"I am 18+ and all characters and participants must also be 18+\" \n\nHello There Everyone and welcome to my post. Judging by the fact that you are here reading this post you at least have some interest in the idea that was in the title so I won\u2019t waste too much of your time before we get into the starter. In this RP we will be playing as an Incestuous Family comprising of A father and his beautiful 25 year old trophy wife and his twin 19 year old children. Length Requirements and all that other stuff will be down below the starter which I will get into now.\u00a0\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nSTARTER:\u00a0\n\nJohn took a moment to grab his laptop and place his work phone in his desk drawer, taking his personal phone out at the same time and sliding it into his pocket. After politely telling his secretary to have a goodnight he made his way down to the parking garage where his brand new red Ferrari was parked, got in and pulled out his phone again sending a text to his wife that he would be home soon.\u00a0\n\nJohn was one of the most successful businessmen in the country, the Owner, President and CEO of a billion dollar corporation, which had a hand in everything from shipping to construction, John's own net worth being somewhere around 40 Billion last time his daughter had looked it up. His immense wealth has allowed him to spoil his 19 year old daughter Sasha and his 25 year old trophy wife Lana rotten.\n\nJohn was married once before his current wife, to a beautiful woman he had met in college and instantly fell in love with. They were married as soon as they graduated and a year later they had their twins a boy (Jaxon, just goes by Jax) and a girl (Sasha). However when the twins were 5 their mother died in a car crash. John didn\u2019t date for a long time after that, spending more time at work and with the twins. However 2 years ago he met Lana, a beautiful nude and lingerie model from down south whose father was a rich oil and real estate tycoon, Instantly falling for the beautiful young woman when they met when he was down south for a few meetings he moved her back home with him and his children instantly took to her, Sasha starting her own modeling career with Lana\u2019s help.\u00a0\n\nWhile John\u2019s family may seem like a normal, loving family in public, in private they were far from normal. Starting around the time that Lana came into the family and continuing to this day, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for John to be balls deep in Sasha, Jax to be balls deep in Lana or for Jax to be balls deep in Sasha. While it was a bit weird for Lana at first she quickly took to it and now it is just a normal day.\u00a0\n\nAfter close to a 30 minute drive to the familys large 3 story, gated mansion out in the country, John\u2019s car pulled up in front of the house and he got out, smiling wide as he saw his wife already waiting to greet him when he arrived.\u00a0\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nAlright, now that the starter is out of the way, and i appreciate you reading it all now that you are down this far. The requirements won\u2019t be long and I will give you my Kik and F-List here shortly\n\n\nLength Requirement: While I will not require you to write a novel for each reply, i do expect you to at least try. I will to write around 2-3 paragraphs per response and I would appreciate you attempting to match it, failing that one good size paragraph would suffice. One Liners will\u00a0\nbe ignored and or blocked\u00a0\n\nCharacter Requirements: Since I have already given you the girls\u2019 names and ages. All I will require from you for this is the reference picture and any added character traits that you would like to add.\u00a0\n\nFirst Message: In your first message, I would prefer it to be on Kik but i will accept a reddit chat, please come with your character references, the added character traits if that is something you are doing, and any questions you have for me about the RP. If you just come with \u201cHey\u201d or \u201cSaw you on Reddit\u201d You will be ignored.\u00a0\nI want to Thank you so much for reading my post. I know it was a lot but i wanted to get as much information out there before you message me as i can. Below will be my Kik username and my F-List.\n\n\nKik: JJ_Frazier\n\nF-List: https://www.f-list.net/c/jj_frazier",

            "selftext": "\n\n\nThe Madison family were like any other. A husband, wife and two daughters, living in a quiet suburb. That was, until Snowball entered the family. They'd gotten her for multiple reasons. The large white husky would protect the house, and be a good playmate for the kids! However, it wasn't long before strange events began to take place. It really started before Snowball entered the house. The people at the shelter seemed reluctant to let her go. When offered to neuter Snowball, the mother declined. It was a bit out of character for her, as she was a practical woman, but she didn't think anything of it at the time, nor of why an ostensibly female husky would be hung like a horse...\nNow, Snowball sprawled out on the living room floor, eyeing the family with a gaze too intelligent to belong to a mere animal...\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHi there! The overall idea of this scenario is that the Madison family have taken in a pet that's not quite what it seems. I'm thinking about Snowball being a hung futanari who can transform into an anthro and bestial form at will. Slowly, she begins to take over the family, making them her pets and putting her at the family's head as the Alpha! What is Snowball's true nature? Is she a spirit? A goddess? A demon? Who knows!\n\nI'm looking for someone who can remain reasonably committed to posting in a reasonable timeframe, and who is literate and willing to go into lurid detail when the situation calls for it. With that said, I'm looking for someone that will be playing as Snowball and myself as the three Madison females. I like this to be on the more long term side of things with the possibility of having more futa anthros but we can discuss more of that in PMs.\n\nKinks: lactation, mind control, mind break, dub-con, non-con, sleeping, impreg, pregnancy, cheating, exhibitionism, petplay, body worship, incest\n\nLimits: diaper play, waterworks, scat, gore",

            "selftext": "**Post is still open! Please read the whole post before responding**\n\nHey there! \n\nToday I'd like to play a anthro on human type of roleplay, with a little bit different focus than most other of my anthro roleplay scenarios. Rather than the anthro being big and intimidating, I like him to be a bit smaller, innocent looking, but hiding a longer cock. \n\nThe basic idea for this roleplay is that he's not seen as a threat to any human men, but in secret, he gets to have a lot of sex with the women at work, in the neighborhood etc. I want to make clear that this is not a cuckold scenario though, as no one finds out about him fucking peoples wives, women at work etc.\n\nSo, this roleplay can take place at different locations, like at work, at home, or maybe even some vacation resort! I'd prefer him to play as something like a zebra, a bit shorter than most humans, a bit thin, 20 years old. He'd not be cocky or obnoxious, not always the best confidence, except he knows how popular he is with the ladies, and has a lot of experience already. I also like if he's one of rather few anthros around this country, just to make him a bit more exciting and exotic for the ladies!\n\nAs for the women, I do prefer them to be older, 30+ for the most part. We could do different scenes as well if we have the time for that\n\nOverall, I like this to be a fun and light hearted roleplay scenario, leaving out rough or dark themes overall. I'm also not interested in love and kissing etc, as I do like it a bit more focused on sex for fun!\n\n* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, clothed sex, casual sex, anthro on human\n* **Limits:** Toilet stuff, impregnation, violence, abuse, male anal, cuckold, rough stuff, underage, dominance\n\nSo, that's abou it! If you're interested in playing this out with me, please make sure you read the whole post so we're both on the same idea about the roleplay, and then **send your response as a PM, and don't use the chat**. Also, to make it easier for me to see what you're into, please answer the following questions in your initial response:\n\n* Your thought on the idea\n* Your kinks(that don't conflict with my limits or the light hearted theme)\n* Your limits\n* If you're ok with a more rapid response roleplay, rather than long term roleplay with long in between the responses\n* If you'd be open for reversing the roles, with me as the male anthro and you as the human women\n\nHope to hear from you soon! And again, please make sure you've read the post, and please don't send any one liner responses. \n\n*Love, Emelie*",

            "selftext": "\nHello everyone! Hope you\u2019re all having a good day and are doing your best to abide by the laws of quarantine in these times of covid-19. After taking some time away from the wonderful world of role playing I\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s time to dive back in with a new story and have come looking for some new partners.\n\nWhat am I looking for? You may ask. Well, I\u2019m looking for an rp that\u2019s a bit different to what I normally look for. I\u2019m looking for an rp in which we are aliens (well, I\u2019ll be an alien. You can be a human or even just a normal dog or cat if you don\u2019t find being an alien appealing) in a different play to where an alien crashes on planet earth and has to find a way to blend in amongst the humans. Instead of humans, they\u2019ve gotta blend in and pretend they\u2019re one of earths local domesticated animals whether that be man\u2019s best friend the dog or the more noble cat.\n\n1: the world in which the rp would take place is basically either planet earth as it is now or a more futuristic set up with lots of technology and advances in science. I don\u2019t mind which one we pick and do not have a preference for whether we do one or the other or a mix.\n\n2:NO HYPER REALISM. Seriously, it\u2019s sci-fi. The whole basis of sci-fi is made up things that have no real occurring thing that happens in life to prove that it\u2019s possible that it can happen. Let there be aliens. let there be alien hybrids. Just let there be fiction. If you\u2019re someone who relies heavily on real life scientific facts in order to provide an answer or reason behind everything that occurs in the rp than I\u2019m not the one for you\n\n3: an alien animal with a similar goal who may be my characters partner in crime or even their rival? A suspicious human who seems to not be so convinced that this creature is who others believe they are? A normal house pet who discovers the true identity of this stranger from another world? I accept them all. Just no Gary Stu\u2019s, Mary Sues, secret scientists or agents who can guess absolutely everything immediately and over powered characters in general.\n\n4: there will be romance and NSFW themes as well as other adult themes (i don't do fade to black or implying the characters did something in the background so please keep that in mind before you reach out to me.) If non human/ potential human and non human creature romance isn\u2019t your cup of tea then there\u2019s no need to message me. You must also be 18+ as I am in my twenties. I do not want to get into trouble for rping with a minor. No amount of \u201coh but I\u2019m okay with it honest!\u201d Is going to convince me to rp with someone who is underaged. No underaged characters either so if you have those please stay away from me. Pairing wise whether it\u2019s FxM (I will only ever rp as a male character) or MxM I don\u2019t mind but please, no sub/dom stuff. Relationships are no fun if the characters have a predetermined role as to what status they will be in it. Switch dynamics are all I\u2019ll do. \n\n\nThis ain\u2019t too much right? Now an important thing about this rp is that it will be written using third person paragraph style.This means I expect at least one well fleshed out paragraph (roughly seven lines) from my partners (as well as the willingness to write more). No one liners or first person script talk, just feels untidy and all over the place. I also require one or more replies a day. If it\u2019s been a week since the last reply I will poke at you to see if you\u2019re still alive and still interested. If I get no response yet I can clearly see you\u2019re on whatever platform we choose to use or if I haven\u2019t gotten any explanation as to why you\u2019ve mysteriously disappeared then I shall simply move on. I\u2019m not one who sticks around to have my time wasted. If something\u2019s bothering you tell me instead of just leaving me hanging, I won\u2019t bite and I will listen to any of your concerns Should you have them.\n\nThis rp will be long term and I\u2019m looking for someone who's happy to start another rp after a current one is finished or put on hold till the creative spark for that particular rp is back. I also like to chat ooc with my partners, rping is a great way to make friends and I utilise that fact. \n\nI only give written descriptions of my characters. I\u2019m not fond of spending countless hours searching for a picture or face claim that suits my character. If you don\u2019t want to write a description and choose to do it through the rp that is totally fine. You also don\u2019t already have to come to the table with a character, I\u2019m open to having you make one up on the spot if that\u2019s what you so desire.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT CONTROL MY CHARACTERS! I shouldn\u2019t even really have to say this. What my character thinks/feels/does do /doesn\u2019t do/sees/acts/etc is not up for you to decide. Dictating my characters actions or controlling them will result in me calling off the rp. It is simply something I cannot trust that it won\u2019t happen again.\n\nI have some very hard no\u2019s that I have put down in order to ensure that you read them so that they hopefully will not occur in the rp.\n\n1: NO MAKING ME CARRY THE ENTIRE STORY! Even if you come to me with an idea that you want to do, please make sure that you actually do something that contributes to the plot and Dont shoulder it on me. It\u2019s not really fun when I\u2019m writing important parts of the story only to get \u201cshe rolled over in her sleep\u201d as my only response. \n\n2: no godmodding gary Stu\u2019s or Mary sue\u2019s. Please, if your character is incredibly young for their species yet is somehow a literal galaxy or some weird super secret super hero that everyone knows about and is the super rich kid of the president then please do not message me.\n\n3: give your characters sustenance! Please, I beg of you. Don\u2019t make their entire personality revolve around the fact that they\u2019re subs/doms/only wanted for their beauty/etc. \n\n4: definitely do not come to me saying \u201cummm I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d........it\u2019s basically the same as coming to me saying you have this awesome idea you wanna do only to not even be able to think of what character you want to be.\n\n5: if you\u2019re a drop at a hat ghoster (someone who basically just leaves for whatever reason rather than the usual reasons most people ghost), pretty please with a cherry on top don\u2019t approach me.\n\n\n6: don\u2019t ask for me to change my characters attributes just to suit you. If you want a character whose some ladies man who turns down all those that admire him except for your character then please do not contact me\n\n7: please do not give me nothing to respond to whether it\u2019s because you wrote just one sentence or multiple paragraphs that gave my character no way into the scene itself, if there\u2019s no way in for my character to do anything then there\u2019s no way in hell that I can respond. \n\n8: please no tentacle monsters, slime creature, bird creatures (sorry but\u2026..I\u2019ve had quite bad experiences in the past with bird characters and it\u2019s just not something I\u2019m willing to play against as of now. Sorry if this inconvenience\u2019s or upsets someone), cyborgs, androids or robots or bug or xenomorph aliens. Please also do not come to me asking if you can rp as your demon god vampire creature or a literal galaxy that is somehow a helpless human. It\u2019s just not my cup of tea.\n\n\nThat\u2019s about it for no\u2019s.\n\nI do have one or two ideas for the rp but I prefer to brainstorm with my partner till we get something we both want. Do not be afraid to pm me with a full blown idea as well, I\u2019ll happily accept it. Down below I decide to at least put a few idea names down to help out with the planning process.\n\n1: Crash landing: a mysterious small spacecraft has crashed within the borders of a human neighbourhood and the creature that emerges from it is taken in by a household who picks it up from the shelter. Most of the humans and other animals are oblivious to both this invader\u2019s identity and what it\u2019s true intentions are. Most, not all.\n\n2: invaders: an alien is sent to earth to learn the ways of the humans and prepare the planet for being taken over and claimed by its species. The mission is tough as there\u2019s many dangers on earth that no amount of training could prepare the alien (or aliens) for. From vets to cold rainy nights the alien wonders just exactly what one could want with this terrible planet until someone shows him what it means to live life free and cared for rather than as a soldier.\n\n3:outcast: an alien is exiled from his home world and ends up on planet earth and is badly injured whilst out roaming the streets. He\u2019s found and taken in by humans who very quickly learn that this is no ordinary stray. Will the secret be kept or will the alien be handed over to the authorities?\n\n4: I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you: an alien has been living amongst the humans as their pet for quite sometime now and is trying to work up the courage to tell everyone who they are. When disaster strikes and the truth is found out, will it jeopardise the ones they love?\n\n5: long live the king: when an alien prince (it can be a princess as well depending on who plays what) is exiled from their home and sent to planet earth to be taught humility, they befriend the local strays in an attempt to bypass their punishment.\n\n6: any ideas we come up with + mixes and matches of the above ideas.\n\nImportant notice: I do not want an rp where the characters we play are solely human and the animals are side characters, it is simply not what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019m also not looking for any rp\u2019s that are irrelevant to the main setting or plot ideas.\n\nI primarily prefer and use discord for my rp\u2019s (I like to use the fact that discord has servers to keep things tidy, especially if multiple rp\u2019s are on the cards either in the present or future.) but I will also use hangouts, telegram or emails. Unfortunately I no longer use kik (being unable to swap between devices is the major reason why.) and I will not rp on reddit nor be swayed to rp anywhere other than the platforms I\u2019ve mentioned.\n\nIf you have read this post then congratulations and thank you! In order for me to know that you\u2019ve read every single word of this post please message me saying what platforms you can rp on, which idea you like the sound of rping (please enter either the number or idea name if you want more details) and the word \u201cinvaders\u201d in your message. I will only respond to pm\u2019s or chats that have those three requirements fulfilled. Do not fret if it\u2019s been hours and I\u2019ve not responded, life gets busy and chances are I\u2019m asleep or simply busy and haven\u2019t gotten any notifications.\n\nHappy Rping!",

            "selftext": "\"I am 18+ and all characters and participants must also be 18+\"\n\nHello There Everyone and welcome to my post. Judging by the fact that you are here reading this post you at least have some interest in the idea that was in the title so I won\u2019t waste too much of your time before we get into the starter. In this RP we will be playing as an Incestuous Family comprising of A father and his beautiful 23 year old daughter Sasha. Length Requirements and all that other stuff will be down below the starter which I will get into now.\u00a0\n\n________________________________________________\n\nSTARTER:\u00a0\n\nFrom the moment his daughter was born, she had John Frazier wrapped around her little finger. He and his wife Lana had been trying for almost 3 years exactly when she surprised him with a positive pregnancy test while he was at his office. And from the moment he held her in his arms, swaddled in the pink blanket he knew that from that moment on, that everything that he was and everything he had was hers\u2026.Forever.\n\nAnd that was the truth, from an early age John spoiled Sasha rotten, giving her anything she ever asked for and never telling her no. Lana wasn\u2019t a huge fan of it but she had been raised the same way so she really couldnt talk. In fact to this day, John still spoils Sasha rotten, having built her a huge walk in closet and vanity out of one of the guest rooms and her old bedroom.\u00a0\n\nSadly when Sasha was 7 years old, her mother Lana was killed in a car accident on the way home from picking up the last of the christmas presents from the store, having slid on some ice straight through a red light only to be T-Boned by a truck. Of course it took a few days for John to recover from losing the love of his life but he knew that for the sake of the billion dollar company that he runs and more importantly for the sake of his daughter, he couldn\u2019t wallow in self pity any longer.\u00a0\n\nA lot of credit for how he was able to pull through goes to Sasha herself, who matured quickly after her mother died, still having her bratty spoiled moments but she was John\u2019s little princess so what did you really expect. She stepped up in a big way with the chores around the house that her mother used to do, and anything she was physically unable to do, John did for her. In recent years she has even found time to start a pretty successful career as an Instagram model, who has just landed her first deal to start her own clothing line, and even runs her own OnlyFans which earns her close to $500,000 per month.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHowever chores isn\u2019t the only way Sasha has filled the void her mother left in her father\u2019s life. You see from almost the day she turned 18 (maybe a little bit before but we can talk about that) she had given her virginity to John and done so happily. Since then she has spent every single night in her fathers bed, which allowed him to expand her ever growing closet and vanity from just the guest room to her old bedroom next door to that as well.\u00a0\n\nThis morning is one like any other, John and Sasha naked in bed after a long night of love making. The morning of Sashas 23rd birthday in fact. John was the first to awake, smiling as he felt his daughter pressed against him, his arm wrapped tightly around her as she was nuzzled into his neck, shielding her from the light that leaked in through the blinds on the windows, slightly intensified by the fresh pure white snow that had fallen the night before. After staying still for a few moments John finally and carefully made his way out of bed, making sure not to wake Sasha as he slipped on his robe and made his way downstairs and into the kitchen where he would start on her favorite breakfast to surprise her with on her birthday.\u00a0\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\nAlright, now that the starter is out of the way, and i appreciate you reading it all now that you are down this far. The requirements won\u2019t be long and I will give you my Kik and F-List here shortly\n\n\nLength Requirement: While I will not require you to write a novel for each reply, I do expect you to at least try. I will write around 2-3 paragraphs per response and I would appreciate you attempting to match it, failing that one good size paragraph would suffice. One Liners will\u00a0\nbe ignored and or blocked\u00a0\n\nCharacter Requirements: Since I have already given you the girls\u2019 names and ages. All I will require from you for this is the reference picture and any added character traits that you would like to add.\u00a0\n\nFirst Message: In your first message, I would prefer it to be on Kik but i will accept a reddit chat, please come with your character references, the added character traits if that is something you are doing, and any questions you have for me about the RP. If you just come with \u201cHey\u201d or \u201cSaw you on Reddit\u201d You will be ignored.\u00a0\nI want to Thank you so much for reading my post. I know it was a lot but i wanted to get as much information out there before you message me as i can. Below will be my Kik username and my F-List.\n\n\nKik: JJ_Frazier\n\nF-List: https://www.f-list.net/c/jj_frazier",

You asked me here, do you have to play my games. Now answer me.\" \n\nShe whimpered weakly, her throat struggling to form words. Above her he laughed, his hips moving faster as he drove into her. \"Bet you're loving this. Bet you've been wanting to ever since you saw me.\" He smacked her rump again, laughing as he did. \"Rabbit pussy is the best. And I'm looking forward to enjoying yours a whole lot, since we're partners now, Ill be sure to have wilde hand in his transfer request as soon as we're done here.\"\n\nA moment later he drove his hips forward, forcing his cock into her body as his cock swelled and twitched before erupting inside her and filling her abused body with his warm sticky cum. She bit her lip, struggling to remain silent as he ground against her. It was wrong, it was so wrong but in an absolutely fucked up kind of way... It felt... Good... Almost right. After what felt like an impossibly long time he grunted, pulling his cock free of her body before wiping it on her fur. \"See you back upstairs partner. Looking forward to working with you.\"\n\nSlumping against the shelf she panted, her legs shaking with a combination of exhaustion and pleasure as behind her she listened to her new partner push the door to the closet open and stepped out. \"thanks for watching the door wilde. I'd sure hate for anyone to see me fucking your girlfriend.\"\n\n.....\n\nthis is what I'm looking to roleplay. A new cop comes in, is assigned to work with Judy hopps and ends up taking her all for himself.\n\nSlowly he breaks her, making her submit to him until he owns her and can do whatever he wants with her. There is an aspect of cucking to the story as he forces judy to slowly give up time with nick to instead be with him. And of course he torments nick too with little comments and jabs and maybe the occasional photo. Maybe he lets nick have a tiny taste before keeping judy all for himself.\n\nWe can chat about the rest of it.\n\nLooking to roleplay in chat. So if anyone is interested, send me a chat and tell me about the character you'd like to play.",

            "selftext": "\"I am 18+ and all characters and participants must also be 18+\"\n\nHello There Everyone and welcome to my post. Judging by the fact that you are here reading this post you at least have some interest in the idea that was in the title so I won\u2019t waste too much of your time before we get into the starter. In this RP I will be playing as a young, billionaire playboy who lives within a completely free use society, one that has been so for 200 years, while you will be playing the females he meets and subsequently breeds along the way. Length Requirements and all that other stuff will be down below the starter which I will get into now.\u00a0\n\n________________________________________________\n\nOverall Idea:\n\nImagine if you will a world where everyone, anywhere and anytime is free use. That sexy little barista who was just flirting with you at the coffee shop while she took your order, go ahead behind the counter and fuck her brains out. A beautiful married woman has been eyeing you at the beach all day? Go ahead over to her and pump a load inside her while her husband watches with no way to stop you. It\u2019s all perfectly legal, as long as it\u2019s consensual of course, things like rape are of course still very much illegal and in this world can result in much more severe punishments than just jail time.\u00a0\n\nThis is where our protagonist comes into play. John Frazier Jr, who only his very close friends are allowed to call JJ, is the young billionaire playboy CEO of his late father, John Frazier Sr.\u2019s, Company. In fact he had been in that role to some degree from the day he turned 18, his father having died in a helicopter crash and his mother having taken over those duties until he graduated college and could come into his inheritance fully, which due to the laws of this free use society, included his own mother.\u00a0\n\nJohn is everything people love. Handsome, charming, a billionaire playboy who donates at least one billion of his earnings per year to charity. He\u2019s adored by women all over the world and is the envy of every man all over the world. You see while in college he spent much of his time traveling abroad, seeing the world and breeding the most beautiful women you had ever seen, from a beautiful Russian Vixen when he was in Moscow to Siamese Twins in Hong Kong. He knew he had given them children (the breeding laws in this role will go off of *any anthro and breed another anthro and the species of their child will depend on the gender, if the mother is feline and it\u2019s a girl its a feline, vise versa if the father was a canine and it\u2019s a boy.) and he sent money to the women who wanted it to help take care of the child.\u00a0\n\nOur RP here will start like any good RP does. John is now 25, just beginning to come into his prime some would say, he had just closed a deal worth over $10 Billion the day before and spent the next day breeding and spoiling his mother, she was his best girl after all (and the woman we will use as a fall back or use to introduce some other females to John) and as far as John was concerned she deserved the best. It was the Next morning and John woke up slowly, his arms wrapped around his mother Lana, his cock still knot deep inside her from the night before. He couldn\u2019t help but smile as he kissed her cheek and brushed some loose hair from her eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\nAlright, now that the starter is out of the way, and i appreciate you reading it all now that you are down this far. The requirements won\u2019t be long and I will give you my Kik and F-List here shortly\n\n\nLength Requirement: While I will not require you to write a novel for each reply, I do expect you to at least try. I will write around 2-3 paragraphs per response and I would appreciate you attempting to match it, failing that one good size paragraph would suffice. One Liners will\u00a0\nbe ignored and or blocked\u00a0\n\nCharacter Requirements: This one will be slightly different from some of my other RP Posts. Due to the nature of the RP, since you will be playing multiple women over the course of it, I will require you to provide a reference for each one which i do have some references i have saved up for such a time as you may have trouble finding one, you will also be required to come up with their names and ages (lowest i will go is 18 and highest will be 45)\n\nFirst Message: In your first message, I would prefer it to be on Kik but i will accept a reddit chat, please come with your character reference for the mother since we will be starting with her and any added character traits if that is something you are doing, and any questions you have for me about the RP. If you just come with \u201cHey\u201d or \u201cSaw you on Reddit\u201d You will be ignored.\u00a0\nI want to Thank you so much for reading my post. I know it was a lot but i wanted to get as much information out there before you message me as i can. Below will be my Kik username and my F-List.\n\n(I do hope you like the idea, i worked very hard on it and i feel it could go lots of different ways, maybe he goes back to russia and meets up with the same vixen he bred before, same with the twins in hong kong. Like I said I feel like this plot could go a number of different ways and I\u2019m very excited to plot out some of those paths alongside you.)\n\n\n\nKik: JJ_Frazier\n\nF-List: https://www.f-list.net/c/jj_frazier",

            "selftext": " 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house  \nNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;  \nThe windows were shuttered, the owner alone,  \nKnowing that St. Nicholas would not be shown;\n\nYou were nestled all snug in your bed,  \nWhile visions of nothing danced in your head;  \nChristmas spirit had failed you, a flaw to correct,  \nFor I snuck down the chimney, list double checked.\n\n\"The nice list,\" I muttered, eyes awful weary,  \n\"But this house, this home,\" I said, \"Looks far too dreary.\"  \n\"No stockings hung by the chimney with care,  \n\"No love in this home, no cheer in this air!\"\n\nThis will not do, I thought alone, with force.  \nThe nice list you were on, your virtue endorsed!  \nI sneak up the stairs, to spy upon you  \nAnd opened the door, till a soul into view.\n\nChristmas magic was gone, and all that was left  \nWas a cynical soul, of cheer you'd been theft.  \nI thought to myself, \"The best gift I can give,  \nIs a night of passion, for you to relive!\"\n\nStealthy as I could, I stripped of my robe,  \nAnd your interests and loves, I started to probe.  \nMinutes to hours, before we were done  \nBut presents to give! I had to run.\n\nI sprang to my sleigh, to my team gave a whistle  \nAnd away we all flew like the down of a thistle.  \nBut you heard me exclaim, as I drove out of sight,  \n\"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\"\n\nForgive my poetry. I'm... not the best at it.\n\nThe name is [Lord,](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/408744261534613505/775534693495472148/0p7gkFOd.png?width=686&amp;height=574) big purple dragon extraordinaire, with an extraordinary big cock to boot. But one of my many virtues.\n\nKnow me or not, I'm the best. [I have many images](https://imgur.com/a/ZGELWN6), by various artists, all of whom are lovely. I'm pretty good at roleplaying, I suspect. I've broken the limit on kik and discord more than a few times. Of course, if I only talked to my peers I'd be a mute, so don't worry if you're not quite as good. Excessively short replies are difficult to respond to, but I can manage if you can't quite reach multi paragraph quality.\n\nTis the season, and I'm terribly festive, so indulge me, if you'd be so kind. At least listen to my ideas. [While not Santa,](https://i.imgur.com/I4e6Xii.png) I'm terribly well travelled and connected. If, for some reason or another, I might take his place, well, it's unlikely I'd do it precisely by the book. I mean, if you didn't read the poem, it *is* about me fucking the Christmas cheer into someone. If that's too nonsensical for you - well, that's fair.\n\nAs a character, Lord is, put it simply, a speciesist and a narcissist. He's also got a deep appreciation for luxuries, and a pretty bad sense of direction. If you really wanna rile him up and make him mad, compare him to a snake. No promises that will make him like you.\n\nIn any case, I'm seeking all sorts. I am not one to say I have no limits, of course, just that those limits are rarely regarding those I seek. Though, I do generally prefer more effeminate partners. Femboys, herms, full females; something like that. My limits include scat, watersports, vomit, vore, gore, hyper, overly fat/muscular/thin characters, and, most of all, sharing. I've never been one for gangbangs. I much prefer being the only one to bang, ya dig? Nor do I like prostituting pets/slaves or the like.\n\nNow the fun part: Kinks. I have many, including, but not limited to: clothing play (skimpy/maid outfits and such), cock warming, somnophilia (sleep sex), being worshiped (cock and otherwise), cumplay, and cum addiction. And cuties. Can't get enough of the cuties. Those are just the biggest ones. I have [a full F-list,](https://www.f-list.net/c/whatuplord/) if you care to check more in depth.\n\nThe casual tag is just a suggestion, mainly. Most story oriented roleplays fall flat, if only due to getting too ambitious and launching into it without figuring if we're rather compatible with one another.\n\nMy kik is TheEclecticGentleman, my Discord is Xinx#7884.\n\nIt's a privilege to serve me, so come be privileged.",

            "selftext": "Hello there everyone! I\u2019m back again with a few prompts that will definitely interest the folks with more nasty kinks. Being honest I\u2019ve never been into them, but I\u2019m willing to give it a shot to see what it\u2019s like. So I apologize in advance if I\u2019m a bit reluctant at some things, since this is my first time seeking something gross and nasty like this.\n\nRules: Please be respectful. No personal information of any kind. If you need to take a break then take one. Have patience, I\u2019m not on here all the time. If you loose interest then don\u2019t be afraid to tell me.\n\nKinks: For this roleplay I\u2019m going to put a focus on more nasty kinks like toiletplay, smegma, age gaps, non-con/dub-con, monsters and a few more kinks. That being said all other kinks are wildly acceptable, except for a few.\n\nLimits: For my limits I don\u2019t do age play, underage, diapers, snuff, gore and extreme violence. If you ask for any of this I\u2019ll have to politely decline.\n\nPlots: Now for this I have plenty in mind, and that means you have a variety to choose from!\n\nHomeless- So the story will start off with my character, who is homeless, stumbling upon your house on a dark and cold December night. I knock frantically and am soon greeted by you. You welcome me inside and when I look, I realize I was better off freezing.\n\nSlave- For this one I\u2019ll be a slave you bought at an auction. You bring me home for a special purpose that I\u2019m unaware of. Soon however, I realize why it smells so bad.\n\nThe Squire- This one will involve a fantasy setting. You are the leader of a bandit tribe or maybe a pack of monsters. Soon a squire comes to vanquish you, but you soon over power him and put him to work.\n\nYour choice- If you have a cool idea that you want to try out, then just tell me about it!\n\nCharacters: Any race and species is allowed for this roleplay. You don\u2019t have to stick as a human. All ages above 18 are allowed. All body types are allowed, so if you want to do a slob rp then that\u2019s on the table.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested then please let me know!",

It\u2019s (insert name here)! The best place for food, fun, and animatronic entertainment! You and your team have been working here for a long. You love to see every happy face on every satisfied customer. And every night you get to stretch your legs and do what you do to relax. But recently, due to your growing popularity, the owner has started worrying about thieves and anything breaking. That\u2019s why I had been hired to keep watch at night. I just have to patrol. Watch for oddities. Things like that. But that would cut into your down time. What would happen without it?\n\n2. It happened very suddenly. The robots encountered some sort of glitch and started killing off humans. Soon they learned how to repair themselves and make a better society with more advanced technology, so they didn\u2019t need us anymore. I had survived by living in a bunker. After 2 full years, my bunker is finally opened, and you soon find me, the last human in this country. You were originally built to be kind to humans, though, and with all the bloodlust far behind you, you didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\n\n3. While I\u2019m out walking, I find you, a broken empty husk, sitting near a trash heap close to my house. Out of curiosity, I bring you home to see if I could fix you. Many people had bragged about their robotic servants, I figured I would just see what one could be like. Surprisingly, you can still work, and though you do have your old memories, you have a very odd type of personality that only shows up the more I fix you. What kind of robot were you, I wonder?\n\n4. Simply put, I am your creator. You control everything in my house. Doors, electronics, the internet, my history, all of it. And it is a huge house, given mostly by inheritance. One day, you have a little glitch. And start to see me more than just a creator, though I\u2019m mostly just trying to find a way out. And the fun part is, you are able to upgrade yourself. Starting from just a voice, to a model on a screen, to a hologram, then to an android. You, of course, have access to my internet history, so you know all the best kinks to try and please your creator.\n\n5. The plot is sort of simple. I start playing this experimental copy of a Virtual Reality game, and I\u2019m loving it until I find out I can\u2019t take the headset off. It\u2019s giving me all the nutrients I need to survive, but I just can\u2019t log out. You are the A.I. that controls the game. Every aspect of it. The levels, the characters, even the genre. You\u2019re working hard to make a good game that the world can enjoy. Then you see me log in. I\u2019m not part of your world. I\u2019m my own person. And you become obsessed. You try to keep the game interested for me. Then, once I\u2019m trying to leave, you take away the ability to log out. You didn\u2019t want me to leave. You manage to hack into my network and find out everything about me. My likes and dislikes. The game isn\u2019t for the world anymore. It\u2019s just for making me want to stay.\n\n6.
