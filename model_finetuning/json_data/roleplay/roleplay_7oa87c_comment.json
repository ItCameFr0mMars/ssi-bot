For instance in our canon Jon Snow was in fact the child of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and a Targaryen. At the same time the winner of the War of the Five Kings was Aegon Targaryen, Young Griff from the books, who took the name Blackfyre when it was revealed that he possessed the sword of the same name.\n\nAs for activity we've had a bit of a slowdown over the holiday season, but we're beginning to pick back up now that people are coming back.",
