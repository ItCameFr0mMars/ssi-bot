Are you interested in learning / structuring the RP around it? It provides the structure, abilities and such while we provide the rest.\n\nThe scenario above is possible with only a little forethought and tweaking from us. In that system, your troubles would be known as a Mystery Play, the visitor would be a true Mage and you would be either a sleepwalker or a newly awoken Mage. A mage can warp reality through 10 different spheres or Arcanum, all you had in mind is possible exactly how you envision it, based on the rules of the system.",
