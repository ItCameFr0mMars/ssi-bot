Then I'd suggest you seek out role players who have more of a loose activity - every few days or a few times a week.\n\nHowever. If somebody has multiple plots, they usually don't mind if you don't reply every single day. Communicating with your partner on what they expect / if something is okay is the best route you can take!",

In your case, just be clear and communicate what is realistic and comfortable for you. Communication is generally the best way to go about issues. If your partners accommodate you, that's good. If they don't, then you can walk away and find someone better, more understanding. In my book, if my partner is stressed or unhappy, I'm not and I want to help. I hope you can move forward and do what is best for you. :)",
