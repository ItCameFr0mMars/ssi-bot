Literally did it all day for months, I barely slept, didn't care about my real life, whenever I wasn't writing it I was thinking about it, it was insane lol, but I loved it so much. Only reason I stopped was because my partner had to leave because of life stuff. But I'd say the best way to get over it is to set for yourself specific times in the day to log on, before going to bed, after lunch, things like that, and just at those times. Maybe you'll miss out on some things on the RP but you won't be missing out on life, I guess(? In any case, it's a matter of deciding your priorities, if roleplaying means more to you than other things I'd say just go ahead and keep enjoying yourself. Hope it helps and good luck!",

Then use an equal amount of time to do stuff IRL, even if it's like reading a book or cleaning. Yes, it may be mundane, but you are practicing being able to hold yourself back.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you miss an event in RP. it does matter if you miss a job interview.",
