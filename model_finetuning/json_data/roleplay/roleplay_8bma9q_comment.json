I train him in ways to use his powers deviously and to his advantage, eventually helping him become almost his own person in this time.\n2) I play a new time hero with similarly strong powers and decide to team up with you in helping clear up Gotham, and return you to the past.\n3) I play a longstanding hero who is trying to convince you to join the JLA. In the process I accidentally alert the LoD and they send out one of their own to recruit you to their cause.\nI also have a fourth option if you wanna do an injustice storyline",
