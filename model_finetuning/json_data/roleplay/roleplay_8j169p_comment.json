His hands carving pieces of apple with a long curved knife, popping the slices into his mouth. He spent the last several months in one place a wood elf wouldn\u2019t want to be, at sea. Lossamdir was a temporary crew member of the Pirate Ship *The Scowlin\u2019 Beauty* in search of a book rumored to be written by a god. Of course like all good treasure stories told by pirates and other telltale storytellers, it wasn\u2019t real. Or well, so the Captain of the band of pirates thought. Either way Lossamdir was happy, he got to go home and got money from a contracted gig that involved almost no work. \n\nHis wooden mask is slung on his waist held by his red sash. His green hood was down revealing his face to the moon night. His tree that he is currently sitting on was in a forest several miles away from the nearest town and deep inside the woods. It\u2019s quiet, and he enjoyed it. For the past several months all he heard was the sound of waves crashing, sirens singing, and drunken pirates fighting. He missed the sound of wind whispering against the bushes and leaves of the trees. He was at peace, and he\u2019s at home. \n",

The chest pounding EDM music guiding the packed house of young adult bodies into a dance frenzy doesn\u2019t affect the cold blooded vampire known as Gavin. Dressed in all black, he stands at the back of the club, leaning against the wall watching the mass of people jump up and down at the whim of the DJ. \n\n\u201cC\u2019MON ALL I WANT TO SEE YOU JUMP. MAKE SOME NOISE.\u201d The DJ would yell out on the mic, and the place grew more rowdy. The male DJ was undressed from the waist up, six pack, curly blonde hair, and clearly was better looking than his choice of music he would play to the young crowd. \n\nGavin was bored, he\u2019s been bored for years. Every few months he would go out during the night, away from the house, away from the small fortune and *safety nest* he created himself to experience what life is like for the living. It was dull, filled with instant gratification of cellphones, internet, and short term flings. It seemed, frivolous. Speaking of cellphones, his buzzed in his pocket. He checks it, a text message from one of his retainers. \n\nIt was someone he paid on the police force. He provided services from disposing bodies to where the cops won\u2019t be when he needed to feed. Lately the city has been under fire from gang violence between conflicting street gangs, something in which Gavin thought was below him. In fact it was the officer that recommended *Celebrities* to Gavin to visit for his Night Club visit. \n\n*Get out, you\u2019re in danger.* It read, Gavin looked around the club. He smiled at the text.\n",
