While I am writing what they are and what they do, I like to consider myself something of a vessel for them to exist. I create them, their mindset, their ideals, their objectives, their life and times; but they are not me. In fact, I\u2019ve often written characters whose actions, ideals, goals and means I personally find abhorrent. See what I mean? In a sense, they *are* lambs to the cosmic slaughter, but it is *their* choices and *their* actions that will doom or save them. Not mine.\n\nSo yeah, Death of the Author, basically.",

That seems to lead to Mary Stue's and god-modding, cardinal sins of roleplaying. It's also worth noting that almost all drama is about someone overcoming adversity and pain and the resulting struggle. \n\nIdeally there would be a good sense of balance, between a character having a rediculously hard time and never feeling any strife at all. These extremes are equally un-fun. \n\nMy advice then would be to either do a rather sleepy roleplay without much conflict, something that would allow you to explore your characters without forcing them into a dangerous, exciting circumstance, or alternatively, try and find a partner who is able to strike the balance with you.

I've even written as characters I hate from a show or anime, and eventually I can somewhat understand better as I write for them. I empathize with them and I cherish them. That said, hardship is needed to grow and I am not above doing horrible things to them (though it's hard to write that out because deep down I'm a weanie haha).\n\nBut OCs? Nah. I really dislike them because writers tend to be too protective of them and make them too similar to themselves. If I criticize an OC I think is too cliche or just not a good fit for the story, some writers feel personally attacked and I don't have time to debate about characters personally. OCs can be so poorly constructed and given picture perfect backstories (or worse, the shittiest ones) that I have little patience when a plot revolves around them. People get protective of OCs or even canons they play as and when a writer can't detach themselves and see a bigger picture, that is a problem for me.\n\nSo I think there is a balance but it's tough to strike. Maybe it's the right character in the right moment with the right partner? I don't know but for me, I have only found a small handful of people I can't write with because of how they link themselves to their character(s). Overall a lot of folks are open to being fair but firm with development and enjoy not only their character but their partner's character as well which I think is pretty important when working one on one.

I've never been able to get into dice roleplay any more than freeform without running into the \"collab storytelling\" or \"optimizing play outside of character role\" problems. I \\*have\\* in MMORPGs, but only when I start playing with friends to begin with. Even then it's 50&amp;#37; or greater of times that it's less about \"let's use these characters to explore the world together\" and more about \"let's use this character to dump gear onto, this one for minmaxing the market, this one gets to be the butt\\-monkey agro\\-bait while we grind XP\", etc.\n\nSo that's not even that it's a \\*poor\\* dynamic, just that it optimizes over elements divorced from the roles played by the characters. If I wanted to step into the shoes of a diety exploring diety\\-hood through limitless disposable serfs, this sounds as though it would be an appropriate approach. But I just want to explore the world from the perspective of one \\(or sometimes more\\) characters. Play from the character perspective instead of from the Dungeon Master or Guild Leader perspective.",

And it sounds like both dynamics that I describe \\(Character\\-POV vs World\\-POV\\) are being shown to have both fruitful and obnoxious implementations, even if I feel like I'm the only one giving airtime to the \"fruitful Character\\-POV\" corner of that square. ;\\)\n\nCollaborative storytelling makes sense to do from a World\\-POV, because it's all in service to some eventual reader or to the lore of the world or storyline itself. Characters will experience herculean hardship and what does not kill them will allow them to grow stronger.. and then the *reader* can be drawn along with their struggles.\n\nBut Character\\-POV is for when the writers *do* expect to be the only readers. For this the world is less like a novel written or a movie performed in, and more like what one might expect if one were to go with some friends onto the Holodeck to relax or to explore imaginary places or situations. Here it's not about being a deity inflicting suffering upon a character just to offer them the opportunity to rise above it or to resolve a larger dissonance in the storyline, instead whatever challenges or suffering you face actually reflect your own personal limitations and opportunities for growth. You pose \"What would happen if\" scenarios to explore *your own reactions to them* and their effects on you \\(as the character\\) instead of their effects on the greater world or the narrative flow.\n\nBad Character\\-POV would come out as mary suing and godmodding and being a wet blanket for anyone else to RP with. But good Character\\-POV would involve the discipline of not hijacking anyone else's character or altering/adding\\-to the world in ways favorable to your character that work against either other characters or expectations that people set amongst themselves. Bad World\\-POV could present as any of the above, or as minmaxing the fun out of the experience. You sound like you've got a fair handle on good World\\-POV though. :\\)\n\nSo is the Character\\-POV that I describe really so rare \\(outside of lazy/selfish examples\\) as to not have a name or a place where people meet up to do that?",

But I know that Character\\-POV is a thing folks know how to do because when I start with friends first, I've done it with dozens of people.. and on hundreds of occasions prior to even hearing the term \"role play\" or learning an iota of how Dungeons and Dragons worked \\(prior to that I just presumed it was a complex board game lol\\).\n\nIt's fine if you're not clear where my question is coming from, and/or where or how one might LFG such a thing.
