Moreover, reading through your ads, I noticed that your prompts seem rather specific, which, while not in itself an issue, certainly makes the niche you\u2019ve carved yourself into smaller. Now, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, and nothing else, all the advice I can personally give you is to keep on trying until someone is interested, which is statistically certain to happen, eventually. Otherwise, you could try casting a wider net, conceptualizing new prompts for different RPs, and creating connections that way; maybe after you have people to roleplay with, after you\u2019ve made a meaningful connection, you can try your current idea. Anyhow, yeah. The reason you haven\u2019t had luck is primarily that yours is a fairly niche request, and not much else. You seem polite and literate, which is always good, so those are points in your favor. In any case, good luck.",

As your idea, that of an evil Doctor Who names The Storm, is dramatically different from anything that has been seen in Doctor Who, it might be easier for you and more accessible for others, if you ditched the actual Doctor Who fandom, and instead creating an original setting which is heavily influenced by it. \n\nSecond, although jumping into the premise for your roleplay is good, I believe it's better if you have a few paragraphs either describing the setting of your story, or a few paragraphs from a scene. This not only allows you to show off how well you can write, but also provides a hook for anyone thinking about your idea. It would come across as a complex detailed world instead of a mere 'what if the doctor was evil'\n\nYou have been advertising this same roleplay for two weeks now which is enough time for you to draw conclusions about how popular, or how unpopular, that setting is. It's impossible to tell how many people have read your idea, but I imagine it would be quite a lot. Maybe it's time for a fresh idea?",

I know plenty of fandom posts here seem to get downvoted \\(at least to me\\) and I assume it's because people don't like fandoms. That's a tough enough hurdle to overcome \\(though I have found great fandom writers here so it's not impossible\\) Maybe there are MCU folks out there \\(well I know there are based on the past few MCU posts in this sub\\) who don't want to spin things in the way you presented them and that's not a reflection of you but of your craving.\n\nTo me I don't know where either RP goes. You wanna give your canons a dark spin but if say someone plays Rose or Pepper or Martha, those canons will contrast with the way you're playing your characters so perhaps people aren't sure of the direction and the goal you're after. In my mind, these canons females I mentioned would probably not enjoy the misdeeds you want to commit. Do you want your characters to reform or do you want them to help? Wanting characters to 'resist as well as work alongside him' seems like the RP centers around your character and his choices which to me, doesn't sound to exciting. Your premise is centered around your character but doesn't open up the plot to the other person's character and for me, I try not to take part in plots that feel one\\-sided.\n\nLike someone playing an OC and making others write as canons or a character who is super clumsy but all the guys still fall for her, sort of stuff. I'm not saying your RP will be all about your character but you've presented it in a light where that's all you care about and others may just be along to help bring your vision to life. I don't really see at at first glance but I thought it might be helpful. Maybe my perspective isn't quite right. \n\nMaybe it boils down to people wanting a Ten \\(he is popular\\) but not wanting him being evil. So maybe you could start on his journey to that place? Just like people might like a Tony but have a tough time believing he could be tied to HYDRA and president \\(well if Trump could do it, okay\\) but don't see where the story goes. \n\nPersonally I prefer Nine to Ten and I don't like a lot of agnsty plots. So I'd go with Tony but I have zero interest in HYDRA and that part of MCU or want him to be evil. That's just me. But I would offer these suggestions:\n\n\\- Start the RP before your character has come into power. We want to see the rise, not just the man already on his throne.\n\n\\- Open the RP up to your leading lady. Make sure her role is important and she isn't just a prop.\n\n\\- Or just be open to other fandoms or remove the twist from your current ones and wait a few weeks to try dropping this particular bait. \n\nI hope you do find someone because I know what it's like to have a craving you gotta see through to the end but sadly sometimes it takes months or years for things to really click into place. I don't think it's you, it's just the fact people aren't looking for what you're looking for. Have you tried dpp? They might be able to help \\(in fact a lot of posters lately would be better of advertising there than here IMO\\) given their mature \\(content wise\\) users. Good luck!",
