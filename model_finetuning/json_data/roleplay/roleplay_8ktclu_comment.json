Offering some options for ways for people to roleplay with you (example: Discord or email as opposed to only Discord, which excludes people who don't have the time to roleplay via chat) also helps, if you are willing.\n\nAs for what roleplayers want... each person wants one thing, but it does take time to find a long-term partner.

The same problem happens to me.\n\nThere is a couple of things you can do to increase the odds of people wanting to respond to you and roleplay with you though.\n\nFirstly: make your ads sound interesting. It\u2019s obvious, but but pizzaz and details in there.\n\nAlso, when you do roleplay with someone, do NOT control their characters/any character they control unless they give you permission or tell you to. That\u2019s a huge turn off in roleplaying.\n\nAlso, length and whatnot matter. Most roleplayers prefer a couple of paragraphs in addition to good writing skills and third person. Typically try to match your partner unless he/she says otherwise.\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s just a game of luck really. Also don\u2019t bother too much of telling people to post when it takes them a while. It makes people not want to post more. And try to make friends with them! \n\nThere\u2019s other roleplaying sites to go to that helps too. RPNation, Discord RPs, here, etc.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind chatting with you about a fantasy roleplay. Hit me up if you\u2019d like.",

(I don't know if you do any of these things, so this is a general list.)\n\n**Turn offs:**\n\n* Using the word 'literate' or mentioning a post-length requirement. I'm a decent writer. I've written several novels. I'm absolutely capable of adding detail when detail is warranted... but so many people try to use length as a sign of quality, and it's absolutely not true. Rambling into introspective purple-prose in dialog where it's not needed, or inspecting the lace on the tablecloth as a word count buffer is sucky writing, full stop. At best, it's needless padding. At worst, you're denying me the chance to interact, and isn't that the _point_ of RP? Interaction? If I wanted to write a novel by myself, I'd just go write another novel.\n* Prompts where someone tries to foist a character on me. I have my own characters. Don't try to force one down my throat.\n* Pairings. Saying you want to play Princess x Pirate might work for some, but it's turnoff for me.\n\n**Turn ons:**\n\n* Have _some_ idea of what you're interested in. \"I like everything\" is hard to narrow down.\n* Characters and/or situational prompts. The last few prompts that caught my eye were either a specific situation, or a detailed character profile. A medieval lord with PTSD who happened to be deaf. A prince who'd escaped a necromancer who'd done _something_ to the rest of the royal family. An extremely flawed bounty hunter who's grown suspicious of the mob he works for.\n* A sense that you're proactive, and can hold your own brainstorming. No one likes being a writing chauffeur.\n\n**Important Match Points:**\n\n* Medium type. This is going to be a factor for everyone-- I RP over Discord, but I won't consider email.\n* Frequency. I only do rapid-fire RP. One post right after another. This is not a popular option, and I understand that-- I'm actually bedridden with a chronic illness, and no one has as much time as I do. So I know I need to be patient and picky to find a good match.",

Distinction which is extremely neglected by damn near everyone in the community. I do not enjoy /writing/. I do not enjoy (And actually hate 99% of the time) /reading/. I enjoy /creation/ and /interaction/. Is it so hard to understand? I fucking created a complete universe over imaginative bathroom break wanderings and never wrote shit (heh) down because it's boring without the interactivity. It also scares me because, as much as i think i'm a glorious icon of the amazing brittania language... It's not my first language and i've probably butchered all sense of grammar and formatting on this one paragraph. Sue me.\n\nI also feel you on the last two turn-offs. What's the point of playing without the flexibility? I've noticed that the rolexrole format seems to be prompted mostly by ERPers who think they're sneaky unfortunately. So i'm naturally afraid of answering anything that asks that way,even though there's probably well meaning, nice RPers who prompt that way.\n\nI'll admit i'm guilty of sometimes sucking at these things. I do like everything, and i want you to pick. But I have no problem knowing what i like. No fuck, no kiss, nothing without at least one dragon in it (idgaf if it's living, hypothetical or mechanical) and make me feel special. That's it. I have a few prompts myself, and can come up with ideas FAST. I just prefer to hear what the other person has to offer first!\n\nAlso, characters are the focus of my prompts most of the time, so we match on that too. \n\nI'll admit i'm guilty of this last turn on of yours. I suck at holding up my own shit most of the time, but i can try my hardest. I mean, i made up an universe over shitting time. Maybe i'm lazy? I need to fix this. \n\nAlso, i do chat only mostly too.\n\nOn that last bit there's nothing i can do, though. I live an extremely hectic life where i bathe every 5 days and sleep 4 hours on weekdays and i don't know how i'm still alive, so... Yeah. 10 posts a day, maybe more, but not constant unfortunately, sorry :c",
