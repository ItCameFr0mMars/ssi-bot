If you're really addicted or using it to cope with depression, you need therapy or some other outside source.

I'm a maladaptive daydreamer myself and have found a lot of support there. Check this out, does this sound like you?: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ckYSydGYKRU\n\nI use daydreaming and RPing to cope with a lot of stuff, but I don't feel they cause problems in my life as much as they are a symptom of a problem. In fact, it can be therapeutic and help you develop creative skills if used in moderation. I just have to say that, in defense of writing. BUT there is a point where its done too often, and you begin to neglect your social life, your professional life, sometimes even your hygiene to dedicate all of your time to the escape RP(or whatever your poison is) provides. So I think the question you have to ask yourself is not how to cut back RP, but what is driving you to require such an escape and so often? I don't think simply cutting back will solve the underlying issues here (directly anyway). What hole is it filling is what you have to consider in order to be able to move forward in a way that won't just cause you relapse again after taking a break. \n\nSchedule and dedicate time to maintaining friendships, exercise, adopt a tactile hobby. Of course, seeking professional help doesn't hurt. But don't demonize something that has brought you happiness or escape in the past. Escape is healthy, it keeps us sane. As long as we don't lose our real lives to it. \n\nHopefully this doesn't sound like enabling. I wish you good luck, a lot of this sub has been there, I'm sure. And you took a risk and reached out for advice, so you're doing great already I'd say. You're trying, and seeking help. PM if you ever need someone to talk to you. ",

            "body": "Well, if you feel you have an issue because you're afraid to miss out on something, and the current one you're in is hyperactive, 24 hours, and chat based, it's going to do nothing but feed in that notion that you're missing something.\n\nStaying in your current capacity isn't going to do anything to help your problem and might even make it worse long term. You might not even have to leave wholesale; you could scale back, still chat with everyone in the group, and follow stories, but just not actively participate as much, if at all.\n\nI don't do chat groups and haven't since the early 2000's, but even way back then, someone would write up a summary of what happened in the chat for people to follow, and I doubt that practice has changed much in the meantime. So if your group has a summary of the plot so people not on every day can still follow along with all of the changes, I suggest just focusing on that for the story and finding a slower RP. Then, after awhile, start migrating back, just enough to where you can still maintain a proper RP/work/school/life balance with everything else you have going on in your corner of the universe.\n\nDoing otherwise is going to lead to some other issue coming up or complete burnout.",
