            "body": "I think the biggest thing to remember here is that you have more than one option. You're going to really need to consider what works for you as a person and please! Don't be afraid to be specific. Set your limits in the beginning and remember, there is such a large amount of people out here roleplaying that you'll always be able to find someone for *something*. Trust me, I'm one of the picky folks. So, how are you in group chats? At what number do they tend to become a bit overwhelming or just hard to follow? Group roleplays come in various sizes. \n\nI've been roeplaying for over fifteen years now and I believe the largest group I've been in contained at least twenty people, while the smallest group was around four people. One of the most common complaints I've seen about these are:\n\n* Way too many notifications/people talking.\n* Not feeling heard by peers or feeling a bit dwarfed by more active members.\n* And for smaller groups, simply not enough action or replies that come too slow.\n\nYou're also going to consider how frequently you want to receive and send out posts. This fluctuates from person to person and some people tend to have shorter attention spans than others when it comes to long delays between replies. When you're in a group roleplay, it's not just one other person you're waiting on. It's potentially multiple. Most people are leaving school for summer now or going on vacation from their jobs, so it leaves a lot of room for quicker replies. If you prefer a faster speed, then chances are one on one might work best for you. \n\nThere's also fandom vs originals. So, with fandom roleplays, they typically consist of writing canon characters. For example, I'd write as Harry Potter and you'd write as Ron Weasley. There are also people who like to pair\\(because a lot of times, people like to roleplay for the sake of building character romantic relationships\\), their original characters with canon characters. The third option in the fandom category is people who prefer to write with original characters only but they prefer to only play in a preestablish world. Essentially, we'd both create OCs, but they'd live in the world of Harry Potter. \n\nFor original RPs, writers typically have their own prompts that they're interested in roleplaying. You might see something like:\n\nI want to rp these ships: AngelxDemon, PrincessxVillager, etc.\n\nI honestly think the best way to start is to jump right in with the attitude of frick it. Worst case scenario, you guys both stop the RP. Best case? You guys totally click and form a friendship because of it. :\\)\n\n\\- Extras: Some things I hate about the RP community is that people can be really inconsiderate of real life. I once wound up in the hospital with a broken bone after a pretty bad car accident and one of my partners at the time actually got mad at me for not replying in a timely manner. And when I eventually snapped at them because that's really stupid, they tried to get mad at me for not contacting them before anyone else \\- including my mother. Keep in mind that I'd only been roleplaying with this person for a month and didn't know them from a hole in the wall. And that wasn't the first time that something like that had happened. \n\nOther than this, I really hate writers who change their characters to suit their agenda. I tend to roleplay in fandom, canon/canon, so it's really frustrating when someone makes a character do something they wouldn't actually do. For example, Hermione Granger isn't going to go on a crucio spree to get revenge over a missed examination. Of course, this is roleplay, it's not canon annyways, but holey moley, at least try to stick to the character's key personality quirks and traits. \n\nAnyways, I wish you the best and I want to let you know that it's a lot easier than you think.",
