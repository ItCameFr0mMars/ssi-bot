What I can explain is 1 on 1 RPs to the best of my ability, from my experience - You can either make your own character entirely, or you can play a character that already exists and you feel you can portray them well. There isn't really a person with a \"pen and paper\", or a narrative, unless you're interacting with something like D&amp;D and have a \"game master\". You are in control of what happens to your character, but not the other's for the most part. In terms of what types of writing styles, there's the basics you get from books like Third and First person, and then there's action based, like \"*reaches over and holds her hand*\", but here I've only ever seen the more literary standpoint. I hope this answers some of your questions!",

            "body": "/u/Nezryn covers the 1x1 side particularly well, so I'll cover the group aspect. While there are many different ways of doing it, group style is probably the most like pen and paper D&amp;D - there's usually an admin/mod (or several) who check over everything and set up events, but they don't go through everything that goes on - just enough to get people interacting. With roleplay, the focus is more in controlling your character's actions and pushing in your own narrative around others - it's like a combination of DM and player, I suppose. There's no controlling of other people's characters, though there may sometimes be dice rolls if your admin/mod wants to incorporate those.\n\nTypes of roleplays, I'd go with:\n\n-- novel roleplay (set out like writing a book, so 'He said, \"Hello.\"')\n\n-- script roleplay (set out like so: 'Tom: Hey. *waves*')\n\n-- asterisk roleplay (set out like *They/I walk to the door* but may use different brackets or even hyphens in place \nof asterisks)\n\n-- group roleplay (multiple people writing, typically with an admin/mod)\n\n-- 1x1 roleplay (private roleplay between two people, typically longer and with more control over the setting)\n\n-- fandom roleplay (set in an existing fictional world/setting, such as Marvel, writing canon characters like Spider-\nMan and more, but also able to write your own characters)\n\n-- original roleplay (wholly your own design, with maybe some influence from fandom)\n\n-- forum roleplay (set on websites with typically a team of 'staff' who guide the place, has more rules but has more continuity/interactions aren't stuck to just one scene as often)\n\nHope that helps a little!",
