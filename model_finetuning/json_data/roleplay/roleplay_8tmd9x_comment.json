The breaking point for me, a person who has finished their transition, was when they made 3 gender roles called: male, female, &amp; multi-gender-mental-illness.\n\nSo. My advice? KEEP POLITICS OUT OF IT. Keep your real world beliefs out of it. If you are transgender avoid groups at all costs, as after that group did... that... I have found it difficult to join other groups when I see they have OOC discussion, face reveals, etc. so another string of advice would be to avoid once with those things or just restrict yourself not to participate.
