Though currently Pan is deceased in canon so we would have to negotiate on how to bring him back, or simply make him the wish version who Rumple has imprisoned.\n\nPlease note. As we are a mature site, &amp; allow adult content. No child characters are allowed, or persons registering under 18. Due to this all Lost Boys in the storyline will have aged too, to be around 18 at the youngest. \n\nThis fits in with the present time line perfectly for US.  As due to the magic Neverland possessed having died out, since Pan never completed his plan to restore it with the heart of the truest believer in our canon,  time is no longer in effect, frozen there.",
