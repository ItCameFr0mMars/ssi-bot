How can we predict what language, symbols, or cultural icons will be significant or understood that far into the future? The article points out that even the skull and crossbones started out not as a symbol of death or as a warning. If you put a skull and crossbones on something and showed it to a  Christian from the Middle Ages, he wouldn't regard it as a warning at all, but as a symbol of faith. In fact you will frequently find [a skull and crossbones on old crucifixes](https://imgur.com/a/z1UtRDu), and it didn't signify the Dread Pirate Jesus, but belief in the rebirth of Christ. \n\nShip captains would later add in their logs a small skull and crossbones next to the names of sailors who had died on the voyage as a kind of R.I.P. Pirates then adopted the use of the skull and crossbones as a warning -- mess with us and you'll get one of *these* next to your name in the ship's log -- and only then did we associate it with death and danger, and start putting it on bottles of poison and what have you. So symbols can change over time! ",
