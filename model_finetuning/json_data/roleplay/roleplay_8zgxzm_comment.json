My recent efforts have had mixed success at keeping the story alive, but I'm always looking for an opportunity to try again with folks more invested in the experience. Worlds I've explored are not from any pop universe and I like it that way.  One world I'd love to explore more is a bit steam-punk, with corporations more powerful than governments and ridiculous levels of financial inequality.  The OCs would be part of the Watcher organization, a secret cabal of historians that hunt down Memory stones littering the earth.  Within each stone is the key to unlocking alternate realities with the help of a seriously life-threatening cocktail of drugs and cybernetic enhancements.  These \"Watchers\" dive into the \"Memories\" hoping to learn about them and even steal precious technologies/relics.  Anyway, I'm up for something else too, just shoot back a comment if your interested in creating a new world with me.",
