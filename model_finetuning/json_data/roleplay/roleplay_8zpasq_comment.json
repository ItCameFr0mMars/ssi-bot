Never feel rushed to reply and if you're not happy with what you're writing, express that and you and your partners can fix it. I can try and show you an example if you'd like. I'd have to find some screen shots, but I can try. If you would like you can add me on discord, so pm me if either of you would like.",

Also, remember that there is no set rule and this is mostly me talking from experience so take everything with a grain of salt lmao\n\n Firstly, there is 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person. You probably know this already, but for rp specifically 1st and 3rd person are important. When people refer to 1st, they usually refer to something like this:\n\n1st person: Hello! *i waved my hand* \n3rd person: Hello! *she waved her hand*\n\nThids one is more common and is the standard:\n\n1st person: ''Hello!'' I said as I waved my hand.\n3rd person: ''Hello!'' She said as she waved her hand.\n\nOf course, there are different variations, but these 2 are common ones that I often see. The main difference is that method one is more often than not not detailed at all and a common style for beginners. It's pretty frowned upon in the community, but I have seen some roleplays executing it well. The 3rd person variant of the second style is the most common and accepted by far.\n\nMost roleplays will want to rate their expected and accepted length, and it's usually somewhat like this:\n\nOne liner: 1 to 3 sentences. Very basic, these pretty much only work well in very fast roleplays, frowned upon and often used by beginners.\nSemi literate: This is what you're gonna want to aim for at the beggining. This is 1-4 paragraphs, and is generally accepted on most sites.\nLiterate: These are the absolute beasts who can write a person asking 'how are you' in like 7 paragraphs. Don't start with aiming for this, instead increase your word count goal as you get better.\n\nAs with any media, there is many genres, like original rp, fandom rp, and the feared erotic rp (if you want to you can do erotic rp aka erp but thats not my cup of tea so I cant give you advice about it lol)\n\nThere's also group rp, 1x1 rp, closed groups, open groups, ones with strict rules and plot or ones where you're given nothing and can do anything! Really, it's so broad that it's insane.\n\nI would also suggest you read up on general writing terminology because that stuff gets thrown around a lot.\n\nI guess that's the basics? If anyone has any questions or wants to correct me, please do!",
