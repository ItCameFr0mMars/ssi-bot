I too have been hankering for a Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk story lately, in particular Shadowrun has been calling my name. Though I am open to suggestions on that front. Really all I'm looking for is a competent, well versed partner, and you certainly seem to fit those characteristics. If you're interested I'd be more than happy to take things into a PM so I can tell you more about myself and start discussing ideas.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

My favorite era is undoubtedly, \"The Clone Wars\", however I'm up for just about any time period in that universe. So, let me know if you want to take this to PM.
