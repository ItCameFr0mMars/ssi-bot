Specifically thinking of combining the beauty and the beast style plot line with a pot pirate ship/pirates of the Caribbean style plot.\n\nI prefer to write male characters, so we'll have no problems there.  Right off the bat I'm going to say that I work a regular 9-4pm job with weekends off, so I'm only around in the evenings or the weekend. I prefer an rp style that's more passive (what I call it) where I'll do a reply and it might take you a day or two to reply and then I'll reply when I get a chance. Not too long if I can help it, but sometimes I don't have the muse to write.  This has been a deal breaker before and I want to put it out there before we start bouncing ideas around.\n\nBut if this works out with you, I'd love to start throwing ideas around. I have the most experience rping on Tumblr or Discord, so we could migrate there, or I'm willing to use a different app or email. Just let me know.",
