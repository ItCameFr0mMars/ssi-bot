If they don't like it than they're not worth your time. I've been roleplaying since middle and high school, but I managed to find a very good friend who I roleplay with religiously everyday, where we be shared ideas and have even made worlds together for our characters.

Don't limit yourself to what you want to do - seek out groups who share a common interest and I guarantee you that you'll find a friend or friends like I have. They're out there, just keep looking.",

I started out on GaiaOnline (well there goes my age showing) and someone there taught me to roleplay \"properly\" (no asterisk, multi-para posts, adding detail, etc.). From there I moved to smaller forums and really developed my skills. Now it's hard to find someone willing to truly invest. I, somehow, magically do have 2 partners on Discord who are cool as hell and do write multi-para but Ive also had many more who just talk OoC, plan, and then never reply to my posts and never say another word to me. It's a little disheartening.\n\nI'm also guilty of ghosting but I'm trying to get better at explaining when I'm upset about something or I'm just lacking interest in the story. \n\nIt's also rather hard to find people who aren't just in it for the smut. Like smut is cool and all but dude(tte), I want a story with some substance. I dont want just smut all the fraking time. /EndRant",

From there I wanted to push myself and just found it easy to post quickly and in detail..letting the creative flow take over. \n\nI don't however see that attitude today usually. No one really wants to push themselves or be challenged. /shrug \n\nThat's awesome you've got some good partners luckily. I rekindled with some old ones but life got in the way for them so things barely got off the ground maybe to what one would consider chapter 5 in an epic novel series lol. I do come back every now and then to usual haunts and try looking for new partners sharing similar desires interests..think last time I found someone new that was decent and a match was maybe 6-7 years ago? xD\n\nYes- I like balance of good story, character building and development, smut etc...when all of these things are done well it's really something else. Like a good book...\n\n(It's really difficult to not sound ranty in posts like these isn't it?) xD\n\n-LF\n",

Gone are the days I could come home from school or work and look forward to RPing with someone.

The board moved really quickly, and while most threads only lasted a single night, many of them were unforgettable. Posts consisted of 1-2 well-written paragraphs with an emphasis on interaction and characterization (depending on the partners, obviously, but it was pretty easy to sort out who was a good fit for you). As a result you'd have these short-term RPs that felt totally complete by the end, kind of like sitting down to watch a movie where you and your friends are the writers. Then it would be over and the following night you'd do it all again.\n\nI made a lot of really great friends in those days, some of whom I'm still in touch with.\n\nThen the switch to long-form RP happened. Not a problem at all, except there was this huge emphasis on writing long-winded posts that didn't go anywhere. Everyone was suddenly so neurotic about post length and 'quality' and if you weren't trying to one-up your partners at every turn, then you weren't worth their time. I remember hating sites like Twilight Sky/December Romance for this reason.\n\nTen years later and I'm still afraid to get back into the fray. I subbed because I'd like to try, but truth be told this is the first post I've ever made here.\n\ntl;dr: Roleplaying used to be a fun, shared experience, but now everyone's got these impossible standards and it's totally killed it for me. Feels more like dating (with all the same stresses).\n\n",

Roleplaying is like dating in a way, and finding someone who is a match is difficult. I would even say that your pool of potential roleplayers is bigger than it was back then (it is for me! I feel so old!) so you might have to sift through more mismatches until you find someone. Maybe the community *is* affected, simply by being bigger. There\u2019s more opinions as to what a good roleplay looks like, and it\u2019s rare to match up perfectly now.\n\nI\u2019m rooting for you to find your match! Somebody\u2019s out there who\u2019ll appreciate you for you. Use the bad ones as learning opportunities to know more about yourself: what you want, and where you can compromise. Going forward, be explicit in both in your ads (if you aren\u2019t already) and it\u2019ll help you narrow it down. Good luck!",
