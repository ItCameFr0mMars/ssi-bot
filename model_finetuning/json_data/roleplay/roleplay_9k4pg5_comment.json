            "body": "I\u2019m quite experienced in the field of role playing, and writing in general despite only recently been on Reddit. I\u2019d understand if my lack of experience with this specific site is an issue, although I personally hope it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve been looking around for people to make similar superpower-themed role plays with and have found it to be quite difficult since navigation on this site is fairly different than with other sites I\u2019ve roleplayed on. I can write with just about any style you prefer, but my absolute favorite is crack ideas taken seriously. The specific prompt I\u2019ve been thinking of takes place in a classic world of superheroes. The government in this world has set up a secret organization that recruits the flunk outs from the League of Heroes because the general populace overlooks them as losers, and trains them to be able to take down threats too large for the main heroes to handle. The character\u2019s I\u2019ve pictured all have limited, flawed, or overly specific powers. For instance, someone might have the ability to talk to plants, but they don\u2019t have to necessarily do what she says. Other characters might have laser-pointer vision, a frequently malfunctioning ability to walk through walls, powers that let him turn the floor about one foot deep if chocolate pudding, etc. One specific character I had in mind would have the ability to make anyone he wants chase him with violent intent. I understand if this specific prompt isn\u2019t up to your standards, but appreciate the opportunity none the less. Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing your response later.",
