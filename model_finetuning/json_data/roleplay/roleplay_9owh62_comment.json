I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m late!\u201d John chuckled with a tight, lopsided grin, dropping down into the seat across from Jane as he tore his coat off. \u2018\n\n^ post from another person\n\nsome people write as little as that and bounce back and forth, some write multiple paragraphs, but generally it\u2019s working together to construct one story that can go however you please. hopefully this was helpful lol \n\nedit: i do mostly long-term, ongoing rps that take place over a long period of time just for some context with the way i tend to set things up :)",

            "body": "Hi! I\u2019ve been role playing for 5 years and when I first started I honestly had a lot of the same questions as you! For background, I began role playing on Omegle and Gmail but have since transitioned to tumblr.\n\nWhen you first begin a thread, one partner (out of the two of you) will likely start the rp with a prompt. This can be long or short. The prompt may have a little bit of backstory or it may not, it really depends on what kind of story the thread is going to have! Most prompts will have a character (most of the time the person writing the prompts character) performing some kind of action. It\u2019s very possible for this character to accidentally bump into your character while walking down the street, or for this character to say something to yours. Either way, the prompt is going to have *something* for *your* character to react to! Your characters reaction is going to be what you write in response to a prompt.\n\nIt is also possible for you and your partner to discuss together what kind of story the thread is going to have/what kind of interaction the two characters are going to have before a prompt is even written. This is called plotting! There may be  A LOT of plotting between you and your partner, but there also may not.\n\nEvery rp is going to be different, such as every prompt. A prompt (I like to call it a starter!) will usually establish the idea of a story. A good starter will include everything you need to know for your reply. Ex:\n\n1) do these characters already know each other? If so, what is their relationship?\n2) what are these characters doing/talking about? What has led them to this moment of them doing/talking about this thing?\n3) where is it taking place? Are they in someone\u2019s house, outside, at a store? Is it night or day?\n4) for period rps, a prompt should explain the era. Is it during the 1950s? Is it modern times? Maybe it\u2019s a Victorian era and the characters are jumping into a horse drawn carriage. \n\nThese details are what makes a prompt! \n\nAfter the prompt and the other persons reply, the story continues from there. You write your reply, then your partner writes their reply. It goes back and forth! There can be time skips and so on.\n\nA good reply will have something that your partner can respond to. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT, if you don\u2019t leave your reply open ended, there is going to be no path for your partner to reply to, and it\u2019s going to suck. DO NOT reply with \u201cshe smiled and giggled.\u201d Instead, write something that the other character is going to be able to react to. \u201cShe smiled, giggled, and pinched his arm.\u201d\n\nWhen I first started, I also questioned on how to *end* an rp. How do I know when it\u2019s over? Well, that\u2019s easy actually! An rp can end any of these ways.\n\n1) the story meets its end! An example would be if one character is dying from cancer and the whole thread was building up to this moment and the character finally dies, that\u2019d be a wonderful ending to a story! Like a movie :) by that point, wrap it up and thank your rp partner for writing with you! See if they want to start a new thread with you.\n\n2) the two of you get bored of the rp. At this point, express to your partner that you aren\u2019t feeling the thread anymore and maybe the two of you could start something new\n\n3) one of you stops replying. This one sucks, especially when it\u2019s the other person who stops replying when you were really into the story! DO NOT harass this other person, though, if they don\u2019t want to reply anymore, the rp is over\n\nI hope this is helpful! If you have more questions ask away :)",
