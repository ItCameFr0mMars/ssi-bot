I am sorry if this comes off as defensive, but I feel like you're accusing me of something for wanting to write female characters. I'm not sure what but your comment just rubbed me the wrong way. Yes, I am indeed a male writer who prefers to write female characters. I am also an individual who likes to dress up and wear make up some days. Writing female characters is an outlet for me regarding that. How exactly is a male playing female characters any different from females playing males? You're not the first person to judge me for this. (I really do hope your comment was for clarification and not for judgement though.) I am not my characters, I am not here to sexualize my characters either, I am a writer who happen to be looking for a story for my female character. I see a lot of females in this community demanding m/m ships but that is fine, right? Because females don't sexualize men, right? Wrong. They do and there are a lot of examples out there. If you like to explore gay ships and you happen to be a female, good for you. Don't sexualize it though. I am aware that a lot of male writers are called out right off the bat for playing female characters in this community. And you know what? I am gay in real life.",

I don\u2019t have any issues with it. I don\u2019t care. I was just checking if it was truly what you were looking for since they were in two totally different paragraphs.
