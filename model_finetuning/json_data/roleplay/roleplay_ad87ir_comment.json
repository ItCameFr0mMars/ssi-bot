I've dabbled with it every so often however never was immersed in a world. But, I do love creative writing and write often. Although, everything I write is not in the world of RP. I would be interested in exploring the creativity and experience that can come with it. \n\nLove slice of life and romance. Also, the idea of portraying characters with mental illnesses is something I would be doing as well. Open to playing anytype of role. \n\nThanks! Let me know if you're interested. ",
