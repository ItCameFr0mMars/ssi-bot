            "body": "Hello there.\n\nI think we may share the same interests. I am a scifi fan as well. I read a lot of books, have a vast collection of sci-fi/horror movies. A large gaming collection. I often play RPG oriented video games. I have been looking for a long term roleplay partner as well. While there would be a fair amount of contact during the weekend, I am also hoping to connect with someone that can speak with during the week. \n\nI wanted to highlight two of your quotes;\n\n\" As a preference, not a requirement, I would very much enjoy a partner who is not only comfortable with, but actively enjoys NSFW elements and themes. In fact, I would be quite open to having this be a primarily NSFW RP, provided that we could interweave plenty of plot and actual character development. A blend of NSFW and story-depth is difficult, but when it happens, it can be exceedingly fun. \"\n\n \"Be LGBTQ friendly. I would actually prefer LGBTQ themes to be present the story if possible and the central romance itself to be such. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is exactly what I am looking for and I am hoping you and I can connect in order to craft something together. \n\nI recently had to separate from a long term relationship (however we still remain friends). One of the tings that we did together for many years was write stories together, create art and roleplay characters within those stories. Most of these stories were focused within adventure fantasy worlds similar to D&amp;D but were very much our own creation and is of a very adult nature that can be both romantic but can also involve something more rough or be  perverse at times. I spent the last three years working on a very ambitious roleplay project within a very detailed world with a host of well developed characters and a in-depth story line.  Only one problem. I no longer have anyone to share it with. It has been difficult to find a person to share this with among the regular gaming crowd because it is more story focused with the game system really being more of a medium to tell a story and most people within that culture are not looking for something like that. It would be my preference that this be a experience between just you and me. I am not looking to form a group. If you think you would be interested and we can get to know each other. ",
