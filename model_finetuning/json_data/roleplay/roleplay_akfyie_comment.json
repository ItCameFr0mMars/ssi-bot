I have done everything from Larp, tabletop and text role-play of course. \n\nI consider myself a literate role-player and will always do my best to match my partners reply length.\n\nRomance is one of my favorite role-play subjects and am very much into slow burn romance role-play and okay with NSFW topics. I would be very interested in doing some Alt history role-play or Bodyguard X Principal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested in roleplaying with me feel free to PM me so we can chat !\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
