            "body": "This is a story I can get behind! I have multiple pokemon Ocs, and I'll leave a short description of all of them. Keep in mind, *I do not mind making more or resetting characters to their base values.* Most of these characters have already had a journey and/or plot line previously, so if it doesn't feel right to have them halfway or finished with their journey already, feel free to ask me to change that. Green Crystal is one of my most used, if you don't mind the fact her story came from pokemon scientist experimentation gone wrong. Her story is she was fused with a latias, and her creator was killed by the other more power hungry experiments they had created. She's got a good heart, doesn't crack under pressure, but even the sight of a needle or lab coat will send her scrambling away in fear. Her pokemon can be up to your choice, as everytime she's been recreated in a new rp, she's had different pokemon. Second we have Artemis Soule, she had come from Alola with her Absol, the only thing left of someone she held dear. She acts snobby at times, and she can be cold to people she doesn't know, but really she just hasn't gotten over the loss she witnessed back in Alola with her rival's death to the Ultra Beasts, and doesn't want to get close since she worries it will happen again. She blames herself for everything that goes wrong, even if out of her reach, and does her absolute best to hide her emotions. Lastly for the listed, Virsai Chiran, his past his hidden just as much as he hides in the shadows, waiting to be overlooked. He doesn't like being the center of attention, and his attitude throws many off before they can get to know his softer side. He hates being asked about himself, his short temper has left him considered a \"loner\" to many, and he pretends he never had a past. His houndour was a gift from his eldest brother, and he has treasured Dusk ever since his brother went missing years ago. Even now he still searches for any sign of him, despite his brother being gone for over twelve years now, showing how he still tries to cling to any hope that he is still alive somewhere. If you want any others listed, ask about Zeta (Male), Lyra (Female), Alex (Male), or ask for me to make an entirely new character. I do not mind being multiple characters either, so you can choose multiple trainers.",
