Maybe if I'm in a group as a GM and it's spun differently...but I dislike when someone has a plot or world already built and expects me (in a 1x1) to work with it. It makes me feel like I can't contribute or if I comment on an issue, one might take it personally. If I can develop a plot and world with someone, that's great. We're both coming up with new ideas instead of one trying to feed the other lore and things that may not really matter in a more contained situation. ",

You have set out an elaborate plan, filled with racial interactions and small nuances like \"wait you are hiring, an elf? You know they don't do heavy lifting right?\"\n\nThe stinginess is normal, but that doesn't mean you should hide your world from rpers. Sure you'd have to correct them, but bealive it or not, rpers are actually pretty adaptable.\n\nConsider this world that I have called 'creata'. We have many races, and each race has an specific way of life and shit. At the same time, I've left it open to interpretation by adding two words \n\n\"exceptions exsist\"\n\n This has allowed me to go from correcting to \"well they don't normally work that way\". So that's on my side I guess.\n\n",
