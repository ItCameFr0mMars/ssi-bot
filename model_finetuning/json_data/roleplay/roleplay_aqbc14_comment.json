            "body": "You know, I'd never considered this but you're right! I think it deserves a more creative explanation than just 'death energy!'\n\nHere's an idea just hammered out, feel free to borrow steal remix or reject:\n\nAll 'life' energy is basically just an organism operating as intended. Muscles and even thoughts are just the results of normal biological processes. Food is broken down, nutrients and water absorbed, cells split and move as designed. \n\nDeath energy, on the other hand, is a fuel that allows these processes to operate cut off from their usual fuel source. It works much elemental energy for fire, in the sense that it requires a medium and will dissipate quickly without one. It'll allow cells and organic matter to work *without* the usual processes, and since direct energy is a path of less resistance than indirect energy through metabolism, the matter in question will quickly adapt to work off of only necrotic energy. It's why you can't un-zombie someone, they've been altered at a cellular level. But it also is why creatures who are already dead are better vessels because no natural processes to overcome means less energy required to get them functioning differently. Just takes a bit of a kickstart. \n\nThe energy itself functions much like radiation. Small doses are fine, as long as it's not enough to overpower the natural processes or doesn't affect enough cells to not be simply processed out via normal healing. But large concentrations will overpower the living system, basically killing the creature cell by cell until it's been completely converted to run on death energy alone. All the unconscious and involuntary functions of the body will continue, everything from breathing to balance, but the conscious functions like thought and speech are not. Only the most basic, feral functions which are hard-wired and not software (memory or culture) based will continue.\n\nHow do necromancers control their minions? By putting signals in the energy flow. It works more akin to the old infrared remotes than anything like Bluetooth, utilizing 'pulses' of energy to communicate basic commands. However, but its line-of-sight nature there is a hard limit to how much can be communicated, so while a skilled necromancer could command a group of undead effectively it'd be impractical for any advanced tactic or group above a certain size (since they'd all get only the same basic command at once if they were in range).\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It would solve the signal problem to be sure! It would also give some nice legendary items that might be one of a kind and exceptionally strong, even to the point of overpowering other necromancer's signals.\n\nNext question is this: is death just another element? Is it naturally occurring like a mineral or is it something that can be charged? Like would crystals under a particularly bloody battlefield lead to a death 'mine' of sorts, or is it something just peppered about but it's seldom harvested because, yanno, it'd be surrounded by savage undead wildlife?",

Perhaps that death energy, while sinister, is much more natural. Death is, after all, a part of the circle of life. I\u2019d say, It doesn\u2019t taint the earth, but it will linger. Perhaps not literally staining the fauna and twisted the environment but, rather, tainting the aura of the area? On the other hand, necrotic death energy it\u2019s malevolent, it\u2019s unnatural. Just as it is corrupted by ill-will does it corrupt and twist anything it touches \n\nI definitely feel like if we were at the site of say a field where countless battles had been fought over the years, There would be an abundance of natural death energy lingering about. This is fine, it may even help people with more wholesome intentions interact with the spiritual world more easily. \n\nHowever, for a necromancer, this giant field of lingering death energy is like a massive amplifier for his powers. Let\u2019s say he now chooses to build a tower in this field, then amass insane amounts of necrotic energy, raising the countless dead beneath his feet from the earth, and swelling immensely in power as he just hangs around this area that\u2019s doing nothing but bolstering his necrotic powers.

Just as it is corrupted by ill-will does it corrupt and twist anything it touches.\n\nYes! Exactly like radiation, if you think about it. Necrotic energy is just what is released upon a living thing being killed suddenly as opposed to withering slowly. It would certainly irradiate areas where there was a lot of very quick and violent deaths, and it would be the ideal place to build a tower since there's no living energy that would be naturally draining the necrotic energy.\n\nHoly bat goodness. *Life is an unstable isotope!*\n\nIt's a twisted yet totally reasonable position for a necromancer to think! The energy itself is corrupting by nature, so eventually a necromancer would be completely consumed mind, body, and spirit. Once that happens, they are so attuned with death and its energy that the living world must look like just fields of powderkegs! Yes, it's rooted in a compulsion to absorb more energy (since it is essentially food for their now-necrotic form) but also it might be justified in their minds that they are taking the pressure off the ticking time bombs that are the living!\n\nWow, this is getting interesting!\n\nSo is any of this working for your OC?
