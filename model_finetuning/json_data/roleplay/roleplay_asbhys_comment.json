Wording it this way makes it clear for them that you're not nagging them for a post, just wanting to know if you have to move on. \n\nGood luck!",

No. As a random person talking to a random person, it would be insanely rude to say \"Hey, you suck at talking... so I suddenly have zero interest in having a conversation with you.\" Nor am I required to say \"Hey, if this is going to work between us I need something more.\" I literally just met you.
