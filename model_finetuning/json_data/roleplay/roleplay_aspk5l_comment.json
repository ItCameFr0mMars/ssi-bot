It's easy to have multiple emails going either for OOC content or RP(s), much the same as Discord lets you set up different rooms.\n\nUnfortunately, there aren't really any other venues I prefer as I have gotten rid of them and don't want to try and make new accounts for them.  \nAs I said, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, and if you're not okay with it I completely understand. :D",
