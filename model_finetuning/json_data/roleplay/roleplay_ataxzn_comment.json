There's the inevitable dip in enthusiasm that can occur as soon as there is a pause from the initial connection and design discussions. And if you have a bunch of plans in your head that are suddenly rendered void by your enthusiastic partner's idea, you might encounter some resistance or a corresponding lack of enthusiasm.  \n\nCommunication via text is a challenge and even if you're certain that you're being clear your communication can be misinterpreted. In addition, if I'm feeling cranky and I read an ambiguous message then I might see it as more negative. It can go the other way, too.\n\nCommunication is key and if you discover that you can't communicate in a way that works for you then it makes sense to either address it and work on that or to take a break from the story for a while (or forever).\n\nBoundaries are key, too. If you're writing something with nsfw content then you want to be certain that everybody knows that this is about the characters and not about each other.  There are other subreddits for that type of collaboration.\n\nGood luck, have fun and keep writing!",

It's so bizarre sometimes, but the most common thing that keeps happening to me is this:\n\nMy partner has characters that are AMAZING, they have cool personalities and our characters have this amazing chemistry.\n\nBuuut the person roleplaying them has a personality equivalent to a squished raisin: they are weird, the misunderstand everything you say to them and don't seem to have any chill. It's not that big of a deal, but it's still strange when IC they are witty and their character is so much more enjoyable than they themselves. I get that we are not roleplaying ourselves, but it's weird to have such a dissonance between the player and their character. \n\nI had this incredible partner that I had to drop because they were impossible to deal with. They misunderstood every single thing I said to them, plotting with them was borderline impossible. Once they got in character things changed so much. I'm still sad about losing this partner, but I just didn't have the energy to deal with their constant breakdowns over something I said and they completely misunderstood that.",
