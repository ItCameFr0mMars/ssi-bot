She found me on [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net), complimented my stories and we roleplayed for over 10 years.  Unfortunately, she doesn't have time in her life anymore but I've missed it so.  My roleplay was Erik from Phantom of the Opera.  However, I also played a female love interest for him.  I adore writing and I can describe scenes as well as inter-character dialogue. Please let me know if you aren't \n\ninterested.  Thank you.",

We used to sit up and talk about our characters for hours while asking each other \"what ifs\" and gawking at couples that reminded us of them in public. Since we parted ways, I have honestly missed that so much. Despite being female, I have never really played the female in a heterosexual relationship, and don't know that I would be any good at that. A part of me really wants to reach out to this to give it a shot, but I would hate to disappoint you because this is truly a beautiful concept that I admire so greatly. Good luck to you, though! I'm definitely jealous in all of the best ways. (: ",
