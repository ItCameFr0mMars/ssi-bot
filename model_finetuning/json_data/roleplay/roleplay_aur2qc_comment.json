Forums are a bit more static and preserve long-form content better. I like the structure of forums, where each plot between characters gets its own thread in a subform, and they can be read back over. I like plotter threads and character pages and the forum and sub-forum structure. I can't enjoy or understand RPing on discord because it's more fast-paced and harder to go back and read things over, there's too much chaos; it's a platform designed for quick-fire, real-time chatting and that doesn't suit my RPing style. I know that most RPing has shifted over to discord-like platforms in the past few years, and I've tried multiple times to make the switch, but it just doesn't work for me. It's a hobby I've been obsessed with for almost 2 decades now and I've weathered every shift, but I'm stuck as a luddite in this regard. ",
