Eventually people stop bothering to report them because they see it goes nowhere and only ends up with the one who did the reporting being called drama and toxic. \n\nI only ever do solo rp these days, except for one of my voice table top games, where we use text rp to cover downtime between sessions. It's a very small group of people though, so it's a lot easier to smack down the problems when they start to crop up, and everyone gets pretty equal punishment because if one person ends up leaving, it can screw up everyone's enjoyment and story.

I spend about 90% of my time on my phone roleplaying rather than on my PC (even though I'll admit it's WAY easier to type a long, drawn out post on my PC).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother reason why forums are annoying is they often have a post length requirement. If I can sufficiently say what I want to say in 1-3 paragraphs, why should I have to stretch it to 5-6 paragraphs? Extra fluff makes the roleplay go slower and becomes bothersome to sift through for the actual meaning of the post. You get what I'm saying?",

            "body": "Weirdly enough, the other day I posted an ad for my forum RP and someone posted asking why it wasn't on discord and suggesting that discord would be better for a variety of reasons...which seemed to me like me saying \"I have opened a pizza restaurant!\" and someone saying \"why not a taco truck? trucks can drive, and I like tacos!\"\n\nForums are just a totally different feel, style, and format of game. I love them, it's what I've played on for almost two decades, and I enjoy them more than any other format. I've stuck with the hobby through a whole bunch of \"eras\" - I remember way back before \"faceclaims\" were a thing; I remember when jcink arrived on the scene; I remember the dark days when every forum had massive royal family trees you had to navigate to create a character with the correct age and history. Hell, I work in tech writing these days and all the CSS/HTML I learned in this hobby has been a major career boost.\n\nIt goes up and down, but I have seen it decline sharply in popularity in the last 5 or so years. Here is what I've seen:\n\n  \n1.) Forum RPing can have a high barrier to entry - the look, feel, rules, etc. are unusual to a lot of people. The vast majority of people I know who do forum RPing have been doing it for years and years - ever since it was The Main Way To Roleplay, and we were middle schoolers with pliable brains and tons of free time. It's rare to see a total newcomer jump into forum RPing. So now the forum diehards are in our 20s and 30s and falling out of lifestyles where we had hours to dedicate to this hobby every day, and no one is picking up the standard behind us. If a hobby isn't really picking up droves of newcomers, and it's slowly losing old-timers, it's just going to be less popular. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) Discord-style RPing has, in contrast, a much lower barrier to entry. You don't have to spend hours finding the right photos for your faceclaim, setting up your \"mini profile,\" there's no \"lore section\" with sub-folders of overwhelming text, etc. The user interface of discord is a lot more intuitive to a tech user in 2019 than a jcink forum. And the style of writing is quicker, more casual, and feels less intimidating. So new people picking up the hobby are going to be drawn toward discord. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.) Tabletop, real-time, conversational styles of roleplay have gotten HUGE in the past few years, with popular podcasts and a resurgence of interest in D&amp;D type games. I've seen a lot of people get into discord RPing because it does a better job replicating that kind of roleplaying. If a main entry point to RPing is D&amp;D, and people are using discord for it, then the styles of RPing that discord supports are going to be more popular. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4.) It is more mobile friendly - again, it appeals to the newer crop of people, which tend to be younger and have more time to be dedicated and passionate. Forum RPing is not mobile friendly at all, and when it was in its heyday, that didn't matter - there was no such thing as mobile. Now, people want things they can do from their phones, and longer form, slower paced forum RPs don't work that way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut neither one is better or worse; they're just different. We forum folks might prefer the more in-depth, slower pace; the close-knit community; the aesthetic flourishes. Doesn't mean we're right, we just like to sit down and have a slice of pizza. It is frustrating that there used to be a huge glut of forums out there and I could find a handful with great communities and cool worlds; now it's much harder to find a functional, active forum in a genre I enjoy - but I can't begrudge the fact that my hobby isn't as popular as it used to be; it's just the way things have gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, and shameless plug - I run a post-apocalyptic forum if you wanna check it out.

Pixel Perfect is a great animanga resource site, but it doesn't have the vast pull of 'literally every admin is on this site' that PB Support/RPG-D did in their prime and quite frankly a lot of people aren't going to do the hassle of doing the whole topsites and searching through random advertising boards in order to find a good site that isn't well advertised anymore. They have better things to do, and I don't blame them.\n\nIt used to be as easy as firing up one site as your one stop shop for your platform of choice forum wise, but our community fell apart and a significant chunk moved onto Tumblr before Discord got popular and now to Discord for the exact reasons you stated. Lower barrier of entry, less intimidating, less work to get up and running. Coding is terrifying and lots of people want everything to look perfect before launching a forum, but perfection is never there and people feel like the site has to look like the Mona Lisa or something for people to join and just never end up launching.",
