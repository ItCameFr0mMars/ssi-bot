            "body": "Agreed. However, it can be tiring to be writing up a fresh ad every day. And if you find a partner with a post one day, why not try the same one again?\n\nAnd I also agree that there is a difference between someone expressing an idea in their post vs a generic call for all \"fantasy/zombie/superhero/modern\" themes.\n\nWhat I do is make use of the user tags. I read a prompt and see if the OP and I will be compatible or not. If not I tag the user as \"Unlikely Match\".  If I think there could be a match I tag the user as \"Maybe\". Then, later, I can find the users that I tagged \"Maybe\" and see if they are active and see if they might want to RP.\n\nI also love these discussion type posts because I get to see a little more of the personality of the user. I've found partners based on what they posted in comments and reached out that way. I've had much more success starting conversations that way than by posting an ad, actually.",

Though, I do get my hopes up on the first person to send me a message and have that hope crushed when they ghost me when the first post is made. \n\nGeneric can be OK at times just to throw something out there but I also kind of try to figure out through the post if someone is willing to come up with an idea. There's no science to it but its fun when both players are coming up with ideas. \n\nThat's not a bad idea. All those original inquiries from others could just be duds. I honestly have never had so much difficulty trying to find partners until I came to reddit. \n\nTrue. And you also know that someone out there isn't a robot that wants to roleplay just as something to do in their five minutes of freetime for the week, IF they feel like it. I'm not one who requires constant ooc chat but it's nice to know if I bring up something it's not going to be read by blind eyes. I love these discussions because it's the only time I/everyone gets to rant about the common issues in roleplaying. Some people just want to have a good time but I feel like there are people out there being trolls on purpose but I could be over thinking it. ",

I like to think I am, lol. I really enjoy more than just sext (or how the act of sex is called in role-playing), but my fandom always goes for that and it has become a very annoying must for some. Kind of how those rules of the paragraph before worked lol: No one says it, but it's expected.   \n\n\nThaaat said, I'm here.

I used to be the 1-on-1 type however with so many having ghosted me, it's just better to be apart of a multi-writer project in case someone leaves, so things can continue to develop or I can find others to fill the roleplaying gap if a friend needs to take a break. I'm not sure if you specified whether you were apart of a community or not in which this is happening, but there are many active roleplays around where it's unlikely person after person would abruptly leave you (though...it can still happen).
