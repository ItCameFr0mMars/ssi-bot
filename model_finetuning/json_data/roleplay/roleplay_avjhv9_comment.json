It\u2019s just life is a real thing. \n\nThere would be weekends, or holidays that I would feel great. Plenty of sleep, plenty of downtime. My mind would start ramping up and I\u2019d start wondering why I haven\u2019t roleplayed in a while and start hunting up a way to do it. I usually end up on reddit reading through RP wanted posts and find someone who sounds like a match, and after a day or so of working out details we go to work.\n\nThen my life goes back to normal. \n\nI stroll in from work and see that the other person has posted.....think to myself \u201cMan I\u2019m to tired to think....I\u2019ll reply in the morning.\u201d Then \u201cI shouldn\u2019t do this at work....I\u2019ll reply tonight when I\u2019m free.\u201d \nRepeat cycle until I realize it\u2019s been several days and I just give up.\n\nThis is also why I don\u2019t really seek out roleplay on this sub anymore. I recognized my own pattern and realized it wasn\u2019t fair to the other parties no matter how busy, or exhausted I was.\n\nBut really I just wanna tell the story of the other side. Sometimes life just happens for people.\n\nI\u2019ve ghosted and I\u2019ve been ghosted. That\u2019s why I prefer roleplay in Discord, or other live chat settings rather than forums and email. Having the other person respond in time leads to better RP imo.\n\n",
