There are a lot of 'resource' sites dedicated to Jcink/PB roleplays, that have codes and guides on forum roleplaying, as well as forum directories. Places like Caution to the Wind, A Thousand Fireflies, Shadowplay, they're all Jcink resource forums. You'll also find a whole bunch of Tumblr directories dedicated to Jcink/PB roleplay, such as All Things Roleplay, Jcink Tinder, RPG Adverts, Jcink Adverts, etc. Forum roleplay is mostly geared toward groups, by the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also find that Tumblr is a pretty decent places to find RP buddies, mostly for 1x1's. The community is kind of hit or miss, especially as most users tend to be on the younger side, but I've found some great RP friends through it. Most 1x1's will be done through Discord, Google Docs, or email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you'd like links, especially pertaining to all that Jcink stuff I mentioned, send me a message and I'll throw some things your way.",
