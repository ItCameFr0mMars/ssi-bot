These posts also use very different levels of language.\n\nThat said, your words, \"people need to chill\" are slightly inconsiderate. I firmly believe everybody has the right to look for whatever they want, whether it's perfectly written, very long posts or a quick one-liner session on Kik. \n\nKeep in mind that *both* parties are looking to get something out of a RP and the closer their preferences and levels are, the happier they will both be.\n\nI have been roleplaying on Reddit and elsewhere for a decade now and in my experience, when you find good partners, you agree on the standards of writing and when you don't agree on the standards of writing, it's a good idea to search for new partners. Not because you're \"good\" or \"bad\", not because your partner is \"good\" or \"bad\" - you're just a poor match. ",

            "body": "It's always been that way, actually. I remember seeing similar lists of demands on Furcadia descriptions and Yahoo RP groups. Even on old Anglefire pages for groups in AOL chat rooms. Yes, I am old as hell.\n\nI agree with others here that everyone is free to set the boundaries of their expectations and some do want to separate themselves from the net speak, single-line, one-shot RPs that others are looking for. But I also agree that some people are creating a very unbalanced dynamic with their demands. It makes it seem like *you* should be working harder to please *them* if you wish for the pleasure of their collaboration. I'm sure many would scoff if you replied with a similarly rigid set of demands that they had to satisfy.\n\nPersonally I have found that the people who post those ads are absolutely the minority. They just appear to be more common because they seem to post more frequently (as I'm sure they get few takers to endure their rigid screening process) or spam several RP channels at once. There are still many who choose instead to post RP samples or original story hooks that demonstrate the kind of standards they are expecting, or those who are DM friendly in communities where you can see how they tell their stories firsthand. Most of my favorite stories came from me reaching out to people who posted samples and ideas right here on Reddit RP subs! ",

Challenging yourself to write with better roleplayers and take the comments as constructive criticism, rather than elitism, worked wonders for me and eventually became the standard. To this day, 11 years later, I'm still learning and looking to find better writers. As long as someone respects you, is patient with you, teaches you without belittling you I say keep pushing yourself. \n\n\n",

It is is no way \"elitist\" for a person to state the degree to which they write, and  what they expect in a similar level of writing.  There is also no such thing as baseline \"simple replies\" as replying (to any degree) is entirely based on the writer itself. Some writers will say a simple reply consists of few sentences, while others may think a paragraph or two is a simple reply.  It's all subjective to the level of writer.   \n\n\nRP isn't anyone's safe space either, people get frustrated, ghosted, creeped out and the list goes on in interacting with different types of writers looking for their ideal partners. It's a mixed bag out here and to be honest, and most writers will usually start off their posts by outlining what expect right off the bat, so if you don't see someone's specifics listed out when engaging to begin writing try asking them is they are in \"in depth\" writer or looking for some casual rp so neither party becomes frustrated at each other.   \n\n\nI would also discourage telling any writer to \"chill\" on the levels they hold themselves to in their writing as a lot of RPer's use RP to practice, polish or even advance their writing skills they have been working at for years. I consider paragraph levels of RP \"Fun\", so again it's all subjective.  Some roleplayers consider writing a hobby, others consider it a passion and profession.   \n\n\nIf you are truly looking to improve your writing skills, I would say you should try listening to some of the more advanced writers giving you tips and suggestions rather than try to force the practice into a limited field of \"simplicity.\"   It sounds as though you were just looking for some casual and light rp so I would suggest finding someone at your level and going from there.

It's a story, not a thesis.\n\nThat said, I've never seen anyone be quite that demanding. I feel like you should at least make an effort to *try* and match your partner, because it's no fun getting back a sentence or two that you can barely reply to.\n\nI have ended up joining some servers where people aren't quite up to my standards, but I've still had enjoyable experiences roleplaying with them, and even seeing some of them noticably improve. I am an elitist ass, though. I keep a channel in my personal discord (usually used for notes) of the worst misspellings people have had in posts. Current winners are \"sheriad\" (charade) and \"ixruating\" (excruciating) . Also a post from someone who said \"I usually have desent spelling and desent gramer.\" I've roleplayed with literal twelve year olds that wrote better. I don't ask for samples anymore because it made me feel elitist, but maybe I should.",

If I post something like: \n\nJohn looked over at you/them (whatever your character name is) with a skeptical expression, rubbing the back of his head. \"Are you sure something like that will work?\" \n\nAnd you reply with just: \n\n\"Okay.\" Or \"Yes.\" With no additional detail like, at least your character's thoughts/feelings (even if its a simple: She was sure of the plan as she nodded, \"Yes.\" ) then you're not really giving me much to work with.
