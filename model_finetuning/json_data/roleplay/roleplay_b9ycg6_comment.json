I am looking to get back into it, and something a little more fluffy is right up my alley. If you are interested, maybe we could bounce a few samples off each other? I love writing romance, especially NSFW, but want to be sure we have good flow for it. Again, I haven't been able to write in a while, so keep that in mind. Let me know! :)",
