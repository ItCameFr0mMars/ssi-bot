I absolutely love the Victorian Era.\n From upper class englishman trying impress beautiful ladies in layers of frilly skirts or young gentleman about to get married to a preety damsel who he has never met before in his life to a street urchin taking unfair advantage of a lost girl from a respectable family or a mean attendant of the workhouse abusing its residents to a professional hangman about to hang a young woman who murdered her elderly abusive husband.\n\nOnly thing I prefer is a realistic victorian setting and detailed description of the layers of frilly skirts, tight corset, beautiful dresses and peeking petticoats of the ladies. Lol.\n\nI can RP in both genders or even crossdressers if necessary.\n\nWould like to hear from u soon.",
