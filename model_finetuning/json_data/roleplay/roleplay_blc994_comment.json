            "body": "Hey, a League of Legends or Overwatch RP sounds pretty neat and I enjoy playing both M and F canon characters (prefer them over OCs for these fandoms) - I don't have much free time as of late for rapid replies but if I'm invested, I make time to get replies in because the RP is interesting and entertaining. I do writing of my own and while I'm not creating novels, I like to think that I can hold my own when it comes to an RP. If you're into coming up with something for Overwatch or League or discussing any ideas, since you mention an AU for LoL in particular, let me know! It sounds like it'd be a lot of fun. Cheers!",
