            "body": "It is difficult to find people who you click with. This is a fact whether you have been RPing a few months, years or over a decade. You said that it's hard for you to get comfortable with someone. You already have a wall built up in that mindset alone. I would approach roleplaying as you would making a new friend. The first few messages (or even days of contact) are going to be both of you feeling the other out and seeing if your ideas and writing styles match up.\n\nInstead of worrying about getting comfortable, focus on the story and show your passions for it. There will be others who share the same goal and vision and in doing so, discussions will be a lot easier. Some people I find don't talk about their offline lives but others like that kind of OOC (out of character) connection. You'll have to figure out if you want someone you can chat with freely or someone who you'll just converse with about plot and leave personal tidbits aside.\n\nI think the people I find on this subreddit have ben fairly receptive and easy to talk to. Most people nowadays do like to relocate to places like Discord because of the ease of organization. You mention Amino which I don't know about but I assume if it's like kik, it might be more for quick, short posts? Another idea is to make sure you find someone who matches what you give. Whether it's a paragraph or ten paragraphs, you need to find the right place to RP that allows for that kind of writing.\n\nLastly. I would say to remember there is a lot of trail and error. I once had a great partner, he ended up controlling my character to which I politely asked him to stop. Then he ghosted me. I was pissed but a few hours later, over it. So you may connect with people but for some reason you will get ghosted. I've trained myself to just accept it in stride. \n\nMost of my advice is geared toward one on one but even as a GM for groups, I will advise you not to be intimated if you're joining a group already formed. Always be open and receptive but not to the point you sink your whole investment in one roleplay (group or one on one) since most don't have longevity. But I do believe when we do find the right partner, there is a bond there that can ensure a RP does have an ending. I wish you lots of luck in finding someone and to have fun and not get discouraged!",
