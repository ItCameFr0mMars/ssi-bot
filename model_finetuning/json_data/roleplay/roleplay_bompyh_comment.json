Find a someone to Rp with who understands that you might be a little rusty and who is willing to help. As far as making characters just start to write(or type) out what type of a role you want them to fill and make a background and personality to match. For me seeing examples of other people\u2019s characters is always really helpful so that I know just how in-depth I want them to be. If you are the same way then I would consider reading through other people\u2019s characters to get a feel for how in-depth you want your character.\nSorry if I\u2019m rambling, I wish you the best of luck in your future role playing efforts!",

Find something that you've a passion for that's fit for a story- be it a game, an idea, or just going to Apocalypse. As long as it's fit to play in the sandbox that roleplay tends to be. \n\nCharacters... depends on who you're with. How does relationships feel between you two, 18+ content if applicable, adult themes, or just some good fluff and fade to black. It's all on the table. Honestly, the biggest draw when it comes to characters to me is being unique and faulted. Every character needs a way to fail, really, and someone that's totally perfect isn't gonna fly. And finding a partner whose character can cover the faults of yours is the best. \n\nFor now, posting a few ads in here can do you well. Plenty should respond- I'll give you a tip and say don't be afraid to type. While a sizeable amount respond to nearly anything, I like to see a lot of text and engagement. As a generally para/novella writer, I like an impressive word count for both posts and responses.",
