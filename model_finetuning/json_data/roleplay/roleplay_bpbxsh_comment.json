            "body": "Hey :) I read your post and became curious about what idea you might have in mind. I had a mideval one in mind and another fantasy one but Im also down for way more realistic themes, dw. \n\n\n1. Your character would be a legendary pit fighter, and you catch the attention of the mercenary band leader that I follow. You\u2019re payed to fight in our lines, and I get demoted to squire (the guys that take care of knights horses etc) after an incident, even though Id much rather fight and make my money that way. Turns out Im assigned to you, and am not too happy about it. Neither are you, as you aren\u2019t used to having someone around all the time. \n\n2. You/or me have been genetically designed to have enhanced strength, healing capabilities, vision and a form of bloodlust that enhances their fighting capabilities. People like you/me have been implimented into the military and our every day lives, but are discriminated against nonetheless, mistrusted and avoided at all cost.",
