My personal favorite series is Star Trek, but Im also well aquainted with Mass Effect, Dead Space, Star Wars and a few other titles. \n(Im going to leave Anime sci-fi titles out of this for now because Im not sure how you feel about it, but just as a side note, Im into that stuff too.)\nI can write multi-paragraph relatively easily, and Ive received positive feedback across the board in the past. Feel free to DM me your discord if you're interested.",
