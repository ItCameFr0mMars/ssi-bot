This is doomed to fail. At this point, may be I want it to. Being called a whiney bitch by the owner - after I was given a last-warning and threatened to be muted, then banned then threatened to be muted again for standing up for myself (outwitting said mod by finishing his joke) whilst the mod everyone agreed was a complete utter shit saw no punitive measure - has left me feeling sour because !t seems as though a roleplay with potential came crashing down because of nepotism and complete lack of self-awareness.\n\nMods, for example, held several positions such as (forcing newer players to pick c-lister or custom characters):\n\nCo-owner is Deadpool, Spider-Man, Daredevil and Norman Osborn at the same time. But you don't get it, they're his favourites, so it's okay. And Deadpool's too OP for anyone else to play him (actual quotes).\n\nCaptain Steve Rogers as well as Captain Marvel.\n\nHawkeye as well as Loki, Danny Rand etc...\n\nIron Man as well as Wolverine, blah blah....\n\nAll people you'd want to play are already taken over by staff. They do not roleplay frequently, except for a couple of very goof fellows I met there.\n\nTake a hint, do not join.",
