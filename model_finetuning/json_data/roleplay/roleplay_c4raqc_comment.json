Hmmmm lemme try to make a sample:\n\nAs he walked through the crowd during the busy time of day in New York city, Azreal, who goes by the name of Haden, blended in with the crowd in his sharp suit along with his long black hair slicked back. This man had the appearance of what would be a young male model. Ladies adore him. Find him intriguing. As he got in with all the business people crowding the sidewalks to get to work the only thing that rare through his mind was \"who would fall next?\" Later on walking a block down the road, as he came around the corner, he slams into a woman knocking her back on the ground spilling her coffee all over her purse as he towered over her like a mountain. It was then he knew the answer. She was next to fall for him.\n\nNot an official chara but an example of my rp and creativity.",
