It is very suitable for all skill levels of role players, and accessibility doesn\u2019t stop there, letting you Roleplay as the same character in multiple different scenarios at the same time. The heavy amount of detail put into the Rift itself, with it\u2019s lore, characters, and locations is what got me into the Rift in the first place. If you were considering learning about this place, and even possibly joining, take my word, you won\u2019t regret it.",
