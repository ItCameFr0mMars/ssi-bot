I know you have multiple people already requesting to do this roleplay with you, but let me at least give you some suggestions that just randomly popped into my head reading your idea if you don't want to do the idea with me.\n\nI can already see a good story of a sprouting friendship or cute romance between maybe two guys to add to the quirk factor? Two girls, two guys, or just a male and female still works too, I can do any of those options. Anyway, so my character would perhaps have access to to a magical world, or at least know of all the myths and legends and believe in all of them unlike the other people of the village. Since they believe in fairies, elves, mermaids, all of that stuff, they eventually find those creatures and drag your character along on that adventure to show them the wonders of a world most don't believe in. In showing them this magical world, the two bond and either remain close friends or fall in love over the adventures. Perhaps as time goes on, they look for more dangerous myths so a little angst can be added, but overall it's just a really pure story of two people bonding over their interest in the supernatural, mythical world my character founded.\n\nMan, I seriously can't describe the picture in my head, but I just see two people running through the forest laughing and smiling happily as my character points out the fairies your character never quite noticed, or they see the brilliant scales of mermaids in the water, or hear the sweet singing of sirens, ride atop the backs of centaurs, and more. I see backpacks filled with supplies for the longer adventures and little patches being worked into the clothes torn on that tree branch the other day, and just two people standing against the world's opinion of them for dwelling too long in the forest, for believing in children's tales.\n\nAnyway, tell me if you're interested! Sorry for the long post, I just couldn't get the wild imagery out of my head.",
