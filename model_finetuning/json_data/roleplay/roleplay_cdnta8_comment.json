There are plenty of times where it's nothing more than simple back and forth dialogue with two characters and so things such as that can result in short one or two sentence responses as well as we welcome anyone with any experience of roleplaying.\n\nCombat is handled simply and explained in our info channel, but to make it short it's handled by the players. Rolling isn't a factor as it's too luck based and can result in very unrealistic outcomes. It's nothing more than simple turn-based combat that relies moreso on the realism of the scenario and trust that opposing member(s) will act fairly. Most stick to a 2-1 rule, for every two dodged actions you take one. We haven't had any issues with combat for the most part, and while we don't see all too much  'PvP', GM ran events tend to have a lot of combat and things usually go rather smoothly.",
