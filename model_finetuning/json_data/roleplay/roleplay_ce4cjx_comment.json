I'm on every single day from around 11am to around 3am maybe even longer just depending on what kind of day I'm having and how tired I get. I like to do realistic roleplays like real-life situations &amp; whatnot. I don't know if this is a big deal to you or not but I am in a wheelchair &amp; sometimes if you're comfortable with it I like to bring my real-life situations of being in a wheelchair into my roles. I also like romantic/mature/NSFW things. The NSFW stuff doesn't have to be all the time just depending on how the situation folds out in the role you know? If you're interested I can use the chat client through here on Reddit or Discord. Or whatever you prefer if you're interested. I've done all sorts of roles in the past. I'm always up for new ideas as well. I'm a pretty easy going kinda guy so if you are interested and have any questions feel free to message me if you want. My name is Joe but you can call me Joe or Joey or whatever. Doesn't matter to me.",
