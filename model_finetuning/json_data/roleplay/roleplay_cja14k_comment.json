And when I did sit back and allow life to happen I gave away my sword. Nearly got decapitated. Became best friends with you. \n\nThe current state of things are because of my lack of planning. And because I failed to address everything you told me the other night. I knew the truth but I looked the other way. Because I was scared.\n\nI am scared.\n\nScared because while you seem to suffer from not being near me, I suffer the same for not being near you. That cannot be healthy. Not for either of us. \n\nOh Crowley, don't you understand?!\n\nThere is no forgetting any of this. For this is something we have known for so long and yet never spoke on. And now that you have there is no way to stuff it all back in to be ignored.\n\nWe have screwed the pooch. Unleashed all the toothpaste from its tube. Chopped down the tree. And all other metaphors. \n\nFor we are filled with love for one another. And that is truly...truly a problem.\n\nI'm so sorry but I need time, Crowley.\n\nIf you wish to write to me again, come and see me in my shop in a week. \n\nA week is naught but a breath in God's time.\n\nYou will survive.\n\nAnd so will I.\n\nI hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Aziraphale",

Giving away your sword set an entire path in motion; a path that *needed* to happen; a path that wouldn't have happened if there was a plan, ultimately proving that the plan was that there was no plan!

Ignoring it would be. Smart.\n\nYou and I both know I am not the smartest one of heaven. But I have enough knowledge to say this.\n\nGod had a plan. We changed her mind. \n\nAnd if this is all apart of the plan still I just NEED to be sure. I need to know that this (whatever this is) is not just some hiccup or speed-bump on the way to whatever is ahead of us. You might be able to move and leap and fly to and fro to whatever strikes your fancy but I am not the same, Crowley.\n\nYou move at the speed of light and I like to take my time.\n\nAlso yes I did say screw the pooch, and? \n\nAnd.\n\nI.\n\nAlso said love.\n\nBecause it is true. \n\nWhich is so strange because I have been taught demons are not capable of love, but you said you felt it. And I am full of it already. LOVE. I mean. I am full of love.\n\n~~Although I might be full of it as well.~~ \n\nWhat you said the other night broke through every carefully formed barrier and now I am worried. \n\nBecause listen to yourself. You sat back and confessed to me that I was your world, that you loved me, that I was special to you. And now you are willing to destroy yourself just to get my attention. \n\n...Part of me worries that if I see you, that if I return all the feelings you owned up to you would realize that within moments I was not worth your time, your affection, your spite.\n\nYou change all the time. \n\nAnd I...I am dreadfully the same. \n\nIf you were to grow tired of me I would be quite bereft.   \n\n\nWell goodness Crowley. I could always just ignore you and these *posts!* It would serve you right.  \nBut if you are truly threatening me with the possibility of you ceasing to exist then...\n\nThen tell me where you are.\n\nYou selfish demon.\n\n\\-Aziraphale",
