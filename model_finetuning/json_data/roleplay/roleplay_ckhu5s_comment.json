I am an upperclassman yet we somehow became bitter rivals, and more than that, while I'm not one to admit it so, close friends. We are among the best the school has to offer - and perhaps, it's that drive to be the #1 that brought us close together. I am thankful for all you've done for me but for the sake of our pride and current relationship, I wouldn't dare to seek more than what we have. \n\n\nFinally, the day to test our mettle comes. The tournament to determine who is the cream of the crop, the best of the best, the #1 duelist and most importantly, the match that will break the draw between us. Truly, the most fitting stage for us. \n\n\n...The tournament has drawn to a close. I planned to pull off another mischievous stunt on you, but today, I noticed your usual spunk was gone. I couldn't help but wonder what happened - you weren't the kind of person to react this way in all our matches before. I've always just left you to your own devices, but today I decide to push open the door, just slightly - to understand what's going on. Clearly, you're not being yourself... \n\n___\n\nI'm a full time employee, 27M, residing in Malaysia. I'm interested to pursue your well-written prompt. If I piqued your interest, I'd love to discuss more! \n\nXoX \nCola",
