These days a lot of people just nod their heads and agree with you (figuratively speaking) hoping it will make you send them porn style posts that they can read while the fill up with gas or stand in a Queue or are on a break at work. Even when someone does appear nice and actually interested in a role they usually turn out to take very little part in the roleplay. These days guys seem to type sex scenes out of a manual without a single thought or emotion, they simply name a position and say they are banging away. After years of roleplaying I close to giving up completely, the first 10 years were great, the past 10 years have just got worse and worse.",

He was never worth my time.\n\nI'm a fandom writer and I create original works at times as well, it is so hard finding someone willing to work with me or someone which shares the same interests as me. I was beyond upset but it didn't last long. Aside from; being left on read, waiting for responses from a select few, and trying to work with the people I've already spoken to...I'm a very patient and flexible person.\n\nI try to see eye to eye with my partner[s], I discuss and get to the bottom of their comfort zone or interests and make the story enjoyable. I've been writing for 12 years and counting but people always seem to fail me or get pissy over something. Can't please them all. Damned if you do and Damned if you don't ya know?",

[Family, Education, Jobs, Mental Health, Physical Health, Friends, and respect of time] all of those come first roleplay is my only way of escaping my sad reality, I love to focus on a world where I can explore or be creative.\n\nThe main thing which pisses me off is when my time is wasted and I'm left for weeks on read forgotten. No check ins or a hint of when the next word will be spoken. I will send messages once every few days. One time I was writing with a guy and I messaged him on a Tuesday only once I heard nothing. I waited all the way to Saturday and sent another message. He sent a reply but I were busy with irl stuff, he expected me to respond to his post instantly and then called me pointless when I chewed him out over not respecting my time.\n\nI'm so sick of trying to find creative partners to build story with and just be free from the stress of my every day life...this guy today set me back a few spots because of his rude ignorance.",
