            "body": "Hello, Roland here,19 year-old college student.I've been into roleplaying for about 3 years  by now and  I've done slice of life several times sprinkled with some drama and romance. I  haven't written  angst though, but I am always open to something  new. \n\nWell, what could I say?I have no problem with 3rd person, as  I use it ... like 99.9% of the time.I don't have a problem with getting out a reply a day if there's nothing urgent going on  in the house.I  don't have a problem searching for  real life faceclaims(I guess you meant that no  anime pics or anything  drawn, right?), although,  sometimes I do have a problem to find the perfect one, I don't  really know if that's an universal issue. =)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do enjoy chatter outside roleplay. I live for  the theories, headcanons and  shipping.\n\nMy writting style ... I guess it could be counted as   proper english. I don't use asterisks and anything.Paragraphs and qoutes for dialogue for the win!I might do spelling mistakes, and sometimes my grammar is off,  and I might not be the best  at writting descriptions(English isn't my second  language, so I still have to work  on it, I can't write like some of the authors do) ,but I can  get the message across.\n\nCharacter-wise, I  try to build   OCs which are somewhat unique, I try to give them a personality(sometimes it fails, though.. but I try :P)  and something to  overcome or fight for, or one of [each.One](https://each.One)  example is Dylan, who's a nerdy teenager  who had to deal with his parents' divorce, his mom also moved from town to town ever since said divorce, he was separated from his sister  and reunited after like 4-5 years, and then they had to like.. work it [out.It](https://out.It)'s much more than this, but  the paragraph would be too long, so I just stop right here!",
