I'm a minor, so I'm not open for smut(for obvious reasons), but I am comfortable with blood and gore, as well as sexual jokes/innuendos.\n\nThe main thing for you to keep in mind is, I won't always be the fastest to reply - I'm not really used to writing multi-paragraph responses (though I'll certainly do my best to match your length). So, hope you don't mind waiting around for me.\n\nWe can do it in Reddit or Discord DMs, whichever you prefer, I'm personally haven't really roleplayed on Reddit before but I'm willing to try it out.",
