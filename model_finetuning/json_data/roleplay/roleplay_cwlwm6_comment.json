I normally write within one fandom so this would be my first time branching out of that universe. \n\nI adore romance plotlines and cute moments &lt;3 I know you said minimal NSFW, but I don't write that at all. If this puts you off then don't worry, I know it's a deal-breaker for some people.\n\nMy possible drawback is that I am dyslexic and while my spelling to the most part is fine, my grammar is somewhat lacking and it means I need a little while to write and edit a response. Also, I don't ghost or disappear without a quick message, but RP is something I approach in a casual manner around work, family, health etc so if you want quick replies I'm probably the wrong RPer for what you're after.\n\nReading that back I've realised I'm probably not the right person but I'll post just incase :)",
