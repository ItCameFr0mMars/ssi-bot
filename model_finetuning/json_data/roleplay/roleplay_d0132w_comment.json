Though I will say some of my characters are more lore based and some have a few trust issues, but that isn\u2019t all of them :3 if you want to hear more, just let me know.",

I'm female behind the screen, but I'm able to write for male characters and female characters depending on the preference that my partner has (I'm assuming you're looking for your partner to play a male character, right?).\n\nI have a couple of characters that I'd love to use, including, but not limited to..\n\n\u21a0 \\[Gritty Fantasy; 1800's USA\\] Newly turned Vampire (think of the \"Van Helsing\" 2004 movie) that's horribly wounded due to the attack. Plans for him is that a character (possibly your own) stumbles upon him, thinking that he's just a horribly wounded human.\n\n\u21a0 \\[Gritty Fantasy; early 1900's Ireland\\] Werewolf (turned a year prior; think of the \"Van Helsing\" 2004 movie for reference) that stumbles into a countryside village and attempts to find work as a farmhand, only for the daughter of said farmer to make quick friends with him. She finds out his secret by complete accident when he traps himself in a sturdy barn during the full moon; she thinks he's under attack and opens the barred doors, letting him loose.\n\n\u21a0 \\[Magical Fantasy; Medieval themed\\] An Elven mage is charged with protecting a Princess that's having to travel half way across the world (3+ months in RP) for an arranged marriage. They both end up becoming infatuated with each other (possibly fall in love) and attempt to devise a plan to where she doesn't have to marry the Duke to form political ties.\n\nIf none of those peek your interest, I have *tons* of other characters that might! Shoot me a DM if you're interested.",
