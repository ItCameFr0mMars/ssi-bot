As he walked through the castle truly lookingat the halls he'd seen his whole life, the young man had resented these walls but would follow the bloodline within, even after death. He pondered that as he knocked on the door to his new master's room, the last command given by the king ringing in his ears.",

Aelderich couldn't afford to show it; not here, and so his gloved hands tucked behind his green military sashes, and dignified his posture. -- The artists took note. There, settled at the flanks of the closed ornate doors of the throneroom, decorated with zealot's regalia and engravings of piety, they made sure to immortalize the moment; Aelderich's temple-shaven raven hair, his emerald eyes; his fencer's build and stoic complexion. The courtly painters didn't miss a detail. After all, today's events would certainly be recorded into the history books.\n\nAs the doors, tugged by two dwarfish laborers by chains, finally began to pry open though, Aelderich hoped it would be for his virtues. Aristocratic gait begun, he walked through the opulent doors, faced the royal family, bowed and muttered to himself.\n\n\"I would've preferred war. You're something else, father.\"",
