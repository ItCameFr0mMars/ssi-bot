            "body": "I have been roleplaying for many years, but just recently got back into it and discovered reddit. I have had a harsh awakening and realized that finding dedicated, passionate writers is hard! I had close to five partners that I began plotting with. With some of them, we had even created a server and begun roleplaying! Then... out of nowhere, after I spent hours creating Pinterest boards and getting excited over my character and the possibility for long term development... they would stop replying. And I totally understand being busy throughout the week. We all have lives and jobs. But still...nothing for days and weeks.  \n\n\nI'm one of those people who would voice to a partner if things aren't going as excepted. If we didn't \"vibe\" or shared the same plot interests or writing style, I would say something and see if we could work it out. I would never leave someone hanging and I guess I kind of expected the same thing out of others. It sucks that this is a real problem and I never realized how bad it was until I began seeking a long term partner!  \n\n\nI'm so sorry it happened to you! I totally get it and hope you won't give up on writing because it is such a beautiful hobby and way of expression &lt;3 Nothing feels better than getting lost into a character and a world of your own creation.",

Maybe you should take a break for a while to see if that helps before you search again and try to invest in it, because I already know the burn-out can be nasty.

I enjoy DM'ing group RPs though, and I'm at the point where I 100% of the time add more people than I want in the RP because I know that 1-2 people won't post at all, and a few will post only a couple of times and then quit. It's just how it is, unfortuantely. It's also kind of the reason I don't do 1x1. I feel you 100%. It's okay to cry about it.

The sad truth is, not too many people feel comfortable telling their partner that they aren't having fun with what they're doing, and so they think it best to just leave. A good fix I've found for this is simply making *absolutely* sure that the roleplay will be enjoyable for the both of you. Whether that's asking if they think anything should be changed and that it's highly encouraged, or just by simply talking to them OOC to keep a real human tie to the entire ordeal. Essentially, there aren't many people who will just stop doing something they enjoy, unless real life becomes an issue (in which most will let you know of) so if it's a plotline set out to specifically be fun for the both of you, ghosting should never be a problem.\n\nTL;DR - If the roleplay is enjoyable, people won't ghost",
