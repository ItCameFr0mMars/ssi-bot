I do roleplay since I was 15, sometimes I adapt some universes, like Star Wars and 90% of the time I roleplay as OC. \n\nFirst person is so natural to me that when I do it in 3th doesn't feel so good, I'm still learning english and for that reason I ask you to bare with some grammar errors. But, if you find them, feel free to correct me. I WOULD LOVE THAT. \n\nWhen I'm doing fantasy/science fiction, I LOVE wonderlands! like floating mountains, or a glowing mushroom forest. Yet, I like to take a slow approach on those type of places, because it NEED to have a huge impact in the narrative.\n\nAbout my characters, I do roleplay as trans woman or male for sex/romance, because I'm more comfortable with it. And sometimes I can have a character with mental illness, like Sekhmet, a chaos witch that have schizophrenia. If you are interested reply with your discord :d Because I need to install it again.",

Romantic plots and the like are a whole different animal, which I do love to indulge in as a a sort of guilty pleasure. I have been trying to get back into rp'ing for a good while with little luck on partners. \n\nI am fine with any kind of plot really so long as it's nothing just absolutely grotesque. I'm not terribly creative myself but can keep the ball rolling. I will admit to being out of practice as it's been.... probably years since I've had the proper opportunity.
