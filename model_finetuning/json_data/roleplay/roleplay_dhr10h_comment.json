When it comes to plotting? I like to think on my feet as a planned out plot may take some turns and curves depending on interaction and as for world-building and character development? Yes please.\\~",

It was as if a shooting star had brought her a wish right outside her home, even though it was not possible, no one lived here anymore, no one aside from her long banished family of \"witches\", according to those in charge of the new cities.   \nThe shadow outside, right after the flash, made her stand up to get a closer look.   \n\n\n// Hello! I'm a 19 year old writer who has been writing on and off for six years now. I write semi-para responses, such as the example above, but in faster paced scenes I like to indeed, go fast paced. My favorite genres are fantasy, romance and medieval, and I quite have the need for the second genre in whatever role play I do, it brings it alive in a whole different way. I'm a woman, and living in Europe. Nsfw is very welcome with me as well. I look forward to hearing from you, please send me a message if you got interested, or at the very least answer my response if you are not! I feel it would only be polite.   \nExcited and hopeful regards,  \n\\- The \"witch\" in the woods",
