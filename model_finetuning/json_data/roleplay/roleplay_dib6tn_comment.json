            "body": "Hey there o/\n\nI'll start off by saying that I am a 21 year old male. If you're willing to look passed that then maybe we could try to write something together?\n\nI've never tried advertising or searching for adverts on reddit before but I have been roleplaying on-and-off for about 8 years now, and I have a passion for writing in general. I've recently acquired some time to pursue it again but I've found myself with a serious case of writer's block and I'm looking for someone to help me get out of it. Nothing helps break the block like some good ol' fun/casual writing. \n\nI like playing all kinds of characters, pretty much getting a taste of everything since I started, and I've roleplayed with almost every kind of person under the sun. The ones that have really stuck with me though are the ones that actually talk to me about their side of the story. It's easy to drive a story on your own but when you have a partner then things can get messy, so I like communication out of character to at least sync up. As you said, it's a give and take, and I respect that.\n\nI have the most experience in gritty fantasy stuff but I've tried and enjoyed everything from sci-fi space operas to more personal crime dramas to romance plots, and I honestly don't know what I'm looking for right now. I just need to write something to wake myself up again.\n\nSo yeah, I hope we can talk a bit more. Peace!",
