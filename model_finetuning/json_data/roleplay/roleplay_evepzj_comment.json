            "body": "Hello, drowsyLegosi!\n\nI\u2019m extremely new to online role play, but I do play a lot of D&amp;D, and have DM\u2019d for over two years. I think I\u2019d really like a collaborative exercise in worldbuilding; that\u2019s probably my favorite part of the hobby. \n\nI\u2019d need a little introduction to the mechanics of it, i.e. how we exchange writing, how often we communicate, and how we expect to actually do any potential role play in a \u201clong form\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m M/33 if that matters. I promise nothing inappropriate, I know it\u2019s the internet. In fact, I\u2019d prefer strictly SFW role play. If that\u2019s a dealbreaker, I understand. \n\nPlease let me know if you\u2019re interested. Looking forward to hearing from you!",

I myself actually adore world building and character building, and I pride myself on my ability to Doo each! I'm not too well versed in d&amp;d though, sadly. For some reason, it's just super hard for me to get a hang of the rules..... Still, if I don't need to have perfect knowledge of it, I would love for you to give me a reply sometime!",
