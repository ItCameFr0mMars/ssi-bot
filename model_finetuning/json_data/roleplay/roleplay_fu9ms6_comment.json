Too far? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It takes a huge amount of hard work and focus...\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReshuffle, numbers in order. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Which I'm sure you understand, yes Ms. Evans?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTopics could work instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"That the medical field takes strong mental...uhm, fortitude. It's a field that...\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, not topics. Toss out the extras and re-number?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It's a field that your grades certainly suit. With graduation upcoming you could take the MCATs this spr-\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I've taken them,\" Paige looked up from her pamphlets with surprise. \"That's not in my file?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What? Oh, yes, I suppose it...\" the counselor shifted through her paperwork. Her years were showing as frustration crept in. Paige wondered if her glasses needed to be changed. She kept moving them up and down her nose, nostrils flaring the further their meeting went. Seasonal allergies?\n\n\"Look, Ms. Evans,\" the woman sighed and put her hands down over the papers. Her appointment didn't appear to be listening. The student was staring intently at the scattered pages she held down. \"I'll be honest with you.\" She drew herself up, clasping her hands in front of her and staring down the brunette. Paige lifted her eyes to pay attention. Finally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I don't think that this field is for you,\" the disemboweled folder was forgotten by them both. \"You lack a certain...personal nature that's important for doctors.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Surgeon.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWearing a withering stare she continued, \"That's important for surgeons,\" Paige nodded and glanced to the clock. \"Not to mention your Myers-Briggs highly suggests something quiet and self-driven would be best. Maybe a librar-\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Oh, that's fake.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Librarians?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"N-no, the Myers-Briggs. Well, not fake; it exists but it wasn't formulated by any psychologists although it was based on the work of Carl Jung.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I think you're missing the point.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Am I?\" Her attention shifted back to the highlighters she had lined up on the table. Paige began to gather them up.\n\n\"Please, Ms. Evans, you really should reconsider,\" the woman deflated, shoving her forms back into the manilla folder they came from. \"When it comes to working with people who are sick and ill you need to have a certain-\" she looped a wrinkled hand through the air. \"-je ne sais quoi.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaige had stood and looked up, one hand shoved into her bookbag, as she stared. She seemed ready to say something but another check of the clock stopped her, \"I'll think about it,\" she lied. \"Thank you very  much for your time Mrs. Davis.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You're welcome dear,\" suddenly she was all smiles and offered up the file with a flourish. \"I'll be here when you're ready to discuss your future.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was cold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMrs. Davis had a tiny oil diffuser that hummed pleasantly and created less than pleasant fumes. As Paige took deep breaths of the fall air she could feel her headache fading away. The day was cold but nice, only the breeze held a real chill and the sunlight was enough to keep people outdoors enjoying the weather. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich meant it was loud.\n\nThe wheels of Paige's bag clacked on the old bricks that made up the university's pathway. She passed no less than three games of hackeysack and two guitar-playing freshmen before she decided it was too cold for her tastes. Her hoody wasn't enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Jason, stop it!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe warning was less than serious and came from above. Paige followed it with a frown, already knowing she wouldn't like what she saw based on the laughter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith arms spread wide a skinny man easily walked along the railing of one of the school's many department connecting bridges. A gaggle of students had stopped to stare both on the ground and above, the student eating it all up. With a wrinkle of her nose, Paige stepped far away from what she deemed the 'splash zone', although he seemed to be doing well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat she guessed to be his girlfriend continued to fuss, only pausing to remind others that he was hers. Students retrieved phones while others pointed and laughed as he did a backflip. Gymnastics scholarship then? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore people on the ground level began to gather and Paige took that as her cue to leave.\n\n\"Come on, again!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Young man, get down from there!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You can do it Jason!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Oh man look at him-\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it was over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crack was enough to mute the entire crowd. Paige knew what she was going to see as she turned around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith disappointment, she noticed the lack of blood. The first time she saw a body it was supposed to be something bloody and shocking! If the student didn't look so surprised, or if his foot wasn't at a right angle, or if he stopped wheezing it would look like he was asleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn his back, he was on his back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"SOMEBODY CALL 911!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe disbelief wore off and people were screaming, some dashed away for help, most took out their phones to record. From twenty feet in the air the, previously, proud girlfriend was making a scene, her upper half leaning well over the railing as she wailed for her beloved. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow long did it take cleanup crews to come? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaige didn't even mind the crowd as she stared and contemplated, finding the situation as fascinating as it was terrifying...no, off putting. A reminder of mortality. Anyone could be a body one day- but he was breathing, wasn't he?\n\nSo, he wasn't a body. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot yet at least. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was morbid curiosity that kept Paige in the crowd and the very same that urged her forward. At first, she moved slowly but when nobody stopped her she closed the distance at an eager trot. She stood over the body, Jason, and took a deep breath, fighting back her excitement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Don't move, I'm here to help.\"",
