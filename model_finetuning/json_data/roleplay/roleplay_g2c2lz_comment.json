            "body": "I have an idea for something. But before I get into that, let me explain well...me.  \n\n\nI have been avid in the roleplaying scene for nearly thirteen years or more, as I've lost count with the years. I'm 27 years of age, so 18+ is most definitely a thing I do. I prefer MxM pairings, though am not opposed to any other roles, and I vastly enjoy coming up with original plots, or doing things set in a universe with original characters. I typically try to get in between 3 and 5 paragraphs a post when roleplaying.  \n\n\nNow as for the plot idea, well, I have several.  \n\n\nFirst one being a sort of murder mystery where one of us is a murderer at a local high school. Kids have gone missing, more specifically people who have been bullying a particular new kid at the school. But these kids are all known bullies or troublemakers. No one knows who is doing it and cops are dumbfounded that they can't trace back any evidence. The bullied new kid is an absolute sweetheart who is trying to fit in in a very conservative school that doesn't necessarily tolerate open gay-ness. The murderer is his best friend, and the guy only known as the weird art cringe kid. He's strikingly handsome in an unconventional way but people always feel there is something off about him...  \n\n\n  \nSecond story  \n\n\nA sort of modern day Zeus and Ganymede style roleplay where a godlike humanoid has a thing for a specific beautiful human male he saw essentially selling his body at a bar serving drinks in nothing but a mesh shirt, tight shirts, a waist apron, thigh high fishnets and stilettos. God guy gets in his mind that he needs to rescue the poor kid before someone takes advantage of him.   \n\n\nI can come up with many more than this though. Feel free to DM me if you're interested!",
