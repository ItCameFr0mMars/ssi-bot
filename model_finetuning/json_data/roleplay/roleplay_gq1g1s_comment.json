            "body": "I was thinking of a human priestess of the goddess of the hunt, much akin to Artemis. She would be a somewhat impulsive, hot headed, and passionate huntress with fiery red hair that she braids frequebtly when not out hunting. Her hair stands out all the more against her beige skin. Her sharp eyes are colored with hazel irises and give view to a certain roiling intensity. Her clothing is unassuming, just a light green shirt covered by a brown coat of leather armor and similarly hued earthen pants. \n\nHer clothing seems to hug the ample curvatures of her body out of practicality to avoid being snagged. Her form has beem sculpted by a lifetime of running, jumping, and living in the woods and there is little denying she would be conventionally attractive and fit. To complete her wardrobe, on each thigh are crisscrossing straps that she uses to hold daggers and other things she might need to reach in a hurry and slung along her back is her main weapon. A bow  carved of yew and a rather unassuming quiver full of arrows.\n\nSianna was taken in by the priestess of Artemis after she was sold into slavery by her parents to pay off an insurmountable debt as a child. The slave caravan was fortunately raided as it went through the forest and since being rescued, she has never looked back. \n\nMuch to the dismay of her elders, Sianna knows little of the meaning of restraint or patience. She throws herself completely into anything she does until she excels. This also means she can be quick tempered and quicker to act, which had landed her in trouble many times. This is all due to her passionate nature and she loves as fervently as she fights. \n\nIf you are interested, shoot me a message with your discord and we can talk more about her role in your world.",
