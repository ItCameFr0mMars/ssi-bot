            "body": "Hello Lynne... \n\nFirst, I am Will, and  I am GMT+2... (American in Germany). And I did read your entire request... And I have been roleplaying / writing for a long time (wishing my writing was more creative, so I shall not classify myself as a \"Creative Writer\\* though I try)... \n\nAnd yes, I too seek long-term writing partner(s)... I am not good for flash postings or \"one-night stands\" so to speak... and how long my posts are, is generally based upon the circumstances and what my character is doing... And yes, I only wrote 3rd person as well.\n\nThird Language? *\"Shuck ma'am, I kin barely speek 'merican anglish...\"* Actually I am impressed. My wife and son are multi-lingual as well. My Russian is a bit childish, but useful. So yes, mistakes are allowable... and should you require assistance and patience, allow me.\n\nChat OOC? Why of course... I can ALWAYS use a friend... to wile away the time.  And I use Discord as well; not good at it but I am trying.  Rping in Discord? I know the concept (old AOL chatroom experience) but have not done that is several years and am rusting like the tin-man in Wizard of Oz. But if you are as patient as I, then I would be comfortable.\n\nWhat interests me? **Fictional history !!!** I tried fantasy, but I rebound to history, as I found myself struggling with writing fantasy, especially when the muse dries up... With History, I could always refer to the books and stir the muse to misconstrue the history to fit the rp situations... I am giving you my weakness as well, hope that is preferable.\n\nOh yes, I just recently have started a [new world](https://srv1570s.jcink.net/)... It is fictional history, based upon the ***City of Masks***, circa 1574 (but i tend to blend the entire Italian Renaissance into my schemes)... and am in need of a writing partner(s), preferably long-term, who loves the adventure, drama, and the mysterious... all upon a foundation of romance. For what drives the individual of any world, any creation, any period, but the love of something... or someone !!! \n\nSo if you are interested ! :)  It is not easy to get started anew, or maybe I am not doing it correctly.  I am on CET (American in Germany)... Please feel free to look me up at [Discord](https://discord.gg/fUeAb9p), William#5949 so we can discuss this further. \n\n\\*bows at the waist, his eyes never leaving her visage\\*\n\nBuona Giornata Signorina,\n\nWill",
