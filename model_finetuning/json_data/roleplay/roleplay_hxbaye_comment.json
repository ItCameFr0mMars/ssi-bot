So far, we have 2 to look forward to, as more people join the game:\n\n At 15 Players: Clan locations outside of Unilatis opened! There will be a channel category for each of the 6 clans - initially, those locations will be based on existing landmarks, but players will be able to suggest rooms in those areas just like they can in Unilatis already. \n\n At 25 Players: The Night of Colors will take place. The Night of Colors is the largest and most celebrated annual event in Ydin.",
