            "body": "Post removed due to violation of rule 2:\n\n\"Posts and prompts must be SFW. RP that is predominantly or heavily NSFW, or which requires NSFW, is not welcomed. Posts cannot contain explicit content and AutoMod will automatically remove all posts and comments that include curse words, common kink/BDSM terms, sexual and/or other offensive language. Obviously fetishistic and euphemistic content will be removed. Attempting to circumvent the AutoMod with misspellings and/or euphemisms will result in removal of your post. If the roleplay you are requesting may contain adult elements, use the NSFW tag. This pertains to both sexual content and violence/gore. However, use of the NSFW tag on a post does not suspend rules regarding post content, it is a way to categorize your search for 18+ players.\n\n2b. In addition, no \u2018NSFW okay\u2019 posts. To clarify, any poster may not permit people to seek contact with optional NSFW content. There are other applicable subreddits for NSFW content. Do not discuss any sort of NSFW content, even if it were non-sexual, on this subreddit (even if you believe that it is entirely harmless). Any post which openly invites NSFW content or discussion, no matter how discrete, will be removed.\n\n2c. While seeking NSFW content on this subreddit is against the rules, users may require that potential partners be a certain age (18+, for example) due to mature and/or serious themes. This does not pertain to NSFW concepts. It is still acceptable to state in your post that you want to have a mature partner that can handle complex themes. Any other content that would exceed these rules must be discussed outside of this subreddit.\"\n\nFeel free to edit and repost if you'd like :)",
