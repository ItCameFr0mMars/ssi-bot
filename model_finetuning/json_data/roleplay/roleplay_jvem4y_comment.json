            "body": "Name: Kai Lya\n\nAge: 19\n\nBending: Avatar, but only knows firebending so far\n\nPersonality: Empathetic, contrary to everything her nation taught her, she's a pacifist, and refuses to use violence, even in self-defense, unless she feels she has no other choice. Naturally intelligent and curious, and is constantly creating something new.\n\nBackstory: She was born in the Fire Nation, and studied at the Imperial Fire Academy for Girls. She did quite well, but often got in trouble for questioning the teachers, especially during history lessons. When the Fire Sages revealed that she was the avatar, she was excited to finally be able to see the world beyond what the Fire Nation taught her. (This backstory assumes the Fire Nation has a martial and warlike culture as seen in ATLA. If that is not true of the Fire Nation in the rp, then I can change the backstory accordingly)",
