With me as a DM, I have no problem introducing the lore and history of the world but I rely very much on my partner's enthusiasm for the content of our writing, especially the setting, and I would find it odd that someone would want to write in the Warcraft universe if they're not enthusiastic about it at all!\n\nEssentially, I'm open-minded and I'm looking for a solid partner. But I'd be skeptical as to why someone with no interest in Warcraft would want to roleplay in that universe!",

I don't want to just sit and mindlessly slog through page after page of lore, I want to *feel* the world, with the kind of life breathed into it that only someone who's passionate about, experienced with, and who loves the world can do. So it's hardly a lack of enthusiasm, nor is it a lack of interest in Warcraft.",
