            "body": "Hey! I know you asked to be PM'd, but I seem to be having issues with that, so hopefully commenting here still reaches you! I'd love to talk more, so if you're interested, please shoot me a message! \n\nLike you, I have written for many years, and across all spectrums of genre, though my favorites are fantasy based, be it Tolkien-esque or fantasy to a lesser extent. Supernatural themes are also some of my favorites! I also enjoy working within Fandom universes, some of my most comfortable ones include: Avatar the Last Airbender, Percy Jackson, World of Warcraft, Harry Potter, etc.\n\nI'm 20+, write in 3rd person, and prefer to use Discord or Google Docs (though Docs are definitely my favorite- I like to feel like I'm writing a book!). My posts are typically multi-paragraphed, lit to semi-lit, and I do my best about diverse vocabulary and proper language. \n\nI usually write MxF, as the male character, but since I see you're looking for a female character, I could probably try that! \n\nIf you'd like to talk more, please message me!",
