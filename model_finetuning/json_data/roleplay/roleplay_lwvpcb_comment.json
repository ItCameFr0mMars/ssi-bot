Funny thing is, I an short and an extrovert, just as you had said in your idea. 3. I am in a relationship. Not sure if that pertains to your roleplay, but if we are going to be partners in this idea, I felt you should know. So, now that that's out of the way, let me tell you what I thought about your idea. I think it's a very good idea. I do have a few thoughts that I'd like to talk to you about, but I'd like to talk about them only if we are partners. I do have discord as well. If you'd like to have me as your roleplay partner, just dm me!",
