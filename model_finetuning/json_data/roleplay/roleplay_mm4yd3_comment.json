We did like each other but the thing was it was long distance she was from another state so was I. When I found that out. I was heart broken to. I felt crushed that she couldn't be with me because she was too far away from me. But I know how you feel. What she did was. She stopped talking to me. Because she knew that I was upset. She felt awful saying no to me. So I had to keep my distance from her. Which is like I stopped messaging her and I moved forward. My advice to you is. Take that break, let your feelings move on from that person. And try to find a new roleplay partner. I'm not saying you should stop talking to this person.  But if you continue to rp with the person. You will be more and more upset trust me it hurts",
