Right now I'm developing a story for a comic I might or might not make about a world where magic and modern technology are both the norm and many different magic creatures live alongside humans, each with their own culture, technology and way of using magic.\n\nThe plot would be: Everyone is told dark magic is bad and it corrupts you, until you stumble upon a half demon with a different point of view... Will you trust him? \n\nI've been looking for someone who'd like to roleplay with this world I made to further develop it and my characters. \n\nThe only problem is that I'm 18. I thought I could at least tell you about my idea in case 18 isn't too much of an age gap. I understand if you wouldn't feel uncomfortable roleplaying with someone so young, though.",
