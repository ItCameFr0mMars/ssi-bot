            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Saki, and I'm--obviously--looking for new people to RP with!\n\nI've been roleplaying for almost ten years, mostly just with my best friend. And while I love her to pieces and we still RP pretty much every day, I'm looking to make new friends with this mutual interest.\n\nThe big thing about me is I'm more focused on plots driven by character interaction rather than structured plot (although I'm open to planning out big arcs too!). For instance, I'm perfectly comfortable just having our characters meet, get to know each other, and have shenanigans arise from that. I have a ton of OC's, and their backstories vary from an entire series' worth of worldbuilding to just a normal kid living in the city. A lot of them are inspired by anime because I'm a big weeb, but a few are closer to real life. If your characters are just as interesting and well thought-out, a fun plot is sure to begin just from the two converging lives! At least, that's what I think. ^^\n\nI also have a few fan characters, mostly fan-created homunculi from Fullmetal Alchemist (though I've also drafted an AU where their creation is a completely original concept, separated from that show). If there's a particular series you're interested in, I'd love to discuss it.\n\nI'm also super flexible when it comes to format. I'm perfectly capable of paragraph-length responses, but I'm also comfortable with script-style writing (i.e. Marissa: Come on, let's go! *grabs his hand, laughing*). Honestly it depends what I have the energy for.\n\nThis post is getting kind of long so I'll wrap it up by saying I /am/ comfortable with NSFW content...if I know you well enough. If we become friends and I feel comfortable with you, I'm open to roleplaying intimate character relationships. Definitely won't happen immediately, though!\n\nIf you're interested, PM me here and I'll give you my discord if I think we'd get along.\n\nThank you~",

I have yet to find someone who either stands out to me or sticks with our RP :( At the end of the day, I am looking for someone who I can brainstorm and have fun with.\n\n\u2022 I am a female, in my early 20s, and just graduated from college.\n\n\u2022 I currently live in the Eastern Time Zone. I have done it before and would be willing to work around a different time zone. As long as you are passionate about writing, I believe we can make a time difference work.\n\n\u2022 I have been writing/roleplaying for 5+ years. Started finding writing partners on sites like Omegle, but that obviously does not work anymore.\n\n\u2022 I appreciate partners with creativity and depth. Preferred responses would have 2 descriptive paragraphs. (I understand that some responses will be less, such as dialogue between characters).\n\n\u2022 We can discuss whether the responses are in first or third person. I am open to whatever you are more comfortable with.\n\n\u2022 I appreciate someone who is willing to make mistakes and tolerate the ones that I may make. I am not looking for someone who is conceited about his or her work. I am not perfect, neither are you. Writing is only something fun that I do in my free time.\n\n\u2022 I have a few ideas in mind and have been working on a variety of plots for a while, but I appreciate a partner who can give me constructive criticism and help me build upon what I already have.\n\n\u2022 One of my favorite settings that I have worked on is a medieval (fiction but not fantasy) plot, but I am not limited to this. I also have a handful of other detailed ideas, which I would be happy to share with you. Hopefully we can compare interests and find a common ground. \n\n\u2022 If you feel more comfortable roleplaying with existing worlds, I have the most experience with the Harry Potter series. I have created original characters within the Marauder Era, but would love to try something new. \n",

I'm dying to play out this one https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/6fil8k/f4m_18_suspensehorror_rp_e_s/ but I'll RP pretty much anything provided it makes sense. I would like you to be literate; I hate one-liners. I myself typically write in the 1-3 paragraph range. Again, as I would like this to be a long-term roleplay I'm more than willing to work something out with you regarding plot and setting. Some themes/elements I enjoy:\n\n\u2022 Suspense/intrigue\n\n\u2022 Romance, especially of the taboo/forbidden variety\n\n\u2022 Themes of madness and insanity, deranged experiments, etc.\n\nI hope I can help you develop your character over the course of the RP and look forward to playing with you. My preferred platforms are facebook, skype, discord, and gmail.",

Hope this format is passable! \n\n\nWhat you RP:\nPride and Prejudice (canon and variation- I'm open to either!)\n\n\nCharacters you RP: Fitzwilliam Darcy, secondary characters in third person narrative and dialogue.\n\nCharacters you\u2019re looking to interact with: Elizabeth Bennet\n\nAny specific storyline ideas, or general feelings involved with RPing:\nI love to stick with canon, but I also adore believable variation. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite novel ever, and while I had read many variations and sequels, I still love coming up with them in my head and bouncing ideas off another person. \n\nWhen it comes to roleplaying in general, I would vastly prefer a partner who is considerate of time, creative, and literate. I would also prefer someone who is knowledgeable about the time period and the social norms and strictures. I prefer third-person narrative with dialogue in quotations and can write anywhere from one to three paragraphs to a brief novella. Obviously, it depends on the time of day, the availability in my schedule to post, and what's happening in the plot at the time. ;) I also do all RP through Google docs.\n\nI would ask that my partner be in their 20s-30s\n\nI know I'm most likely looking for a needle in a haystack. I find that it's hard to find a super fan in this genre, even with this being a classic book. I also would like to say that I very heavily base the Darcy I write on the Darcy portayed by Colin Firth in the BBC miniseries, which, if you haven't seen, I would highly suggest. It's glorious! I know it's upwards of twenty years old, but it's amazing...\n\nPlease comment! ",

            "selftext": "Much prefer Partners 18+, as I won\u2019t roleplay anything too romantic with people younger! \n\ny-o, Reddit! Of course after seeing The last Jedi, I'm craving more Reylo in my life. (Been lowkey rooting for them for two years, so I'm prettyyyyyyy happy at how it turned out.) \n\nI prefer 3rd person and literate posts. I've done novella to script and try to match my partners length as long as I'm not writing a huge amount of useless filler. (Quality over quantity!)\n\n\nRey has been one of my main muses for a while, I've adored her character since TFA came out and try to play her as close to the movie and various novelizations portray her. I try to consume basically all the canon things to help with my writing! (Though, _of course_ I love taking the liberty of making some headcanons.) \n\n\nIdeally, I'd love it if my partner also liked who they were roleplaying! Maybe Ben/Kylo fits into the archetype you love to explore. Maybe he's been your fav since TFA. Or maybe you just like the character and you'd love to try writing them. \n\n\nThough, I'm more than down to play a Myriad of characters along with whatever plot we decide to do! Rose, Finn, Poe, Jess, Luke, Leia- I can pull off a prreettyy good Hux too if I do say so myself. And while I'm alright with writing most characters if you're not comfortable, ideally I'd like to split the task between the both of us. Whether that means I'd control the resistance characters while you handle the first order, or we split the characters into who we'd like to write. Either options great with me! ('Cause c'mon, we gotta have some other peeps around causing some mischief! And plot.) \n\n\nSpeaking of, as for plot, I've got a few we could expand on together- or we could make up something entirely different with the two together! \n\n1. The TLJ timeline being _a lot_ more slowed down. Instead of the trying to run out the clock, fast paced story we got, maybe make things a little less intense. Perhaps the resistance was able to escape for the time being, buying Rey a lot more time for things on Ahch-To. I'm sure theres plenty of scenes we can do where Force timing turns from an unbelievable annoyance, too a casual thing they've both taken vague comfort in. From there of course, we could re-write our own end to the movie. (Do they still separate? Do they stay together? Run away? I'm down for it all.)\n\n2. Post-TLJ. Force connection still running strong between them, connecting to one another now probably doesn't lead to much besides arguing or just sitting in silence to ignore each other+...Until, dun dun dun, third-party threat comes that'll decimate both sides if they don't work together. What this threat could be, I've one idea from another roleplay from the EU we could probably twist and shape. But I'm more than down for any ideas you have! \n\n3. Alrighty. Here we go. the big decision. We could roleplay Ben choosing to come with Rey and help save the resistance and explore the redemption in that aspect. Or, of course, we could have Rey deciding that yeah, man, it is time for old things to die. And become part of the first order. In that scenario, I'd kind of like Rey to use it as an advantage maybe to shift the first order priorities, y'know. They're making the galaxy they way they want it to be. (though, I do feel she'd only accept this choice if Ben/Kylo let the resistance go and free'd Rose and Finn.) \n\n4. ??????????? Anything, honestly. Want to toss these two into some modern au? Want to do something post-tfa instead? I'm down. As long as Rey and Ben end up bonding over mutual feelings and learning about one another and doing some kissing' (And ofc _other_ things, if my partner is comfortable with such and 18+) \n\nAnyway, if this appeals to you, don't hesitate to hmu! I have reddit pm/chat, kik, discord. Most standerd platforms! ",

In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\nhttp://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction",

            "selftext": "###Hello there! First things first, I only have Reddit on my laptop. Therefore, I do not receive notifications when a PM is sent. Please have patience as I will likely respond between a 2-hour time window. I promise I'm not ignoring you! I just go to school full time. \n\n#I am currently looking for a male or someone who can play a male to do a modern day, romance roleplay! I exclusively use Discord and am not willing to use any other platform. Sorry! \ud83d\ude05\n\nI have been roleplaying for about 5 years now, and I guess one could say I am pretty good. I also am currently writing my own novels. I always roleplay full lit, and my responses are typically 1-3 paragraphs. Of course, that will vary between responses, as they depend on the course the plot is taking. Usually at the beginning, my responses will be pretty long (3-5), but of course, they will go down in length as the scene and characters are introduced and established. Remember, quality over quantity! I do usually do NSFW in my role plays, and would like someone who is capable of integrating it into the plot without making it the main focus or rushing into it.\n\nThough I'm pretty open to all role play idea's I prefer, if not exclusively, do romance plots. However, this does not mean its sub-genre can't be something else! For example, I did a role play a while ago involving a mayor who was at a constant risk of being assassination and her bodyguard, who protected her with all he had. The main genre was romance and the sub-genre was drama/action! ***I do not, however, do fandoms, fantasy, or any pre-modern plots (Though the most back I am willing to go in a time era is the 1930\u2019s)***\n\n###Here are some good things to do, and bad things to do/be when roleplaying with me!\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0Please be literate! I don't ask you to speak like a human dictionary, but I do ask you to be mindful of basic grammar skills. *For example, knowing the difference between to/too/two, their/there/they're, wear/where proper spelling of simple words etc.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Try and 'mirror' my replies. *For example, when I write a reply of a few paragraphs, I would expect the same in response. Likewise, when I write a few sentences, you don't have to write a whole novel of a reply.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0I would really love to be able to talk out of character, both for planning and just to talk! It's absolutely not necessary, but I just because I feel as though a good relationship between partners can always improve the role play and better the communication of what is going on in the plot.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Though not an absolute requirement, I prefer when the partner I'm role playing with chooses characters that have the 'Alpha Male' Personality. (Being confident, Dominating, Cocky, Aggressive, Possessive, sometimes a total dick)\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I like when my partners can come up with new characters and personalities unlike the last for the different role plays we may do.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do pretty much only Third person. I just prefer it, but I may be willing to change it to First\ud83d\ude04\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't use text speech or little asterisks when you write. I really prefer when my partner writes just as a book would be. *For example; She looked up at him with big eyes, shining from the tears in them. \"You don't understand, do you.\" She murmurs lowly, trying to contain herself. \"I love you and you don't even look at me\"*\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just I will you, please understand if my replies aren't immediate. I do go to school full time and I hope you can understand when I don\u2019t respond quickly. I will be able to reply throughout the day, just don't get upset if I reply a little later than when you sent it. I will, of course, be just as understanding with you!\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though a character face claim is not necessary, I like them to get a better image of what your character looks like. Also, I need all characters to have a bio, as it makes things like personality and background more clear. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD *PLEASE* NO ANIME FC. \n\nThough I don't have very many plot ideas at the moment, I have lots of OC's and I am more than willing to hear any ideas you have and even brainstorm a new one together!\n\n###REMINDER! If I go a few days without replying/messaging you, *please* don't think I left you hanging! I am likely either busy, or your message didn't come through to me! I will never end a role play without telling you I am doing so.\n\nWith that being said, if you're reading this, you just got brownie points for reading until the end! Congrats! \ud83d\ude0a I hope to hear from you soon! Have a super awesome day!\n\nMuch love, Apple Valentina\n\n***PS!

It is seen as the destroyer of decent society, a danger to all non-magical people, for magic wielders only seek power and bloodshed. They trick, they lie, they are unnatural. Or so they say. Those who use magic are deemed heathens and heretics, they are a danger to society. Even non-human beings are decidedly dangerous in some parts. Therefore magic is outlawed in most major countries to the civilized West. Wars ensued. Lives lost.  A council was gathered and measures were put in place for peace. A unifying religious sect called The Rise of Bloodroot, who wear the badge of white flowers as their sigil, crater. Of course this does not mean people are not born without magic, magic exists all around us and lies within many. Non-magic beings exist and have existed, even longer than human life and are pushed from their homes. Magic blooded beings are killed in the streets. Whether the beliefs are true is besides the point. Some say there are lands filled with magic, where creature and magic blooded beings live in harmony. \n\nZachariah Hail doesn't much care if someone or something is magical or not. He doesn\u2019t care about war or The Rise. I mean, sure, magic is frightening and all - but it tends to fetch a high price. And if Zachariah loves anything, it's a high price. If you've got a magical item, be it a necklace or a broach, a glove or a dagger - he can find a quiet buyer. Hot items, cold items, items of average temperature - there\u2019s always a buyer. Just as long as he doesn't have to actually touch it. Magic is dangerous, and he\u2019s afraid it might rub off or something. I don\u2019t know! He doesn\u2019t know how it works! Hail is not just a transporter of expensive goods, he's something of a low-level conman. No grand heists here, just little things, hustling in taverns, romantic scams, pretending to be a traveling fortune teller. The sort of stuff that takes no real commitment combined with a quick payout. Long gone are the days of pickpocketing for Zachariah!\n\nBut what happens when Zachariah's particular skills take a turn and send him on the journey of a lifetime? A grand, epic adventure? A maaaagical adventure!\n\nThis is where your character comes in! I'd love to flesh out and strengthen this plot! I'd really like our two characters to come together in an unlikely way, go on an adventure together, perhaps find love and fulfillment - that sort of thing. I love world building, plotting, all of it.\n\nIf you're interested please let me know! Just tell me a bit about yourself and a bit about your character/type of character you'd be using. Writing sample appreciated. ",

            "selftext": "Hey all! VC, owner of The Hub, here! Site 17 is officially running, with 18 Player Characters so far! As of right now, characters are finishing up their first day, after having all the groundwork settled, and the story arc is underway.\n\nOf course, Site 17 itself isn't the only location in the RP. In fact, most of the RP is open-world, with space for players to RP in other Sites entirely, such as the tech-heavy Site 4, or the gun-crazy Site 20. The possibilities are endless! Only one problem: there's nobody there.\n\nSo I'm here advertising for Site 17's open world side! We're looking for even more players to create characters who will make up the meat of the area outside of Site 17 itself.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Site 17:\n\nSomething's brewing in the corrupt education center Site 17. The world has long since ended, but humanity thrives, now more advanced than ever. Sites are the only thing keeping the radiation out, but are they also keeping something more sinister in?  \nSite 17 is a cyberpunk RP that can be described as a mix of Fallout and Blade Runner. Characters can explore an open world consisting of 20 Sites, or head to Site 17 and join in on the overarching storyline. The RP will feature a custom combat system, different factions, and secrets galore, as well as certain specialized mechanics to keep everyone wondering who *isn't* human.\n\n* https://discord.gg/QFsfkP8  \n* https://worldanvil.com/w/site-17-verdictfps  \n\n**Hope to see you there!**\n\n*****\n\n^Part ^of ^The ^Hub ^network ^of ^RP ^servers.  \nWelcome to The Hub.

            "selftext": "So, just what is the lands of Therin? It's a roleplaying server that is looking for roleplayers that want a controlled roleplay that is based on adventuring a large piece of land. It's an open world roleplay, so what just does that mean? It means that your character is not required to remain in any certain area or with any specific group. You may travel anywhere you wish around the map so long as you do the roleplay of moving to that location. The roleplay while it has restrictions in place to make sure that nobody goes overboard with their character and to stray away from the edge-lords of roleplay, is still decently free in what it allows. There's a set list of elemental arcane affinities, but if what you want isn't on the list don't worry! You can always speak to an admin and find out if you can get what you want!\n\nSo, what exactly makes us different from any other roleplay out here on Discord? Well, the clear thing is that our server runs off a customized world and lore. This means that no other roleplay server will have the background ours has or the set land as we have put thought into our server and have made sure to think of what the locations are and what they are about. This is also meant to be for large-scale roleplaying, mean that the more people, the better. Of course, at the start to avoid boredom, we advise you keep within certain areas to keep you around the roleplay, but are in no way required to. \n\nSo, what are the requirements? Simply we ask that you fluently speak English and understand what serious roleplay is! This is not a place to find ERP, or a place to create a character that can turn into a 76 headed snake. There is a bit of reading to be done with the roleplay information that's provided, but it will ensure you know everything there is to know before making a character.\n\nSo, to put it short. Are you into large-group roleplays? Do you like fantasy setting roleplays? Do you like to have fun? It's pretty much what this Discord is. Not sure if you're down, come in! Ask some questions and read some more!\n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/ZrX43ft",

            "selftext": "On October 2nd, 1982, the end of the world began.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEarly official reports stated that it was an outbreak of avian flu originating in India, but rumors claimed it was actually a bioengineered plague escaped from Soviet labs or perhaps unleashed deliberately. Whatever the case, the Red Cough quickly turned into the deadliest single disease outbreak in human history, directly killing five out of every seven people across the world over the ensuing months. As governments broke down and infrastructure collapsed, millions more died from violence or lack of food and water.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn July of 1983, things got worse as nuclear weapons were launched initially from various points in Asia and the Indian subcontinent, and shortly after all over the world. Details are scarce, but most believe what started as an attempt at nuclear sterilization of outbreak hotspots led to nuclear panic and multiple ensuing launches all over the world. Most governments that had remained intact up to this point were destroyed in nuclear fire. In the course of a mere seven months, the entirety of human civilization was brought to ruin.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBlack Bear Island is a small volcanic island 4 miles (6.4 km) off the coast of the U.S. state of Washington. With a total land area of approximately 84 square miles (220 km), its pre-outbreak economy was largely based on fishing and tourism with limited agricultural activity in the form of apple orchards. In 2055, its population is roughly 1100, approximately 800 of which live in the main coastal town of Piedmont Bay. The town is overlooked by scenic Mt. James, a dormant volcano whose only activity consists of occasional minor earthquakes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe residents of Black Bear Island fared better in the wake of societal collapse than did many others on the mainland. The island had been mostly dependent on local geothermal power and had its water supplied by a desalination plant and wells.  Rocky shoals dotting the offshore waters had traditionally made it difficult to access by boat, and its only permanent connection to the mainland was a cable ferry--at the time, the longest in the world. The forward-thinking actions of pre-outbreak mayor Johnathan Cormack allowed society on Black Bear to remain largely intact despite the state of affairs on the mainland. In the initial weeks of the outbreak he ordered the ferry cables cut and persuaded the commanding officer of the island's National Guard armory to enforce a quarantine of the island, not allowing any boats to cross from the mainland.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe better part of a century later, Black Bear Island remains a relatively secure and peaceful place to live. The islanders have been forced to adapt to the lack of manufactured goods from the mainland, producing what they can for themselves and making do when they cannot. They supply most of their own food, fishing off of small sailboats and enjoying locally produced apples and cider. Gas is hard to come by; what can't be run off of geothermal power is generally not run at all, though small amounts of biodiesel are produced from fish oil. Expeditions off of the island are rare due to the ever-present threat of active pockets of Red Cough. The late Mayor Cormack's words tend to rule attitudes toward the mainland: \"Think first of your families, then of your neighbors, then of the rest of the world.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo will you think of your family? Or do you still have hope for the rest of humanity?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://discord.gg/ZX4V9v7",

I've been role playing since I was 10, so I have a bit of experience and I've done a little bit of everything.  I'm very descriptive, have nice grammar, and like to go into detail about my character's thoughts, feelings and actions and I'm looking for someone willing to give me the same depth. I'm ok with lengthy posts and with one-paragraph-long replies as long as they have some juice in them and I will match my partner's preference. I love 'layered' stories with some depth to them, so I love to add romance, sex and conflict to the adventure, I play characters of any gender and orientation, though I do have a preference for M/M settings. As for style, I'm most comfortable with third person and past sense. \n\nFor original settings, I like:\n\n* SciFi.\n\n* Historical Fiction.\n\n* Slice of Life.\n\n* Fantasy.\n\n* Urban Fantasy. \n\n* Post-Apocalyptic scenarios.\n\n\nNow, let's talk about fandoms:\n\n* Assassins Creed.\n\n* The Witcher (books and games).\n\n* The Elder Scrolls.\n\n* Fallout.\n\n* Far Cry.\n\n* Star Trek.\n\n* Uncharted.\n\n* DC comics (just getting into these.)\n\n* Mass Effect.\n\n\nIf there's some idea you've been wanting to play, I'm all ears!

I\u2019ve attempted to keep it short and sweet below, but feel free to ask questions if you\u2019re curious. \n\n- 3rd person\n\n- Long-term. Most of my stories are many hundreds of pages long. It would be impossible to write that in the short term. Please plan to stick around a bit. \n\n- Multi-para posts via email or GoogleDocs only. Minimum 4 paragraphs, more preferred. Descriptive, illustrative, well crafted writing. \n\n- Post minimum 1x a day, more would be great. (I\u2019m on EST in the US and write primarily during the day, but we can work something out)\n\n- Be 21+. For both NSFW options and for general life experience. Are there adultier adults on Reddit? Please pop in! \n\n- Romance is non-negotiable. Everything else revolves around the love story. There should be a whole host of action and adventure unfolding along the way, but I like what I like.\n\n- You must be willing to play the straight, male, lead. I have a very specific type. Big, broad, muscular, alpha personality type. Beards and tattoos are optional, but welcome. Open beyond that for the most part, and happy to repay certain favors. \n\n- Have ideas! This is a collaboration. I write some stuff, you write some stuff. We occasionally brainstorm a particular arc and go from there. Surprises are good. I\u2019m not looking to drag dead weight. Therefore you must be willing to communicate about the story. \n\nLooking for historical tales. Will consider ideas which through various supernatural means weave between historical and modern, but nothing solely modern based. This leaves a vast period of time to explore. Research is not required, creative license and close approximation are fine. Celtic tribes, Roman conquest, Westward expansion, Viking invasion, World War horror, or events and locations out of our own imagination.\n\nI prefer reality(ish) and to keep my fantastical themes in the character type realm (werewolves, vampires, fairy tale creatures, etc). Occasional light magics and supernatural influences, deities, etc work fine. \n\nI play straight women that are almost always human. They often have painful histories and flawed backgrounds that can make them difficult characters. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re tuned into the all drama all the time channel, but they are going to develop over time. They\u2019re typically more submissive archetypes (not helpless, that\u2019s very different). For example, they\u2019re more likely to be a war prize, arranged marriage, nurse on the battlefield, than a fellow soldier. \n\nThe story is everything. One of those epic, wrenching, exciting tales. Pearl Harbor, Titanic, Braveheart, King Arthur, (and even a few with happier endings). Since it always comes up, my list of limitations is relatively short, but made substantially longer by Reddit encounters. Yeah...thanks for that. Happy to outline it if needs be. \n\nSo, come along then, let\u2019s have a chat. What has inspired you lately? What story are you aching to write? Bring an idea and let\u2019s discuss. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I went from AOL to Yahoo to MUD to D&amp;D. I miss the AOL and Yahoo days of roleplay so I'm hoping to find some 1x1 partners.\n\nI'm looking for long-term, story-based roleplay. I like to play original characters set in a medieval/fantasy setting but am also open to crossovers, original ideas, and new settings. I have a few characters that I can use but don't mind making a new one to fit the need of the RP.\n\nI do ask that my partner be over 18. It's a precaution I have to take no matter what we play. I don't mind getting into mature themes but I do not want the roleplay to be based around that only. I like character development, I like telling stories with my characters, I like them building a life for themselves and going on adventures. The most important thing is to let things happen organically between the characters. \n\nIt's okay if you don't want to play an original character or a character that isn't from the medieval times. I don't like to play complete fandoms, though, so I don't want my character to be stuck in a pre-made world. World building is part of the fun!\n\nI like to be rather active in roleplay so 2-3 days between posts doesn't work for me. I can post several times a day depending on time zone differences. I understand that life happens and I'm very understanding of that as long as you communicate with me. \n\nI prefer role-playing in the third person. There's something about the first person that creeps me out. I'll do my best to match your length but I tend to average 2-3 paragraphs, depending on the situation. I'll never send a one-liner or just one word and I ask you to stay away from that as well.\n\nIt's okay if your grammar and spelling aren't perfect. Goodness knows mine isn't! I do ask that you do not use text speak when we roleplay. I'm okay with changing the way a word is spelled if it's being pronounced differently (i.e. \"yer\", \"tae\", etc).\n\nWhat else, what else...\n\nI should add that I used to make friends with my partners. It wasn't just all roleplay all the time. We chatted, got to know each other, built up those friendships. In my opinion, it makes for a better RP. I understand not everyone is like that but I would really like to get to know you at least a little bit. That way if we need a break we can chat. The most important thing is communication. If it's not working out, if we need a change of pace, or if one of us needs a break I want us to be able to tell each other about that.\n\nThe only thing left to cover here is where I prefer to role-play. I've come to prefer Discord because of their servers which helps organize things. I could be talked into using Skype or even hangouts if that's what you enjoy. I will not RP over Kik, Reddit PM, or email. \n\nIf any of this sounds good to you please message me! When you do give a short introduction plus what you're looking for so I have an idea and we can go from there. Looking forward to it!",

            "selftext": "_\u201cAll around us are people of all classes, of all nationalities, of all ages. For a select amount of time these people, these strangers to one another, are brought together. They sleep and eat under one roof, they cannot get away from each other. At the end of this time they part, they go their separate ways, never, perhaps, to see each other again.\u201d_\n\nHello there! I have been in love with Agatha Christie\u2019s \u2018Murder on the Orient Express\u2019 for as long as I can remember. The 1974 movie adaption was wonderful, and if anyone remembers Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u2019Strangers on a Train\u2019 (1951), I love that as well. I\u2019ve always wanted to do a roleplay inspired by these literary and cinematic works, but getting the people and story together isn\u2019t always easy, especially without a means for advertising. But with the remake of Murder on the Orient Express now in theatres, I figure that now is a better time than ever to get this roleplay going! I tried to get it started a while back but I am doing a reboot.\n\n**THE BASICS**: The Roleplay takes place on in 1930s Europe. The train is called _The Calais-Mediterran\u00e9e Express_, but is often nicknamed Le Train Bleu, or The Blue Train. This roleplay is inspired by the book but not exactly the same, in terms of the murder and many other aspects, especially as you all will craft your own OCs. There is an OOC chat for out of character conversation, planning, perhaps rolling if we decide we want to incorporate it, etcetera. This is a place to clarify ideas but also get to know the people you are roleplaying with, without disrupting the flow of the roleplay itself. That being said, please be considerate of other people! If you want to PM somebody, please wait until you get their permission. The RolePlay will be entirely in character, narrative and third person. A murderer will be chosen, and it will not be me! I will, however, NPC characters like the conductor and servers if need be.\n\nIn order to secure a spot in this RolePlay, I ask that you are a **detailed, advanced literate RolePlayer**. Please, NO one\u2013liners! You will be required to create an original character, _approved by myself_, that adheres to one of the provided tropes. ONE trope per player\u2014 if someone is already playing The Professor, for example, that trope is taken, and there will be no more Professors on the train. That being said, your character should be unique and interesting! As the book says, there are people of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities. Creativity is encouraged here. So, into what I need! I\u2019m looking for _at least_ 14 other players in order to cover all required tropes and bases for this roleplay. The remaining available tropes are as follows;\n\n**THE ASSISTANT**\n**THE WIDOW**\n**THE DOCTOR**\n**THE MAID**\n**THE BUTLER**\n**THE MISSIONARY**\n**THE GANGSTER**\n**THE PROFESSOR**\n**THE SALESMAN**\n**THE DETECTIVE**\n**THE PRINCESS**\n\nIf you are not interested in any of these tropes, but you ARE interested in this roleplay, _please_ still get in touch with me! We would also love a conductor, cooks and servers, an engineer, and other people who work on, or would be on the train. Some of these characters will also be NPC\u2019ed ( by myself ) if need be, and nobody wants to claim them.\n\nTogether, the players will solve dilemmas, engage in conversation, and gather clues and knowledge to work towards finding the murderer... If they aren\u2019t murdered themselves. The RolePlay will mainly be carried by the players, but I, as an ominous force who maintains the mood and environment of the train, will present players with prompts, options, twists, turns, and clues provided to me by the killer, in order to keep things moving and interesting. And don\u2019t worry\u2014 even if your character is not the Detective, you still will play a very important role in solving the mystery, but also being a suspect and a witness! No matter which trope or character you choose, you will have fun.\n\nIf you are interested or have any questions, message me your desired **TROPE**, your character\u2019s **NAME**, and anything else you want to discuss right off the bat. I will send you my specific bio template and we can make the platform switch.",

            "selftext": "Hey there, everyone. You can call me Thranduuiil/Milkweed. I\u2019m a 21-year-old Illustrator and part-time Bartender from Scotland. (GMT) I\u2019ve recently been on the hunt for some new role-players. I keep my roleplaying pool small since I like to make friends. The two role-players I have currently are amazing, but I can\u2019t ask too much of them at one time, which is why I\u2019m opening to another partner!  As for all the personal, quick stuff\u2014Despite my time zone, I\u2019m usually always about. I might disappear once a day to have a nap. How great are naps, right? I also have a strange love for Cacti and Succulents and I currently own a good collection of them. If we hook up, expect pictures of my Cacti Crew, they\u2019re just the best. Being an illustrator, there\u2019s a high chance I will draw our characters, one way or another. Only if you\u2019d like! And apart from that, I work two-jobs in a bar. But even then, I can be responsive when it isn\u2019t busy. \n\n\nLet me talk about myself a tad more, for the sake of the Roleplay itself.\n\n\nSo, if the title didn\u2019t give it away, I\u2019m looking for a Fallout-based roleplay. Usually I would welcome originals and what not, but at this current moment, I\u2019m seeking some action in the Mojave Desert. (However, if we get on, we could maybe discuss some originals at some point! I\u2019m not one-track minded). At the moment, I only have two Original Characters in the Mojave but I\u2019m looking forward to making more. I absolutely adore in-depth, intriguing, interesting plots. Packed full of drama, suspense, passion, anger and crippling sadness. My post length starts at about 400-500 but can rocket into the 1,000\u2019s if need be. I roleplay both CANON and ORIGINAL characters and I expect my partner to do the same. I\u2019m inclusive of all Genders, Sexes, Religions, Backgrounds and would hope, again, my partner is too. As for the Canon of the game, neither of my Original Characters are considered the Courier, so I\u2019m more than happy for your character to take up that Mantle. I WILL double, as I love doing so. One romance/friendship for another? Sign me up! \n\n\nThere\u2019s plenty more I could post about my Characters and the plot of the Roleplay and what not, but let\u2019s see how we click first, shall we? If you are interested, don\u2019t be afraid to drop me a DM. I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as possible. \n\n\n-Milkweed/Thranduuiil. &lt;3\n",

I\u2019m sixteen, which I know is a deal-breaker for a lot of people, though I\u2019m perfectly happy roleplaying with a partner of any age. I but M/A instead of A because guys tend to ghost less.\n\nI generally mirror the length of whoever I\u2019m writing with, but would prefer a partner who writes 2+ paragraphs since I make mine quite detailed. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m alright with my grammar/spelling and would appreciate the same from you. I also write as though I\u2019m writing a book, so we\u2019d likely be incompatible if you use the *italics for actions* method.\n\nI write characters, not self-inserts. I\u2019m perfectly happy writing with self-inserts, but I won\u2019t play one. My characters tend to cause conflict, because that\u2019s what I enjoy, so you have to be okay with our characters maybe not immediately being besties.\n\nI\u2019m also in the UK, in case that\u2019s an issue for anyone. Right, so:\n\n**Post Apocalyptic**\n\n######The Last of Us\n\nI\u2019ve been playing TLOU again and *woo boy*. I\u2019d love to roleplay something in this universe, be it as Joel and Ellie or as OCs. Or a mixture! ^Play ^Joel ^and ^Ellie ^so ^I ^can ^give ^them ^a ^hug.^please.\nI\u2019m kidding, but I\u2019d love to brainstorm something with you on this and give you some of my current ideas. So existing characters or OCs or a mix is good with me!\n\n######The Walking Dead/Zombie Apocalypse\n\nIf pressed, I could give playing any TWD character a go, be it from the show or game if that\u2019s what you\u2019d like. I\u2019d also be excited to play OCs, either in the TWD world or just in a pretty typical zombie apocalypse. \n\nI\u2019ve got some ideas for this. Existing/original/mix friendly!\n\n######Fallout/Sci-Fi Style Apocalypse\n\nSo my knowledge on Fallout lore is shaky at best, but I do love the feel of the entire thing a lot. I\u2019ve played a fair bit of FO4, so if you didn\u2019t mind me tripping up now and again we could do it in the Fallout universe. Or we could make our own style of it.\n\nI\u2019m only able to play original characters for this one, though you could play existing if you liked.\n\n**Medieval Fantasy**\n\n######Dragon Age\n\nI love Dragon Age. I\u2019d be happy to chat over any ideas for any of the games or a new story set in the universe. I could play any characters from the series as needed, but I would prefer to go with new ones for our main chars (it\u2019s up to you what you play yourself).\n\nI have a few ideas!\n\n######Original\n\nI love my worldbuilding. I\u2019d be excited to try and do co-worldbuilding while in character. I have a few ideas, and a few characters waiting. Feel free to just leap in with a character intro with this one if you feel like it?\n\n**Modern**\n\n######Fantasy/Magical World\n\nI\u2019ve never actually done a modern roleplay, and I\u2019d be excited to try it out with a sort of fantastical edge to it. Maybe one of us is a normal person caught up in something bad? Magical enemies? I don\u2019t know!\n\n######Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts\n\nLong shot, but I love Newt and the whole magizoologist thing! I\u2019d love to do something down that route.",

I am looking for a DM to rub my tiefling through a long-term fantasy / DnD game over Discord, OR looking for a DM and one/two/three other players to run us all through a fantasy game. Either way. I am descriptive, literate and have been roleplaying both online and tabletop for about 12 years now. My OC is a tiefling spellsword whi I\u2019ve had for years now. She\u2019s often a mercenary, stubborn, sexy, hard-headed and tenacious, utilizing both her skills with a sword and her affinity for magic. I\u2019d prefer to set this in an original fantasy world. Either one of your own making, or we can build the world together as we go along. The hope here is to tell an interesting story with character development, action, adventure, potentially romance, etc. Whatever the case, I need a DM to play the world and the character surrounding my OC. I\u2019m active basically every day and live in CST time zone. \n\nIf you have an existing RP server and are looking for new players for your fantasy game in which a tiefling OC can be included, I\u2019d also love to join you. Whatever the case, just message me and I\u2019m sure we can figure something out. Thanks! ",

            "selftext": "Hello once again!\n\nI'm writing this to seek out one or two new writing partners. I will embark on the long and arduous journey towards a PhD, which may limit my availability. But fear not, I'm not about to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above two meaty paragraphs makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nSpeaking of plots and genres, I am currently looking for Modern Slice of Life and Historical settings. \n\nHonestly, there are many more themes I am willing to try. The only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",

Some of my favorites are Soul Eater, Sword Art Online, and My Hero Academia. Of course, I'm up for anything you might suggest as well, I'm very flexible and able to play either gender and a multitude of character types. For the genre of RP I am once again flexible, although I enjoy a healthy mix of Slice of life, Combat, and romance, if at all possible in the situation (Although I understand not every RP needs or can include combat). I like my partners to be somewhat available, I understand that daily might not be possible, but more than a couple posts a week is preferred. My posts vary depending on yours, but on my own I always attempt at least 1-2 paragraphs, if not more. I'm not super picky about everything being prim and proper grammatically, we all make mistakes! I'm looking forward to speaking with you, Pm me if you are interested!",

You guys can tell me what scenario you want, I'm open to suggestions.\n\nBasically, me DMing (Dungeon Master; old concept from DnD) involves me guiding the group through a journey that is a lot of fun. You guys choose EVERY single thing- nothing is off limits, so I can't control what you do- however, my job is to play as the NPCs, tell you what loot you manage to scrape by, say when a zombie enters the room, etc. Basically, I determine the result of your actions based on multiple factors, involving a few die rolls and arbitrary thinking both on my part and yours.\n\nLike I said, it will be somewhat arbitrary and besides setting up some preset die roll chances for each action I won't be creating many rules because we're not actually playing DnD.\n\nIt would be over discord, long-term, and rapid-fire. We'd get together at preset times, say twice a week, and have 2-3 hour sessions of rapid-fire RP. Deep characters wanted with development, quirks, and flaws.\n\nPM me on here if interested.\n\nAlso, since this is longterm and will require a LOT of effort from my part, I ask that before you join you to consider if you really have time to make a dedication like this and will work with me to make the game fun.\n\nLooking forward to it!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nWe\u2019re here to tell you about a Reddit roleplay set in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire: [A Dawn of Ice and Fire RP](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADawnOfIceAndFireRP/).\n\nSet 100 years after the events of the books, ADOIAF begins during the long reign of Baelon Blackfyre, a descendant of Aegon VI, who won the War of the Five Kings in 303 AC. Westeros, however, is a very different place even now. Not long after the ascension of House Blackfyre, the Others successfully breached the Wall and invaded the southern lands of Westeros, bringing with them the Second Long Night.\n\nThe army of the dead marched south, and King Aegon of House Blackfyre, dubbed such after the reveal of his possession of the ancient sword, raised the armies of the Great Houses in response to this grave new threat. With the combined efforts of the living, the White Walkers and their armies of dead men were defeated in 340 AC after a long and costly war. \n\nDespite the end of the War for the Dawn, and the rebuilding of society after the end of a generation-long winter, the invasion has left long-lasting effects on the lands south of the Wall. Cultures, allegiances, and the land itself has changed in the decades since. \n\nNow it is 400 AC, in the midst of a long summer, and you can have a role in what the Dawn looks like.\n\nA Dawn of Ice and Fire RP is a story-based RP subreddit and is open to any and all with a desire to tell the stories of their characters. It\u2019s a big world with hundreds of houses to choose from, but you\u2019re by no means limited to a noble character. As GRRM said himself: *\"Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can't make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like. A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people.\u201d*\n\nYou can visit our [Character Creation thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADawnOfIceAndFireRP/comments/6qs8jy/ooc_character_creation_thread/?st=j5sryde1&amp;sh=19a239e9) and our [Introduction Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADawnOfIceAndFireRP/comments/6qs8u8/ooc_introduction_and_sub_guidelines/?st=j5sryf6l&amp;sh=33e7d6b7) for more information as to how to join, and if you have any questions [our discord chat is open to you!](https://discord.gg/aKnn2k) \n\nHope to see you join us in the new Dawn in Westeros!\n\n",

            "selftext": "\"You remember our most venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch on the moor. I lived all my years in that ancient rumor shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury, and yet I began to tire of... conventional extravagance. Singular unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long-buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workmen and... sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt-soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness. In the end, I alone fled, laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity. Until consciousness failed me.\n\n\nYou remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you, return home, claim your birthright and deliver our family from the ravenous clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon.\"\n\nThank you for reading. This roleplay is a different take on the video game \"Darkest Dungeon\" and gives it a more roleplay feel to it. You are returning home to the town of Haven you once called your own. But years after you left to achieve even greater things, something dark befell your once beloved playground. Driven to raving madness and bloodshed, dark things began to appear, corrupting all but the most sanctimonious of prefectures. The letter you received from your uncle declared you owner of the household, along with two others who have yet to be identified. Against your better judgement, you now sit in a carriage, traveling along the Old Road back to home....",

I write an original adaptation of the Queen of Hearts, and have spent some time constructing a version of Wonderland which has a neon-noir crime underworld feel to it. I would love to set up some long-term rps on either email or discord, and I'm open to any characters (or adaptations thereof) you would like to throw into this Wonderland.\n\nI can obviously explain more about the world in length when we chat, but I do have a [pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/gendrqueerghost/world-neon-noir-wonderland/) with some aesthetic inspiration posts and the like. The basic premise is that the four card suit gangs each specialize in a type of crime, and all fight for control of and territory in Wonderland.

No no, don't leave yet, finish reading this and if you still think I am not worth your time (no one thinks this, trust me) then you can leave. \n\nThanks for reading on. Now to the main part of the post. It's a new year, and I have been wanting to write with some new people. Some months ago this sub introduced me to some people who I now call best friends and I am looking for more like those out there, I know there are many of you. \n\nAs much as I love a good RP, I also love to talk with my partners, mess around and just talk about anything and everything. If you don't want to do that still message me but you should try it, talking is fund :D\n\nFor RP I am into anything and everything that is not too fantasy heavy. I am open to smutting (some call me smut queen ;) ). I want to RP on discord only, and past tense 3rd person preferred. I don't want to have a big list of things really so that will be it for now. \n\nI am also into fandoms, GoT being the main one I will do anything involving this, HP and Disney being others. There might be some more that I can't remember, so just ask. Ask me anything you want really. \n\nWell that's it for now, thanks for reading again. Let's become good friends. PM me for Discord name :D \n\nP.S: Love you all :P ",

I'll put a list down below of the things they're from, but if there's going to be romance, I only do lesbian. Some of them I'll ship with certain canon characters, but you can try your own OC's and we'll see. I also play canon characters, but I'm really picky about playing against other OC's. Also, I go to a trade school full time so I wont be able to be on all the time during the week. Anyway, here's what my characters are from:\n\nStar Wars \n\nNaruto\n\nDragonball\n\nSteven Universe\n\nGeneric Fantasy\n\nGeneric Cyberpunk\n\nModern day\n\nFallout\n\nWitcher\n\nAssassin's Creed \n\nFinal Fantasy\n\nArcher\n\nAvatar\n\nAnd there might be a few more that I'm forgetting. If you come up with anything not on the list, ask about it but don't be disappointed if I don't know it. When you message me, put whatever universe it's gonna be in and the name of your character so I don't get a bunch of the same mixed up. Also, don't message me if you're just gonna disappear before we actually get to do anything.",

I am also a frequent writer, I can write more than one response a day and am very willing to do \"live\" rp with a partner.\n\nWhat I would like in return is someone who is engaged and passionate about rp, someone who is willing to enjoy the creative process, someone who has an open mind and is willing to explore issues that lighter rp's would not.\n\nI would also ask the person be over 18 and interested in longer term rp writing.\n\nI look forward to any and all responses, thanks for reading.

            "selftext": "The dragon Knights were a formidable force, mainly centered in Orsis, and fought primarily in the first calamity war, though the use of the dragon golems were used sporadically in other wars, and one of the oldest was rumored to be used alongside the magi.\n\nDragon golems themselves are massive undertakings of craftsmanship and magic, a fusion of rare metals, and the still beating heart of a very ancient dragon. The massive humanoid construct is adorned with the scales of the dragon, and a weapon made from its bones, as a symbol of respect to the beast. It requires an entire lifespan of mana to use, and because of that, dragon Knights are linked to the golem, until retirement, forfeiting their mana so the golem can move and fight. \n\nHowever, it has been suggested that someone with near flawless mana control, or alternatively, a special type of aetherium could theoretically be used as a buffer and an amplifier, allowing the knight to possibly use magic alongside their golem. In recent years, golems have been seen using an array of armaments, most notably, a powerful, and primitive mana based weapon. Not a lot is known about this weapon just yet, other than its ability to erase entire platoons of armored Knights. \n\nA golem hasn't been made in several decades, as the dragons themselves have disappeared off the face of earth. However, there have been rumors of a young man searching for a dragon, to create his own construct....\n\n(Hiya! If this interested you, I'd be more than happy to try and figure out something! I would like to mention that this will be primarily a romance/adventure RP, with sporadic action here and there. That being said, please, go ahead and pm me! That's all, for now at least. Have a good day! Err, and before I forget, sorry for the blob of words. Mobile formatting is awful.)\n\nEdit- if you've messaged me about this prompt before, or if we did something along these lines before, please shoot me a message. Life kinda got in the way, so I had to poof for a while.",

            "selftext": "You needed a new job. You discovered this particular ad listed under \"house keeping\". \n\n\n\"Skilled cook needed for role as full time, multitalented, factotum on private manor in Tabor, Nepal. Jobs might also include household cleaning, light grounds keeping, pool maintenance, and laundry. Skill in hosting parties is also well recognized.\"\n\n\nTwo things stuck out you about the ad. First, and already shocking enough, it required that the employee live on site, in Nepal obviously. More importantly for you, it paid almost two hundred grand annually with benefits, as well as covered costs of traveling to Nepal for an interview, and covered relocation expenses. You submitted an application, half expecting nothing to happen, but received a response only a couple hours later asking you to come in for an interview. \n\n\nThe Roleplay starts with you arriving at the expansive villa in the fictional region of Tabor for your interview with a Mr. \"Ron Stanley\", but not even this event can really prepare you for the bizarre and often eccentric or cruel personalities that reside in this building. This original roleplay draws elements from Sci-Fi, mystery, and LP romance genres. Shoot me a PM if you're interested! If you have any questions, I'm always happy to try and answer. Talk to you soon luv! \n\n\n",

Before I pitch my idea, I\u2019ll give you my details on how I roleplay [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/7kn6ya/pandy1031/?st=JC4CV37D&amp;sh=924925ad) !\nThanks so much for checking my idea out!\n\nAvina has always been running. She can\u2019t stop, they\u2019ll catch her and \u201cenhance\u201d her. Like her friends, her family. \n\nAvina\u2019s world is one where everyone has enhancements. It\u2019s desirable to. Many people her age get enhancements at 15. They can run faster, see through walls, don\u2019t need to eat. Almost anything you can think of, they can do. But Avina doesn\u2019t want that. She ran away 3 days before her 15th birthday, was in a homestead with other refugees for 11 months before they got taken away. Avina\u2019s been on the run ever since. \n\nThat\u2019s where you come in. You can either be someone in the company that does the enhancements that is sent to persuade Avina to get the enhancements but falls in love with her, or you can be a fellow refugee! It\u2019s all up to you!\n\nIf you decide you would like to join Avina on her journey, drop me a message and we can figure things out from there! I can\u2019t wait to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Camp Castaway is a Summer Camp roleplay that is based around Maine, US.\n\nLore:Years ago, in 1850, there was a brilliant, nice camp that stood in the country side of Maine. In this city, many teens and children would come to camp where they found themselves enjoying the delight of the camp. Campers would host games, have camp fires, make s'mores, sing songs, and enjoy their warm summer in the beautiful camp. Campers never rested a moment, besides the curfew of course, and would enjoy many days. Although, in 1933, when the Great Depression swept across America, Camp Castaway was shut down and transformed into a shelter for people. Once the Great Depression ended, the owner of the camp had passed away, and nobody had stepped up to take over the camp. Although, just 4 months ago, a decedent of the owner has stepped up to re-open the Summer Camp. It has been modernized and freshly cleaned, along with repaired and such for new campers this summer. Original Owner: Robert Trent New Owner: Tiffany Trent\n\nIf you are interested, please join the group with this link: https://discord.gg/HRF3egg\n\nPlease do not hestitate to put any suggestion or question!\n\nEnjoy!\n",

My name is Maddie and I am twenty-one years old and I am located in EST time zone. I prefer to use KIK, SKYPE, DISCORD, EMAIL, and REDDIT PERSONAL MESSAGES. I might willing to use something else so just ask! I usually can give rapid fire responses throughout the day, though I am much more active at night. My roleplaying style consists of third person, multi-paragraph (two-ten), literate, and full of detail. I am flexible with this, of course, but it is what I prefer!\n\nI've been roleplaying for around nine-ish years now and it is something I love dearly! I've dabbled in a little of this and a little of that, but my heart lies in two things: ROMANCE and ANGST. I am looking for both! I will admit both will make my heart squeeze in my chest. I am also quite fond of darker plots as well. I have very few limitations on what I will do, so just ask me or include yours in your message! I usually always play as a female around the ages sixteen to twenty-five unless I agree to double with you as a male or another gender. I prefer pairing my female with a male.\n\nOh boy, do I love fandoms. I am mostly an anime kind of girl with a heavy obsession with My Hero Academia and Naruto at the moment. For these I am looking to pair an OC of mine with your choice from a list of canon characters. BUT, I am DEFINITELY willing to double for you ask anyone from the show, whether it be male or female, young or old.\n\nThe order in which I have listed these characters are from most to least interested in pairing with my OC.\n\nMy Hero Academia: Shinsou Hitoshi, Ojirou Mashirao, Yosetsu Awase, Hanta Sero, Bakugou Katsuki, Kirishima Eijirou, Todoroki Shouto, Denki Kaminari, and Midoriya Izuku.\n\nNaruto: Gaara, Kankuro, Kiba, Shikamaru.\n\nOther fandoms I may be interested in include: Pokemon, Monster Munsume, Twilight, Left 4 Dead, The Walking Dead, maybe more just ask??\n\n\nI hope to hear from you soon! Please message me if anything caught your eye and we can begin plotting!",

I prefer to roleplay with another female unless you accept as a male this is strictly platonic and don't act like a weirdo. I normally do MxF and I like to play female. I also like partners who reply a couple of times a day, at least. Bonus points for many, many times a day. When you reply, I usually reply within the hour unless I'm busy. I am not interested in someone who goes days between replies. Most times, I can rapid fire unless I'm tied up in something. I also only roleplay over email, but I don't mind discussing the roleplay with you over Kik or discord. So if I haven't scared you off, please message me!\n\nAlso please be 21+. I am 25 and not interested in roleplaying with anyone under 21.",

            "selftext": "Hey Naruto lovers! I\u2019ve been craving a long term RP based on Naruto lately and have thought up a little something. Before we begin, please note that this RP is darker and contains adult themes like extreme violence from gore and combat, sex and strong language. If you\u2019re not able to play and enjoy any of these themes, then we\u2019re not compatible. Sorry. As for the regular themes of this RP, I\u2019d like one of the main ones to be detailed romance between our two characters. The others would be the obvious action, suspense, drama, and things like that. \n\nFor this, you\u2019re going to need quite extensive knowledge of the universe, as I do as well. I feel like the RP dynamic would work better if both of us knew what each other was talking about in our replies instead of one of us driving the story and making references. This will be set after the events of Boruto the movie but will have a fair amount of flashback scenes, as I would like to flesh out the relationship between our characters more. I have a story dealing mostly with my character, but I\u2019d love to hear your suggestions and ideas as well.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in pursuing this with me, message me on Reddit so we can move to another platform and  get into the details of the story!",

            "selftext": "Afternoon, everyone. I'm taking a day off from work, and I'd like to continue my search for compatible partners. Right now, I have a few original concepts for medieval fantasy settings, and one that's more paranormal. Maybe one of them will catch your eye. (: **(If you're looking for fandoms, you can check out my other - very old but still relevant - ad [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/52ax8c/f4ma_e_fandoms_bits_of_fluff/).)**\n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you before I get ahead of myself: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); and who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story most of the time, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write fairly SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* My characters in these ideas are all female. I would like a male character to play against mine if possible.\n\n* My real life is kind of a mess right now, so there are times when I might vanish for a couple days. Please, please feel free to poke me. I will let you know if I can or cannot continue. I just want to give you a heads up, since I hate when someone makes me wonder what happened.\n\nAlrighty, so, ideas next? I think so.\n\nA. **Moon Dancers**\n\nThis is another medieval setting, and a brand new idea that sounds appealing.\n \nMost of life as humanity knows it is lived during the day. The world awakens at dawn and retires at dusk, unfailingly. There are nocturnal beasts, of course, but those are just animals. And what traveler or criminal hasn\u2019t stayed up to walk by the moonlight many a time himself? Even still, night is meant for sleep and silence, and daytime for work and play.  But that\u2019s not true of every sentient race in the world.\n \nThere is a race of people, called the Aventine (AH-ven-teen), who not only live their lives at night, but are physically incapable of retaining consciousness in the daytime. Think of them as the \u201celves\u201d of the world \u2013 magical, fairly mysterious, largely peaceful, in tune with nature. Not a lot has been known about them over the centuries. They keep to themselves most of the time.\n \nIn old days, they would even play harmless, good-natured tricks on their human counterparts, or leave playful messages, or sit and soothe a child who had awakened in the night while his parents slept on. There was goodwill between the two peoples. They were seen as anything from myth and folklore, to guardian angels, to fairies, to spirits of good fortune and blessing. But just as with anything people don\u2019t understand, mystery eventually turned to wariness. A wedge was driven between them as mutual suspicion and fear began to take root, and the \u201cMoon Dancers\u201d (humanity\u2019s nickname for them) withdrew into themselves. They have to be the more proactive in protecting themselves, after all, because of their very nature.\n \nLike I said, the Aventine are only active at night. When the morning comes, they immediately fall into a deep slumber, like flowers that only bloom in the evening. Nothing can break that sleep, and it\u2019s not possible to \u201cstay up late.\u201d They\u2019re completely vulnerable if this happens out in the world \u2013 not something you really want when the other race finds you unnerving at best and downright malicious at worst. What usually happens, and is supposed to happen, is that they retreat into the Vale, a magical  place kind of existing outside the normal realm. There, they\u2019re free to sleep and dream away the whole day.\n \nNow, I have in mind to play a young Aventine woman with your typical failings of curiosity, rebelliousness, wanderlust, and inquisitiveness. She\u2019s restless with this careful life of secrecy, always watching the sleepy human towns and villages, wondering if they\u2019re really so bad. I\u2019d like the other role to be left up to you: do you want to play a human? Someone who encounters her, with ensuing potential for adventure as they learn about each other and have to protect each other from their respective peoples? Or do you want to play another Aventine who is either tasked with  keeping her out of trouble or is trying to convince her because he actually cares for her, with that potential for adventure as they\u2019re discovered and cut off from the Vale and have to navigate this terrifying world ruled by humans? There are lots of possibilities here, and I\u2019d really like to brainstorm with you more about the world, the story, etc. The only thing I ask is to play against a male character, because\u2026hopeless romantic.~\n\nB. **The Wyv (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nThere are beings called Wyverns in the world. They have a form that looks like normal humans on the surface, and they were once a thriving, powerful race. They have formidable magic, live extraordinarily long lives, are even purported to have prophetic capabilities, and their other forms are similar to dragons - hence the name. Derp. They lived largely in peace with the other races of the world, even somewhat deified by mortals.\n\nA long time ago, the other races of the world started hunting them like animals, sometimes for the hide of their beast forms, sometimes to harness their magic. They were largely wiped out over the years and are now very rare and *very* hidden. A lot of people actually think they're extinct, and some don't believe they were ever anything more than legends and fairy tales. The discovery of one would be a big deal, and among nations that are in conflict, having something like that in their arsenal would give the holder quite an edge.\n \nI would like to play a young Wyv either in captivity by one such nation, or on the run from it, and I'm looking for someone to build his/her own *non-Wyv* character and collaborate on the world and story with me. I want you to have creative freedom with your character. The only thing I ask is that there be no anthro (human-animal hybrids), and no other Wyv. That would defeat the purpose.\n\nC. **Demon Seed (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\n\nSo, the idea is that there's this one kind of magic that is seen as unholy and evil. It's also an exceedingly rare gift; someone is born with it only once every (insert large amount of time here). There is a legend and superstition surrounding them that says they're the descendants of a demon who in ancient times came and bred with mortal races to corrupt them and steal them away from their benevolent gods. These people are referred to as demon seeds and are both hated and feared. They're seen as bringers of death and misfortune. And over the eons, this view has been supported by the seeds - because being hated and mistreated will ruin people, and many of them became the villains everyone said they were.\n\nMy girl will be the current seed, shrouded in superstition, trying to make sense of what she actually is and how the world sees her. I'd like to discuss more world- and story-building with my partner and leave the other character up to you entirely.\n\nD. **Inseparable (Medieval Fantasy):**\n\nThis one is actually the only one in which I'm not looking for romance. Rather, I'm looking for a deep platonic bond between my character, a sentient creature type, and yours, some sort of humanoid creation (the only races I'd like to avoid are the ones considered anthro, or half creature/half human).\n\nNow, bear with me, here. My character is a half-demon (apparently I'm in a demonic mood?) tigress. There are two \"clans,\" for lack of a better word, of feline creatures that are more than just wild animals. They're bigger, they're sentient, they can \"speak\"; think of them as more spirit creatures than animals. I gave them ridiculously corny names eight years ago when I came up with this, so I'm not going to embarrass myself by putting them here - but essentially, the panthers are bad, and the tigers are...considerably more benevolent. You do not want to run into a panther at the best of times; you only have to worry about a tiger if you've wronged them or the lands they protect. Panthers are demon-cats, like one of my tabbies would be if she had supernatural abilities. If it helps, I'll call the tigers the angels. Guardian spirits, more like.\n\nSo. My character is the product of mixed parentage. Her mother was a tiger; her father was a panther. Don't ask how that happened. The world is not black and white. She lost her mother as a cub, however, when poachers raided the glen her kind called home and pretty much wiped them out (my guess is they had some help, if you know what I mean). I would like to find someone to play a character who finds this little mystical fuzzball, \"raises her,\" probably without either of them really knowing what she is, and thus creates such a sweet, timeless bond of friendship.\n\nWe could either start with their meeting and then time-skip to adulthood a few years later, or start with adulthood. Beyond that, the challenges they face, the rest of the story, any baggage of your character's own to bring into play - that's all open and up for discussion. It's just the relationship and my own character I have.\n\nE. **Wishes &amp; Whims (Flexible):**\n\nSo I had a dream last night, and it's led me to doing some plotting and musing today. I'd like to do something involving a genie, of sorts - only not exactly the typical \"three wishes\" deal. I envision young female spirit sort of being, trapped by some great power and freed by a young man, who then becomes her \"master.\" Now, I'm not talking about *that* kind of master, so kindly get your mind out of the gutter. She would attach to him; want to do things for him and make him happy; protect him at all cost. It may be that once, these beings were in partnership with humanity (and/or other mortal races); a soul link would be created between two individuals who were compatible, and they would fight together, with the human(oid) channeling the spirit's energy. I'm thinking that there are certain people who are *born* with the innate ability to link with them. Perhaps humanity began taking advantage of this partnership/pact system, however, and began using the links to conquer instead of just protect. So, most of them abandoned humanity and refuse to pact now - but she didn't. She still believes, and is waiting for her soulmate.\n\nOr maybe she's just extremely grateful to be freed. I kind of like pact systems, and a bond growing out of that, but I'm totally open to discussion and brainstorming, too! It's just a rough idea I pulled out of the air, anyway.\n\n\nF. **Fish Out of Water (Realistic/Fantasy):**\n\n(Note: This is probably the lowest on my preference list. I've had a few attempts to start it, but it always sort of falls flat. So I'd love to get a really good version going, but I'm a little discouraged about it. Keep that in mind.)\n \nThis is kind of a mix of modern realistic and medieval fantasy settings. It involves a young man from the \"real\" world (our world), and a girl from another world entirely; a world with magic and knights and medieval kingdoms. However, unlike your typical, patriarchal systems, her homeland recognizes equal female authority, as well as female knights and warriors. The world from which she hails is currently under threat of cataclysm, and the girl in question is one of those warriors. Though young, she was tracking down some magical doo-dad to help her country turn the tide of impending doom, but she was intercepted by a powerful sorcerer on the other side. There was a fight, and in the commotion, the artifact was destabilized, and there was an accident. She (along with the object) got dumped into another realm. Boom. Earth. She has no idea where she is, or how to navigate this odd place and its even odder customs.\n \nEnter your character. Whether he's some plain 9-to-5-er, or something more interesting - that's up to you. It may even turn out he's some special, prophesied hero in her world and doesn't know it. The point is the comedy, frustration, and emotion of the fish out of water situation. If you've seen the movie, Enchanted, you can see an example of that - though I'm not intending to play a giddy, stereotypical Disney princess. She's fiery and determined. I do want a bond to form between them, though. And eventually, I think it would even be cool to take the RP back into *her* world, where *he's* the one floundering,\n\nG. **Reverse *Phantom of the Opera* (Paranormal)**:\n\nSo, I've finally seen the show, and I love it, but I'm not looking for a direct copy.  It simply serves as the inspiration for an idea I had; I'd like to switch up the genders (i.e. female phantom) and potentially make her *actually* a ghost of sorts haunting the theatre. It's really just a rough, vague concept, but it's open to all kinds of discussion and interpretation.\n\nH. **Post-Apocalyptic**:\n\nI don't really have any specifics on this; it's more a general genre. However, I do not want zombies. I want something more sci-fi and dystopian than horror or fantasy. Ruined civilizations, humanity struggling to survive... That kind of thing. Rating rules *still* apply here, though!\n\nI. **Paranormal Collaboration**\n\nTalking actual ghosts, here, not just things flying off shelves a la corny ghost hunting \"documentaries.\" I'd love to play a ghost against a human. Skillet's song, \"Lucy,\" inspired me a bit here. \n\nJ. **Science Fiction Collaboration**\n\nI also love sci-fi and am happy to come up with an idea together. Except for my Star Trek love (Voyager), though, I'm not interested in space travel. I like artificial intelligence subjects and futuristic things, but not really keen on aliens and interstellar ambling. \n\nI also have a vague inkling of an idea that came from Nickelback's Lullaby! More fantasy, potentially a modern song but could be medieval. Could also be sci-fi! \n~\n\n...That was really long. I apologize. Hopefully, I didn't lose *all* of you to my incessant rambling. If you're still with me, please feel free to PM me. I **don't** respond to comments, so please use the PM function. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Just to tl;dr. I'm looking for fandoms and original stuff both. The one specific fandom I'm REALLY looking for is Splatoon. Otherwise the rest I'm fine throwing my original stuff into. My Hero Academia, Dragon Ball Z, Skullgirls and Legend of Zelda to name a few. If you're not for either one of those original setting stuff is fine (and preferred) too.\n\nSo, ehh, hi I guess. Preferred name is Extvia. I've been writing for going on 9 years now, write only in 3rd person and am 22. From America and am basically around all the time. Kinda just looking for an active, literate partner for a long term, 1 on 1 plot of a character/interaction driven, over the top, adventure/action RP with a bit of cheesyness and stuff in the mix. I range between half a paragraph to multiple depending on the context within a scene but will allow myself to one-line if it becomes a momentary back and forth chat. I tend to work with rapid fire posting and am not much of one for slower paces. Also if you're on late night and stuff that's 10/10. Cause I've got a night shift-esque sleep schedule.\n\nI'm mostly kinda just here for RP partners and being chummy is fine but that's about as far as it'd go. I'm a bit on the thorny and cynical side and have a thing for being abrasive and offensive sometimes, but mostly on things other than who I'm talking to unless said person is some kind of total chimp.\n\nSo as far as the play itself goes I covered most of it above, but I suppose it'd be best to go into proper detail. I'm interested in those fantastical, unreal sort of adventures with all sorts of action going on but instead of CONSTANT action and fighting I like things rather character/interaction driven. The focus of the story being the two characters involved with the action/adventure being there to influence how they feel and go about things. I'm not much of one for slice of life stuff and mostly only use it momentarily to fill in the gaps. Romance CAN happen but I don't force it. It relies on character chemistry and all my characters are Female and all Lesbian/Gay. I like the two characters to contrast on many levels, both in personality and lifestyle/history. If they're alike it tends to be rather boring. I have a bit of a thing for causing my characters significant issues from time to time, whether it be physical or mental and I'm a bit of a junkie for development and in a sense a character \"blooming\" into something else even if it's only around a select few. Some dark themes are fine but I prefer it in moderation.\n\nI suppose for the lazy types to not read my RP Gateway thing or maybe feel it isn't enough I could put some rules/guidelines here:\n\n\u26ab I prefer plot and largely don't like smut at all and unless it's one of those rare partners I'm really into, if any smut happens at all, would likely just be fade to black. I only do anything of the sort even implying it if justified by the plot, namely the relationship. If they're not all lovey dovey it'd likely never happen.\n\n\u26ab Just about any era is fine but I easily have a bias for some over others.\n\n\u26ab As far as partner post length goes I want it either mirrored or at least half of what I posted if you can't outdo what I did. If you can't do that I am not interested.\n\n\u26ab Literacy and good grammar is mandatory. A few typos is one thing, being an actual clown with it is another.\n\n\u26ab No poofing at random. Having to deal with stuff is a thing yes but you'd best tell me. Cause poofing, especially without warning is REALLY annoying.\n\n\u26ab Long term is basically the only kind of plot I do and I tend to post multiple times a day. If you can only post like 1-3 times a day or something I'm largely not interested.\n\n\u26ab I won't play things other than what I already have on offer and I will not change them in any sort of big way to suit you unless it's a setting I'm actually VERY interested in and even then this mostly only applies to canons. My characters are strong, independent girls with detailed personalities to them and I don't intend to change it for very much of anything or use something else entirely.\n\n\u26ab I'm not much of one for lazy partners. If you're not going to contribute anything, develop any kind of plots, especially ones that don't derail the one already going on and are going to be nothing more than a mere reaction bot, I ain't interested. I'm not interested in doing all the leg work.\n\n\u26ab A quick run down on a few things I automatically will say No to: Furries, a number of current fandoms such as, but not limited to the likes of MLP, FNaF, Undertale, Gravity Falls, Steven Universe and so on. Generic, low fantasy settings like some kind of run of the mill gritty military RP like stuff along the lines of Halo/CoD and I'm not interested in Post Apoc settings at all. I will also never do outright versus/fighting each other RPs.\n\n\u26ab While I do indeed mostly do original stuff, I suppose to give an idea of what I actually do/the kind of high fantasy I mean. Canons I've worked with before and/or know that I am willing to throw myself into if you'd prefer it is: My Hero Academia, Skullgirls, Shantae, and Legend of Zelda. I have a go-to canon setting of choice in Splatoon when original stuff doesn't work or not preferred but I put my high fantasy spin on that as well.\n\n\u26ab I'm more of a person with a preference for toon/anime stuff rather than realistic stuff like faceclaims/reference or storylines. I just do this shit for fun man. So if you do realistic stuff and/or use realistic/IRL face claims I'm likely not interested unfortunately. If you're willing to adjust though that's fine too.\n\nOtherwise if you're interested, go ahead and PM me I guess. Can also look at my profile thing on RP Gateway if you feel like I missed anything and if that don't cover something either just ask in a PM.",

It's always been my favorite pairing and it's been ages since I've been able to write against someone who enjoys their interactions as much as I do.  \n\nObviously, due to the nature of these characters, I am looking for someone willing to write about very dark themes, and clearly this is a M/M pairing (so, if that bothers you, why are you here?) This would also be 'loosely' set in the BBC Sherlock universe.\n\nMore than all that, I'm looking for someone to chat with, become friends with, and just have fun with the rp together. I love writing, and it's always so much more fun when you have someone to gush and giggle and plot with. \n\nI can provide samples of my writing, if you're interested, and I'm willing to play on pretty much any platform that's convenient to you. \n\nHope to hear from you soon~ &lt;3\n\n",

I have a general story that I want to play out, but everything else is up in air. \n\n\n I know that this post in really vague. I did it on purpose because I want to flesh out a story with you.\n\nAs for my partner. I want someone who will be able to RP back and forth for a bit. I understand life happens, but I ask that you let me know so that I don't think that you ghosted me. Also, I want someone who is creative and will develop the story with me, not someone who idly responds to what my character does. ",

It's so close and pungent you can almost taste it. Disgusting. On the brink of death you soil your pants, you're sobbing crying out for your mortal parent when a glorious figure comes out from the trees. They appear to be glowing and you swear their hair is made of gold. They pull their arm back to reveal their bow, already set with an arrow that goes soaring into the beast's eye. BOOM! It explodes into fine gold dust that gets everywhere. You're frozen in shock. What just happened? The figure introduces themselves as a child of- of Apollo?! If Apollo's real does that mean so is Aphrodite and Dionysus?! Yeeeeaaaaaaahhh buddy!\n\nCome one, come all have your character fall into this server's hands!
