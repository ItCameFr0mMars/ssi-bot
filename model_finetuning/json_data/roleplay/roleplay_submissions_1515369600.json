            "selftext": "**Hey /roleplay!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\n&gt; I am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\n&gt; I don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n&gt; When it comes to where we RP I have four choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\n&gt; Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n&gt; This is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n* The Witcher (Currently craving this the most.)\n\n**World Building**\n&gt; I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

            "selftext": "_Dimensions_ is a fairly new project that is based on the Original Character and World of the owner, who has been creating and developing it for the past 6 years.\n\nThe World consists of five interconnected dimensions, which are all heavily influenced by the immortal families ruling in them.\n\n**Assiah** is a world similar to ours which became aware of the possibility of the supernatural during the first World War. The anomalous is generally frowned upon and hated, so the 3% of the populaon with special powers have to hide it from the rest of the world. Pretty much noone knows about the existence of the other Dimensions in here.\n\n**Hyrux** is a beautiful forest world, featuring high mountains, a few different tribes of people and an abundance of odd mammals. Its inhabitants are more hunter-like. 73% of this world is in-tune with their special abilities, and most of the best healers come from here. It's the largest dimension, followed by **Assiah**.\n\n**Imecester** is, as opposed to **Hyrux**, a war-torn world in the hands of Vance Crpyt where the last of the Resistance is still all that's left to purge from the world.\n\u00a0\n**Gehenna** is basically what we would call hell and the smallest Dimension out of all five. This world hails different demons and the like. Some supernatural abilities are suppressed by the properties of this dimension.\n\n**Allodas** is the Dimension, the second smallest at that, created by the Hale Family. Nobody apart from Serah Hale, the last remaining member of the family, lives there.\n\nThere's a lot more to the lore which you can find in the appropriate channel on the server, the post would be too long if I'd include all of it.\n\nNow, this Server isn't exactly for everyone and heavily relies on character interactions, making most of the Roleplay player-driven. You can be part of a larger company in Assiah, run by humans with anomalous powers, be someone living on their own with anomalous piwers or just be a regular civilian who gets involved in the supernatural. Be the leader of a tribe in Hyrux, or an outcast with no special abilities. In Imecester you could be part of the militarized Resistance fighting against Cance Crypt, in Gehenna you could be in charge of a demon serving Satan himself. Or be a member of one of the Families, possessing powerful abilities and immortality!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThere's a wide range of possible roles, you can always ask if you want to be something or someone which isn't listed in this list!\n\n\nThe server will contain NSFW material. Erotica and the like is prohibited, but explicit scenes of violence may pop up from time to time, so the minimum age required to join is, quite obviously, 18.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to state it in the comments or shoot me a PM - that also applies if you want an Invite to the server.",

            "selftext": "**Hello, everybody! My name is Quibii, and I shall be guiding you through my little introduction and advertisement.** \n\n*Preface;* As the title states, I am looking for a role-play set within the Elder Scrolls universe! Below, I'll note down my own qualifications, a couple of details regarding the universe (more specifically, non-canon changes I would like to include/alter,) as well as what I'd seek in a partner! I'll try to keep it as short and concise as possible. \n\n***Qualifications:*** \n&gt; I have been role-playing for close to ten or so years now, originally through e-mail, though I much prefer instant messages these days. I have been working on improving my craft the entire time, and while I won't say it's by any means perfected, I am relatively content with it. Always room for improvement though, right? I am also more than fluent in the English language, seeing as it is my one and only language. (I would love to learn French someday, though!) Lastly, I'd like to think I'm relatively flexible. When it comes to characters, I can go for the most lithe of Altmer ladies, or the most brutish Bretons. I can go with action and adventure, romance, or if you'd like, you can see what that NSFW tag is all about. \n\n***The Roleplay:*** Is not actually something set in stone! I have a few small ideas, which I can detail a little bit below, but for the most part, I would like to discuss a concept with my partner! \n\n\n**Buried Riches:** \n&gt; The local inn is abuzz, mercenaries being round up to march towards an underground burial site. Gold and gems and riches beyond imagining are said to rest underneath, but nobody can handle what lays down below on their own. \n\n\n**The Diplomatic Solution:** \n&gt; Tensions rise amongst the nations of Tamriel. Border incidents, disagreements and more. The only thing these leaders would listen to is steel at their throats. \n\n\n**Oblivion's Wrath:** \n&gt; Everyone knows something is wrong. Atronachs where wildlife should roam, imps and scamps harassing farmland. Something's wrong, but nobody can figure out what. \n\n\n\n***The Elder Scrolls Universe:***\n&gt; This is the universe in which the series of Elder Scrolls games is set, from Arena, all the way to Skyrim, including everything in between as well as the various spin-offs. While I love the setting, I would like to include a couple of tweaks within the universe. But please, if something seems off about my knowledge of the lore, please let me know otherwise! I am very much fond of the universe, but I am far from knowing everything surrounding it. \n\n\u2022 **Technical Magics**\n&gt; While I am fond of the magic on Nirn, I've also been fond of the idea of making it a little more technical and methodical. There wouldn't be as much shooting-fireballs-from-your-hands (like bandits seem to enjoy,) but a more practiced system. While magic could still be performed with nothing but a hand, I like to imagine things like firing bolts of electricity from your palms to be something only the likes of Divayth Fyr could accomplish. Instead, most magic without an apparatus of sorts would be little more than cantrips. Scrying, creating spheres of light, most things that would fall under Alteration, Illusion and Mysticism. That's not to say all magics under those trees would be available, nor is it to say anything not under those categories would require more. Perhaps a small bolt of ice could be conjured, or even a small ember being formed within a Mage's palm, albeit seldom on a combative scale. \n\n&gt; As a result, I'd like to imagine the more powerful and offensive magics requiring one of two methods; that of a scroll, or of a staff. With a scroll, my head-canon is that it would take a lot of time and effort to perfect writing a scroll. It would need to be done in such a way to avoid any kind of error--where one wrong slip of the wrist would render the entire scroll unusable. However, the scroll could only be used with a soul gem. I like to imagine it as being a catalyst and entry-point for the magic to reach the physical realm. Say the scroll is to shoot a ball of fire--that fire would release from the soul gem. That's the first method of casting larger spells. \n\n&gt; The second involves a staff, which would also be imbued with a soul gem. A staff could do one of two things; it could simply cast a set spell, based on the inscription near the \"top\" of it, or it could amplify a spell cast into it. That small ember in your palm, when channelled into a certain staff, would become a blazing torrent of flames. \n\n&gt; Now, a soul gem itself, would need to be powered to be used in any of these things. (Aside from a staff that would amplify magics. That would need to be empty.) But for the Mage that isn't as comfortable trapping a living soul inside of a small crystal, it could also be fused with raw magicka, allowing for the same effect without having to kill someone. \n\n&gt; This is generally how I'd like to imagine magic on Tamriel. Of course, there are exceptions, but generally speaking I'd like to imagine this is how it would go. Feel free to ask me any questions regarding it, or discuss that section further! Onto the second point; \n\n\n\n\u2022 **Political and Militaristic Infrastructure:**\n&gt; While I would like to try to stick with the established lore as much as possible, I also wouldn't mind making some alterations to the aforementioned aspects to make it a little more...stream-lined. Expanding the Imperial Legion's ranking system as seen in Skyrim, for example. Auxiliary, Praetor, General. Going a little more in-depth into each of these roles, having alternative titles based on military role (such as archers,) so on and so forth. This sort of alteration would also apply to other factions, to make things a little more official. Hammerfell having its own military branch, titles, roles, and the like. \n\n&gt; Likewise, while some aspects of the hierarchy have been detailed, such as the Emperor of the Imperial Empire, others haven't been as in-depth, such as within the Black Marsh. While remaining true to the source material, I would like to make things a little more specific in that regard. For example, you have the Emperor and the Elder Council. Below that, perhaps it is something of an aristocracy. \n\n\n\n\u2022 **Population**\n&gt; This is a rather brief subject. While in games, the population of cities barely reaches thirty, the actual lore is likely to be a much larger number. I'd like to find a middle-ground between the two, where fifteen soldiers isn't considered a huge amount, but twenty thousand is seen as impossibly large. I wish I could put into words exactly why I'd like to do things like this. Of course, if you'd rather alter things in that regard, that's fine too. \n\n\n\n\u2022 **History and Relations**\n&gt; I don't plan on altering an entire history! That's half of what makes the Elder Scrolls as interesting as it is. However, I'll put it this way. Let's say Hammerfell was to invade Skyrim, 4E, 201. Making sure that is a little more plausible would be nice. The Great War having had a slightly larger impact on both the Empire's and the Aldmeri Dominion's forces. (Granted, it already did, but hopefully you get where I'm going with this!) The accepting of the White-Gold Concordat and the renouncing of Hammerfell being a much larger insult and offensive declaration than it may have been, things of that nature, I suppose. \n\n\n\n***What I'd Like In A Partner:*** \n&gt; We're nearing the end! Rejoice! I'll try to be brief about what I'd like in a partner, since at this point parts of the text editor have turned black and I'm concerned I might lose my text. \n\n\u2022 **Patience:** This is a huge thing for me! I've had people get upset after half an hour of not responding. It leaves a sour taste in my mouth, and can become a slight bit irksome. That's not to say checking up on me is a bad thing, but don't get all bent out of shape if I take a little bit. \n\n\u2022 **Understanding &amp; Decency:** I'd rather not get my head bitten off because of one little thing. We can be adults, can't we? \n\n\u2022 **Elder Scrolls Knowledge:** Don't get me wrong, I'm still very much learning, myself. But I'd rather not have to explain when someone's coming up to me going; \"eyo what's dat lizard boi.\" I'm happy to answer questions, truly, but please have at least some kind of knowledge! Just a little bit! \n\n\u2022 **Length &amp; Literacy:** Though I don't like to put a fine point on things (for example, if there's nothing but dialogue, there might not be much else to type,) I would like at least a paragraph, with a decent grasp of the English language. I understand if mistakes happen, or if English isn't even your first language! But at least try somewhat, please. \n\n***Epilogue:*** If you've read this far, kudos! And of course, thank you for reading. I feel like I'm forgetting something that I should have added, but perhaps I'll just edit that in. (I'm sure I'll need to edit this post anyway for formatting reasons.) Thank you for reading all of this, and I hope you have a nice day!",

You guys choose EVERY single thing- nothing is off limits, so I can't control what you do- however, my job is to play as the NPCs, tell you what loot you manage to scrape by, say when a zombie enters the room, etc. Basically, I determine the result of your actions based on multiple factors, involving a few die rolls and arbitrary thinking both on my part and yours.\n\nLike I said, it will be somewhat arbitrary and besides setting up some preset die roll chances for each action I won't be creating many rules because we're not actually playing DnD.\n\nIt would be over discord, long-term, and rapid-fire. We'd get together at preset times, say twice a week, and have 2-3 hour sessions of rapid-fire RP. Deep characters wanted with development, quirks, and flaws.\n\nPM me on here if interested.\n\nAlso, since this is longterm and will require a LOT of effort from my part, I ask that before you join you to consider if you really have time to make a dedication like this and will work with me to make the game fun. \n\nLooking forward to it!",

Pardon our Dust is a high fantasy free form roleplay taking place in a sprawling setting that you're entirely free to explore, containing optional main narratives, and a community-driven storyline. You're welcome to test characters, roleplay with the community, and generally enjoy your stay if you decide to join. Roleplayers of all experience levels welcome.\n\nOur goal is to make a casual environment for players to roleplay in a large scale setting with plenty of room for player character interactions. While we have a secondary goal of progressing a major storyline, having a place for any roleplayers who are looking to scratch that fantasy itch in an accommodating environment comes first and foremost.\n\n   &gt; Pardon our dust takes place on a planet named Kestera, home to three diverse continents and whatever character you choose to make. The initial setting is firmly nestled in the remains of an Empire that's long since fallen, the remnants having settled to form four city states west of the barren landscape their empire once held. A small and quaint land, but still vibrant and full of the chance to make a fortune, make a name, or make a home for yourself wherever you might please.\n\n   &gt; Whether you're a warrior, a mage, or somewhere in between, you'll be able to find something to do in this land. Annual festivals have begun, kingdoms are looking for workers and contracts to be completed, and other issues are starting to crop up throughout the surrounding city-states.\n\nWhile we are a free form setting that doesn't use any form of stats or systems, you're welcome to import a character and adapt to the setting from whatever form they might already be in. D&amp;D, Pathfinder, Fate, anything is fine.\n\nIf any of the above sounds remotely interesting to you, come check out the Discord at:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/rEfEDjW",

            "selftext": "Long ago, society had deemed wielders of Magic, too dangerous to be allowed to coincide with the world of the Pure. Witches, elementals, and magical creatures where all banished outside of the realm of Rionet to the Dark Forests of Dalmeu left to hopefully rot. However, the wielders of Magic slowly have integrated themselves back into Rionet - the original clans long dead, now generations later hidden amongst the Pure.  \n   Many of the witches alive now have never even been near the edge of the realm, the Dalmeu were a story passed down by parents, elders, anyone trying to make the newer generations of witches understand that magic was to be hidden under every circumstance. Not that it mattered most magic blood wasn\u2019t even strong enough to be used without the aid of magic relics which were stolen and hid away by Purist long ago. \n   Now hundreds of years later, there has been a uprising of the children of Dalmeu, hellbent on reclaiming the artifacts of the past in order to regain their strength. Many humans have joined your cause. Helping you to reclaim wands, stones, books, anything to help you and your kind take down the Purist. \n  However, the Pure have caught wind of this, and have set out their own precautions in order to stop this uprising. They have bred a group of witch hunters, brainwashing them since they were babes to hate witches, fear them, kill them or anyone who stood in their way. Their mission in life is to bring what they see as an abomination to an end. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nIn this roleplay, I would like for you play as one of the male witches left in the world. He is part of the rebellion and wishes to see magic flourish again. It is important to note, magic is not used for evil, most witches use their powers for good or not at all. You and your small party are on a mission to retrieve a elemental stone locked away deep beneath the ground in a Purist temple. You are ambushed by a party of witch hunters and a fight ensues. \n\nHowever one of the hunters catches your eye, you can sense something is different about her. You discover your suspicion is correct when she takes the stone from the alter and the water in the room nearest to the two of you reacts to her. After dealing with the other two hunters, your party goes to kill the stone holder, who has passed out from the exhaustion of the magic coursing through her body. You save her, informing your party she to has magic within her. \n\nFrom there, you take her back to your city, stone in tow and try to discover who she is, how she has magic, and see if you can discover the truth behind the Purists. Unfortunately for you, taming her will be a difficult task- but one you are determined to complete. You can feel her strength, one that might be enough to save everyone. \n\nI typically write 2-3 paragraphs in third person. I prefer detailed writers, but obviously I don\u2019t need an essay for every response haha. As for my platforms, I have discord (preferred), Skype, and kik. \n\nIf you\u2019re still reading, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a little interested! I\u2019d like for this roleplay to involve romance between the two characters, action, and drama. There\u2019s a lot of wiggle room in the plot so if you have any questions or suggestions shoot me a pm. Can\u2019t wait to hear from you! ",

            "selftext": "**Hey /roleplay!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\n&gt; I am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\n&gt; I don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n&gt; When it comes to where we RP I have four choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\n&gt; Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n&gt; This is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n* The Witcher (Currently craving this the most.)\n\n**World Building**\n&gt; I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

I have a job and am in school so I don't want a partner who is looking for immediate replies. I want someone who is patient and likes to talk and plot and take things slow.\n\n- Harry Potter\n\n- MCU\n\n- Hunger Games\n\n- Pokemon\n\n- Yokai Watch\n\n- Fruits Basket\n\n- Death Note\n\n- Your Lie in April\n\n- Naruto\n\n- Yu Yu Hakusho\n\n- Legend of Korra\n\n- DBZ\n\n- Game of Thrones\n\n- Dot Hack\n\n- Doctor Who\n\n- Star Trek\n\n- Fire Emblem\n\n- Oban Star Racers\n\n- Alice 19th\n\n- Parks and Rec\n\n- The Good Place",

            "selftext": "**Introduction:** I am female, in college and looking for one or two writing buddies. I have a few right now but I feel I could add one or two more without much trouble. You can expect a post from me about once a day, maybe once every couple of days. The pace isn't expected to be quick so I do expect more than a few lines even in dialogue situations. \n\nI like to write several (3-5) paragraphs (4-7 sentences usually) and hope I can find someone who feeds off rich detail and notices the little things. Ideally my partner should feel comfortable discussing plot or letting me know if a post is going to be delayed. But most importantly, my partner should contribute and feel just as interested in the story as I am. It's awkward when I feel like my partner has lost interest. If my partner does lose interest or is having a tough time, I'd want to be able to help and change things up, but just giving up or going silent isn't going to work for me. \n\nGiven the MCU is pretty mature, mature scenes will likely take place but I am not comfortable with excessive mature content that is forced or unnecessary. I value plot and development above all else. Lastly, this is about having fun. Writing is a treasured outlet for me and I'm sure there are many who feel the same way. If a post takes a few weeks to get back to me, I'm fine with waiting. A post should never feel like a job so only write when you have time and the motivation. But keep me in the loop whenever possible so we can keep things moving.\n\n**Plots:** Below are some rough ideas I have involving the movie LOGAN and the Netflix shows JESSICA JONES and DAREDEVIL. If anyone had any suggestions or tweaks, let me know via PM so we can brainstorm further. Also, some roles can be shared if desired. As a note these all deal with Logan being a father to Laura. I loved that aspect and would love to explore it further because it brought such humanity to Logan. If that's not your cup of tea though, let me know and we'll see what we can do.\n\nEssentially I need a Logan but as stated below I'm willing to double and help play other roles. Hopefully we can work something out. :)\n\n- Set in 2029 (LOGAN-timeline) Raven has lost touch with Charles and Erik. She poses as a nurse named Gabriela in order to keep an eye on Transigen's activites. She befriends Laura and soon the two escape once X-24 has been created. The children and Raven are separated but know to go to Eden and to be there as soon as possible. Raven, still disguised as Gabriela, tracks down Logan looking for help and to introduce him to Laura, his daughter. Logan reluctantly takes the job to escort them to North Dakota and it's Charles who immediately knows Gabriela is in fact Raven. The four take a road trip through America's heartland, pillaging labs owned by Transigen and helping others along the way. Raven wants to find Erik and knows Laura will be a valued asset in bringing down Transigen but along the way, she and Logan develop a deep bond while trying to raise Laura in the real world.\n\n*Roles I can play: Laura, Charles, Caliban, and Raven.*\n\n- Set in modern day. Basically we're inserting the LOGAN plot into JESSICA JONES. Logan is a driver in NYC, making some extra money since the school hasn't been doing so well as of late. There is an underground lab in NYC that has been producing mutants under the order of a man obsessed with special people and special powers: Kilgrave. Kilgrave was saved at the end of season one by a company calleds Transigen. Kilgrave then offered them his DNA to be the first to be tested. Experiments went by quickly and soon a girl named Laura (X-23) is created. Meanwhile Jessica has been following leads about Transigen's actions and soon runs into Logan, needing a getaway Uber, as the two try to save the mutants with the help of Laura, who managed to escape the lab and take refuge in Jessica's apartment building. \n\n*Roles I can play: Laura, Jessica, Kilgrave, Trish and Donald.*\n\n- Set in modern day, between season one and two of DAREDEVIL. Logan and Matt cross paths at Fogwell's Gym one day. The two men bond over a drink and Logan knows instantly that Matt isn't some blind lawyer. He's more than that. One night as Logan is drunkenly wandering back to his apartment in Hell's Kitchen, the Devil of Hell's Kitchen stops a woman from being mugged. Logan steps in and they both realize who the other person is. Now with their secrets out in the open, Matt tries to convince Logan to help him fight justice on the street but Logan doesn't want any trouble. One day a nurse named Gabriela comes into Matt's office looking for help, she found a girl named Laura in an alley and she wants to adopt her. Matt is of course touched and he and Karen work together to help Laura find a new home. Without notice, Gabriela is murdered and Logan shows and interest when he notices Gabriela worked for a company called Transigen, people who Logan has been hunting down since he moved to Hell's Kitchen. Together, they dig deeper to understand Laura and who her father is.\n\n*Roles I can play: Laura, Karen, Matt, Foggy, Gabriela and Donald.*\n\n- Set in modern day. Essentially a mix of LOGAN, JESSICA JONES and DAREDEVIL. Set in the middle of season one of JESSICA JONES and after season one of DAREDEVIL; Logan, Matt and Jessica all find themselves at the same bar. A fight breaks out and the three jump into action out of instinct. The three aren't exactly interested in combing forces and part ways without as much as an introduction to one another. With Kilgrave still on the prowl, Jessica decides it may not hurt to have more muscle on her side so she first tracks down Matt who was easy enough to find. While trying to find out whatever the clawed guy is up to, Jessica stumbles across a young girl who has claws too. She's not who Jessica is looking for but Jessica thinks Laura has gotta be related to Logan so she takes Laura under her wing. Eventually Logan is spotted and the four have a conversation about who Laura is and why the others should be worried about Kilgrave. Kilgrave soon gets Matt alone and gets him under his control, leaving Laura, Jessica and Logan to save Matt and bring down Kilgave. Admittedly this plot isn't as fleshed out but it can be improved upon privately I'm sure.\n\n*Roles I can play: Laura, Karen, Foggy, Matt and Jessica.*",

This is literally the end of the world! There is no Superman. There is no one to save us. It is only a matter of time until we're all wiped out.\n\nThe demons attacked the south dorms first. None of the witches in the dorm had enough time to prepare, but their sacrifices gave the others time. They were able to make it to safer ground. Though all of them knew that it wouldn't be safe for long. All they could do now was look through books to find a way to kill these demons. Or die trying.\n\nThey heard it on the news. Well, before the station cut out, but even so, they went north. The demons couldn't be used to cold weather, could they? The snow is fresh and still falling. Their heavy fur will keep them safe from the chill. Yet, these werewolves needed to come up with a better plan if they were going to survive.\n\nHe could not leave his room. The sunlight was still too strong for him to venture out. This vampire would wait until night to flee. At least he had immortality. Those poor, poor humans.\n\nA shadow atop a building, snorted. How could a rip in the planes this size happen? The first demons out aren't even the ones that should frighten them. If they cannot defeat hell hounds, there is no way that they would ever be able to defeat a Behemoth. The shadow demon shook its head. There was not much it could do in this situation, but report back to the queen.\n\n~~~~~~\n\nHello, hello!\n\nAs you read, demons have escaped from the Negative Plane and are running wild across our plane. You would be playing one of the few survivors/fighters. You can be any one of the races I have described above in this RP (even a demon!). I have set up lore for each other them, but I'm open to suggestions on changes!\n\nThere is a plot I have in mind, but I want each character to still have motivation to keep living without my plot. I want to keep this RP driven, but give everyone room to be able to do something they love with their character.\n\nI would prefer this to have **longer** and **detailed** posts, so this RP might be a little slower paced. I hope this will encourage people of all schedules to join in!\n\nHere is the link to the server:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/sj6nWZg\n\nI look forward to preparing you for the end of the world!",

There is a magical shield around him.  \n \n You see more people awake and you are informed you are in a mansion in the middle of the forest, and you will all participate in a game: There is no escape and to survive, you must complete the jobs the owner and his helpers put upon you all while you discover the truth behind this mansion and its sick game. \n \n The woodland mansion is a puzzle roleplay with quest and mystery-horror vibe based on Danganronpa, you will be tasked with different missions to follow in order to get punished or rewarded and a mystery left by the previous owner, girly, who seems to not be around anymore. \n NSFW might occur and its allowed but is not the main focus of the game nor the roleplay.\n \n Join with this link: https://discord.gg/dVHxjz9",

            "selftext": "The history books, what little copies were left anyway, stated that there had been an \"alien asteroid\" that had visited the solar system way back in 2017. Scientists back then had assumed that, given how fast it was moving, there was no way it was on an orbital path. Turns out, they were wrong. Centuries later, the asteroid returned. Urgent messages had been sent out, warnings to get to safety, to find shelter, that the asteroid was much, much larger than they'd anticipated, going much faster than they'd calculated, and was heading straight for us. Too little, too late. The asteroid slammed right into the Atlantic Ocean, so far in that it pierced the bottom of the ocean and still had a mile left sticking out at the top. Worse, the impact caused tsunamis of untold heights. The entirety of most continents were completely washed over. They thought that was the end of it, that the worst had passed. They were wrong. \n\nThe worst was just beginning; the asteroid had hit us in just the right spot, at just the right angle to push us ever so slightly closer to our Sun. Naturally, temperatures began to rise, and when the floods began to evaporate away, revealing streets and houses that had been hidden for several months, they took it as a sign of good things to come. They were wrong. \n\nThings continued to heat up, Drying out out streets. Ponds and lakes that could never have run dry normally began to shrink. Ocean levels began to drop, even despite the extra water being dumped into the ocean by all the glacial caps being melted so quickly. Soon, all that was left was sand and wind. All the technology had been more or less wiped out, so reliant on power lines and electricity were we; as such, there was no way to gauge how long this unbearable summer would last. The only thing for it was to sit and wait it out. \n\nAnd wait we did. The summer, usually two to three months long, ran a grueling six months, with it's hottest being around the middle three months; it was almost impossible to go outside during those months at all. Finally things began to cool off. The hopeful ones took it as a relief, a sign that things were going back to normal. The poor hapless fools. The others tried to warn them that there was a new balance to things now; extreme heat meant extreme cold. And when the temperatures finally cooled down, when the snowfall began, new dread arose in those who survived. A new season meant a new set of dangers to ward off. \n\nIt took a few years, but eventually they began to learn, began to see the signs of what was coming, and how to prepare for it. They redeveloped older technologies; windmills and solar panels which provided the power they needed. One by one, small groups and clans or survivors moved towards a safe location, deemed to be one of the safest places that the earth had left to offer. A spot, somewhere in what used to be the Indian Ocean. Many still referred to it as that though; it somehow gave it a sense of reality of the name changed and besides, an ocean of water wasn\u2019t too different from an ocean of sand. \n\nSlowly, they began to build and expand. It took then well over four decades but finally, New Haven was built. So many people striving for one goal: Thrive. History books were being rewritten, even as Haven developed. They wrote of the Apolcalypse, of the harsh summers and winters, of the development of Haven, of the reestablishment of the first official government since the New World began. \n\nOf course, with the government came rules and regulations, and with those came criminals. Petty things were dealt with harshly; a small theft resulted in being thrown out of Haven with only a small pack to allow one\u2019s survival. \n\nThese people formed their own camps here and there, becoming nomadic in nature. In order to provide support, so as not to appear entirely cruel, Haven began airdropping supplies now and then, but the locations were always randomized. They used to drop them three times a week, then it dropped to three times a month. Eventually, they only began dropping once a month. \n\n A lot of the stragglers stuck on the outside relied on Haven's airdrops to continue surviving. The drop spots became literal warzones for about a day or two before the remaining survivors decided to divvy up the supplies amongst each other and go on their way. Haven always launched the supplies far enough away from the city to where the sounds of fighting wouldn\u2019t carry to them. \n\nWe never formed together though; it was the unspoken rule of fives among all the stragglers and wanderers outside of Haven. No groups of five held up past five days, nor raided more than five supply drops together. It was a tough system but our fear was that perhaps someone would form another group, build another Haven somewhere, and do what New Haven did to us. We couldn\u2019t let that happen. \n\n------------\n\nHey there! So I had a lot of success with this plot the last time I posted it. I know the science is more than a little wonky but cut me some slack lol. \n\nMy ideal partner is a female in my age group (20-26) able to play a minimum of two characters and able to write at least two to five paragraphs per post. This plot is meant to just be a background for us to develop a plot to RP with! \n\nI hope to see those orange envelopes!",

We used to have over a half dozen concurrent role plays, and the goal is to get to that point again. \n\nWe have recently started a new Fantasy RP and we're accepting new characters, whether original characters or characters based off of other universes. Our rules are straightforward, and our staff will help if there is a dispute. The styles of role play differ from channel to channel, but it's mostly open, free-form role play. \n\nIf you are interested in joining us, you may contact me directly, or follow [this discord link.](https://discord.gg/y2e7PDu)\n\n*PS: This server has several NSFW sharing channels, if you don't like that, just don't apply the NSFW role for yourself.*",

I've toured around and peeked into a couple of wonderful servers that have been advertised here, but they've all lacked a certain quality that is hard to put my finger on. I figure by this point, if you can't join 'em, beat 'em!\n\nI've been roleplaying for close to fourteen years now. Granted I wasn't a prodigy and didn't start out very well. It has taken at least ten to eleven years for me to reach a place where I feel confident with my own writing (we're our own worst critics, after all). I've led several projects in the past, ranging from RP Forums, World of Warcraft Heavy-RP Guilds, Dungeons &amp; Dragons Tabletop / Online Campaigns, and Instant Messenger RP Groups. It has been one helluva journey and I'm excited to start up a new project that will hopefully have a solid, lasting run.\n\nRight now I am in need of other versed writers who are interested not only in the world of BnHA, but are interested in helping me run this project. I already have a Discord in the works (I'm always updating it when I have the spare time), but I lack the staffing backbone to see this start comfortably. That's where you fantastic people come in. I've met a lot of personalities here in /r/roleplay, a lot of them great, but I have a lot of hope we can build something awesome.\n\nIf you're interested in helping me lay down the ground floor, taking up moderator roles or dedicating yourself to a teaching role within the roleplay, please feel free to message me here on reddit or inquire below. I'll answer any questions you have and do a quick screening on reddit or Discord to get a feel for you, just to see if you've got the right head for the job.\n\nThank you for reading! I hope to hear from you fine folks soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm looking for some good partners for both original and fandom settings. Here, I'm listing my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts, as they're still applicable. (I also have the beginnings of a fantasy or sci-fi thing based off Nickelback's \"Lullaby,\" if that interests anyone...)\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* Please, for the love of Cruxis, do not ask me what medium I want to use for RP. I use tags in my titles for a reason, and when people ask me questions that I've *obviously* already answered, it's a pretty big turn-off; it means, or at least looks like, you didn't bother to actually pay attention.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina) \n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! (Please note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.)",

I have *not* read the full series, so bear with me on that, but I have read through 9 at the very least before. It won't take me long to finish, but in any case I'm more interested in setting up a story before the series. \n\nSpecifically, when it comes to WoT, I love the dichotomy of men and women in the universe. The Aes Sedai and their Warders, of the Aes Sedai and the male channelers, of kings and queens, or even the Seanchan and their *damane*. I have a feeling there's a lot of potential within the universe for a fun one x one storyline.\n\nI added the NSFW tag because Wheel of Time has the potential to be a very dark, mature series, and I'd like to approach that. The Darkfriends can be brutal, the nature of magic can be personal, and the relationships forged can be very intense. I am looking for an 18+ partner only; I am an adult myself and prefer to write with fellow adults. \n\nI write 3rd person past tense on discord or reddit. Discord is far better for prompt replies. ",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm looking for someone who'd be willing to roleplay in a very specific type of setting, of course, as the title suggests, we will be creating our very own haven of gloom and doom, and I'll have to specify that I'm not really looking for compromise. I won't be doing any other sort of roleplay until I'm satisfied with this story, but, I wouldn't be against a more permanent partner if things go well.\n\nNow, before I go into the details of what is a \"dark fantasy world\" in my opinion, I'll just have my usual warnings. I'd like you to be fairly cautious when it comes to mistakes of all kinds, I often make them, and I really don't care about stylistic choices, but please be careful. Considering the theme of this RP, I'd also like to point out that there might be some mature elements to it, including gore and violence of all kinds, but the language might be a bit more tame, since it is after all a fantasy world, excessive swearing using \"modern\" expressions is a bit out of place. Finally, I'm particularly lenient when it comes to the size of your posts, because I, myself, am not really good at elongating my paragraphs, and would much prefer quality over quantity.\n\nIf you're still reading this, maybe you're the right person! We'll just have to see if you're interested in my notion of dark fantasy. What I'm looking for is more akin to Berserk (the anime), the Souls series (videogames) and Kingdom Death (the boardgame) then, say, Game of Thrones or the Conan universe. This setting will be built on a foundation of hopelessness for our characters, and a recurring theme will most likely be their inability to fight back against whatever might be an obstacle to them. But, I'm also a very romantic girl, and I can't say I don't love it when heroes manage to overcome the adversity.\n\nThat's that! If you're interested, leave me a PM with your questions and/or Skype name.\n\nThank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "###Hello there! First things first, I only have Reddit on my laptop. Therefore, I do not receive notifications when a PM is sent. Please have patience as I will likely respond between a 2-hour time window. I promise I'm not ignoring you! I just go to school full time. \n\n#I am currently looking for a male or someone who can play a male to do a modern day, romance roleplay! I exclusively use Discord and am not willing to use any other platform. Sorry! \ud83d\ude05\n\nI have been roleplaying for about 5 years now, and I guess one could say I am pretty good. I also am currently writing my own novels. I always roleplay full lit, and my responses are typically 1-3 paragraphs. Of course, that will vary between responses, as they depend on the course the plot is taking. Usually at the beginning, my responses will be pretty long (3-5), but of course, they will go down in length as the scene and characters are introduced and established. Remember, quality over quantity! I do usually do NSFW in my role plays, and would like someone who is capable of integrating it into the plot without making it the main focus or rushing into it.\n\nThough I'm pretty open to all role play idea's I prefer, if not exclusively, do romance plots. However, this does not mean its sub-genre can't be something else! For example, I did a role play a while ago involving a mayor who was at a constant risk of being assassination and her bodyguard, who protected her with all he had. The main genre was romance and the sub-genre was drama/action! ***I do not, however, do fandoms, fantasy, or any pre-modern plots (Though the most back I am willing to go in a time era is the 1930\u2019s)***\n\n###Here are some good things to do, and bad things to do/be when roleplaying with me!\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0Please be literate! I don't ask you to speak like a human dictionary, but I do ask you to be mindful of basic grammar skills. *For example, knowing the difference between to/too/two, their/there/they're, wear/where proper spelling of simple words etc.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Try and 'mirror' my replies. *For example, when I write a reply of a few paragraphs, I would expect the same in response. Likewise, when I write a few sentences, you don't have to write a whole novel of a reply.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0I would really love to be able to talk out of character, both for planning and just to talk! It's absolutely not necessary, but I just because I feel as though a good relationship between partners can always improve the role play and better the communication of what is going on in the plot.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Though not an absolute requirement, I prefer when the partner I'm role playing with chooses characters that have the 'Alpha Male' Personality. (Being confident, Dominating, Cocky, Aggressive, Possessive, sometimes a total dick)\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I like when my partners can come up with new characters and personalities unlike the last for the different role plays we may do.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do pretty much only Third person. I just prefer it, but I may be willing to change it to First\ud83d\ude04\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't use text speech or little asterisks when you write. I really prefer when my partner writes just as a book would be. *For example; She looked up at him with big eyes, shining from the tears in them. \"You don't understand, do you.\" She murmurs lowly, trying to contain herself. \"I love you and you don't even look at me\"*\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just I will you, please understand if my replies aren't immediate. I do go to school full time and I hope you can understand when I don\u2019t respond quickly. I will be able to reply throughout the day, just don't get upset if I reply a little later than when you sent it. I will, of course, be just as understanding with you!\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though a character face claim is not necessary, I like them to get a better image of what your character looks like. Also, I need all characters to have a bio, as it makes things like personality and background more clear. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD *PLEASE* NO ANIME FC. \n\nThough I don't have very many plot ideas at the moment, I have lots of OC's and I am more than willing to hear any ideas you have and even brainstorm a new one together!\n\n###REMINDER! If I go a few days without replying/messaging you, *please* don't think I left you hanging! I am likely either busy, or your message didn't come through to me! I will never end a role play without telling you I am doing so.\n\nWith that being said, if you're reading this, you just got brownie points for reading until the end! Congrats! \ud83d\ude0a I hope to hear from you soon! Have a super awesome day!\n\nMuch love, Apple Valentina\n\n***PS!

It's so close and pungent you can almost taste it. Disgusting. On the brink of death you soil your pants, you're sobbing crying out for your mortal parent when a glorious figure comes out from the trees. They appear to be glowing and you swear their hair is made of gold. They pull their arm back to reveal their bow, already set with an arrow that goes soaring into the beast's eye. BOOM! It explodes into fine gold dust that gets everywhere. You're frozen in shock. What just happened? The figure introduces themselves as a child of- of Apollo?! If Apollo's real does that mean so is Aphrodite and Dionysus?! Yeeeeaaaaaaahhh buddy!\n\nCome one, come all have your character fall into this server's hands!

            "selftext": "Hey all, MyWetDad here looking for a fun little romp. I'm in the mood for a little Pokemon RP. While this is meant to be a simple little thing to take the edge off, I'm looking for the following elements in it:\n\n1. A couple of Pokemon trainers going on a journey, collecting badges, battling and doing whatever. I'd like this to have this take place in an AU Kanto-Johto (Newer 'mons can be used though), so events of the games and whatnot are not relevant to what we do. This also opens up opportunity to homebrew characters like gym leaders with our own characters, or our own versions of established characters. Again, this is supposed to be a fun little romp - I'm not really looking for edgy, world-ending plots. Conflict and evil shall be approached of course! But you get what I mean.\n\n2. Older trainers. This one's just an expansion thing - I've always felt it's a little weird that 10 year old kids travel around. I'd like us to have main characters in the 16-18 range. Yeah, romance can be a thing if we want. I'm not gonna push it, but I ain't against it.\n\nThat's pretty much it - if you're looking for something like this, shoot me a PM and I'll share my Discord information. I look forward to hangin' with you, whoever you might be.",

Preferably with lyrics but if you\u2019re just *that* cool, solid instrumentals would probably be fun too.\n\nWe take that song and make a roleplay based off of it. Share the vibes/ideas we get off the song, what kind of world springs to mind, what kind of characters. Write with them, hopefully. If you already have some of those ideas then feel free to send those too! \n\nAny song genre is good with me, as well as multiple songs, and I\u2019m excited to see what people choose!\n\n**Info**\n\nI write 3+ paragraphs generally, and like to think I\u2019m literate and can write decently well. I use grammar and punctuation as correctly as I can and heavily prefer the book style to italic actions/etc. I more often write younger female characters simply because it\u2019s easier for me. I\u2019m not 18, so smut is a no-go. \n\nI treat roleplay like we\u2019re writing a story and as you can tell, really love worldbuilding and creating characters.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nI always feel awful for putting this bit because it sounds super demanding but it makes us both happier in the long run, I guess!\n\n* Please have decent grammar/spelling.\n\n* If I\u2019m getting two short barely-thought-over paragraphs as a reply, I\u2019ll quit the RP. Just to be blunt about it.\n\n* Please introduce yourself in your first message. \u2018Do you have X?\u2019 messages generally result in nothing in my experience so I don\u2019t bother replying.\n\nThank you for reading!

Because of that, I want to stick to reddit or something off of Google. I don't want to fuss with skype or discord or an application of that nature. So I want someone who is okay with a slower posting speed but can still keep in touch even in between posts.*\n\n**Posting Habits:** *I want someone to post around 3-4 paragraphs and give rich detail and thoughtfulness. Because I don't need posts every day, I don't want them to seem rushed. If you're struggling with where to move things, feel free to skip to another day or ask me what I think. Let's talk things out but by no means make writing out to be a chore or obligation. If it is, let's find a way to fix things.*\n\n**My Characters:** *I can play males and females but right now I am seeking someone to play a male against my female. I am totally cool with playing male characters who are still main characters though, like your guy's friend or sibling. My characters are usually ones who are 18 years or older, mostly because it's tough to write as teenagers when you're a bit beyond that age. My characters are typically straight unless we discuss otherwise. And finally, mature themes are okay in strict moderation. These are romance plots but I don't drive the story toward mature situations, if they happen, so be it. But I want plot and purpose more than anything else.*\n\n**Some Ideas:** *Below are some small ideas I had, if you're interested, feel free to come at me with ideas to add one. Let's both have a plot we're happy with! Now with slice of life, I do expect a slow pace of development, with us exploring so many things like family life, school life, romance, friends, and stuff. When contacting me, let me know what it is about slice of life you enjoy. And if you have an idea yourself, feel free to share it too. I just made these up on the spot haha.*\n\n**1.** Our RP takes place in a small mountain town in Japan, modern day. One character has lived in there their whole life while another has just moved from Tokyo (or some other big city or even abroad). Our characters can be either in their final year of high school or their first year of university. One character stumbles across an old shrine in the middle of the forest and begins to repair it and bring it back to life. The other character stumbles upon it too (while wandering, the shrine is seemingly vacant) and begins to clean it up as well. Together our characters befriend each other at school or in the neighborhood while both fixing up the shrine, before realizing the other is helping them with the shrine.\n\nWe can add a bit of fantasy to this perhaps. Maybe once the shrine is cleaned up and repaired, a festival from the past takes over and characters are spirited away. Or maybe the shrine has some kind of items inside that are magical. Or perhaps the true owner of the shrine is a mythical guardian. It doesn't need to have fantasy elements though and if it does, I'd like them to be subtle and not overpower the RP.\n\n**2.** Our RP takes place in London, modern day. Our characters are the best of mates and have a (secret) shared interest in gaming. Soon an online game is released, one our characters have been eyeing for several years during its development. Our characters have gotten part-time jobs to pay for it and finally get their hands on it upon its release. The game is a fantasy virtual reality. For whatever reason, one friend hasn't admitted they have purchased said game, having voiced ambivalence about it, and plays in secret. The two friends run into one another online, unbeknownst to them. Either they hit it off well or they don't.\n\nWe would then explore their offline relationship as best friends, and their online relationship, either as rivals or potential lovers. Will the truth be revealed when they want to meet offline or will the friend with the secret, finally admit it before then? I see our characters here, being in high school but it's possible they're in college or even the workplace. It's also possible to maybe have a same-sex romance develop? And yes, this is inspired by dot hack.\n\n**3.** Our RP takes place in a fantasy world where either everyone is born with magical powers or no one is born with magic. It is our characters who will be the outliers who either don't have magic or do. In either instance, they are forced to go on the run, either ridiculed or hated by the society they live in. Our characters live in forests and other secluded areas, living off the land and getting odd jobs to pay for food and supplies. Why they were given such a hard life, will be for our characters to uncover.\n\nFor this, I want fantasy to still be light, nothing heavy/intense. Like, I don't want varied races or political dynamics with ten kingdoms, I want something simple we can develop and build together without worry and a lot of thought involved.\n\n**4.** Our RP takes place somewhere in Japan, either modern day or perhaps ten-fifteen years ago because technology now makes me sad. Our characters are friends and while walking around a quiet neighborhood, stumble across a quaint bookstore. The bookstore owner shows them a book filled with odd enchantments and curses. The owner explains the book's power requires two people and that our characters are welcome to try it out. Whether the owner is good intentions or not, is up for us to decide. It is my idea that the book's magic itself is very basic and would do things like cause a person to tell the truth for a week or cause a person to confess their hidden feelings or cause a person to become astonishingly confident for twenty-four hours, small little things like that.\n\n**5.** Our RP takes place in modern day Japan or somewhere in the UK. One character lives in one country and has been corresponding with someone who they believe is either in another part of the country or in another country altogether. In reality the character's pen pal is someone they know in real life. An acquaintance or rival or best friend perhaps? The person pretending to be someone else, works at the post office and grabs the letter before it gets returned to the sender because the address doesn't actually exist. The two characters confide in one another over many years and soon agree to meet one another. What will happen then?\n\nSo for this, I do want us to get involved in the letter-writing and exchanging that stuff as pen pals would. But I also want our RP to be about the relationship with the characters on another level and people interacting with each other outside of letters and emails and packages. I don't want there to be malice in this deception but more like a cute shyness or something, this isn't like catfishing or I hope it's not...but maybe it kind of is? And this might be a place for a same-sex romance maybe.\n\n**6.** Our RP takes place in a modern world like ours, with the exception that no one can embrace the opposite sex unless they're true soulmates. If someone does embrace someone of the opposite sex and they are not soulmates, they both transform into whatever animal they were born as according to the Chinese Zodiac. Our characters have had several broken hearts after getting close and finding out their partner wasn't their soulmate. Our characters are friends but are slowly coming to the conclusion that perhaps, they might be the other's answer. \n\nSo this takes inspiration from Fruits Basket but I think for this situation, the love has to be fully realized. You can't go around hugging people until you stop transforming. I want this to be a bit goofy and cute. It's a weird concept but it's an every day issue in the RP and I think it would change a few things in regards to casual sex and such.\n\n**7.** Our RP takes place in a modern world like ours, with the exception that there is a book that allows you to kill someone if you know their name and face. There are about 100 copies of this killing book circulating around the world at any given time. There are sites set up to keep track of who has a book. Whoever does have a book must make a public announcement and must announce who they kill, as per the rules of the book. Many wars have of course been fought over these books. Each person can only kill five people before the book is gifted to another random person. Our characters can either be fans of this craze or against the idea. \n\nYes, this is mildly inspired by Death Note. I want this to be a bit of a tense slice of life but I don't want to get political here. I think it would be fun to make up some cool or weird rules. Of course at the end of the day, this RP would be about morals and perhaps one character intends to kill a family member of the other character. I think we could find some interesting dynamics to work with while still keeping things cute and light.",

            "selftext": "Just to tl;dr. I'm looking for fandoms and original stuff both. The one specific fandom I'm REALLY looking for is Splatoon. Otherwise the rest I'm fine throwing my original stuff into. My Hero Academia, Dragon Ball Z, Skullgirls and Legend of Zelda to name a few. If you're not for either one of those original setting stuff is fine (and preferred) too.\n\nSo, ehh, hi I guess. Preferred name is Extvia. I've been writing for going on 9 years now, write only in 3rd person and am 22. From America and am basically around all the time. Kinda just looking for an active, literate partner for a long term, 1 on 1 plot of a character/interaction driven, over the top, adventure/action RP with a bit of cheesyness and stuff in the mix. I range between half a paragraph to multiple depending on the context within a scene but will allow myself to one-line if it becomes a momentary back and forth chat. I tend to work with rapid fire posting and am not much of one for slower paces. Also if you're on late night and stuff that's 10/10. Cause I've got a night shift-esque sleep schedule.\n\nI'm mostly kinda just here for RP partners and being chummy is fine but that's about as far as it'd go. I'm a bit on the thorny and cynical side and have a thing for being abrasive and offensive sometimes, but mostly on things other than who I'm talking to unless said person is some kind of total chimp.\n\nSo as far as the play itself goes I covered most of it above, but I suppose it'd be best to go into proper detail. I'm interested in those fantastical, unreal sort of adventures with all sorts of action going on but instead of CONSTANT action and fighting I like things rather character/interaction driven. The focus of the story being the two characters involved with the action/adventure being there to influence how they feel and go about things. I'm not much of one for slice of life stuff and mostly only use it momentarily to fill in the gaps. Romance CAN happen but I don't force it. It relies on character chemistry and all my characters are Female and all Lesbian/Gay. I like the two characters to contrast on many levels, both in personality and lifestyle/history. If they're alike it tends to be rather boring. I have a bit of a thing for causing my characters significant issues from time to time, whether it be physical or mental and I'm a bit of a junkie for development and in a sense a character \"blooming\" into something else even if it's only around a select few. Some dark themes are fine but I prefer it in moderation.\n\nI suppose for the lazy types to not read my RP Gateway thing or maybe feel it isn't enough I could put some rules/guidelines here:\n\n\u2022 I prefer plot and largely don't like smut at all and unless it's one of those rare partners I'm really into, if any smut happens at all, would likely just be fade to black. I only do anything of the sort even implying it if justified by the plot, namely the relationship. If they're not all lovey dovey it'd likely never happen.\n\n\u2022 Just about any era is fine but I easily have a bias for some over others.\n\n\u2022 As far as partner post length goes I want it either mirrored or at least half of what I posted if you can't outdo what I did. If you can't do that I am not interested.  Shorter posts when scenes calm down and such is fine.\n\n\u2022 Literacy and good grammar is mandatory. A few typos is one thing, being an actual clown with it is another.\n\n\u2022 No poofing at random. Having to deal with stuff is a thing yes but you'd best tell me. Cause poofing, especially without warning is REALLY annoying.\n\n\u2022 Long term is basically the only kind of plot I do and I tend to post multiple times a day. If you can only post like 1-3 times a day or something I'm largely not interested.\n\n\u2022 I won't play things other than what I already have on offer and I will not change them in any sort of big way to suit you unless it's a setting I'm actually VERY interested in and even then this mostly only applies to canons. My characters are strong, independent girls with detailed personalities to them and I don't intend to change it for very much of anything or use something else entirely.\n\n\u2022 I'm not much of one for lazy partners. If you're not going to contribute anything, develop any kind of plots, especially ones that don't derail the one already going on and are going to be nothing more than a mere reaction bot, I ain't interested. I'm not interested in doing all the leg work.\n\n\u2022 A quick run down on a few things I automatically will say No to: Furries, a number of current fandoms such as, but not limited to the likes of MLP, FNaF, Undertale, Gravity Falls, Steven Universe and so on. Generic, low fantasy settings like some kind of run of the mill gritty military RP like stuff along the lines of Halo/CoD and I'm not interested in Post Apoc settings at all. I will also never do outright versus/fighting each other RPs.\n\n\u2022 While I do indeed mostly do original stuff, I suppose to give an idea of what I actually do/the kind of high fantasy I mean. Canons I've worked with before and/or know that I am willing to throw myself into if you'd prefer it is: My Hero Academia, Skullgirls, Shantae, and Legend of Zelda. I have a go-to canon setting of choice in Splatoon when original stuff doesn't work or not preferred but I put my high fantasy spin on that as well.\n\n\u2022 I'm more of a person with a preference for toon/anime stuff rather than realistic stuff like faceclaims/reference or storylines. I just do this shit for fun man. So if you do realistic stuff and/or use realistic/IRL face claims I'm likely not interested unfortunately. If you're willing to adjust though that's fine too.\n\nOtherwise if you're interested, go ahead and PM me I guess. Can also look at my profile thing on RP Gateway if you feel like I missed anything and if that don't cover something either just ask in a PM.",

            "selftext": "The Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme.\nEvery character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\nhttp://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction",

            "selftext": "I made quite a bit of RPs involving fantasy. So many large, vast worlds that I've put hours and hours of time into for an epic journey and fantasy RP.\n\nBut, I've grown tired of it. And now, I just want a shameless, heartwarming and quirky romance.\n\nThis RP is based off of Japanimation (Anime) thus, Japan will be the setting for said RP. It doesn't necessarily mean your character has to be Japanese, they could easily be foreign.\n\nYuutaka Seiji is a short, 18 year old who's pretty hated by most in real life. Known for being overly rude, outspoken and brutally honest towards most, he's a boy trying to cope with alot of things. He's not necessarily traumatized, nor is he the product of a tragic past. \n\nHe's just an awkward, antisocial boy with low self confidence, who pushes others around in hopes to feel better about himself.\n\nI'm looking for someone who doesn't put up with his shit. Whether they're more rude and outspoken than him, or just someone who's generally disciplinary, I'd really like to develop an oddly quirky romance based around Yuutaka getting a taste of his own medicine.\n\nI definitely have (very picky) preferences when it comes to female characters, but I'm willing to look past those in order to roleplay something out of my typical element. \n\nI prefer Discord, definitely. We can talk about the details of the RP and such there!\n\nIt's very important that I communicate the insecurities of Yuutaka, as the point of this is to reveal his soft, sensitive side through the same harsh remarks that he communicates, whether it's intentional or not.\n\n",

I'll put a list down below of the things they're from, but if there's going to be romance, I only do lesbian. Some of them I'll ship with certain canon characters, but you can try your own OC's and we'll see. I also play canon characters, but I'm really picky about playing against other OC's. Also, I go to a trade school full time so I wont be able to be on all the time during the week. Anyway, here's what my characters are from:\n\nStar Wars \n\nNaruto\n\nDragonball\n\nSteven Universe\n\nGeneric Fantasy\n\nGeneric Cyberpunk\n\nModern day\n\nFallout\n\nWitcher\n\nAssassin's Creed \n\nFinal Fantasy\n\nArcher\n\nAvatar\n\nAnd there might be a few more that I'm forgetting. If you come up with anything not on the list, ask about it but don't be disappointed if I don't know it. When you message me, put whatever universe it's gonna be in and the name of your character so I don't get a bunch of the same mixed up. Also, don't message me if you're just gonna disappear before we actually get to do anything.",

            "selftext": "Introduction:\n\nHello and welcome to my RP ad, I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful day! Thank you so much for taking the time to stop by and read this, I greatly appreciate it! I know this a wall-o-text but I wanted to try and provide as much information as possible about myself and what I\u2019m looking for. Anyways... Let\u2019s a Go!\n\nPersonal Info:\n\nThis is my first time posting to reddit so please keep that in mind. A little about me, I\u2019m in my early 20\u2019s, a full-time student, and am currently living in the PST. I have about 2-3 years of RP experience and I\u2019m still learning a lot! I do my best to use spell check and read over my posts, but I am human and do make mistakes. I do have many other hobbies and activities that I actively participate in, so please do take that into consideration.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSchool is currently not in session for me, however I am attending practice for tennis every morning for three hours. For now, I\u2019m going to say I can schedule three nights a week for dedicated RP time with a potential partner. (Monday, Wednesday, and either Thursday or Friday depending on what\u2019s going on in RL.) School does start in about a month, at which time I will have to sit down and take a better look at my schedule to determine which nights will work best for RP. (As of now, Tuesday, Thursday, and maybe Saturday or Sunday could work, but please don\u2019t quote me on that!) If for any reason I am unable to attend a session, I will always do my bet to let you know beforehand.\n\nMy RP style:\n\nI usually prefer to RP in the third person format, posting anywhere between two to six paragraphs depending on the situation. If you can match that awesome, if not, that\u2019s fine too. If your posts are quality and are contributing towards the growth and development of the story and characters, I\u2019m happy! Most of the time I prefer to create and play original characters, however recently there has been one cannon character I have been really dying to play who I\u2019ll mention a little later in the ad. As the title says, I\u2019m only looking for FxF pairing, your RL gender doesn\u2019t matter to me, only your characters. I enjoy slow burning stories that allow our characters to grow, change, and develop together over time. I do not mind sexual elements being incorporated into RP, just in the appropriate time and as long as it doesn\u2019t overshadow other elements of the story. Everything in moderation, right? As I want to leave this post SFW, any further discussion about this topic can be taken to PM. My preferred method of RP is Discord, though I am new to it as I was accustomed to using AIM. I am open to discussing other methods if Discord isn\u2019t for you.\n\nPreferred Themes &amp; Settings:\n\nAs my wall-o-text is already getting seriously steep, I\u2019m going to list my themes and settings in order of preference with little side notes where needed. When messaging me, please tell me what specific themes and settings you\u2019re interested in. I don\u2019t want to list specific ideas or scenarios here as this ad is already lengthy, and I prefer to talk those topics through with any potential partner.\n\nThemes:\n\nRomance: I absolutely adore this theme and am just going to put it down as mandatory. Sorry if this isn\u2019t your cup of tea! (Mandatory theme)\n\nAdventure: Yes please! Let\u2019s not have our characters be sitting around all day, lets go out there discover the world, live out dreams, and broaden our horizons. (Favorite)\n\nAction: This goes hand in hand with a lot of the settings I\u2019ll be listing below. Sometimes conflict is necessary! (Favorite)\n\nSurvival: This admittedly is a theme that I have no experience with but intrigues me. I\u2019m willing to listen to any ideas that may involve this theme. (Like/Curious)\n\nSettings:\n\nMarvel Runaways (TV or Original World): It has been sometime since I have read the comics, but my love for this setting was recently rekindled by Hulu\u2019s take on the superhuman teens. This is where my cannon character itch comes in, as I would LOVE to play Karolina Dean ideally with my partner playing Nico Minoru. This is not required, you can whoever you\u2019d like to, including an OC. (Preferred/Favorite!)\n\nX-men/ X-Mansion: I am nowhere near current on the comics as that hobby is a bit too pricey for a lowly college student.. sad face! In any case, there is a small possibility I may want to try my hand at playing either Paige Guthrie aka Husk or Illyana Rasputin aka Magik though I will most likely play an OC. (Favorite!)\n\nHarry Potter: This is probably my most played setting, and I absolutely love it. Will only be playing OC\u2019s in this, if you prefer to play a cannon character, that\u2019s totally fine! I have played a character in every house at Hogwarts, but my favorites are Ravenclaw and Slytherin in that order. (Favorite)\n\nKingdom Hearts: The possibilities for this setting are literally limitless which is why I love it! A fantastic opportunity to make some creative OC\u2019s while taking advantage of the vast amount of worlds to explore and discover! Warning, I have not played ALL the games, I have played Kingdom Hearts I &amp; II and am planning to start the others soon. (Like)\n\nOriginal Worlds: I am totally open to working with potential partners to create our own world for our characters to play in. This does take a lot of time, work, and collaboration but can be a very rewarding process. If this is something you\u2019re interested in, please let me know and we can talk about it. (Like)\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\nOk, almost done, I promise! I think the most important thing to me in a potential part is the ability and willingness to communicate. I\u2019m not talking about OOC chit chat, but being able to openly talk about ideas, stories, and characters in a creative and constructive way. This is a collaboration after all, I value my partner\u2019s thoughts and inputs into the story that we are creating together, so please if you\u2019re looking for one person alone to take the reins, please look elsewhere. I\u2019m also looking for someone who is passionate about these themes and settings I have posted. I know this seems like a given, but it really does make a difference, especially in the writing if you really love or care about these elements. Lastly, I\u2019m looking for someone who is understanding, as I mentioned above I will be starting school again in a month, and I may not have as much free time as I do now. I need someone that is understanding of the pressures of life, and that I may not be available all the time to post or play.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOk, whew.. if you made it through it all, congratulations! Thank you sooooo much for taking the time to read all this. I know a lot of my settings are pretty niche, but I\u2019m really hoping to find someone that loves them as much as I do. If you\u2019re interested, or just have questions or comments feel free to leave me a message. I hope you all have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "*The new township had a few dozen families, homes for each, a windmill for milling grain, a sawmill and lumber yard for processing the rich wood of the forest that surrounds, a few common wells for water, a town hall, a small shrine to Lady Bel, the Sun Goddess, and other communal and private buildings for processing food and goods. It is far from becoming a city and the local lord is further away than the nearest large town. Trade goods come occasionally in exchange for the high quality lumber, and merchants to sell their wares. However, the woods have always been a place of mystery, rumor, and fear. The people that work them whisper of spirits watching the lumberers, that the woods themselves have a life and an intelligence that rues their work against the trees. The people do not feel safe.*\n\n*But*\u00a0she\u00a0*is here to belay those fears. She is a Paladin of Lady Bel, the Goddess of Light, Healing, and Justice. Trained to wield steel and the magic of the Lady of Light, she is here to bring the law of civilization to the frontier town, to tend Lady Bel's shrine, and to put to rest any notions of evil spirits...or put such spirits to rest themselves.*\n\n*Chief among the rumors is that of a spirit moving through the village at night, wandering around, visiting the farm animals and the wells, floating about, sometimes just watching. The lady Paladin will discover this spirit to be one like her...a Priest of Lord Sin, the Master of the Moon, a god of Mystery, Magic, Secrets, but primarily known as the Dual-Natured God; a guide for those lost in the dark, and an avenger for the wronged. What this young man wants is not clear, but the two of them shall become painfully entwined together.*\n\nI would like to do a roleplay steeped in emotion and a conflicted romance between the Moon Priest and the Sun Paladin. Whether from internal or external threats, I would like conflict and pain between them as they struggle with their emotions. I want to paint a rich and lush world with lots of descriptors and feeling. We can fill in more details and more about the characters before we start. I hope we can create something deep and filled with feeling together. If you have any questions, let me know.",

If you\u2019ve got an idea, throw it at me in PMs &amp; I\u2019ll get back to you. I just want this ship. It\u2019s my guilty pleasure.\n\nAs for Overwatch, I\u2019m not opposed to AUs if you have one, but I do prefer to play in the canon universe as I am very familiar and invested in the lore. I mainly play Widowmaker, and here\u2019s some of the ships I\u2019m looking for:\n\nWidowReaper\nWidowMoira\nWidowGerard \nWidowMaximillion (the Talon Omnic in case you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about lmao) \n\nAs for ships without Widow, I\u2019m interested in MercyxMoira with me playing Angela. \n\nI am also willing to play Sombra, although I\u2019ve never done her before. I\u2019m down to play these characters &amp; others within a roleplay focused on any of the other ships in order to further the plot.

            "selftext": "#Hello there! First things first, I only have Reddit on my laptop. Therefore, I do not receive notifications when a PM is sent. Please have patience as I will likely respond between a 2-hour time window. I promise I'm not ignoring you! I just go to school full time. \n\n###I am currently looking for a male or someone who can play a male to do a modern day, romance roleplay! I exclusively use Discord and am not willing to use any other platform. Sorry! \ud83d\ude05\n\nI have been roleplaying for about 5 years now, and I guess one could say I am pretty good. I also am currently writing my own novels. I always roleplay full lit, and my responses are typically 1-3 paragraphs. Of course, that will vary between responses, as they depend on the course the plot is taking. Usually at the beginning, my responses will be pretty long (3-5), but of course, they will go down in length as the scene and characters are introduced and established. Remember, quality over quantity! I do usually do NSFW in my role plays, and would like someone who is capable of integrating it into the plot without making it the main focus or rushing into it.\n\nThough I'm pretty open to all role play idea's I prefer, if not exclusively, do romance plots. However, this does not mean its sub-genre can't be something else! For example, I did a role play a while ago involving a mayor who was at a constant risk of being assassination and her bodyguard, who protected her with all he had. The main genre was romance and the sub-genre was drama/action! ***I do not, however, do fandoms, fantasy, or any pre-modern plots, especially medival (Though the most back I am willing to go in a time era is the 1930\u2019s)***\n\n###Here are some good things to do, and bad things to do/be when roleplaying with me!\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0Please be literate! I don't ask you to speak like a human dictionary, but I do ask you to be mindful of basic grammar skills. *For example, knowing the difference between to/too/two, their/there/they're, wear/where proper spelling of simple words etc.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Try and 'mirror' my replies. *For example, when I write a reply of a few paragraphs, I would expect the same in response. Likewise, when I write a few sentences, you don't have to write a whole novel of a reply.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0I would really love to be able to talk out of character, both for planning and just to talk! It's absolutely not necessary, but I just because I feel as though a good relationship between partners can always improve the role play and better the communication of what is going on in the plot.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Though not an absolute requirement, I prefer when the partner I'm role playing with chooses characters that have the 'Alpha Male' Personality. (Being confident, Dominating, Cocky, Aggressive, Possessive, sometimes a total dick)\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I like when my partners can come up with new characters and personalities unlike the last for the different role plays we may do.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do pretty much only Third person. I just prefer it, but I may be willing to change it to First\ud83d\ude04\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't use text speech or little asterisks when you write. I really prefer when my partner writes just as a book would be. *For example; She looked up at him with big eyes, shining from the tears in them. \"You don't understand, do you.\" She murmurs lowly, trying to contain herself. \"I love you and you don't even look at me\"*\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just I will you, please understand if my replies aren't immediate. I do go to school full time and I hope you can understand when I don\u2019t respond quickly. I will be able to reply throughout the day, just don't get upset if I reply a little later than when you sent it. I will, of course, be just as understanding with you!\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though a character face claim is not necessary, I like them to get a better image of what your character looks like. Also, I need all characters to have a bio, as it makes things like personality and background more clear. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD *PLEASE* NO ANIME FC. \n\nThough I don't have very many plot ideas at the moment, I have lots of OC's and I am more than willing to hear any ideas you have and even brainstorm a new one together!\n\n###REMINDER! If I go a few days without replying/messaging you, *please* don't think I left you hanging! I am likely either busy, or your message didn't come through to me! I will never end a role play without telling you I am doing so.\n\nWith that being said, if you're reading this, you just got brownie points for reading until the end! Congrats! \ud83d\ude0a I hope to hear from you soon! Have a super awesome day!\n\nMuch love, Apple Valentina\n\n***PS!

Preferably with someone who is active daily, has a good grasp on English and can fill out decent paragraphs, also must be 18+ for adult themes.\n\nRomance is a yes if it makes sense within the story, as well as strong language, violence, aspects of horror, anything really!\n\nI tend to prefer not to write in established universes, just because it feels as if there is less freedom in what I can write, but wouldn't rule it out.\n\nThe phrase 'on the run' is really just a jumping off point and I'm up for chatting about different story options and themes. I tend to enjoy historical/cyberpunk/thriller/noir genres, sometimes involving fantasy/scifi elements, sometimes not. I am open to any suggestions though.\n\nWhat I really like exploring is the tension, thrill and paranoia. Two people, maybe they only just met, maybe they are just about to get married, maybe they hate each other, having to work together and make their way across a country. Through cities, towns, forests and unforgiving wildernesses, endlessly chased by an unforgiving enemy.\n\nI like to use discord to chat and write but drop me a message here first if the concept excites you!",

Just a quick disclaimer, considering the characters and themes present in some aspects of the MCU and the likelihood of NSFW scenarios happening, I do ask for my partners to be 18+.\n\nSo I've been wanting to play as James \"Logan\" Howlett, A.K.A. Wolverine, and I would love if I could find someone that could play as Natasha Romanoff.  Specifically, I was thinking of an idea that would involve her recruiting Logan to SHIELD, either just before or just after the events of the first Avengers movie.\n\nAnother idea that I'm more willing to brainstorm and discuss would be the potential of having Wolverine interact with Jessica Jones.  This one is a lot more open ended, with us either following the events of the first season of Jessica Jones or something totally unique.\n\nAt any rate, I hope to hear from you all soon!",

I am found in the EST timezone. I am obsessed with Shinsou Hitoshi, cats, anime, learning about cultures, true crime, food, and drawing.\n\nWhere you RP: Kik, Skype, Discord, Email, maybe somewhere else if you ask!\n\nWhat you RP: Boku no/My Hero Academia, Naruto, Monster Munsume, One Piece, Pokemon, Super natural (genre) and more so just ask me! It will mostly be movies, anime, cartoons, books.\n\nWhat you are looking for: I am looking for a mainly romantic story for my OC. I WILL double with you no matter what, M/M, F/F, whatever else you are looking for. Angst, fluff, hurt/comfort, slice of life, horror, supernatural (genre) is fine with me!\n\nCharacters you RP: I will usually always play as an original female character, but I will be happy to double as whoever you would enjoy! \n\nCharacters you\u2019re looking to interact with:These are listed from MOST to LEAST wanted.\n\nMHA: Shinsou Hitoshi, Ojirou Mashirao, Sero Hanta, Bakugou Katsuki, Inasa, Yosetsu Awase, Kirishima Ejirou, Todoroki Shouto, Izuku\n\nNaruto: Gaara, Kankuro, Kiba Inuzuka\n\nOne Piece: Sanji, Zoro, Bartolomeo\n\nMonster Munsume: Male Monster OC, Male Human OC\n\nSuper Natural: Demons, Lamiia/Naga, Were creatures, Faeries,Witches/Warlocks/Wizards, Vampires???, Whatever else seems fun\n\nParagraph or dialog form?: I prefer paragraph form, please!\n\nGrammar/Length requirements: Please have some decent grammar! No text talk unless it is in an actual text or note between characters. As for length I prefer two upwards to ten paragraphs depending on how into the roleplay we both are. Two to three should work fine but sometimes I end up rambling.\n\nShort-term or long term?: Both! I vastly prefer long term. \n\nGenres I roleplay: Romance, horror, fantasy, tragedy, supernatural, hurt/comfort, fluff, angst\n\nI cannot: Absolutely no ghosting me. How hard is it to send a message saying, \u2018I need to drop this roleplay for such and such reason.\u2019 I\u2019ll say 'okay. I\u2019ll be here if you wanna continue later on.\u2019 I don\u2019t have many limits!\n\nAs my partner, a person would have to: Become my friend! I love meeting new people and hearing stories. Talk with me OOC frequently if you can! Respect my boundaries and I\u2019ll do the same with you. \n\nDo you smut?: Yes, but don\u2019t force it. ",

            "selftext": "Hello there! \n\nSearching for an exceptional partner with whom to spin fantastical tales. I\u2019ve attempted to keep it short and sweet below, but feel free to ask questions if you\u2019re curious. \n\n- 3rd person\n\n- Long-term. Most of my stories are many hundreds of pages long. It would be impossible to write that in the short term. Please plan to stick around a bit. \n\n- Multi-para posts via email or GoogleDocs only. Minimum 4 paragraphs, more preferred. Descriptive, illustrative, well crafted writing. \n\n- Post minimum 1x a day, more would be great. (I\u2019m on EST in the US and write primarily during the day, but we can work something out)\n\n- Be 21+. For both NSFW options and for general life experience. Are there adultier adults on Reddit? Please pop in! \n\n- Romance is non-negotiable. Everything else revolves around the love story. There should be a whole host of action and adventure unfolding along the way, but I like what I like.\n\n- You must be willing to play the straight, male, lead. I have a very specific type. Big, broad, muscular, alpha personality type. Beards and tattoos are optional, but welcome. Open beyond that for the most part, and happy to repay certain favors. \n\n- Have ideas! This is a collaboration. I write some stuff, you write some stuff. We occasionally brainstorm a particular arc and go from there. Surprises are good. I\u2019m not looking to drag dead weight. Therefore you must be willing to communicate about the story. \n\nLooking for historical tales. Will consider ideas which through various supernatural means weave between historical and modern, but nothing solely modern based. This leaves a vast period of time to explore. Research is not required, creative license and close approximation are fine. Celtic tribes, Roman conquest, Westward expansion, Viking invasion, World War horror, or events and locations out of our own imagination.\n\nI prefer reality(ish) and to keep my fantastical themes in the character type realm (werewolves, vampires, fairy tale creatures, etc). Occasional light magics and supernatural influences, deities, etc work fine. \n\nI play straight women that are almost always human. They often have painful histories and flawed backgrounds that can make them difficult characters. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re tuned into the all drama all the time channel, but they are going to develop over time. They\u2019re typically more submissive archetypes (not helpless, that\u2019s very different). For example, they\u2019re more likely to be a war prize, arranged marriage, nurse on the battlefield, than a fellow soldier. \n\nThe story is everything. One of those epic, wrenching, exciting tales. Pearl Harbor, Titanic, Braveheart, King Arthur, (and even a few with happier endings). Since it always comes up, my list of limitations is relatively short, but made substantially longer by Reddit encounters. Yeah...thanks for that. Happy to outline it if needs be. \n\nSo, come along then, let\u2019s have a chat. What has inspired you lately? What story are you aching to write? Bring an idea and let\u2019s discuss. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

They've been scattered, killed, or have gone MIA. *Your objective, commander?* Find and recruit them. We will need their help if we are to overthrow the Avatar project. *Good luck, commander*\n\n\nHello! I am a mod from a semi new role playing. We are only a month old but most of the mod staff has previous experiences from other rps. But I doubt that's why you are looking at this ad now is it?\n\nThis RP is set 10 years Prior to Xcom2, Rpers are crew members about the Veil, a captured and repurposed ship. Their objective is to combat the Advent threat since Xcom is officially dispanded. With the help from their fellow crew members they will accomplish this goal flawlessly or fail and doom humanity. The fate of humanity is yet to be determined. \n\nI would like to invite anyone and everyone to come and join our community. We primarily do our Rping on our Reddit which I will link at the bottom. But we do most of our planning and talking to one another on our Discord which I will also link. So feel free to come and take a look there.\n\nIf you have any questions about us or our Rp, either PM me here on Reddit or join the Discord. The other mods and myself are more then happy to lend a helping hand.\n\nLink to our Reddit: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/XcomRoleplay/\n\nLink to our Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/9nCf8v",

Why? Because I'm a keen RPer who enjoys the company of fellow RPers preferably females. \n\nAs a word of advice, please don't message me with \"Hey.\" Or \"Still looking for that RP Partner?\" because I will ignore it. Put some effort into your introduction. That's what I base my intentions on. Make a good introduction and impression and I'll likely reply. \n\nSo I'm looking for an RP partner similar age to myself, and female. Honestly, I'd also prefer them to be single too, just so no complications happen as my RPs (if you're okay with them) get Romantic and could potentially get NSFW. \n\nI use KiK as my main use of Roleplaying so that's a definite need. I can however resort to using text chat on Skype if necessary. \n\nI also have 6 years of experience so I know what I'm doing. \n\nMy wish list: \n- Must be Female aged 18+ \n- Be willing to conduct romantic Roleplays that may involve NSFW themes (discussed over DM) \n- Be into the same things as myself. \n- Be British (not needed but recommended just for easier schedule) \n- Be friendly of course. :) \n\nMy main RP specialities! \n- Superhero (Marvel and DC) \n- OC x Barbara Dunkelman \n- Elder Scrolls \n- Halo \n- Real Life Romance ( Main and Preferred ) \n- Mecha Combat Team (Gundam-esque) \n- Apocalypse (Both Zombie and Wasteland) \n- VGHS (Video Game High School OCs)\n- Destiny\n- Mass Effect\n\nMessage me if you're interested. \n\nI thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope you contact me soon.

I will be playing an OC, Abelardus Kingston; once famed Kingsglaive still putting up the good fight. Those interested in this role-play can play as either OC or canon, but the character has to be female [because this will carry some \u201cadult themes\u201d alongside epic storytelling]. You\u2019ll be able to play any kind of character you want, but the main plot of this prompt will be loosely based off the new Comrades DLC. That being said, their will be a lot of Daemon hunting, dialogue, Daemon tracking, and character development. \n\nI have a few ideas for starters and the like, but I like to discuss the finer details with my partners before throwing out my ideas. But yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. If you\u2019re a fan of Final Fantasy and want to play in the monster infested world, hit me up and let\u2019s get immersed.",

            "selftext": "I can entertain a few more partners (also since some disappeared already - at least they dropped out early, right?), so here I am making a post. \n\n* I'm located in PST. Hopefully you have similar-ish hours to me, because I will generally post all day when I can. It's not exactly rapid-fire, although on a good day you can expect more than a dozen posts.\n* I only write in paragraph form, and in third-person. My general writings range from 100-500 per post, depending on the content needed and my partner's preferences. \n* Discord only please! Please provide a Discord handle when you PM me.\n* I prefer M/F as a pairing, and playing male. However, if you have an amazing plot and you'd like me to play female, I can be swayed.\n* I prefer original roleplays, with content that we bring to the table together. They can be inspired from fandoms, although not directly the same. I will do some fandoms, but only with original characters, and the list is fairly limited to mostly anime/videogames. Not a big TV or Movie person here.\n\nSo last but not least, I'm most interested in doing something modern-fantasy, or set in a modern-fantasy world. It can be slice of life, pairings, etc. It doesn't have to involve high fantasy either, but I do like the aspect of being able to introduce elements not seen in the everyday.\n\nI'm also big on medieval fantasy, although I'm all out of plots for the era. If you can bring me something awesome, or want to plot something up together, that'd be great.\n\nIf you are interested in doing a fandom of sorts, I've got mostly a list of anime/games. Overwatch, Persona 5, Danganronpa, My Hero Academia, Dungeonmeshi, Fate Stay, for some examples. I'm also more than down to use any element of these as an AU!\n\nI think I covered most things for now. If you're interested and like what you see, PM me and let's discuss further!\n\n",

I prefer to make our own characters when roleplaying, and we can also modify the fandom world and it's history any way we want, as i find it interesting to do so. I would prefer for our characters to have room for growth, so that there can be a little extra room for story in the roleplay. i do also have some pre-made scenarios that we can use, if you would like to use these rather than coming up with our own, however, that is completely up to you. Pm me for my info, and i hope to hear from you soon\n\nFandoms include;\n\nNaruto\n\nFairy Tail\n\nBoku no Hero Academia\n\nBlue Exorcist\n\nSoul Eater\n\nThere are of course more that can be done, but those are just to name a few.",
