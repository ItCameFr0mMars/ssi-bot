            "selftext": "Ten Seconds. The pods drop are dropping from above the atmosphere. Breaking the sound barrier and jumbling the toughest of soldiers stomachs. Some malfunctioning and exploding upon entry.\n\nTwenty Seconds. The pod's parachute deploys and jars the soldiers inside. The Reinforced glass giving a window the the chaos of where they were being deployed. Some are having panic attacks, seizures, and some are dead from the shock their body received upon the opening of the parachute. The lucky few are just vomiting in their helmets.\n\nThirty seconds. A cure shot is injected into the soldiers that survived and they regain lost fluids and are in a focused state of mind. Aircraft rip through the air beside them. The anti-aircraft guns take notice of them and they start firing. Most miss but some are hit by the shells. Ripping through the pods and killing the soldier inside.\n\nForty Seconds. The pods hit the ground. Troops run out of their pod into gunfire, landmines, and the energy swords of the enemy that are waiting. Those that survive confirm at least one kill of the enemy before running to the meet up point.\n\n50 seconds. Some survivors make it to the forest where the meeting point is. But then are picked off by the snipers in the trees and the local wildlife of it.\n\n60 seconds. One lone soldier breaks into the meeting point. A nervous private on the battlefield for the first time.\n\nAnd that is how a whole platoon was wiped out in one minute. Leaving one nervous and scared private with a bomb behind as the soul survivor of the minute massacre. On a planet that he doesn't know.\n\nHello! So, I wanted to explore a bit of a darker RP. This will be largely story driven just so you know. About the struggles of being alone and scared on an alien planet. I will be playing the surviving soldier of the platoon. But you can be a few things. You can be an inhabitant of the planet that finds him. The AI in his helmet that's keeping him sane through all of this. A member of the rescue team that is sent to save him. Just be creative. And don't be afraid to add input either. What's this planet like? What's the government? What kind of beings are we dealing with?\n\nI look forward to building a world and an adventure with you.",

            "selftext": "Thousands of years ago, the fifteen chief gods that ruled over the inhabitants of Gheitz battled against evil spirits lead by a powerful dark god. In the end, the 15 gods defeated the dark forces, sealing them away for two thousand years. Being weakened themselves, the fifteen gods disappeared and were quickly forgotten about by the races they protected. Years upon years later, the continent was in turmoil due to racism, desperation of supplies, and religious difference. Races turned on each other and declared small wars, some species being hunted to extinction. Humans were the worst of these offenders in the past, sometimes wiping out whole races only for coin. One day, your family found a destroyed caravan on the side of the road, the entire small army slaughtered except for a small boy. Taking him in as one of their own, they raised the child beside you and you both became best friends. After some time, you both grew to adulthood, always on the lookout for adventure. We had found a map from a street vendor depicting a dungeon with enough gold to make a king Jealous, so we decided to leave our small village and be what we have always wanted to be. Adventurers. \nThanks for reading! I would prefer a partner who uses correct grammar and writes around a paragraph. You can be anything you want with any skills you want. I ask you to do something other than elf or human. I have a list of a lot of different humanoid species if you cant decide! If you have any questions, please ask!",

A little about me, I\u2019m in my early 20\u2019s, a full-time student, and am currently living in the PST. I have about 2-3 years of RP experience and I\u2019m still learning a lot! I do my best to use spell check and read over my posts, but I am human and do make mistakes. I do have many other hobbies and activities that I actively participate in, so please do take that into consideration.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSchool is currently -IN- session for me, which means I will only have specific days available to arrange RP sessions or find time to play by post. As of right now Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday are the days I have available for play. However, I am also an athlete and have a two hour practice every day with matches played on Tuesdays and Fridays (16 matches played total). I already have the season schedule, and am a very organized person, so I should have no problem scheduling sessions and letting you know my availability on a week to week basis.\n\nMy RP style:\n\nI usually prefer to RP in the third person format, posting anywhere between two to six detailed paragraphs depending on the situation. If you can match that awesome, if not, that\u2019s fine too. If your posts are quality and are contributing towards the growth and development of the story and characters, I\u2019m happy! Most of the time I prefer to create and play original characters, however recently there has been one cannon character I have been really dying to play who I\u2019ll mention a little later in the ad. As the title says, I\u2019m only looking for FxF pairing, your RL gender doesn\u2019t matter to me, only your characters. I enjoy slow burning stories that allow our characters to grow, change, and develop together over time. I do not mind sexual elements being incorporated into RP, just in the appropriate time and as long as it doesn\u2019t overshadow other elements of the RP. Everything in moderation, right? As I want to leave this post SFW, any further discussion about this topic can be taken to PM. My preferred method of RP is Discord, though I am new to it as I was accustomed to using AIM. I am open to discussing other methods if Discord isn\u2019t for you.\n\nPreferred Themes &amp; Settings:\n\nAs my wall-o-text is already getting seriously steep, I\u2019m going to list my themes and settings in order of preference with little side notes where needed. When messaging me, please tell me what specific themes and settings you\u2019re interested in. I don\u2019t want to list specific ideas or scenarios here as this ad is already lengthy, and I prefer to talk those topics through with any potential partner.\n\nThemes:\n\nRomance: I absolutely adore this theme and am just going to put it down as mandatory. Sorry if this isn\u2019t your cup of tea! (Mandatory theme)\n\nAdventure: Yes please! Let\u2019s not have our characters be sitting around all day, lets go out there discover the world, live out dreams, and broaden our horizons. (Favorite)\n\nAction: This goes hand in hand with a lot of the settings I\u2019ll be listing below. Sometimes conflict is necessary! (Favorite)\n\nSurvival: This admittedly is a theme that I have no experience with but intrigues me. I\u2019m willing to listen to any ideas that may involve this theme. (Like/Curious)\n\nSettings:\n\nMarvel Runaways (Hulu Series): It has been sometime since I have read the comics, but my love for this setting was recently rekindled by Hulu\u2019s take on the superhuman teens. This is where my cannon character itch comes in, as I would LOVE to play Karolina Dean ideally with my partner playing Nico Minoru. This is preferred but not required, you can whoever you\u2019d like to, including an OC. (Preferred/Favorite!)\n\nX-men/ X-Mansion: I am nowhere near current on the comics as that hobby is a bit too pricey for a lowly college student.. sad face! In any case, there is a small possibility I may want to try my hand at playing either Paige Guthrie aka Husk or Illyana Rasputin aka Magik though I will most likely play an OC. (Favorite!)\n\nHarry Potter: This is probably my most played setting, and I absolutely love it. Will only be playing OC\u2019s in this, if you prefer to play a cannon character, that\u2019s totally fine! I have played a character in every house at Hogwarts, but my favorites are Ravenclaw and Slytherin in that order. (Favorite)\n\nKingdom Hearts: The possibilities for this setting are literally limitless which is why I love it! A fantastic opportunity to make some creative OC\u2019s while taking advantage of the vast number of worlds to explore and discover! Warning, I have not played ALL the games, I have played Kingdom Hearts I &amp; II and am planning to start the others soon. (Like)\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\nOk, almost done, I promise! I think the most important thing to me in a potential part is the ability and willingness to communicate. I\u2019m not talking about OOC chit chat, but being able to openly talk about ideas, stories, and characters in a creative and constructive way. This is a collaboration after all, I value my partner\u2019s thoughts and inputs into the story that we are creating together, so please if you\u2019re looking for one person alone to take the reins, please look elsewhere. I\u2019m also looking for someone who is passionate about these themes and settings I have posted. I know this seems like a given, but it really does make a difference, especially in the writing if you really love or care about these elements. Lastly, I\u2019m looking for someone who is understanding, as I mentioned above I will be starting school again in a month, and I may not have as much free time as I do now. I need someone that is understanding of the pressures of life, and that I may not be available all the time to post or play.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOk, whew.. if you made it through it all, congratulations! Thank you sooooo much for taking the time to read all this. I know a lot of my settings are pretty niche, but I\u2019m really hoping to find someone that loves them as much as I do. If you\u2019re interested, or just have questions or comments feel free to leave me a message. I hope you all have a wonderful day!\n\n",

Any additional questions, please save them for the end of this post.  Thank you!**\n\n--------------------\n\nTHE GREAT ESCAPE RPG\n\nIt started with a few commercials on MTV, a channel that used to host music videos yet somehow evolved to contain strange reality shows about pregnant teenagers and orange partiers on garbage beaches. Inbetween the heavily scripted \u2018real\u2019 drama, and the occasional actual scripted show that wasn\u2019t so bad (seriously, why was Teen Wolf even on this channel?), a single commercial started to catch your attention. Normally, you would roll your eyes at yet another reality game show where contestants were stuffed together and forced to compete for some prize. But this one\u2026 this one caught your eye. It seemed different. It seemed better. It seemed\u2026 dare we say it\u2026. cool. \n\nEscape Games had already been growing fairly popular. You\u2019ve probably done a few with your friends, or maybe with your family as a neat alternative to playing monopoly or yet another round of mini-golf. Maybe you\u2019re good at them. Maybe you suck at them. Maybe you\u2019re really good at them, and are just itching to try something on a larger scale. Maybe you\u2019re just bored and waiting for a new episode of Room Raiders to come on. \n\nWhatever your deal, you see the commercial, and you\u2019re interested. \n\nThe Great Escape! A new reality game show, set in a medieval Scottish Castle, with one simple goal: Survive the curse and escape the castle. The prize? A measly $1,000,000. \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking. In this day and age, a million dollars ain\u2019t worth sh*t. You\u2019ve seen the housing market. A cool million hardly gets you a mansion. After you\u2019ve paid off your student loans, you barely have enough to afford a studio apartment in Manhattan. And as everyone\u2019s favorite troubadour is proud to announce, you\u2019ll have a knapsack full of jack after taxes (+10 points if you get the reference!). \n\nStill\u2026 adding a mil to your bank account surely couldn\u2019t hurt it. \n\nPlus, the adverts are telling you that you get to spend ten days in a castle, for free. \n\nSure, MTV (in partnership with a company called Paradox Productions) has set up the castle to look cursed, and you have to solve puzzles and sh*t and compete with other people. If you get eliminated, you don\u2019t get to play in the castle anymore\u2026. but even if you only make it to the second round, that\u2019s still two days in a Scottish castle, for free. \n\nIt might be kinda cool. \n\nPlus, if you\u2019re good at puzzles and codes and games, maybe you\u2019ll make it to the end. Maybe you\u2019ll win fame and fortune and go down in history as the coolest escape game winner ever. There may even be some hot people of your gendered interest that you could flirt with when you\u2019re not solving puzzles. \n\nOf course, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s all too good to be true. There was that one article on the internet that claimed Strathmore Castle to actually be cursed. Apparently someone said there were actual murders that took place there, murders that were never quite solved. Weird ass sh*t has been happening in the castle, even before MTV decided to host their rating grab show there.. \n\nBut in your mind, whatever the downside, it seems worth the risk. \n\nIt won\u2019t hurt to just send an application, right? It\u2019s just an application. What are the chances you\u2019d actually get picked to compete? What are the chances that the curse is real? What are the chances that anything bad could really come of this? \n\nProbably as low as your chances of winning the million dollar prize. \n\nBut hey, you don\u2019t care about chances. You care about fun. And this looks fun. \n\nSo you send in an application, and you wait. \n\nYou don\u2019t admit it, but a small part of you can\u2019t wait for the response. Even if you did it as a joke, and pretended to forget about it shortly after you sent it in\u2026 there\u2019s that small part of your heart that beats a little faster on the day you pull an envelope out of the mailbox (MTV is sure old fashioned sometimes\u2026haven\u2019t they heard of email?) and see an MTV logo on the backside. \n\nAnd you can\u2019t help the feeling of excitement that alights in your chest when you read the first line of the letter: \n\nDear Contestant, Everyone here at Paradox Productions is delighted to accept your application\u2026. \n\nSomething that feels like fear, the kind of instinct that sends animals running before a tsunami, tickles at the back of your neck. You ignore it. It doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nYou\u2019re going to Scotland. You\u2019re going to live in a Castle. You\u2019re going to play the best Escape Game ever. \n\nAnd you\u2019re going to have fun. \n\nOr you'll die trying.\n\n---------------------------\n\nAdditional information such as the **rules**, how to **audition** and how to **play the game** will be available [HERE!](http://www.roleplayer.me/1357487)\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm looking for some good partners for both original and fandom settings. Here, I'm listing my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts, as they're still applicable.  (I also have the beginnings of a fantasy or sci-fi thing based off Nickelback's \"Lullaby,\" if that interests anyone...)\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* Please, for the love of Cruxis, do not ask me what medium I want to use for RP. I use tags in my titles for a reason, and when people ask me questions that I've *obviously* already answered, it's a pretty big turn-off; it means, or at least looks like, you didn't bother to actually pay attention.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina) \n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! (Please note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.)",

This came about during a discussion I had with another partner but, due to time issues we could not make it work. I am currently looking to do a Roleplay with other elements to it, but what are they? \n\n**Well to start with here is the pitch.**\n\nStruggling musician finds a girl who believes in him far more than he does, the musician has confidence issues and as such finds performing difficult, despite his talent. The girl in question comes from circumstances and a potentially quite volatile past. She would be his muse!\n\n**Here are the two scenarios**\n\na) Option A is the idea of obsession, one party (I am flexible to which) becomes obsessed with the other, obsession is something I have not explored much in Roleplay and id love to try it.\n\nb) Option B is manipulation, the girl in this case would build the musician up and use him, seeing him as a means to an end, a means to get out of her situation.\n\n***These will be dark themes!***\n\nI am open to discussing these themes at length and consider myself a good partner to have, I reply frequently, can reply a number of lengths from short 2-300 to 1900 words, I am also very laid back and fluid in the process, open to discussions at any point about all aspects. I do not put posting guidelines, or pressure others to post, but ideally id love someone as enthusiastic as I am.\n\n**Here is the special part!**\n\nI love extending my role plays out to other avenues, I am a designer so I have created maps for role plays before and also music. I will be creating music for this RP! If that is something you like the idea of, or would like to yourself create something let me know.\n\n31, Male, England, look forward to hearing from you!.\n\n",

I am a detailed, articulate roleplayer who has been roleplaying in some format or another for... a number of years. (And now I\u2019ve succeeded in making myself feel old...) \n\nAnyway! I\u2019m comfortable and experienced playing in a slew of different genres. Fantasy, modern day, Steampunk, Various historical eras... I\u2019m open to some fandoms as well, though I\u2019m only interested in playing original characters within those sorts of pre-existing worlds.) Really, I\u2019m pretty willing to try anything that allows us to come up with an interesting, character driven plot. \nI\u2019ve always felt that where I excel most is with character creation and development, which I think you will find is reflected in my style of roleplay once we get started. \n\nI\u2019m not opposed for there to be darker themes and/or NSFW elements, but I\u2019m not looking for pointless boinking that doesn\u2019t fit in with the story we\u2019re trying to tell. My views on romance are similar - What girl doesn\u2019t like to incorporate a bit of romance? Still, it needs to work with the plot. \n\nI prefer to play in 3rd person, and quality is, of course, more important than quantity. That being said, you can expect an average of three paragraphs from me. Sometimes, more. Sometimes, less. (Probably considerably more when we\u2019re in the earlier stages, setting the scene and introducing characters and the like). Ultimately, it depends on the flow of the scene. \n\nThe medium that I find works best for me is Discord, but I am open to other services upon request! \n\nWell, I think that covers the basics? I look forward to collaborating to create fun and unique stories! ",

I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and possibly **Superhero** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**.",

I know bunch of you guys prefer to do it through Discord and I tried it, I really did but it just doesn't seem as a comfortable platform to me. I enjoy more Tumblr or Facebook (fake accounts of course) because I feel like it gives me more space for creativity and aesthetics.  \n\n\n---- Anyhow, I'm presenting all of my ideas, sorted into categories. Whichever idea gets the most people interested, wins. Or we could do more of it, honestly I have a huge muse for everything.   \n\n\n---- Roleplaying canon universe with canon characters:\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n\nHarry Potter (I'm down for any era)\n\nDisney (ewww so childlish -- hear me out, it would be with a modern/real world/twisted kind of details)\n\nUntil Dawn\n\nLife is Strange\n\nThe Mortal Instruments\n\nOnce Upon a Time\n\n\n---- Roleplaying canon universe with original characters\n\nGame of Thrones (could be in the current timeline or we could invent brand new houses and families)\n\nHarry Potter (any era is welcomed)\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nDivergent\n\nHunger Games\n\nAlice in Wonderland\n\nThe 100\n\nSense8\n\nNarnia\n\nAmerican Horror Story\n\nBattle Royale\n\n\n---- Roleplaying original universe with original characters\n\nMafia themed (we can either limit it to one type of mafia or bring in all of the well-known mafias such as Bratva, Cosa Nostra, Yakuza etc.)\n\nMedieval themed (I would probably prefer fictitious characters and events over the historically accurate ones)\n\nReality Show (something like Big Brother, but we could add a supernatural or a horror twist to it)\n\nRoad Trip\n\nSupernatural Camp\n\nAsylum (set in the past most likely, current asylums are dull)\n\nZombie apocalypse\n\nOrphanage\n",

            "selftext": "So what is kingdoms of ehlerrac exactly, well simply put, it's a freeform roleplay server that has an entirely custom world and lore. Our staff has put a huge amount of time into making sure everything is exactly as we think it should be, though things can still be changed! The server is in a very early stage right now, we've only just started inviting people! So what exactly is freeform roleplay exactly you ask? Well it's a sort of roleplay without the traditional dice and character sheets, which you would see in things like DnD or pathfinder, but keep the roleplay itself. Kingdoms of ehlerrac is also entirely text-based, so you don't need to have a mic or even a pc to participate! You can simply take out your phone, install discord if you haven't already, join the server and start! Another thing our server offers is an open-world rp, players are not locked to specific areas or towns, they can simply explore the lands as they wish.\r\n\r\nNow I'll go a bit more in depth in the systems that play a part in the kingdoms of ehlerrac server.\r\n1, a completely custom magic system! This system was designed by our staff, it has a few elements, or as we call them \"affinities\" that you can choose from, these are completely up to your will, although there is an upper limit as to how much you can have. The magic system is also totally free, how you use it is completely up to you, as long as it is approved by a member of staff.\n2, the fighting system is also completely free, members can fight however they want to, or not at all. The server is set up so that non-combat characters are exactly as important and included in the story as the combat ones. As said before, this is a freeform server, so we do not use stats and all that, instead we use your equipment and any training you may have gotten to see who would normally win a fight, although this may vary depending on what the players themselves decide.\r\n3, the money and equipment system is entirely set up with a bot, you can earn money by doing requests for the citizens of the cities, taking on jobs or even bounty hunting! It's all up to you.\r\n\r\nSo what kind of people are we looking for? We require at least an advanced understanding of the English language, mistakes can always be made, but not too much. Furthermore we would like people that are okay with reading a lot of text and typing it too! This is not an ERP either, it is allowed in dm's, but not encouraged. This is also a server that has quite a few restrictions, this isn't a place where you can be an all-powerful unicorn that has control over time and space, the characters here are much more toned down.\r\n\r\nSo putting it shortly: do you like fantasy roleplay? Do you like to read up on lore and maybe even influence it yourself? Then ehlerrac is the server for you!\n\nThis is the link:\nhttps://discord.gg/Krq2QVp",

            "selftext": "Seeking; Romance Driven Plots with Oc/canon or Oc/Oc \n\nHello role play community!\n\nI just want to put here, so no one feels that their time is wasted, I only Role play over email. :)\n\nI\u2019m on the constant hunt and hopefully I will snag a charismatic partnership in the realm of writing. I am searching for a relaxed atmosphere where writing revolves around the art and love of plotting our stories. \n\nDeep, psychological exploration of the people we write about.\n\nAngst.\n\nJoy.\n\nLove.\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading, well...you\u2019re the perfect match....\n\nI am looking for a partner that can reciprocate playing love interests, or as one would say \u2018doubling\u2019.I am willing and able to play canon for your oc, as long as the favor is returned. There will be many characters in our stories, making them as deep and gripping as possible. I prefer we each have our own stories or create one world together with two plot lines .\n\nWriting style~\n\nI like to write as the inspiration comes, and that is why my reply lengths vary but never less than two paragraphs for each character. I enjoy rapid response, as the story moving at a quicker pace usually keeps my attention better. (There\u2019s nothing more deflating than our plot taking days to get through one single scene.) \n\nThroughout the day I can reply about 3-5 times and then more in the evening if I am free. If I won\u2019t be around for the day or my responses will be small, I will always let my partner know with apologies included. I encourage OOC chatter, and I adore plotting on the side as we role play and even talking about day to day life stuff if that\u2019s how close we end up getting. But no pressure! I\u2019m of the idea that maybe we can become friends but I never expect it if my partner is more of a private soul!\n\nInterests~\n\nI adore romance. Of course other aspects are welcome in plots but I usually write with a character pair that will eventually develop a deep relationship. I also have very few limits and my stories become dark. I love to have a healthy ratio of dark drama and uplifting good. I have very little in terms of limits and I hope you can be the same. I have a very cheesy taste and I\u2019m sorry but my stories sound like the hallmark channel sometimes hahaha. I am willing to do any pairing, though I\u2019ll admit m/m is a bit of an unknown territory for me. I suppose briefly I should add here that I rarely fade to black for anything, and I prefer being able to have someone with little limits. Drugs, sex, and the like might come up and that means I also ask you are of age. \n\nI enjoy any time period, but nothing marvel or space related. I was never into these universes/themes and I don\u2019t want to disappoint my partner by not getting excited! It will unfortunately show in my writing. My favorite time period would be your typical medieval era, and I adore the 1920\u2019s. \n\nI am absolutely fine with any pairing, stuff like arranged marriage or social class differences. That\u2019s only a couple out of the hundreds of options. I feel like it\u2019s easier to just say the possibilities are limitless, and I enjoy taking themes or scenarios from movies, books, shows\u2026my inspiration comes from everywhere and I hope you are the same. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve gone over much of the basics\u2026I hope this was a good enough idea of what I am looking for and I hope to hear from you soon. \n",

President Snow has thus passed away from old age, and President Mayard has been elected into office. Panem life is as normal as it can be\u2026 \n\nThe Games\u2026\nThis Roleplay is set up as a competition! There are several factors that will affect you, such as the hunger-bar, popularity for sponsors, and more! The single winner will be documented on the blog, and will be invited to help plan the next Games!\n\n\n\nELEMENTS OF THE ROLEPLAY\nHUNGER BAR\n\nEvery day, you will lose 20% of your \u201cHunger Bar.\u201d This bar is key to your survival, and you can raise it by eating various food that you find. When the bar hits 0%, you have a two (2) day grace period to find enough food to get back up to 20%. If you do not, your character will perish. All-in-all, this allows for roughly a week of inactivity, so please be aware of how active you can be!\n\nPOPULARITY\n\nSponsors are your life-line! People viewing the blog will be able to place their bets on who will win, and, if approved by the Gamemaker, they can sponsor some supplies to you! Alternatively, the more popular you are in general, the more chance to have the Gamemakers spare you\u2026 or target you. You will be given a popularity bar to gauge how popular you are with the Capitol. With the Panem sponsors on the blog, you\u2019ll just have to wait and see\u2026\n\nTRAINING\n\nIn the week(s) before the Games, every tribute will be allowed to train together. Your training will be recorded by the Gamemakers, and may come in handy later on\u2026 As always, Careers start with three (3) basic training skills, while the rest start with none.\n\nCORNUCOPIA\n\nAt the beginning of the Games, the supplies are stashed in the Cornucopia\u2026 Each weapon, bag, and item will be described before the Bloodbath begins. Grab what you need and run!\n\nRANDOMIZED EVENTS\n\nThe Gamemakers are always trying to spice things up\u2026 Be sure to stay alert!",

I've been on a Supernatural kick lately and I've rewatched some of my favorite episodes and I love me some angels. Give me angels that love humanity and what they stand for; give me fallen angels that yearn for home but have no feasible way to make it home. Give me fallen angels that became the first demons. Give me angels that love; that hate. I want to feel passionate about writing again!\n\nAlso! I'm looking for any kind of monster you want to play! Really craving something like The Shape of Water. \n\nfandoms:\n\nSupernatural: I would love to use some of my angel ocs here!! If you'd play Castiel for me or your own angel then I would play pretty much anyone for you! I haven't seen the last couple of seasons though. I know what happens up to Metaton, I forget what season that is. I do favor seasons four and five though!!\n\nJojo's Bizarre Adventures: I'd love to do this with ocs with canon characters making an appearance if you play Jolyne, Dio, or Bruno for me I'd love you forever. I'm up to playing anyone from the main cast up to part six!\n\n*** Please be 20+\n",

Some of my favorites are Soul Eater, Sword Art Online, and My Hero Academia. Of course, I'm up for anything you might suggest as well, I'm very flexible and able to play either gender and a multitude of character types. For the genre of RP I am once again flexible, although I enjoy a healthy mix of Slice of life, Combat, and romance, if at all possible in the situation (Although I understand not every RP needs or can include combat). I like my partners to be somewhat available, I understand that daily might not be possible, but more than a couple posts a week is preferred. My posts vary depending on yours, but on my own I always attempt at least 1-2 paragraphs, if not more. I'm not super picky about everything being prim and proper grammatically, we all make mistakes! I'm looking forward to speaking with you, Pm me if you are interested!",

Most of my playmates live in the US so timing is a constant nightmare and most days i find myself with literally no one to play with at all T.T\n\nI rp via Skype and work rota (Shift work) so my timings are random at the best of times, been looking in to Discord but not gone that step further at the mo!.\n\ni RP in third person primarily though i'm not super fussed about that!, I love world building but i'm partial to borrowing existing worlds from time to time (books i read form a core part of my rp worlds, especially Warhammer and Warhammer 40k) and I don't fuss over post lengths though I do try my best to match my partners effort at the very least! not an amazing speller so you'll have to forgive me in advance (im terrible for grammar too as you can probably tell though I'm trying to improve)\n\nI play female orientated chars though often they will have some tomboyish qualities or attributes. any RPs would be totally up for discussion, nothing set in stone though I always have ideas floating round my head. Mainly Fantasy/Dark Fantasy, Sci-fi though I am always up for casual slice of life or anything new! (always love trying new things)\n\nI like to do story heavy RP's with little things thrown in here and there, If you wanna give it a whirl drop me a message and we can see how we get on! =) ",

            "selftext": "The Hunger came from nowhere. A cloud that could travel through space, made up trillions upon trillions of microorganisms capable of eating anything. First, they devoured Earth, sending humans into their galaxy\u2014lost and scared. They tried to warn the Prime Council, a gathering of the head of the Prime Races, but they were ignored. That was until the Hunger began to pick off their worlds one by one. The Prime Races tried to rally, but as soon as they went to stand against the Hunger, it devoured the Heart of the Galaxy\u2014and along with it the Prime Council.\n\nScared, races pulled in on themselves, breaking off all contact with each other. This became known as the Isolationist Period. It would go on for a long while, as the Hunger began to eat its way thru colonies and civilizations.\n\nThat was until the ODYSSEY INITIATIVE appeared. They were a gathering of galaxy\u2019s best and brightest. Their mission: to gather resources, embark on diplomatic missions, unearth new technology, fight back against those taking advantage of the current situation, and find a way to stop the Hunger. You were chosen to join the ODYSSEY INITIATIVE and travel aboard the Odyssey, which would venture all over the galaxy attempting to find a way to stop an indestructible force. Backed by the DAEDALUS PROJECT, a gathering of the brightest minds in the galaxy, you and your crewmates are the only thing standing in-between the galaxy and total annihilation.\n\n*A small hope, but the only one the galaxy has.*\n\n\n\n*Unfortunately We Have filled those Roles*\nBut we are opening up a secondary RP. This one will be less limiting than our original RP. You're going to be set on an adventure of a lifetime. 10k credits in your pocket, and an easy enough mission. You think. You hope. But unfortunately, things are not always what they seem.\n---\n\n**About the RP:**\n\n- This RP is Intermediate to Advanced. I welcome any Beginner RPers, but there are a lot of rules and a lot of lore. It'll hopefully lend itself to great character customization, but it might be a bit daunting.  \n- This RP is plot-driven. It isn't a sandbox. Not that I'll stick you on rails and force you down one direction. But the RP will follow its plot, minus a few fun detours.  \n- The content in this RP (the races, the governments, the places, the technology, the magic, etc.) are all original and extensive. Sure, there might be some tropes here and there, but I assure you that you've never played this game before.  \n- This is RP is 18+ only because of the complexity of the politics, ethics, war, and responsibilities of the characters. \n- All ideas are welcome, as long as they fit inside the theme of the RP, and I welcome all creativity and ingenuity.\n\n**A Warning:** This RP will work with me as the D&amp;D-esk DM, basically. But there will not be any dice rolling or stats. I just won't have a PC, and I'll be letting you know what is going on around you and how your actions affect the environment and those around you. Meaning that the foundation and backbone of this RP is **player** agency. I don't have a PC. It's all about the players, what they decide, and how they plan to move forward. \n\n-If you are interested. Please join our discord server. You don't have to commit by clicking the link. Give us a look over and decide if we're right for you: https://discord.gg/tBjzeaw",

            "selftext": "I'm gonna say this first, this isn't based on the new movies. I don't like them, I'll do that era if the other ones aren't interesting enough, but I'll take the others over the new one. I haven't seen The Last Jedi, spoil it if you're going to, I don't care. Just don't message me only to spoil it. \n\nNow that that's over with, I have characters for the Clone Wars, the Civil War and whatever the new one is called, I want to do them in that order. For the Clone Wars, I have a Jedi who turns into a gray Jedi over time, she's a knight when Order sixty six goes into effect. For the Civil War, I have a bounty hunter who's around while the empire is still alive, basically the entire time they're around, she is. I also have another proper Jedi for the tail end of that time period. And I have a rebel that I haven't gotten to use at all that can either be during the Civil War or the new era.\n\nI go to school full time, so I can't be on until about four pm pacific time every day, except on weekends, but those can change every time. Before then, I can't do anything. And the wifi here usually shuts down about eight during the week, and can stretch up to eleven thirty on Friday nights. It's a small window, I know, but its all I have to work with. So if you're interested, message me with which era we'll be in in the title of your message, and whether or not we'll be here or on Discord. Also you can look over my other posts if you want, if any of them interest you I might be willing to do them.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m currently in search of new partners, and I just recently finished watching My Hero Academia, and now I\u2019ve been itching to do a roleplay set in the show. ;^;\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who wouldn\u2019t mind playing as one of the canon characters. More specifically, one of the boys from class 1-A. My favorites are;\n-Katsuki Bakugo\n-Izuku Midoriya \n-Eijiro Kirishima\n-Tenya Lida \n-Shoto Torodoki\n-Denki Kaminari\n\nI myself will be playing as an OC that I\u2019ll come up with, if that\u2019s not too much of a bother.~ \n\nWe don\u2019t have to stick to just the show, we could also do AU\u2019s!\n\n(Soulmate AU, Villain AU, A/B/O AU, ect.) \n\n\nNow about things like grammar and literacy. \n\nI understand that mistakes happen, they happen to me too, but if you\u2019re doing it constantly it\u2019s going to be hard for me to focus on the roleplay. \n\nLength wise, I want someone who\u2019s able to match up to me in length, which is usually 2-4.\n",

            "selftext": "That's right, message me quick ( but read the whole post first) spots are limited. \n\nWith that aside a little about me, I am Elise Elson, a 19 year old student majoring in psychology. In my spare time among a plethora of other things I like to write. I don't always find the time in my hectic life right now but the winter break has given me some much needed writing time.\n\nA couple of things you should take away from this:\n\n* I won't be available to talk and RP 24/7\n* There will be some days with no RP or talk\n* I am older than 18 and expect my partner to be the same\n* I am not an author, this is only a hobby so don't come expecting a novel\n\nWhile I have your attention, I would also like to thank you for taking your time to read this ad. I know I might sound like and asshole, but really I am just a sweet girl who just want's to write. :)\n\nI am big into fandoms, but there are time when I just don't want to do a certain thing. So don't be afraid to ask me but don't be pissed if I say no. Some fandoms I am into right now:\n\n* Game Of Thrones\n* Harry Potter (This one is weird and will need discussing)\n* Star Wars (My knowledge goes as far as the movies, I have seen them all)\n* Disney (This too we need to discuss)\n\nI also like original worlds, but I won't make them all on my own. I know there are people out there like that, so be warned if you want to build a world it will need both of our input. I won't do it on my own.\n\nSo some genres I enjoy:\n\n* Adventure\n* Crime Syndicate\n* Fairytale\n* Fantasy (Vampire, Fey, Magic, etc)\n* Historical\n* Horror\n* Kidnapped / Slavery\n* Modern / Slice of life\n* Mythological (Greek)\n* Post Apocalyptic / Dystopian\n\nIf you have any others don't be afraid to ask me, who know I might enjoy it.\n\nSo finally I like to write, 3rd person, past / present. My lengths are generally 3 - 5 paragraphs and want my partners to match that. If you have a sample of your writing you get extra points :D I am not opposed to smut/romance, in fact I want that to be in my stories just not the only thing in my story.\n\nYou can reach me by DMs.\n\nThank you for reading, I look forward to all of your pretty orange letters. :)",

            "selftext": "Caedia is a medieval fantasy RP - there are noble houses, gods and goddesses and several unique and playable races! Here is a little preface so you all know what you're getting into:\n\nIn the capital of Caedia, Xetela's Landing, tensions are high, and people are plunging into an almost panic-mode due to a recent trail of grisly murders. The King has dismissed all of this and claimed they are unrelated, but others with a more watchful eye have observed patterns within the murders and have sensed they're... something more sinister. Sacrifices? Possibly.\n\nThe word is that a group has been forming and venturing around the city. People claim that have seen demons in the flesh committing the murders, or just walking in the shadows and trailing people, singling out their next victim. One whom has been explicitly vocal about this theory has recently been found decapitated and cut open in a back alley. \n\nMeanwhile, the Queen is missing. The royal family has said that she is just on a visit to her parents, but with suspicions as high as they are, the citizens know that something else is going on. Even the Queens own brother, Ezekiel Blackwell, has had his concerns dismissed by King Wilhelm.\n\nAnd now, this is where you come in. Fears have started to decline for the time being, as Xetela's Festival is coming up! It is a celebration to worship the Protector of Caedia which lasts four days in the city, along with a gala for the higher status citizens. Decorations are being placed, and so many people are getting excited about the festivities to come. There's gossip about which noble houses will be in attendance, their invitations being accepted fleetingly. In order to keep the people feeling safe, extra armed forces were brought in to guard the central areas and provide a sense of protection while the festival is occurring.\n--\nOur server is 16+ and we\u2019re always looking for more skilled roleplayers to enjoy this story with us! I\u2019m currently searching for someone to be a new addition to my moderator team as well. We expect everyone to follow the rules and to play nice in order to have a good time. We\u2019re always open to partnering with other discord RP servers as well!  ( :\n\nhttps://discord.gg/UeNDbSa\n\nSee you there!",

A lot of it is based from taking Japanese (and some from other mythologies and some original) mythical creatures and reimagining them , and mixing the culture of Japan in the Heian, feudal, and Meiji periods of Japanese history with modern technology to world build a unique setting, but all this is just explaining it lightly. \n\nThe setting fits into the following genres: high/epic fantasy, Dark Fantasy, sci-fi fantasy, space opera, and in some cases dying earth \n\nInfo on the setting here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vzpYYSTGClELDZNWIwamdr2JOpP_7m1RZunY_sg87E\n\nPlease be prepared to deal with some pretty dark issues, if anything triggers you please let me know. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required(but welcome), but please be detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

I\u2019d prefer we roleplayed on Telegram, rather than Discord, but both are alright.\n\nI have a wide array of characters, both Female and Male, and can play any role you prefer with anyone. I love meeting new Roleplayers, and love bettering myself as well as them (If needed, of course!) If you\u2019d like to try a different kinda roleplay, I\u2019m more than willing to experiment and try new things.\n\nThough for the most part I\u2019m not picky, I.. do prefer you to be competent when it comes to grammar and literacy. Not asking for perfection, because I know I\u2019m certainly far from it, but absolutely no one word responses and -Nuzzles Chu x3-.\n\nI certainly hope to see you soon!",

This was known as God's Blood Program and it only lasted 2 years until they accidentaly strengthed a disease that took in other diseases and made itself stronger creating the z virus. This event has many names to it and since the spread of the disease people called the begginning of the virus whatever they want. But now it has been 4 years since the first contact of the z virus and the world is in it's worst state.\n8 years have passed since the beginning of the fall of humanity. The US has been torn apart and in its absence factions took control of entire cities and in extreme cases, entire states. The US has been ravaged by dozens of \"small\" to medium wars from rival factions numbering in the thousands, this has left the country barren and a hard place to live. But amidst the war and blood loss many factions rose to protect the human race from the zombie disease and from itself, one of this factions are called the QRF. Officialy they call themselves the Little Creek Settlement but are better known by there elite military branch. This is our story but it doesnt have to be yours, other factions are rising and are working to reclaim the land, it is your choice on which faction to join or if to join none at all. Or will you go against the world and take everything for yourself? God Blood! Humanity Rising!",

I find it oddly stifling that so many communities have so much set in stone before the players actually arrive, and I'd love to try and hammer out that balance of frontier spirit vs. established world.\n\nIn my mind, I have something along the lines of a little frontier township accumulating, but I'm not fussy about setting or even really clinging to that notion. I would rather what eventually springs from our brainstorming to be original, however.\n\nPlease, respond with your thoughts, secrets or questions, I'd like this to eventually move to discord just due to platform preference, but would rather get to know a few potentials over on reddit, first.\n\nWith thanks,\nChoux\n\n",

            "selftext": "The year is 1874. The Union is no more. To the north, the United States. Although still a wealthy nation, times have been tough, but they are still a superpower. With only a few allies still supporting them, the United States is running out of options.. They remain industrial, and thanks to the newly discovered mineral Satorium, they harness just enough to steadily go by.\n\nThe Confederacy, however, far succeeds the United States. Using harsh labor to mine the precious mineral, they have turned into a mighty country. One so powerful it rivals the Roman Empire. New weapons, airships, and amazing mechanical wonders are being produced. And with an alliance with the German Empire as well as the emerging Central Powers, a new mechanized conflict could be at hand.\n\nThe United States, seeing this, begins an elite espionage network, full of individuals from all religions, races, and backgrounds. This story falls onto one group, and their story will be told.\n\n\nHiya! So I must admit, I haven't fully watched PP, but I love the premise! Espionage in a steampunk world. I have many ideas for characters, and the world in which they'll live in. I have a few requirements:\n\n\u2022BE. LITERATE.\n\u2022A paragraph is expected.\n\u2022Smut WILL happen, but there will be build up.\n\n\nI don't ask of you to be here 24/7. Just message me if something comes up, you know? I will either use Discord or Kik, whichever you prefer. Thanks for reading, and message me if you're interested!\n",

            "selftext": "*The new township had a few dozen families, homes for each, a windmill for milling grain, a sawmill and lumber yard for processing the rich wood of the forest that surrounds, a few common wells for water, a town hall, a small shrine to Lady Bel, the Sun Goddess, and other communal and private buildings for processing food and goods. It is far from becoming a city and the local lord is further away than the nearest large town. Trade goods come occasionally in exchange for the high quality lumber, and merchants to sell their wares. However, the woods have always been a place of mystery, rumor, and fear. The people that work them whisper of spirits watching the lumberers, that the woods themselves have a life and an intelligence that rues their work against the trees. The people do not feel safe.*\n\n*But* she *is here to belay those fears. She is a Paladin of Lady Bel, the Goddess of Light, Healing, and Justice. Trained to wield steel and the magic of the Lady of Light, she is here to bring the law of civilization to the frontier town, to tend Lady Bel's shrine, and to put to rest any notions of evil spirits...or put such spirits to rest themselves.*\n\n*Chief among the rumors is that of a spirit moving through the village at night, wandering around, visiting the farm animals and the wells, floating about, sometimes just watching. The lady Paladin will discover this spirit to be one like her...a Priest of Lord Sin, the Master of the Moon, a god of Mystery, Magic, Secrets, but primarily known as the Dual-Natured God; a guide for those lost in the dark, and an avenger for the wronged. What this young man wants is not clear, but the two of them shall become painfully entwined together.*\n\nI would like to do a roleplay steeped in emotion and a conflicted romance between the Moon Priest and the Sun Paladin. Whether from internal or external threats, I would like conflict and pain between them as they struggle with their emotions. I want to paint a rich and lush world with lots of descriptors and feeling. We can fill in more details and more about the characters before we start. I hope we can create something deep and filled with feeling together. If you have any questions, let me know.",

If you like anything you see here, or have any ideas you think I might enjoy, still feel free to send a message my way~\n\n\n**Post The Last Jedi**: \n\nSo, my thoughts on perhaps where we can take the story sorta in an AU way, since I'm pretty sure what I think might happen probably won't in 9. \nThe first factor, a great lack of faith/loyalty to the new Supreme Leader Kylo Ren from the First Order. Those present on Crait, when Luke Skywalker presented himself before them all and Kylo demanded he deal with the Jedi alone, saw how Kylo's rage blinded him from seeing a trick. The First Order, Hux more specifically aware of Kylo's strength in the Force, and yet he failed to see through what was going on. That doesn't say well for a newly assigned leader. \n\nHow I see things, The First Order will begin to lose ground around the Galaxy. Luke's heroic stand sparking new flames, allowing the Resistance to make some ground, while the in-fighting and doubt weakens the First Order. \nThis could prompt Kylo requesting the Knights of Ren to return, from wherever they might be, and they go on missions themselves to re-establish dominance.\n\nWe could also write from the Point of view from the Resistance, who are know relying more on Gorilla warfare tactics; striking small, but over-all aiming for larger damage. \nConsidering the main group of heroes are back together at the end of 8, we can have some interesting play off them- we haven't relaly seen Poe and Rey interact.\n\nThanks for reading my jumble of thoughts, if you want to , feel free to send a message! \n",

I would like it if you were alright with playing mutiple characters. You would never have to play 10+ characters at a time, however! I understand that playing mutiple characters can get overwhelming. The most you probably ever play at a time would be two. I would like someone who is detailed, and doesn't mind putting some effort and length into their responses. I don't mind whether your male or female in real life. As long as you don't mind playing female characters, it's fine by me! I'm looking for someone who doesn't mind being in the more controlling role in the roleplay(A gamemaster would be awesome, but not necessary!). \n\nStory wise, I would like the plot to be this: My character would be a teenager, brought into overwatch from a accident nearby. He would be extremely timid and nervous around others. The rp would be more slice of lifeish, focusing around his bonding with the characters, and coping with past abuse. \n\nIf your interested, please pm me!",

            "selftext": "**Hey /roleplay!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\n&gt; I am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\n&gt; I don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n&gt; When it comes to where we RP I have four choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\n&gt; Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n&gt; This is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n* The Witcher (Currently craving this the most.)\n\n**World Building**\n&gt; I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Kenzie and I\u2019m looking for someone to roleplay with!! :) Sorry if that sounded weird but I\u2019m just super excited and love to roleplay. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about 4 Years now so I am pretty literate so I\u2019d be looking for an equally literate partner! Now onto the fun stuff.\n\nSo i was looking to do a roleplay off the movie called The Longest Ride.  Now don\u2019t freak out if you haven\u2019t seen it. I can tell you the baseline and tell you about it then we can just go off of that and create our own little story.  So a college girl meets a professional bull rider who a year ago had been in an bull riding accident which left him in a coma for ten days and gave him some brain damage. Now fast forward one year later and he\u2019s back riding bulls well these two meet at the local rodeo as he\u2019s riding a bull he jumps off losing his hat in the crowd and there I catch it. And that\u2019s where our story will start!  Now I want there to be romance and smut and drama and conflict. The doctors keep telling you you need to be done bull riding but you don\u2019t want too stop.  Now I know it\u2019s kind of a sappy story but I hope someone finds it interesting and will want to do this with me! :)\n\nPm me and we can discuss it alittle more! I am willing to do most platforms but we can discuss that in PM. Thank you for taking the time to read this and hope to hear from you soon \ud83d\ude0a",

This will be a SciFi-Fantasy crossover world in which there are three different planes of existence. Each being a different version of Earth, holding the same continents and general geography. Each world has its own theme. The first one being sci-fi, the second one being our plane of existence, and the third being the fantasy world \n\nThe first world, known as sector one is the sci-fi world, where humanity has advanced hundreds of years ahead of us after they found a new element which in our world decayed hundreds of years ago. And in this world, robots aka \"sentients\" walk side by side with humanity. They are seen as second class citizens even after a brutal war between humanity and technology.\n\nThe second world is ours and is basically the same, but it was a battle ground between sector one and three. Leaving this world to still be recovering.\n\nThe third is the fantasy world where magic and all the other races exist and thrive together. This world was the first to attack in the war between one and three. But we're suppressed and are now under the rule of sector three. This world is considered the most dangerous, being they are still a medieval society. But magic is very destructive and the mythical creatures are not to be underestimated.\n\nIf you are interested, I roleplay in Google docs, discord, and Kik.\n\nI can adjust the world if you wish to.",

            "selftext": "Hi there, you can call me Gynxie! I am a twenty-two year old woman in the US CST zone. Due to just graduating college, I currently have a lot of free time as I look for work, so I\u2019m looking for one more writing partner.  I write mainly on Discord, in third person multi-paragraph (2-5 paragraphs per reply), and veer towards writing female roles. I don\u2019t mind doubling, or playing side characters of various genders and sexualities, but if left to my own devices I will make bi-females. Anywho, I\u2019m looking for someone in a similar time zone, literate, at least twenty, who writes more than a one line response, and likes ooc chatter, fawning over characters, and occasional doodles! \n\nLast but not least, I\u2019m in the mood for a good romance. It doesn\u2019t have to be the entire plot, but at least present. I\u2019m a fan of fantasy, sci-fi, and modern settings, and touching on darker subjects when it\u2019s appropriate. I have one plot bunny at the moment, with a dragon stuck in a human form, on the run from the people who kept her imprisoned.\n\nIf there was anything that interests you, please send me a PM! Feel free to send me your own plot bunnies. Looking forward to hearing from you all!\n",

These ideas can acomidate 1x1 or group, I can also do 1x1 with multiple characters. \n\nThe first one is an apocalypse idea, I'm really craving that one currently. The basic idea is a \nVirus is set loose that attacks and mutates DNA turning anything living into mutated blood thirsty creatures! I will go into more detail in the  RP, my character plays a large roll in it. \n\nMy second is a demon idea, kind of a hell on earth idea. This is set after the rapture when the righteous are taken up to heaven and the sinners are left on earth. Demons now roam the earth doing Satan's bidding. My character is one of those demons that had sold her soul to Lucifer when she was a human. \n\nI also except other ideas as well and am pretty flexible. I can come up with a character on the spot for an idea I really like. \n\nI prefer email, however I can be swayed. ",

Though I've fallen of for a few months or so I still free write a lot and am still pretty good.\n\nI prefer to do OC's, no fandoms, and use 3rd person. I have a few plots in mind and would love to discuss them if you message me. One is slice of life and the other is fantasy, but if you have ideas of your own i am more than open to hearing them. I use Skype, and Discord as platforms to roleplay on. ",

That being said, I don't care if your a female that plays a male or a male that plays a male. I'm also open to trans characters. \n* I don't care how often you post. I'm a busy person in real life and I'm sure you are too. I'm more than happy to just chat as partners or discuss plots or bounce ideas off one another.\n* I'm open to Skype and Discord in terms of platforms. I prefer Skype but I'm perfectly happy to use Discord. \n* I'm in my mid-twenties and have been roleplaying for nearly a decade so I'd like to think I'm decent at this whole thing but you'll just have to be the judge of that.\n* Romance and NSFW content is lovely but not required. If you're not comfortable with certain things, just let me know ahead of time. \n* I don't have any certain plots or ideas on hand. If you do, I'd love to hear them.

            "selftext": "So, just what is the lands of Therin? It's a roleplaying server that is looking for roleplayers that want a controlled roleplay that is based on adventuring a large piece of land. It's an open world roleplay, so what just does that mean? It means that your character is not required to remain in any certain area or with any specific group. You may travel anywhere you wish around the map so long as you do the roleplay of moving to that location. The roleplay while it has restrictions in place to make sure that nobody goes overboard with their character and to stray away from the edge-lords of roleplay, is still decently free in what it allows. There's a set list of elemental arcane affinities, but if what you want isn't on the list don't worry! You can always speak to an admin and find out if you can get what you want!\n\nSo, what exactly makes us different from any other roleplay out here on Discord? Well, the clear thing is that our server runs off a customized world and lore. This means that no other roleplay server will have the background ours has or the set land as we have put thought into our server and have made sure to think of what the locations are and what they are about. This is also meant to be for large-scale roleplaying, mean that the more people, the better. Of course, at the start to avoid boredom, we advise you keep within certain areas to keep you around the roleplay, but are in no way required to. \n\nSo, what are the requirements? Simply we ask that you fluently speak English and understand what serious roleplay is! This is not a place to find ERP, or a place to create a character that can turn into a 76 headed snake. There is a bit of reading to be done with the roleplay information that's provided, but it will ensure you know everything there is to know before making a character.\n\nSo, to put it short. Are you into large-group roleplays? Do you like fantasy setting roleplays? Do you like to have fun? It's pretty much what this Discord is. Not sure if you're down, come in! Ask some questions and read some more!\n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/ZrX43ft",

If you\u2019re interested then DM me. I tend to use Kik more often for roleplay but I can also use Reddit if preferable to you and we can discuss more. ",
