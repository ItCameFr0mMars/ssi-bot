            "selftext": "Hi everybody! I've posted spooky prompts a lot on here, but now I'm rehashing some of my ideas a bit into this one. Apologies for the hiatus in case someone missed me--and if we've roleplayed together before and you're interested in this, please feel free to reach out. I essentially want to play a vampire (centuries old, but turned somewhere in her early to mid-teens) who meets your character as a child, parts ways, and then meets him again later in life; possibly at various times, though as a kid (somewhere between 11-13) and then as an older adult (30s-40s; bonus points if he ends up as a cop/detective or some kind of supernatural hunter\u2014extra super bonus points for both!) are what I\u2019m most interested in since the dynamics are probably most markedly different\u2014though I have ideas for late teens and early adulthood too.\n\nBasically, we\u2019d roleplay one \u2018era\u2019 until it got boring or we both ran out of ideas\u2014but if you really want to get in depth, I do have a lot of spooky ideas for when they\u2019re younger, almost Stranger Things-eqsue (and hey, can we please make it the 80s because music). However, that option might be a slow burn and it\u2019d take your character awhile to meet mine. If you want to take the lead when they\u2019re older, that\u2019d be great, but I have ideas to contribute there, too. \n\nMy vampires and many of my other spooks are largely based off of Old World of Darkness but I\u2019m certainly not married to all of its lore or mechanics and knowledge of it isn\u2019t required but might be helpful for my ideas not sounding completely insane\u2014but if you\u2019d rather preserve various mysteries, might be beneficial NOT to know. \ud83d\ude09 \n\nMessage me if you want to discuss!!! \n\n\n",

Various plot/world details are coming out, and the players are really pushing story lines forward! Come and join, add your uniqueness to this mixing pot!\n\n-The world used to be normal, normal, normal. Then the flash occurred - Our clocks ticked down to the new year on December 31st, 2009. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. Boom. A flash knocked everything electrical down for five seconds, then it all restarted.\nEveryone was puzzled, until the first Meta's appeared. The world fell into a time of chaos, and all hoped seemed to be lost... until Beacon appeared. He gathered up good heroes and fought back against the tides of anarchy.\n\nEight years they fought, until one day - The final battle came. The battle of Boston. Hundreds of superhumans were involved, from all across the globe. The city was leveled, but the heroes one. Not without a cost though - Beacon dead, thousands of others killed.\nThey rebuilt, though. They built Beacon City where Boston used to be and combined the council of heroes forming the FMSA - The Federal Meta Safety Agency.\n\nWho will you be? A member of the newly formed FMSA? A vigilante? Someone with a power just trying to get by? A villain? -\n\nhttps://discord.gg/vvj8EZE",

I have embarked on the long and arduous journey towards a PhD, which will limit my availability considerably. But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above two meaty paragraphs makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nI'd like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. There are many more themes I am willing to try. The only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this!

            "selftext": "*It was hard for Hagrid. Hogwarts had been the only home he'd known since his childhood. He had shed blood here, in battles and to the blast ended skrewts. He had made friends here. He had found family here.*\n\n*However, with Professor McGonagall's retirement last year, the last familiar face was gone from the school. Flitwick, Trelawny, Vector, and Sprout had all moved on to other career opportunities or to the contented boredom of retirement.* \n\n*Plus, at 89 years old, he was no longer as spry as he once was. His bushy beard and wild mane of hair were as silver as Dumbledore's had been. His joints ached and his back was tight. He could no longer, single handedly, carry the 12 Christmas trees into the Great Hall. He could no longer remember the names of the Centaur foals or keep track of his teaching duties. It was time to retire.* \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI had some large shoes to fill, both figuratively and otherwise, taking over duties for Hagrid. He had been the grounds keeper for longer than many could remember and a very capable Care of Magical Creatures teacher to boot. He was my favorite teacher during my time at Hogwarts and, if I allow myself a hint of immodesty, I believe I was one of his favorite students. Not to take away from the famed witches and wizards that he knew. But, I think he saw a bit of himself in me. Most wizards, after all, are an indoor lot. They relish their libraries, their bubbling cauldrons, and dark lairs of contemplation. Hagrid and I were of a different sort. \n\nGrowing up, I relished the woods behind my home. Hiking. Swimming. Climbing. Running. Searching every nook and cranny, aching to soak up each droplet of sunlight and understand every square inch of my small kingdom. I had an affinity for animals, even then. They found me, ran with me, played with me, and protected me. I didn't know it, then, for what it was... Magic. \n\nMuggle born and unsure what to think when I received my letter, I arrived at Hogwarts and, unlike my classmates, felt drawn not to the Castle with all of its glittering candles and translucent ghosts but to the forest and the lake... I could hear them, calling me. Their voices were so much more complex than the ones I had heard growing up. The animals behind my house were babbling toddlers and these creatures were speaking. I could hear the unicorns, the squid, even the acromantula. I relished the subtle variations in their auras, the minute differences in the way I sensed them. None of this even came close to my elation at meeting the Centaur or the Merpeople. \n\nI was sorted into Ravenclaw and thrived in all my subjects, though Care of Magical Creatures was my speciality. I earned 8 OWLs and 5 NEWTs (Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Herbology, and, of course, Care of Magical Creatures). Yet, I didn't spend my free time studying in the Library. Instead, every spare moment would find me running through the grounds, climbing in the forest, swimming with the giant squid, or visiting with Hagrid. \n\nHe took an interest in me. Tutored me. Fostered my love for all creatures, the magical and the mundane. When I graduated, he even contacted a close friend of his, Charlie Weasley, and got me a summer internship studying Dragons in Romania.\n\nAfter graduation, I spent the next 5 years following in the footsteps of the great Newt Scamander. I explored the wilds of the world, cataloging and updating many of his entries in \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" and trying to make my own mark on Magizoology. \n\nI was in Greece, studying the mating and nesting habits of Griffons, when I received Hagrid's letter. He told me of his plans to retire and that he had suggested my name to the new Headmaster as his replacement. He asked if I would be interested. I dropped everything. Like Hagrid, my time at Hogwarts was the happiest of my life and being a teacher there had always been my dream. Once more, the old game's keeper was looking out for me. \n\nAnd, so, a new adventure begins... The sun glinting bright off the windows of the castle and the surface of the lake, I stand, awaiting the arrival of my very first class. So much to learn, so little time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Hey guys, My name is Dr. JS.

We can talk more specifics if you enjoyed what you read and I am open to all sorts of stories building from here.**\n\n**If you are a HP fan, I would love to hear from you. Did you like the prompt?

My character will be a Dark Souls character pulled from his world into the world of BOTW. \n\nAs for yours, you can go the same route and have your character come from another game world. Or be from BOTW itself. \n\nOur characters will strike up a friendship despite my character being mute. During their journies together, they will make a strong bond as warriors.\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, please feel free to hit me up in a PM. \n\nAs for my schedule, I work Mon-Fri typically 6am-4pm PST.

            "selftext": "Hi all.\n\nSo I've realized I'm craving a Fallout RP. I have something of a plot in mind, so I'll write a bit about it and then a bit about myself and my writing preferences. You'll have to forgive me - I really rather hate RP ads so this will definitely not be exciting. \n\nI'm thinking of playing a Vault-dweller. Someone who, because of certain circumstances, has recently found herself without a home. I'm not solid yet on the specific reasons behind the Vault's failure, but she's on a mission of revenge. However, being a Vault-dweller certainly doesn't lend itself to traveling in the Wastes very effectively at all. That is where you come in. \n\nI'm flexible on your character because, of course, it's *your* character. My thought was that perhaps soon after my character sets out from her Vault, she happens upon yours. Maybe yours intends to rob or assault mine - that is, until my character realizes yours is quite ill. See, she was a doctor prior to the collapse of her Vault, and *oh*, how you've been suffering. Any sort of relief from the pain at this point is lucrative in your characters' eyes.\n\nFrom there, they can travel together, develop a bond and very eventually perhaps a romance. Of course, this is all just my passive thoughts on it. I'm definitely interested in hearing others' ideas. \n\nAs for me, I write through email and I write a lot. I need a partner who writes their replies in a multi-paragraph format. I need someone who replies fairly regularly, and someone who is open to chatting about plot. I'm not looking for smut and the like, but am not opposed to it necessarily. However, I require my partners be *at least* 21. I like a writing sample, and can provide one. \n\nAnyway, please PM me if you're interested. I'd love to hear from you!",

Under the employ of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the crew has been contracted to deliver provisions, supplies, equipment, and other cargo to a colony struggling to thrive on an alien planet located just outside of the outer rim.\n\nOur story begins with the crew waking from hyper sleep; some have been with the Ethelred for years, while for others this is their first deep space contract with the Company. Regardless, they're on final approach to Haven and preparing for the mission ahead.\n\nOur community includes fans of the Alien (film) franchise, who have come together to write our own chapter within this science fiction horror universe introduced nearly 40 years ago.

            "selftext": "She had been in the mental hospital for months now, no amount of medication was clearing up what was wrong with her. Despite the fact she was having some pretty vivid, realistic hallucinations, she was always of sound mind. The doctors could agree on that much. What they couldn't agree on was how someone had so much brain function, it showed up on the scans like someone had flashed a camera. They gave her meds to try to dull brain activity, they gave her everything they could think of. One night, she snuck out with her room mate who had managed to get some weed into the place and that was where she finally found her peace, even if only for a few hours. \n\nFor the last six months she had had visions of stars and galaxies, of being close to the sun and being blinded. She could almost deal with them, but the man she saw, telling her what she really was, that she had a profound connection to the universe and it was calling out to her; just like it called to him a few hundred years ago. No matter how much she screamed, he wouldn't leave her alone and she would be sedated as she fell into a panicked fit. \n\nAnd then it happened, she thought it was another hallucination but the nurse insisted he was indeed her visitor for the day. The man standing in front of her who had driven her to insanity, she struggled with him being real. The meeting went poorly, and she broke.

I do ask for a minimum of two paragraph responses, as I find anything shorter difficult to respond to meaningfully.\n\n2. I also ask for solid grammar. Mistakes are okay if they\u2019re not too common, and I don\u2019t care about typos as those are somewhat inevitable.\n\n3. I ask that you be fairly familiar with Madoka\u2019s setting and themes, so that when working to create a plot we can get something good fairly quickly.\n\n4. Absolutely no edgelords, please. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for almost ten years now and in that time, I have become fairly sick of cliched/tropey/unnecessarily dark characters.\n\nAs for me, I\u2019m a young adult male. I enjoy drawing and writing on a hobbyist\u2019s level, and am looking to become an electrician. I currently live in England but move stateside very soon.\n\nI\u2019m down for just about anything besides erp, thematically, and I can come up with plots pretty quickly. I enjoy taking time to make longer, more thoughtful posts, over spitting out instant replies. If that means 1-2 posts a day or fewer, that\u2019s fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, shoot me a pm and let me know!",

We understand that for some people change is big and scary, but we promise writing via RP.me is not, and we are more than happy to help you with the transition.  Any additional questions, please save them for the end of this post.  Thank you!**\n\n--------------------\n\nTHE GREAT ESCAPE RPG\n\nIt started with a few commercials on MTV, a channel that used to host music videos yet somehow evolved to contain strange reality shows about pregnant teenagers and orange partiers on garbage beaches. Inbetween the heavily scripted \u2018real\u2019 drama, and the occasional actual scripted show that wasn\u2019t so bad (seriously, why was Teen Wolf even on this channel?), a single commercial started to catch your attention. Normally, you would roll your eyes at yet another reality game show where contestants were stuffed together and forced to compete for some prize. But this one\u2026 this one caught your eye. It seemed different. It seemed better. It seemed\u2026 dare we say it\u2026. cool. \n\nEscape Games had already been growing fairly popular. You\u2019ve probably done a few with your friends, or maybe with your family as a neat alternative to playing monopoly or yet another round of mini-golf. Maybe you\u2019re good at them. Maybe you suck at them. Maybe you\u2019re really good at them, and are just itching to try something on a larger scale. Maybe you\u2019re just bored and waiting for a new episode of Room Raiders to come on. \n\nWhatever your deal, you see the commercial, and you\u2019re interested. \n\nThe Great Escape! A new reality game show, set in a medieval Scottish Castle, with one simple goal: Survive the curse and escape the castle. The prize? A measly $1,000,000. \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking. In this day and age, a million dollars ain\u2019t worth sh*t. You\u2019ve seen the housing market. A cool million hardly gets you a mansion. After you\u2019ve paid off your student loans, you barely have enough to afford a studio apartment in Manhattan. And as everyone\u2019s favorite troubadour is proud to announce, you\u2019ll have a knapsack full of jack after taxes (+10 points if you get the reference!). \n\nStill\u2026 adding a mil to your bank account surely couldn\u2019t hurt it. \n\nPlus, the adverts are telling you that you get to spend ten days in a castle, for free. \n\nSure, MTV (in partnership with a company called Paradox Productions) has set up the castle to look cursed, and you have to solve puzzles and sh*t and compete with other people. If you get eliminated, you don\u2019t get to play in the castle anymore\u2026. but even if you only make it to the second round, that\u2019s still two days in a Scottish castle, for free. \n\nIt might be kinda cool. \n\nPlus, if you\u2019re good at puzzles and codes and games, maybe you\u2019ll make it to the end. Maybe you\u2019ll win fame and fortune and go down in history as the coolest escape game winner ever. There may even be some hot people of your gendered interest that you could flirt with when you\u2019re not solving puzzles. \n\nOf course, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s all too good to be true. There was that one article on the internet that claimed Strathmore Castle to actually be cursed. Apparently someone said there were actual murders that took place there, murders that were never quite solved. Weird ass sh*t has been happening in the castle, even before MTV decided to host their rating grab show there.. \n\nBut in your mind, whatever the downside, it seems worth the risk. \n\nIt won\u2019t hurt to just send an application, right? It\u2019s just an application. What are the chances you\u2019d actually get picked to compete? What are the chances that the curse is real? What are the chances that anything bad could really come of this? \n\nProbably as low as your chances of winning the million dollar prize. \n\nBut hey, you don\u2019t care about chances. You care about fun. And this looks fun. \n\nSo you send in an application, and you wait. \n\nYou don\u2019t admit it, but a small part of you can\u2019t wait for the response. Even if you did it as a joke, and pretended to forget about it shortly after you sent it in\u2026 there\u2019s that small part of your heart that beats a little faster on the day you pull an envelope out of the mailbox (MTV is sure old fashioned sometimes\u2026haven\u2019t they heard of email?) and see an MTV logo on the backside. \n\nAnd you can\u2019t help the feeling of excitement that alights in your chest when you read the first line of the letter: \n\nDear Contestant, Everyone here at Paradox Productions is delighted to accept your application\u2026. \n\nSomething that feels like fear, the kind of instinct that sends animals running before a tsunami, tickles at the back of your neck. You ignore it. It doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nYou\u2019re going to Scotland. You\u2019re going to live in a Castle. You\u2019re going to play the best Escape Game ever. \n\nAnd you\u2019re going to have fun. \n\nOr you'll die trying.\n\n---------------------------\n\nAdditional information such as the **rules**, how to **audition** and how to **play the game** will be available [HERE!](http://www.roleplayer.me/1357487)\n\n",

Most events in the room's history are as the games and lore of TES dictate, with some specific recent event changes that fit the room's older or more significant player characters.\nThe room features many smaller plotlines between characters, as well as larger plots that may take up more presence in the room.

            "selftext": "*The new township had a few dozen families, homes for each, a windmill for milling grain, a sawmill and lumber yard for processing the rich wood of the forest that surrounds, a few common wells for water, a town hall, a small shrine to Lady Bel, the Sun Goddess, and other communal and private buildings for processing food and goods. It is far from becoming a city and the local lord is further away than the nearest large town. Trade goods come occasionally in exchange for the high quality lumber, and merchants to sell their wares. However, the woods have always been a place of mystery, rumor, and fear. The people that work them whisper of spirits watching the lumberers, that the woods themselves have a life and an intelligence that rues their work against the trees. The people do not feel safe.*\n\n*But* she *is here to belay those fears. She is a Paladin of Lady Bel, the Goddess of Light, Healing, and Justice. Trained to wield steel and the magic of the Lady of Light, she is here to bring the law of civilization to the frontier town, to tend Lady Bel's shrine, and to put to rest any notions of evil spirits...or put such spirits to rest themselves.*\n\n*Chief among the rumors is that of a spirit moving through the village at night, wandering around, visiting the farm animals and the wells, floating about, sometimes just watching. The lady Paladin will discover this spirit to be one like her...a Priest of Lord Sin, the Master of the Moon, a god of Mystery, Magic, Secrets, but primarily known as the Dual-Natured God; a guide for those lost in the dark, and an avenger for the wronged. What this young man wants is not clear, but the two of them shall become painfully entwined together.*\n\nI would like to do a roleplay steeped in emotion and a conflicted romance between the Moon Priest and the Sun Paladin. Whether from internal or external threats, I would like conflict and pain between them as they struggle with their emotions. I want to paint a rich and lush world with lots of descriptors and feeling. We can fill in more details and more about the characters before we start. I hope we can create something deep and filled with feeling together. If you have any questions, let me know.",

I don\u2019t really have any preference of medium, but do keep in mind that I am mainly mobile. \n\nI want a role play partner who can drive the plot with me and bring something to the table. I want someone who can read and write English correctly - someone who is creative, friendly, and has a good grasp of whatever character they are playing (be it canon or an OC). \nI ask that you do not control my characters or even edit my own posts to suit your liking (that\u2019s just an odd concept to me). Please respect my boundaries and wishes, and I will do the same to you. \n\nI have very little limitations. I can also play male or female without qualms.\nI can also play heterosexual or homosexual pairings. \n\nI would love to do the following:\nMy Hero Academia \nSailor Moon\nSpirited Away\nSuperman\nBatman \n(I\u2019ll play your Batman if you play my Superman) \nHarry Potter\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy\nGlee\nX-Men \nThe Flash \nBlack Bird\n\nBeauty and the Beast \nLady and the Tramp - human\nThe Lion King - human\nFrozen\nBrave\nMoana\nDisney\n\nModern fantasy \nMagical girls\nSuperheroes\nShape shifters\nVampires\nSupernatural \nSoul mates \n\nMessage me with any ideas you have and little about yourself. \n",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI'm writing this to seek out one or two new writing partners. I have embarked on the long and arduous journey towards a PhD, which will limit my availability considerably. But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above two meaty paragraphs makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nSpeaking of plots and genres, I am currently looking for Modern Slice of Life and Historical settings. I'd also like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. There are many more themes I am willing to try. The only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",

What if she and Elsa saved Arendelle together? That would mean Kristoff would still be just a normal ice harvester on the outskirts of Arendelle, with Sven as his only friend. I was thinking he and my OC could meet in the same way as he met Anna. Then, we could brainstorm some ideas from there.\n\nWhen we get in touch, we can discuss our characters, rules, limits, etc. *My number one requirement* is that you play in 3rd person, though.*\n\nI hope to hear some responses soon!

I currently live in England but move stateside very soon.\n\nI\u2019m down for just about anything besides erp, thematically, and I can come up with plots pretty quickly. I enjoy taking time to make longer, more thoughtful posts, over spitting out instant replies. If that means 1-2 posts a day that\u2019s fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, shoot me a pm and let me know!",

I'd be playing the witch role and you can play whoever you'd like, get creative! This is planning to be a modern fantasy RP sent in present day or maybe the 80s or 90s?\n\nIn terms of the magic Im a big fan of demonic/satanic themes. Demons, blood rituals and all that fun sort of dark magic! Maybe our characters accidentally release a demon into the small suburban town or some other evil must be stopped!\n\nDespite the dark magic sort of themes I'd like for this RP to be somewhat light.. just not be doom gloom and miserable the whole time at least. I'm open to NSFW themes (This includes smut and violence if it *makes sense* to the story). I post around 2-3 paragraphs per response and would like the same in return! I prefer to RP on Reddit but you could sway me to Discord if you so please.\n\nAnywho, thanks for reading this and please put your favorite color in your PM so I know you read this!\n\nCan't wait for your responses! &lt;3",

I'm happy to do original characters or game characters just let me know.\nBasic rules:\nD20 is our attack and defence dice D6 is our damage dice.\nA turn looks like this we roll for attack, roll for damage if we tie or beat their defence score we then roll damage, describe what our attack did the them and roll our defence score, to other player then repeats.\nOur character gets 30 health and we do first to 2 rounds.\nnatural roll of 1 for attack means something funny happens to your character, may be they trip, hit the wall or swing and miss and a natural 20 means either double damage roll or if we mortal kombat style you toss the other person into an arena trap which you can describe.\nDepending on the format we can do mortal kombat endings with the loser dying or they can just be KOd don't mind.\nhit me up x",

Spelling isn't a big deal for me, but detail is. As for roles, i'm not looking for anything besides realistic. That means no magic, furries, futas, etc. We can do roles ranging from a vanilla bf/gf, to something as complex as surviving an apocalypse. I know I said realistic, but I mean, an apocalypse isn't too far from it haha. Now, I don't care if smut is involved. Its inevitable, but I don't want the entire premises of our roleplay based on it. If there is a build up to it, i'll most likely be up for it. Feel free to message me if you have more questions. I will try to respond back to as many people as possible. ",

            "selftext": "This is a serious rp. I do not tolerate NSFW pictures or actions. If you want to do NSFW Roleplays, take it somewhere else. The Roleplay hasn't started yet and I need people who would be willing to help me make the plot and other things for it such as types of abilities and how combat will work as well as other things. I ask that you be serious about roleplaying. Anyone who uses * in rp will be removed immediately. I already have a character bio sheet and a basic idea on how abilities work. Again, this very serious and making your character is not a joke. Do not ask to be made a moderator for the chat. I only promote people who I've known for a while and trust to be a moderator. Since this is the first post, in seven days there will be an updated post and I will make sure to edit this post accordingly. I ask that anyone who joins be open minded. You don't need to be LGBT to play but need to respect that people may be interested in that in Roleplay. There is no main plot but there will be big side plots that people can participate in. I plan on this being a big roleplay, with a big diverse land and several chats for each country in the world. There will be a quest system in place and there will also be events depending on the time of year. I want this to be fun for everyone so please do not join if you are a toxic person. I don't want pointless and aggressive arguing. I plan to post again with an update on Thursday of next week. I will wait seven days plus an extra day before posting again. In every post I plan on covering what was added, current events, and other things. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/fsQCqrG \nDo not join the discord unless you are serious about helping out.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I am just going to have a list of my requirements, rules, and things I don't like to roleplay instead of making a paragraph because it just makes it easier to read and probably more likely for people to message me. Haha. Also, I roleplay as male or female characters and roleplay straight or gay/yaoi roleplays. I'm in Eastern time so it would be easier if you were in something close to that. I'm fine with there being a few hours difference but it would just be difficult to do a roleplay on opposite times. Haha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS: -Tell me the gender you want to play. -Tell me the sexuality you want it to be. (Straight or Gay. I don't do lesbian roleplays.) -Must be detailed -Must do third person -Must be experienced and literate -Let me know what you do and don't like to roleplay. BE SPECIFIC -Our roleplay MUST have a story. I don't 'wing' roleplays. -Let me know pairings you like. (Example: Prince X Commoner, Bully X Victim....)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRULES: -Do not suggest a plot based on sex. -Do not ask me to RP first person -Do not tell me to just come up with the plot and you'll do it. I don't work that way. I have to know what you like and you need to come up with things toward the roleplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI WILL NOT ROLEPLAY: -Any kind of roleplay that is complete fantasy. -Sci-fi -Monster Hunter -Fandoms -Large age gap (Beyond 10 years) -Cheating -Co-workers -Apocalypse -Neighbors -Roommates -First time meeting like at a coffee shop or bar. -War -Playing a female that is in charge (A Boss, An Owner, DMLB...) -(There are other things and I will say them if they are brought up. These are just the ones that pop up most often.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have gotten this far, welcome! Feel free to send me a PM that will grab my attention as well as your user for the desired platform so I'll be able to message you right away. Say Magic somewhere in your PM to me so I know you read the post but don't let that be the only thing you send. Give me an introduction. It let's me know you read things. :) Talk to you soon!",

We offer casual RP, a somewhat flexible plot, and every other IC year we do hold a Vytal festival. \n\nThe server features tons of Original Characters, and if you ever need to leave for any reason we will store your character in case you come back. \n\nRoleplay can be as short or as long as you make it, some people prefer one line, some people prefer paragraph or long form. If you speak to any staff we are all more than capable of keeping pace with whatever given.\n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/4Ch56n8",

I have a character that I want to roleplay in this that's non canon. But I have a few fun ideas for it. The basis of my character that he was a criminal I'm retirement but eventually was captured and used as a human test subject for some cruel experiments that turn him something beyond human. As for this organization. Who could do this?\n\nThe white fang with stole tech from atlas?\n\nAtlas themselves \n\nOr perhaps salems group?\n\nEther way. The experiment has failed..or so they thought. The character had fallen into a death like state before his body had shortly jolted back to life as the experiment finally completes and he breaks free. As for placement in when this happens. I could happen durning any time before season 5 of rwby. ( as I haven't fully caught up yet).\n\n\nSo I hope I get a few people that would like to try this out. I have some more information and even a starter planned out in my head! But I would love to hash out some details with anyone interested!\n\nPm me on Reddit for any questions and or detail talking!\n\n",

I'm going to be linking my gateway at the end for more information and I urge you to look at my previous posts to see more about me and get a feel of what I'm looking for.\n\n\nI'm currently looking for a male, or someone to play a male, to scratch a certain itch I've been having. I want to shake things up and instead of doing a slice of life roleplay, I'd love to do a supernatural one! Ideally, I'd love a partner thats knowledgeable about werewolves and how their whole mindset is when it comes to mates, with whom I could do a werewolf roleplay! But if you don't know much about that, that's totally fine! We can totally do something else like a vampire plot, angels/demons, or really whatever else you'd like to do! \n\n\nI exclusively use Discord as my medium and would need my partner to use it too. I'd also really be your best friend if you could play an alpha male personality. (Dominating, aggressive, possessive, hard headed, stubborn, etc.)\n\n\nIf you've read through this whole this, congrats! Let me know that you've earned brownie points!\n\n\n(PS here's my gateway! I implore you to read it along with my other previous posts! Thanks again!) \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/7npw9w/applevalentina/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\n\n\n-Apple Valentina",

Charmed/Harry Potter Crossover. Pairings:\nHermione/Chris\nHermione/Cole\n\nIdea 1.\nI had the idea, that Hermione is in her fourth year, and Magic School is chosen for the triwizard tournament due to Dumstrang dropping out.\nMaybe Wyatt is chosen as Champion?\n\nIdea 2.\n\nPhoebe Halliwell, now known as Hermione; found with shock that the life she believed was a lie. Stolen as a baby, blood adopted and still. very. Phoebe. Hermione finds her two lives conflicting.\nAnd what's up with that cute transfer student in Hogwarts? Cole Turner...\n\nVery AU, basically Hermione was kidnapped by a Death Eater and a Demon; rescued by an Auror. Dumbledore, knowing who she is and unable to contact the mother; decides to hide her away with a trusty blood adoption.\nPerhaps we could add in the sisters, Piper/Leo, Prue/Andy, Paige/Henry.\n\n2.\nCharmed \nChris x Oc\nNot much of an idea here, more hoping for the aboves!\n\nDm me if you're interested, and please.

I'm looking for any rpers to do a long term rp taking place in the Stone Age. \n\nThis rp would mostly consist of th day to day life of a group of humans in the Stone Age, how they survive, how they understand the world around them, etcetera. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in the third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required (but welcome), but please be decently detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

Themes and plot structures are carried over, but there is no lore connected to the original story.\nIn this RP, the story initially takes place in the year X780, in the country of Fiore. Many Guilds are known to exist as well as Dark Guilds. These guilds are ruled over by the Magic Council, who oversee events and deal out punishments relating to magic. Guilds are given jobs that are posted on a job board. Guilds are overseen by a Guild Master as well, a powerful mage that\u2019s incharge of the guild and it\u2019s mages. This RP varies from Fairy Tail in different ways. Firstly, Dragon Slayers and other slayer type mages do not exist. If you know the lore behind slayer mages, you will know why they don\u2019t exist. The RP also varies in that the universe of Edolas does not exist.\nThe in-universe plot itself will change and develop with different arcs and stories.\"\n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/FMnyqn\n\n*Custom Magic\u2019s Only*\n\nWe are literally hours away from officially kicking things off!

The world is at a risk as the evil empress Rita Repulsa escapes her prisonment on the moon and sets her sights on planet Earth. Join Zordon and Alpha 5 in the fight against evil and protect the world!\n\nThis is a DnD inspired roleplay using video game sprites to help visual the story from the Mighty Morphin onward. Like the show, each incarnation of power rangers will be a new cast. Therefore, we will see a Mighty Morphin/Zeo team up because the rangers will be original characters that you make!\n\nI will be acting as GM and as all NPC\u2019s, therefore I need the following characters to be filled.\n\n**Power Rangers:**\n\nYellow Ranger\n\nBlack Ranger\n\nPink Ranger\n\n**Villains:**\n\nGoldar\n\nGreen Ranger (won\u2019t show up till later)\n\nCivilian Characters (potential rangers in the future)\n\nIf you are interested in joining, please go on the site, fill out an application and post it on here or under the comments. Be sure to check out the Combat System too and if you have any questions, let me know. I\u2019m really excited to try this out so please only join if you can be committed!\n\nhttp://powerrangersrpg.webcomic.ws/",

I love Frozen (and Disney), and I've always wanted to try out a pairing with my own OC (a citizen of Arendelle) in the kingdom of Arendelle. \n\nHere's what I was thinking for a Kristoff x my OC: what if Kristoff never met Anna? What if she and Elsa saved Arendelle together? That would mean Kristoff would still be just a normal ice harvester on the outskirts of Arendelle, with Sven as his only friend. I was thinking he and my OC could meet in the same way as he met Anna. Then, we could brainstorm some ideas from there.\n\nWhen we get in touch, we can discuss our characters, rules, limits, etc. *My number one requirement is that you play in 3rd person, though.*\n\nThanks loves!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

Another idea I have is less fleshed out but it\u2019s in the 60s with a high school couple and me joining up and going to fight in Vietnam.\n\nNow I\u2019m looking for someone whose descriptive, can create the story with me, keep the story interesting and keep your character interesting with a fleshed out backstory that we can discover as we rp (I also ask you play as more than one character, as I will be as well to keep the story moving with more character interactions) \n\nI would also like this to contain NSFW elements so please be over 18.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to hear from some of you!

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm currently looking for a partner to do a roleplay based around the show RWBY!\n\nFirst of all, a little bit about me: I have been roleplaying for over three years now, and plan on continuing to do so! I prefer to write longer responses, and love details. I have watched through volume four in the show. You don't have to have watched that far in, though. As long as you know who the characters are! My favorite characters from the show are Pyrrah and Winter. ^-^ As for my schedule, I am available most afternoons and free on most weekends! I will try to alert you if I will be gone for more than a couple of days!\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n-Someone who is detailed, and puts thought and effort into the replies they send. I don't expect wall after wall of text. Quality, not quantity.\n\n-Someone who doesn't mind playing multiple, canon characters. Now, I know this is what probably drives most people away, but it's just the way I like to do my roleplays. Sorry! Note: I don't mind if your male or female, as long as your alright with playing a female character!\n\n-Someone who likes to be in a controlling role. I'm submissive in nature, and tend to play submissive characters by result. I would greatly prefer that you be alright with being in a dominant role. (Possibly even a gamemaster!!)\n\nAlright, so here's the plot idea I had in mind:\n\nMy character would be a teenager, around 16-17. He would be homeless, depending on stealing from others to survive. One day, he is finally caught. (Whether this would be by Winter, or general Vale police.) He would be handed over to Glynda, who would feel bad for him, deciding to put him with one of the teams of Beacon. (Team RWBY, JNPR, or CFVY.) While bent on escaping at first, he would eventually become suited in nicely with the rest of characters. \n\nIf your interested, please pm me! I hope to hear from you guys!",

Breaking the sound barrier and jumbling the toughest of soldiers stomachs. Some malfunctioning and exploding upon entry.\n\nTwenty Seconds. The pod's parachute deploys and jars the soldiers inside. The Reinforced glass giving a window the the chaos of where they were being deployed. Some are having panic attacks, seizures, and some are dead from the shock their body received upon the opening of the parachute. The lucky few are just vomiting in their helmets.\n\nThirty seconds. A cure shot is injected into the soldiers that survived and they regain lost fluids and are in a focused state of mind. Aircraft rip through the air beside them. The anti-aircraft guns take notice of them and they start firing. Most miss but some are hit by the shells. Ripping through the pods and killing the soldier inside.\n\nForty Seconds. The pods hit the ground. Troops run out of their pod into gunfire, landmines, and the energy swords of the enemy that are waiting. Those that survive confirm at least one kill of the enemy before running to the meet up point.\n\nFifty seconds. Some survivors make it to the forest where the meeting point is. But then are picked off by the snipers in the trees and the local wildlife of it.\n\nSixty seconds. One lone soldier breaks into the meeting point. A nervous private on the battlefield for the first time. Alone.\n\nThe footage stopped.\n\nAnd that is how a whole platoon was wiped out in one minute. Leaving one nervous and scared private with a bomb behind as the soul survivor of the minute massacre. On a planet that he doesn't know.\n\nHello! So, I wanted to explore a bit of a darker RP. This will be largely story driven just so you know. About the struggles of being alone and scared on an alien planet. I will be playing the surviving soldier of the platoon. But you can be a few things. You can be an inhabitant of the planet that finds him. The AI in his helmet that's keeping him sane through all of this. A member of the rescue team that is sent to save him. Just be creative. And don't be afraid to add input either. What's this planet like? What's the government? What kind of beings are we dealing with?\n\nI look forward to building a world and an adventure with you.",

I love Frozen (and Disney), and I've always wanted to try out a pairing with my own OC (a citizen of Arendelle) in the kingdom of Arendelle. \n\nHere's what I was thinking for a Kristoff x my OC: what if Kristoff never met Anna? What if she and Elsa saved Arendelle together? That would mean Kristoff would still be just a normal ice harvester on the outskirts of Arendelle, with Sven as his only friend. I was thinking he and my OC could meet in the same way as he met Anna. Then, we could brainstorm some ideas from there.\n\nWhen we get in touch, we can discuss our characters, rules, limits, etc. *My number one requirement is that you play in 3rd person, though.*\n\nI hope to hear some responses soon!

            "selftext": "I'm a male named Valentine, my favorite color is red and I am socially awkward.\nHoping to start my own little d&amp;d style rp, me being the dungeon master or DM, whatever you prefer to call it, whether with a group of people or one, whatever works.\n\nI have my own world and a lot of history already in mind but additions and alterations can be made of course, with discussion and any questions would be wonderful to consider.\n\nThe great empire of Pharsie, the Chained lands.\nA great and powerful continent and series of islands were bound tightly together by a strong commerce and self interest serving bonds, the island nations of the Quaarth sea joined with the great conquerer Thylas Tharizdun and allowed him to put the great continent of Aegia under his rule. It has been nearly four hundred years since then and the country's wealth and prosperity grow, the freedoms granted by Thylas's policies allowed an open continent of freedom and promise. But peace can never last and though in the past many rebellions have been put down, civil war threatens to tear the land apart. Lords and self proclaimed Kings and Satraphs and other rulers rise to split Pharsie again as more and more feel at risk with the variety of foreign cultures approach and the beasts that roam the vast land become more defensive as the humanoids take up more to allow their growth to continue. A tumultuous time, calling for adventurers to rise and do what they can in the uncertain world, rising to do what they can.\nThylas's castle still stands in the center of the Line, a series of beaches, cliffs and mountains that runs down the east side of Aegia and opens to the Chained Islands, previously a variety of cultures now a well traveled Quaarth ocean around many mixed cultures under the empire of Pharsie. The source of most economic income, the islands could unbalance the entire economy of Aegia if pressured. In the north, creatures band together in war bands and armies mount to assail human cultures. In the south, the less common races face a variety of angry creatures threatening to reclaim the territory for the wild. Through the west, humans fight against each other for a variety of selfish purposes and in the center of it all the great Castle of the Gods, the capital of Pharsie, Ancient's Ascent, built by Thylas himself.\nTo this day the royal army stands as a testament to his power and though smaller, is no less an elite force. The army has been stretched thin by the events and a small number of guards stay at the castle and a few stayed to assist the city guard and to settle minor disputes too small for the courts. The metropolis surrounding the castle is where the royal family spends most of their lives, aside from the travels done to be a royal representative or the like.\n\nI'm very open minded and my schedule is a bit all over but if I get enough attention I will give it back, be assured.\nOf course if you're familiar with D&amp;D be prepared to not be playing D&amp;D but rather roleplaying a situation like D&amp;D adventures and experience is good.\nIf too many people for me to handle messages me, I will be unable to keep multiple rps going at once but I do not foresee this happening.\nThanks for reading, private message me and we can discuss from there if you're interested. Thanks for reading, I appreciate your time.",

            "selftext": "Great, looks like the clickbait has worked, once again. If you are reading this again and have messaged me before I urge you to message me again if I haven't yet responded. I am just a human and sometimes I just get overwhelmed, so don't be discouraged just message me, I am actually a pretty chill person, contrariety to popular belief. \n\nWith that aside a little about me, I am Elise Elson, a 19 year old student majoring in psychology. In my spare time among a plethora of other things I like to write. I don't always find the time in my hectic life right now but the winter break has given me some much needed writing time.\n\nA couple of things you should take away from this:\n\n* I won't be available to talk and RP 24/7\n* There will be some days with no RP or talk\n* I am older than 18 and expect my partner to be the same\n* I am not an author, this is only a hobby so don't come expecting a novel\n\nWhile I have your attention, I would also like to thank you for taking your time to read this ad. I know I might sound like and asshole, but really I am just a sweet girl who just want's to write. :)\n\nI am big into fandoms, but there are time when I just don't want to do a certain thing. So don't be afraid to ask me but don't be pissed if I say no. Some fandoms I am into right now:\n\n* Game Of Thrones\n* Harry Potter (This one is weird and will need discussing)\n* Star Wars (My knowledge goes as far as the movies, I have seen them all)\n* Disney (This too we need to discuss)\n\nI also like original worlds, but I won't make them all on my own. I know there are people out there like that, so be warned if you want to build a world it will need both of our input. I won't do it on my own.\n\nSo some genres I enjoy:\n\n* Adventure\n* Crime Syndicate\n* Fairytale\n* Fantasy (Vampire, Fey, Magic, etc)\n* Historical\n* Horror\n* Kidnapped / Slavery\n* Modern / Slice of life\n* Mythological (Greek)\n* Post Apocalyptic / Dystopian\n\nIf you have any others don't be afraid to ask me, who know I might enjoy it.\n\nSo finally I like to write, 3rd person, past / present. My lengths are generally 3 - 5 paragraphs and want my partners to match that. If you have a sample of your writing you get extra points :D I am not opposed to smut/romance, in fact I want that to be in my stories just not the only thing in my story.\n\nYou can reach me by DMs.\n\nThank you for reading, I look forward to all of your pretty orange letters. :)",

            "selftext": "#Introduction\n\nHello, thank you for clicking (:\n\nA little about myself: I am in my twenties, female, in the UK and currently have a lot of commitments. However, roleplay is my passion and I'm shooting for a long-term rp of a specific kind.\nI know this ad is quite long, but I think it's better that you know right away what I'm looking for.\n\n \n#What I want\n\nI\u2019m looking to create a world with someone that would be 'mesolithic' (think 12000 BC or earlier) with 'low' fantasy (used mainly just for flavour). Good news: as this is a roleplay advert, that means I\u2019m looking for a roleplayer and you *don\u2019t* have to be an expert of any kind. I\u2019m definitely not. \nI have quite a few ideas already built up for this, but we don't have to use them at all if we find something else more appealing.\n\nI\u2019d hope for it to be a roleplay to explore survival and the many ways people might understand the world around them. An opportunity for us to world build to our hearts' content, conjuring up the unique clans of people that populate our landscape, the things that bring them together or tear them apart, the host of characters within them, or even outside of them, that breathe life into the story. So all in all, a chance to see where their beliefs, desires and even the power of the natural world takes them for better or worse.\n\nBeing a fantasy world, while we could borrow heavily from our world, there\u2019s no reason we couldn\u2019t also fill it with whatever more we want, so long as the general feel of the era is preserved.\n\n#How I roleplay\n\nHere are some things you should know about me as a roleplayer. Ideally we'd match on all these, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask as I am an open book. If you decide to contact me to rp (yay!) please tell me a bit about how you like to rp and where you stand on limits/post lengths and so on.\n\n1. I typically post around 3 paragraphs though it frequently goes north/south of this depending on the situation. Intros and scene changes are obviously longer in general.\nI always write 3rd person and past tense.\n\n2. I am a low maintenance roleplayer and often busy. If you want multiple posts a day *consistently*, I\u2019m not the one for you. Sometimes I can manage this, othertimes I may post about weekly. If I\u2019m anticipating being very busy for any reason, I\u2019ll let you know.\n\n3. About limits and NSFW content. As general rule, I'll write whatever seems plausible if the roleplay flows that way and I'm rarely squeamish about things. That said, I don't view my roleplays as checklists of NSFW things to achieve and my characters aren't extensions of me/my behaviour. We can discuss limits further over pm. \n\n4. I *love* weaving in side characters and I would hope you can do the same. If this isn\u2019t something you like to do I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re not going to roleplay well together. \nBy extension, we both need to be able to rp 'NPCs' as and when needed. \n*I rarely like to constrain myself to developing just my 'main' character*.\n\n5. I roleplay men and women. I won't rp with anyone that insists on only playing one of these, or claims to rp both but in reality only does so nominally. \n\n6. If a romantic and/or smut storyline comes up, I strongly prefer m/f. \nI also prefer not to fade to black if the situation seems relevant.\nImportant: as great as smut can be, I don't consider myself smut focused, and I don't like forcing chemistry between characters.\n\n7. You must be 18+.\n\n\n#Contact me\n\nMy main way of roleplaying is over email. If you're interested, want to clarify anything or even just have a chat then please do pm me.\n\nOn the other hand, instant messengers are great for plotting so if you can do that it's a big plus. Let me know what your preferred medium is in that case; for me it's generally skype or google hangouts, but I'm open to suggestions.\n\nHave a good day!",

            "selftext": "First, I have been writing for well over 15 years. I've done smut, I've done story. And everything in between, now that I'm married and no longer a teenager, the thrill of smut is gone and now I'm trying to get into writing a book with a very good friend. A hobby may become a money maker one day, unfortunately for me. The story we write is totally orginal, and my buddy doesn't like what I'm looking for here. Stay tuned below for what I want to do. :)\n\nGrowing up, I had a big interest in my video games, mostly platformers but the other happened to be Fighting Games, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, King Of Fighters, hell even Bloody Roar. I loved them all, was never very good but the back stories are what brought me to those games.\n\nBe literate and willing to write multiple paragraphs. I can go up to 5+ when the time calls, and mirroring is a huge thing for me. I'd rather not write a well thought out post only to get two sentences in reply. However, I'm not gonna smack your wrists with a ruler everytime something is a little off, I get writers block. Trust me, I do. And more than anything, I just want to have fun, so more often than not I'm pretty chill with everything. I tend to write quick fire replies and would prefer someone who could do the same but this is in no way a requirement.\n\nBe willing to plan. I'm looking for a partner, not someone to string along with me through the roleplaying process. Give some ideas, bring up some thoughts, chat with me, I don't feel like I'm planning with myself. Be willing to play NPCs as well as Side Characters. It's no fun whenever I'm writing everything myself and playing as everyone!\n\nI write via Kik and Email. Refuse Googledocs as it is just too strange for me to mess with. I usually reply right away unless I happen to be at work or spending time with my family. :)\n\nMy idea: As far as this goes it's more a list of characters I want played against my OC, now I'm not against doubling. Matter of fact I thrive on it! Give me a ship for your OC too! We can definitely make it work. Setting...I'm not sure I'm thinking some kind of big tournament or something along those lines, I'm not opposed to say injecting SF characters into the MK world.\n\nCharacters I would like YOU to write as: This is by no means a list to end all lists but a rough one of female fighting Characters I enjoyed using in the past. Feel free to pick. :)\n\nJuri(Minus pigtails), Cammy(*), Chun-Li(), Skarlet, Frost, Tanya, Jade, Mileena, Katana, Sonya Blade(), Cassie Cage(*) (Stars indicate characters I would really enjoy you writing as!)\n\nAlso, am willing to provide Google and wiki links to all names I have given here.",

I'm looking for any rpers to do a long term post (or post- post) apocalyptic rp with. \n\nYou might be wondering if you didn't know already, technological apocalypse is like a situation they causes all technology (mainly electronics) to stop working, causing the world to fall to chaos and mankind to practically devolve back into the Stone Age.\nI have some ideas for plots, but I love collaborating with people on worldbuilding and the like! Minor sci-fi or even fantasy themes are welcomed. \n Please be prepared to deal with some extremely dark issues.\n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in the third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required (but welcome), but please be decently detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes. If romance is to come up I prefer MxM. \n\nThank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "2890 AD- After centuries of space exploration and technology the earth as we know it is no longer. We've ventured to new worlds and new galaxies. Much as all humans are famed to do, we create conflict. People of power hungry struggles and fear decimate planets simply to control and adapt. In the new galaxy Messier 83, Recently ventured by SSC (Space seeker Cadets) A planet soon to be known as Neheiri is discovered and set for exploration. It's found to sustain life and contain multiple colonies. Also discovered is powers and forces in the alien life that are far beyond any fiction novel. The Life here seems no different then the average human. Though they carry powers and skills that could be used for deadly force. Thus a war breaks out to irradicate these people. Nearly 60% of the native life is wiped out and replaced with a mixture of humans and other non-threatening alien life. The others spared for either willing to bow to new world control or found not to carry the genetic makeup that was sustaining these powerful skill.\n\n2895 AD- Two children living in an orphanage that houses the offspring of the soldiers who died in the conflict. Most not tested for carrying this gene due to their age. Word is spread soon though that there is possibility of children with in the orphanage who possess the abilities. A man wanted for treason and crimes through out the galaxy uses this knowledge to his advantage. He invades the small home carrying 30+ children and finds a boy to take under his wing. He destroys and kills nearly the entire orphanage except on girl who manages to escape.\n\nIts a rough story and believe it or not all came from a dream fueled by cold meds. Something tells me though, This needs to be written, It needs to be epic and told. I want it to have everything, Comedy, romance, drama, tons of action. In order to make this something awesome I need an awesome writer. Be literate and write in 3rd person. Be able to carry a story and become engaged. You'll probably be asked to make more then one character. And please for God sake don't start it with me and then vanish. If you're bored with it then be honest. I don't expect post  everyday nor do I expect a novel to every post. Message me if interested. ",

And this is a repost since my current partner went silent on me but hopefully they're okay.\n\n**Things I'm looking for:**\n\n- If you want to double, that's great and probably for the best. If not, I'm happy to play female and leave it at that. :)\n\n- 2-3 posts a week expected.\n\n- 3-4 paragraphs a post preferred.\n\n- Third person, past tense expected.\n\n- Canons used by both. OCs might be negotiable.\n\n- Communication so we're both enjoying the story and the plot is progressing in the manner we both like. I want us to be happy and on the same page.\n\nNow below are pairs I'd like to do listed in the order of how much I want them. The top pairs are ones I'm craving the most and the lower ones are ones I'd be need to swayed to try. The roles in bold are who I could probably play as. Ideally I'd really really love someone to be Michael so fingers crossed!\n\nMichael x **Elenore**\n\nMichael x **Tahani**\n\nChidi x **Tahani**\n\n**Michael** x **Janet**\n\n**Chidi** x **Elenore**\n\n**Elenore** x **Tahani**\n\nJason x **Elenore**\n\n**Jason** x **Chidi**\n\n**Janet** x **Elenore**\n\nMindy x **Elenore**",

I'm looking for a partner who would be interested in a long term Discord rp!\n\nPlots: **I have an OC I'd like to use already!**\n\nI pretty much stick to these main genres: Realistic/Modern, Crime, and Star Wars (any era)\n\nI don't have a problem with NSFW/Romance if it's built up and in the story! Please don't push it on me, chances are that I'll get bored and leave.\n\nI enjoy crime RPs as my OC is a criminal in the Realistic world, but any pairing will do, not just criminal x criminal. I really do enjoy law enforcement x criminal too!\n\nSW wise, I'm down for anything and any era! This is my favorite genre too!\n\nI don't do Fantasy or Sci Fi other than SW.. sorry!\n\nRules:\n\n*Please please please be literate!* I tend to write longer posts, especially in the beginning\n\nCommunication is important and I'm flexible with ideas! I kind of plan ahead but not a lot to limit the story completely.\n\nNSFW/Romance is welcome, but please build it up\n\nI tend to play my characters realistically, which might involve some darker themes.\n\nCommon sense is the best rule!\n\n**I only use Discord** and making your own servers for RP might make me reply a bit slower (I tend to have notifications off for servers since I'm in so many..), but I'll do either!\n\nI'm very open to ideas, suggestions, plots, pairings, and well, anything.",
