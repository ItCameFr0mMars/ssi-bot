On December 31st of 2009, people were celebrating! A new year, new chances, and new wishes. Millions watched as the annual countdown for the Ball Drop counted down. \n\n10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. \n\n0.\n\nThen, it happened. The moment that everything in the world changed. Things that were impossible before, suddenly became possible. It began with confusion, every single electrical device in the world stopped for exactly five seconds. A huge light filled the sky and a single boom shook the world. Then the lights came back on. The world returned to the normal day-by-day happenings while the media, governments, and scientists tried to figure out what the hell happened. Conspiracy theories shot out, people scrambled for information, but... Everything was normal.\n\nUntil the first of the Metas appeared. The first heroes appeared. Boston was engulfed in war, until it all ended. The Federal Meta Safety Agency was formed, to put limits on superhuman individuals. Public usage of powers were banned, and the world is now at a tentative \"peace\".\n\nIt's been years since that day. Many new metahumans have sprouted up, for good and bad. Vigilantes have been deemed illegal, and enemies of the state. Loyalties have been and will be tested, the government is struggling to keep it all in check, cracks in time and space have appeared all around, villains are cropping up everywhere...\n\nYou may just be the one to change the world.

            "selftext": "Seeking; Romance Driven Plots with Oc/canon or Oc/Oc \n\nHello role play community!\n\nI just want to put here, so no one feels that their time is wasted, I only Role play over email. :)\n\nI\u2019m on the hunt for a charismatic partnership in the realm of writing. I am searching for a relaxed atmosphere where writing revolves around the art and love of plotting our stories. \n\nDeep, psychological exploration of the people we write about.\n\nAngst.\n\nJoy.\n\nLove.\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading, well...you\u2019re the perfect match....\n\nI am looking for a partner that can reciprocate playing love interests, or as one would say \u2018doubling. We gonna have lot of characters running around so buckle up, boi. I am willing and able to play canon for your oc, as long as the favor is returned. (Currently seeking someone to play a Demon Lord Psssst thedemonandthemaid.tumblr.com) \n\nWriting style~\n\nI like to write as the inspiration comes, and that is why my reply lengths vary but never less than two paragraphs for each character. I enjoy rapid response, as the story moving at a quicker pace usually keeps my attention better. (There\u2019s nothing more deflating than our plot taking days to get through one single scene.) BUT. with that being said I am extremely flexible. Life happens. Maybe some days we only get to plan scenes and strategize our stories, maybe some days we get through many 'chapters' so to speak. Things vary, I work 40+ hours but I try to always make time! \n\nThroughout the day I can reply about 3-5 times when work isn't punching me in the friggen face and then more in the evening if I am free. If I won\u2019t be around for the day or my responses will be small, I will always let my partner know with apologies included. I encourage OOC chatter, and I adore plotting on the side as we role play and even talking about day to day life stuff if that\u2019s how close we end up getting. But no pressure! I\u2019m of the idea that maybe we can become friends but I never expect it if my partner is more of a private soul!\n\nInterests~\n\nI adore romance. Of course other aspects are welcome in plots but I usually write with a character pair that will eventually develop a deep relationship. I also have very few limits and my stories become dark in nature. Who doesn't love a little hurtxcomfort romance? I love to have a healthy ratio of dark drama and uplifting good! We can't be 1,000% depressing. I have very little in terms of limits and I hope you can be the same. I am willing to do any pairing, though I\u2019ll admit m/m is a bit of an unknown territory for me. I suppose briefly I should add here that I rarely fade to black for anything, and I prefer being able to have someone with little limits. Drugs, sex, and the like might come up and that means I also ask you are of age because reasons. \n\nI enjoy any time period, but nothing marvel or space related. I was never into these universes/themes and I don\u2019t want to disappoint my partner by not getting excited! It will unfortunately show in my writing. My favorite time period would be your typical medieval era, and I adore the 1920\u2019s. \n\nI am absolutely fine with any pairing, stuff like arranged marriage or social class differences. That\u2019s only a couple out of the hundreds of options. I feel like it\u2019s easier to just say the possibilities are limitless, and I enjoy taking themes or scenarios from movies, books, shows\u2026my inspiration comes from everywhere and I hope you are the same. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve gone over much of the basics\u2026I hope this was a good enough idea of what I am looking for and I hope to hear from you soon. \n",

            "selftext": "**I posted this a while ago and got a good partner but I think real life stole them away so I'm on the hunt again.**\n\n**I am taking inspiration from:** *Your Name, Five Centimeters per Second, His and Her Circumstances, Fruits Basket, Dot Hack, The Garden of Words, Summer Wars, Death Note, and Children who Chase Lost Voices.*\n\n**About Myself:** *I am in college so posts aren't going to super speedy or frequent. Because of that, I want to stick to reddit or something off of Google. I don't want to fuss with skype or discord or an application of that nature. So I want someone who is okay with a slower posting speed but can still keep in touch even in between posts.*\n\n**Posting Whereabouts:** I stick to reddit but could try google docs or maybe email. No I am not seeking a group or to move to kik, discord or skype. Just the aforementioned reddit, GD or email please. \n\n**Posting Habits:** *I want someone to post around 3-4 paragraphs and give rich detail and thoughtfulness. Because I don't need posts every day, I don't want them to seem rushed. If you're struggling with where to move things, feel free to skip to another day or ask me what I think. Let's talk things out but by no means make writing out to be a chore or obligation. If it is, let's find a way to fix things.*\n\n**My Characters:** *I can play males and females but right now I am seeking someone to play a male against my female. I am totally cool with playing male characters who are still main characters though, like your guy's friend or sibling. My characters are usually ones who are 18 years or older, mostly because it's tough to write as teenagers when you're a bit beyond that age. My characters are typically straight unless we discuss otherwise. And finally, mature themes are okay in strict moderation. These are romance plots but I don't drive the story toward mature situations, if they happen, so be it. But I want plot and purpose more than anything else.*\n\n**Some Ideas:** *Below are some small ideas I had, if you're interested, feel free to come at me with ideas to add one. Let's both have a plot we're happy with! Now with slice of life, I do expect a slow pace of development, with us exploring so many things like family life, school life, romance, friends, and stuff. When contacting me, let me know what it is about slice of life you enjoy. And if you have an idea yourself, feel free to share it too. I just made these up on the spot haha.*\n\n**1.** Our RP takes place in a small mountain town in Japan, modern day. One character has lived in there their whole life while another has just moved from Tokyo (or some other big city or even abroad). Our characters can be either in their final year of high school or their first year of university. One character stumbles across an old shrine in the middle of the forest and begins to repair it and bring it back to life. The other character stumbles upon it too (while wandering, the shrine is seemingly vacant) and begins to clean it up as well. Together our characters befriend each other at school or in the neighborhood while both fixing up the shrine, before realizing the other is helping them with the shrine.\n\nWe can add a bit of fantasy to this perhaps. Maybe once the shrine is cleaned up and repaired, a festival from the past takes over and characters are spirited away. Or maybe the shrine has some kind of items inside that are magical. Or perhaps the true owner of the shrine is a mythical guardian. It doesn't need to have fantasy elements though and if it does, I'd like them to be subtle and not overpower the RP.\n\n**2.** Our RP takes place in London, modern day. Our characters are the best of mates and have a (secret) shared interest in gaming. Soon an online game is released, one our characters have been eyeing for several years during its development. Our characters have gotten part-time jobs to pay for it and finally get their hands on it upon its release. The game is a fantasy virtual reality. For whatever reason, one friend hasn't admitted they have purchased said game, having voiced ambivalence about it, and plays in secret. The two friends run into one another online, unbeknownst to them. Either they hit it off well or they don't.\n\nWe would then explore their offline relationship as best friends, and their online relationship, either as rivals or potential lovers. Will the truth be revealed when they want to meet offline or will the friend with the secret, finally admit it before then? I see our characters here, being in high school but it's possible they're in college or even the workplace. It's also possible to maybe have a same-sex romance develop? And yes, this is inspired by dot hack.\n\n**3.** Our RP takes place in a fantasy world where either everyone is born with magical powers or no one is born with magic. It is our characters who will be the outliers who either don't have magic or do. In either instance, they are forced to go on the run, either ridiculed or hated by the society they live in. Our characters live in forests and other secluded areas, living off the land and getting odd jobs to pay for food and supplies. Why they were given such a hard life, will be for our characters to uncover.\n\nFor this, I want fantasy to still be light, nothing heavy/intense. Like, I don't want varied races or political dynamics with ten kingdoms, I want something simple we can develop and build together without worry and a lot of thought involved.\n\n**4.** Our RP takes place somewhere in Japan, either modern day or perhaps ten-fifteen years ago because technology now makes me sad. Our characters are friends and while walking around a quiet neighborhood, stumble across a quaint bookstore. The bookstore owner shows them a book filled with odd enchantments and curses. The owner explains the book's power requires two people and that our characters are welcome to try it out. Whether the owner is good intentions or not, is up for us to decide. It is my idea that the book's magic itself is very basic and would do things like cause a person to tell the truth for a week or cause a person to confess their hidden feelings or cause a person to become astonishingly confident for twenty-four hours, small little things like that.\n\n**5.** Our RP takes place in modern day Japan or somewhere in the UK. One character lives in one country and has been corresponding with someone who they believe is either in another part of the country or in another country altogether. In reality the character's pen pal is someone they know in real life. An acquaintance or rival or best friend perhaps? The person pretending to be someone else, works at the post office and grabs the letter before it gets returned to the sender because the address doesn't actually exist. The two characters confide in one another over many years and soon agree to meet one another. What will happen then?\n\nSo for this, I do want us to get involved in the letter-writing and exchanging that stuff as pen pals would. But I also want our RP to be about the relationship with the characters on another level and people interacting with each other outside of letters and emails and packages. I don't want there to be malice in this deception but more like a cute shyness or something, this isn't like catfishing or I hope it's not...but maybe it kind of is? And this might be a place for a same-sex romance maybe.\n\n**6.** Our RP takes place in a modern world like ours, with the exception that no one can embrace the opposite sex unless they're true soulmates. If someone does embrace someone of the opposite sex and they are not soulmates, they both transform into whatever animal they were born as according to the Chinese Zodiac. Our characters have had several broken hearts after getting close and finding out their partner wasn't their soulmate. Our characters are friends but are slowly coming to the conclusion that perhaps, they might be the other's answer. \n\nSo this takes inspiration from Fruits Basket but I think for this situation, the love has to be fully realized. You can't go around hugging people until you stop transforming. I want this to be a bit goofy and cute. It's a weird concept but it's an every day issue in the RP and I think it would change a few things in regards to casual sex and such.\n\n**7.** Our RP takes place in a modern world like ours, with the exception that there is a book that allows you to kill someone if you know their name and face. There are about 100 copies of this killing book circulating around the world at any given time. There are sites set up to keep track of who has a book. Whoever does have a book must make a public announcement and must announce who they kill, as per the rules of the book. Many wars have of course been fought over these books. Each person can only kill five people before the book is gifted to another random person. Our characters can either be fans of this craze or against the idea. \n\nYes, this is mildly inspired by Death Note. I want this to be a bit of a tense slice of life but I don't want to get political here. I think it would be fun to make up some cool or weird rules. Of course at the end of the day, this RP would be about morals and perhaps one character intends to kill a family member of the other character. I think we could find some interesting dynamics to work with while still keeping things cute and light.",

            "selftext": "\u201cTen years ago, the world was at your feet. The medical world had started to acknowledge you, rave about you and your works with troubled youths. You made tremendous breakthroughs and most of your patients were a success story. Everything was falling into place, that is until you took on her case. \n\nShe was an abnormal case, more abnormal than usual. If that was even possible in the institution you served in. You remember the day she was dragged in, almost as if it were yesterday. Pale skin was covered in fresh cuts, her arms were bound, and she screamed - screamed at an entity that no one else could see. Her screams filled the halls and her frenzied cries still haunted your dreams. \n\nHer diagnosis? She claimed she could see the undead. She claimed that she could communicate with them, project their darkest desires and dispositions. She begged you to believe her, begged you to help her find some serenity. You pumped her full of drugs instead.\n\nShe transitioned into an empty shell and upon her eighteenth birthday, you threw her back in the world. Never to hear from her again and to cross her off as another \u201csuccess\u201d. Then the world went on, you continued on.\n\nBut now, in the present, you have been grieving the death of your late wife but odd things have started happening. Lights flicker in your home, windows are breaking, and you swear you can hear your wife call out to you in the vacant halls. Frantically, you try to research it all - maybe, after all of this time, you start to believe here is a life after this one. This belief lands you back on her case, the case of Alma Montgomery.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u2022 This is an advanced literate roleplay. Grammar, punctuation, and the ability to creatively write with description is required. Commitment is also a requirement. This roleplay will touch on mature themes and it meant to be a bit of horror. As such, this may possibly be a NSFW roleplay and partners must be 18+.\n\n\u2022 You will play the doctor, he is in his late thirties present day and a grieving widower. He is yours to play with though I do have a few suggestion if needed. I will imagine him looking like Jeffrey Dean Morgan because he is amazing.\n\n\u2022 This roleplay will be conducted over Discord. I can provide that information over PM. I like to befriend my partners, blast them with songs and memes, so a bit of friendliness is appreciated. \n\nInterested? Please contact me and we can plot.",

            "selftext": "**Hello there!**\n\nMy name is Kaitlyn, I'm 19 years old, and I'm hoping to share my ideas with a girl who has a interest on going on an epic and action packed journey with me!\n\nI have a lot of ideas with revolve around the aspect of video games and anime crossing over, with all of them focusing on intense action and intriguing plot to carry them. Romance will also be a part of the story; it just won't be the main focus.\n\nI roleplay in both first and third, and I write responses with at least a paragraph in length. I like letting my partners decide that aspect though, as long as its consistent then its okay with me!\n\nI should also note that the NSFW aspect pertains mostly to gory violence and action, along with mature themes for some of the ideas I had in mind. If you want the romance to be NSFW as well then just let me know! I'm totally fine with whatever you want!\n\nNo without a further ado, let's get to the ideas: \n\n**1- Resident Evil X Overwatch**\n\n*After the fall of Umbrella, several organizations began to fight for supremacy over the manufacture and selling of Bio Organic Weapons, other wise known as B.O.W.s. Jill Valentine, a member of the newly-formed Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, or BSAA for short, receives intel on a shadow company known as Talon. Talon, made up of several former Umbrella employees, have commandeered an uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean, home to a secret Umbrella facility. Jill is sent alone to perform reconnaissance and ascertain the location of a missing Dr. Angela Ziegler, a medical expert working on a vaccine for the new ZX-Virus, which Talon has developed.*\n\nSo this idea as some of you probably figured out is going to be Jill Valentine X Angela Ziegler, a.k.a everyone's favorite Momma Mercy!\nIdeally the rp will start off with the two of them meeting, sometime after Jill first gets on the island. There will be other bad guys and enemies to play, which we can switch off of on doing. This one has lots of action and mystery, with the romantic elements possibly taking place in those iconic RE Safe Rooms! I have a preference to play Jill, but if you really want to I can play Angela instead. \n\n**2- Dark Souls X The Legend of Zelda**\n\n*Legend has it that The Hero of Legend, wielding the Sword of Evil's Bane, will be the one to break humanity free from the Curse of the Undead. At the same time, another legend speaks of the Dark Lord, who will put an end to the Reign of Fire and end the curse, bringing about the freedom of humanity and the end of the tyrannical gods. In the Land of the Withering Flame, these two legends will meet, and put an end to it all together...*\n\nThis one is a little weird, as it is very open. Essentially, it will consist of a Female Link (from any game where he isn't a little kid lol) and a Female Player Character from Dark Souls (any game really). This one will be more of a fantastical adventure, with the two helping each other out at the beginning and developing a relationship as they struggle to survive together. We would figure out which games and how exactly both mythos connect, that way I'm not forcing anything down anyone's throat haha!     \n\n**3- Anything X Anything**\nOkay after writing those two prompts I drew a bit of a blank unfortunately haha X3\nAnyways the morale of the story is that I'm down to cross over a lot of things, even anime too!\nNieR Automata, Final Fantasy, Sword Art Online, Overlord, High School of the Dead, Silent Hill, the ones listed above and much, much more!\nI also had an idea for Nier Automata X Resident Evil, but I put it in other NSFW subs and I didn't want my post removed cause of the rules here, so cointact me if you'd like to hear that one out too!\n\nIf you have any ideas of your own about a crossover between games or anime, please PM me! \nAlso PM me if you liked one of the two prompts I actually put effort into! Sorry about not going on more I'm such a bad writer! XD\nAnyways like I said feel free to PM me and let us have some good ol' fun!",

Some, like the boy who survived and his best friend, have chosen to forsake completing their education in favour of taking up jobs. Others, such as Hermione and Draco, have returned to Hogwarts, in order to finish the year that, in the case of the former was missed altogether and for the latter, was interrupted by the events of the war.\n\nThey, along with the few other wizards and witches who have returned, live a quiet life, being a year older than even the oldest students around them.\n\nDraco and Hermione have both become prefects and are working hard to obtain qualifications that will allow them to pursue their careers of choice.\n\nThe roleplay starts when Hermione is taking a relaxing bath in the room made available to prefects. Draco has had the same idea, however when the statue guarding the entrance attempts to deny him access, a bit of the old Draco finds it way back to the surface. Needless to say he is let in promptly by the scared mermaid...\n\n***\n\nAs you can tell I like detail and literacy. I'm looking for a partner who can play a convincing Hermione. This roleplay can be short and sweet, or long term, with the initial scene just providing an entertaining way for the two characters to collide again after the events of HP7...\n\nIf you're in, have suggestions or comments, please don't hesitate to pm me. I roleplay in Reddit PM'S, chat, Kik and on discord.\n\nLooking forward to your messages, x Alex",

            "selftext": "Hey!\nHow are y\u2019all doing?\nSo I wanted to do a supernatural themed romantic roleplay. No twilight shit. Here are my ideas \n1) gothic- Set in modern day, two teenagers start falling in love. Except both are supernatural creatures. One (or both) could be a vampire. The other a Frankenstein monster. Or whatever you want. To the point where they can almost pass looking normal. Basically, the two decide to skip town. We could go anywhere with this. I have this great idea for a motel they could stop at. \n2) takes place in 1920s mansion. Your character has just inherited it from your dead grandfather. This mansion has a lot of urban legends about it.  Like how it used to owned by a cult and your grandfather was the leader of. But you don\u2019t believe any of that. After a few months of living there you meet my character. Who is the spirit of someone who has been murdered in the house. Maybe we could slowly fall in love. Soon, we find out there are hundreds of souls trapped here. There is something about the house that is blocking them from moving on. So we have to figure out why and what happened in this house.\nLet me know if you have any better ideas! \n\n \nI\u2019m fine with NSFW scenes as long as they feel natural. \nA little about me:\nIm a 21 year old male college student. So I have a lot of free time. I\u2019m very detailed and typically respond quickly. Normally, I have 2-6 paragraphs each response. I like to build worlds and create new characters. I was also hoping this would be a long term thing. But a short term roleplay is fine too. Typically I use discord, gmail, google docs, and Reddit. I have kik and am willing to use it. \n\nI expect my partner to be able to respond at least twice a day. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to hear from you!\n",

            "selftext": "What if that weird goth chick in your math class was actually a witch?\n\nHey everyone!\n\nI'm looking to start a long-term roleplay that focus around a Highschool Witch. I'd be playing the witch role and you can play whoever you'd like, get creative! This is planning to be a modern fantasy RP sent in present day or maybe the 80s or 90s?\n\nIn terms of the magic Im a big fan of demonic/satanic themes. Demons, blood rituals and all that fun sort of dark magic! Maybe our characters accidentally release a demon into the small suburban town or some other evil must be stopped!\n\nDespite the dark magic sort of themes I'd like for this RP to be somewhat light.. just not be doom gloom and miserable the whole time at least. I'm open to NSFW themes (This includes smut and violence if it makes sense to the story). I post around 2-3 paragraphs per response and would like the same in return! I prefer to RP on Reddit but you could sway me to Discord if you so please.\n\nAnywho, thanks for reading this and please put your favorite color in your PM so I know you read this!\n\nCan't wait for your responses! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for consistently active partners for over the top high fantasy stuff. Think action anime-level stuff like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on, not to specifically say stories just like them but...more like to reference the level of action I do, egh trying to explain it without sounding like it's outright based on them is a pain. Characters facing long odds and dire situations with strong enemies and at some point or another pulling out against the odds and getting that win. Not to say there can't be any temporary setbacking failures though. Since I have a bit of a thing for causing my characters certain problems from time to time. Romance can happen too but I'm typically exclusive to F/F pairings and it'd take an overwhelmingly compelling partner for me to maybe bend my female character into a male one. Either OOC gender is fine, what someone is IRL doesn't bug me as far as IC stuff goes.\n\nAnyway I prefer the characters to heavily contrast both in personality and in their lives. But that's best detailed in an actual PM so I don't take up space here.\n\nI can range from 1-5 paragraphs depending on the scene and what's going on, sometimes dropping down to one lining if it becomes back and forth chatter for a bit.\n\nWhile I got plenty as far as original stuff goes, for those looking for fandom stuff I'm usually outright interested in either My Hero Academia, Splatoon, MAYBE Pokemon (Trainers), or maybe DBZ stuff. My RP Gateway post can detail other things too.\n\nI'm also more of the type for \"cute\"/anime style characters/faceclaims rather than realistic/photographic ones. So I may not be entirely interested if that ain't your bag. But apart from that feel free to send me a PM and we'll see what we can do.",

Some of my favorites are Soul Eater, Sword Art Online, and My Hero Academia. Of course, I'm up for anything you might suggest as well, I'm very flexible and able to play either gender and a multitude of character types. For the genre of RP I am once again flexible, although I enjoy a healthy mix of Slice of life, Combat, and romance, if at all possible in the situation (Although I understand not every RP needs or can include combat). I like my partners to be somewhat available, I understand that daily might not be possible, but more than a couple posts a week is preferred. My posts vary depending on yours, but on my own I always attempt at least 1-2 paragraphs, if not more. I'm not super picky about everything being prim and proper grammatically, we all make mistakes!

I would prefer if you had the same writing style, but I\u2019ll work with whatever! \n\nI'm currently looking for a Game of Thrones or historical roleplay at the moment. So please have seen GoT, or have read the books, or be interested in history!!\n\nI tend to include a lot of drama, angst and not so nice characters in my roleplay, just to add some spice to it and make it a lot more interesting! I do include smut, but there has to be plot as well.\nThough saying that I do think smut does add some extra elements to a roleplay, but I don't want it in absolutely every scene.\n\nI tend to get quite inspired when roleplay, so if we end up roleplaying together, expect a lot of drawings, playlists and Pinterest boards :) \n\nI'm sorry for rambling on so long, hopefully you've gotten a good enough idea about me and how I like to write! \n\nValar Morghulis &lt;3\n",

You can play as a tough Mercenary within their own unit, or as a member of the Clans.\n\nMercenary Units bid for contracts and earn hard cash to buy better and stronger hardware to take up even more profitable &amp; challenging contracts.\n\nSet in the Battletech Universe, players join or create a Mercenary Unit and take contracts all over inhabited space. Work for any of the Great Houses, gain your fortunes, earn your glory, and change the face of the Inner Sphere!\n\nPlaying by email or by forum, players participate in a Mercenary contract, writing a common transcript to fulfill the objectives for their mission, which is submitted and turned into cash for the unit to expand and refine their roster. Mercenary Units can consist of many writers working on the same project, and each has their own history, background and flavor. \n\n-Fight using a number of highly advanced science-fiction technologies, including the penultimate Battlemech, 50-ton War Mechas that dominate the Battlefield!\n\n-Active, knowledgeable community going back 15 years\n\n-Detailed and competent collaborative writers\n\n-No Battletech background necessary. There are extensive resources available online to introduce new players to the setting, as well as knowledgeable staff and players ready to answer any questions.\n\n-Guided but freeform roleplay style. Contracts are written by staff and correspond to a site-wide plot, and may be custom requested by players. Unit Leaders set the plot and pace of the contract, but players are free to write as they see fit.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about the setting, and would like to know more, please don\u2019t hesitate to message us or drop us a line on the forums. We also recommend checking out www.sarna.net to learn more about the Battletech universe.\n\nSee you on the battlefield!",

            "selftext": "I am looking for someone to do a Cyberpunk RP With.  For those who do not know what Cyberpunk is, here is a quick definition.\n\n\"Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a futuristic setting that tends to focus on \"a combination of low life and high tech\" featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order.\n\n\"Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners who lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, and invasive modification of the human body.\"\n\nCyberpunk plots often center on conflict among artificial intelligences, hackers, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in a near-future Earth, rather than in the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as Isaac Asimov's Foundation or Frank Herbert's Dune. The settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to feature extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its original inventors (\"the street finds its own uses for things\"). Much of the genre's atmosphere echoes film noir, and written works in the genre often use techniques from detective fiction.\n\nThere's some explanation from Wikipedia. Anyway! Message me with some ideas you have, and maybe a story you'd like to follow and ill send you my discord! See ya then.",

I am just going to have a list of my requirements, rules, and things I don't like to roleplay instead of making a paragraph because it just makes it easier to read and probably more likely for people to message me. Haha. Also, I roleplay as male or female characters and roleplay straight or gay/yaoi roleplays. I'm in Eastern time so it would be easier if you were in something close to that. I'm fine with there being a few hours difference but it would just be difficult to do a roleplay on opposite times. Haha. I'm eighteen, if you can't trust me on that, I'd prefer if you didn't message me. Nothing personal, it's just a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS: -Tell me the gender you want to play. -Tell me the sexuality you want it to be. (Straight or Gay. I don't do lesbian roleplays.) -Must be detailed -Must do third person -Must be experienced and literate -Let me know what you do and don't like to roleplay. BE SPECIFIC -Our roleplay MUST have a story. I don't 'wing' roleplays. -Let me know pairings you like. (Example: Prince X Commoner, Bully X Victim....)\n\n\n\n\n\nRULES: -Do not suggest a plot based on sex. -Do not ask me to RP first person -Do not tell me to just come up with the plot and you'll do it. I don't work that way. I have to know what you like and you need to come up with things toward the roleplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI WILL NOT ROLEPLAY: -Any kind of roleplay that is complete fantasy. -Sci-fi -Monster Hunter -Fandoms -Large age gap (Beyond 10 years) -Cheating -Co-workers -Apocalypse -Neighbors -Roommates -First time meeting like at a coffee shop or bar. -War -Playing a female that is in charge (A Boss, An Owner, DMLB...) -(There are other things and I will say them if they are brought up. These are just the ones that pop up most often.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have gotten this far, welcome! Give me an introduction in a PM and we can get started! :) Talk to you soon!",

I am a bit weird but that being said I am always open to suggestion from anyone for new ideas. I already RP with one or two people but since not always are other people around I am always looking for more people to RP with\n\n* I am in college so usually am pretty quick about replying but sometimes there will be days when I am super busy or doing stuff with friends and won't reply. Also I sometimes go through stretches where I feel super down and might not reply. That being said 95% of the time I reply pretty quickly.\n* I am a semi-literate to literate RPer. My post length varies based on that of my partner usually I can match pretty well whatever the person I am doing the RP with is writing. Also if you want me to change something about what I am doing always feel free to tell me\n* Partners must be 18+ I never aim for anything intentionally that would require it but if the RP goes that direction I don't want to worry about it.\n* I prefer modern realistic RPs although I don't mind somewhat recent historical pretty much 1900-present I can maybe do\n* Major interests right now in terms of genre and otherwise as far as material: medical, sports, romance, drama, slice of life and angst\n* I do ask that anybody I am playing with if you want me to change something or have suggestions for me to improve please do give them, I don't want someone silently steaming at me because I am doing something minor that can be easily corrected\n* I prefer discord but can also do PM\n* I prefer to play straight, male characters but can play either gender and any orientation\n* I can also play multiple characters\n* I need all main characters to be 18+ as well\n\nThis is my main idea I had I love all sorts of RP especially if their is some sort of medical aspect. I am open to any plot suggestions from others\n\n I recently had this idea and I absolutely love the idea of it and am looking for people to do it with me.  One character was recently very severely injured in some sort of accident and is expected to make a full recovery or at least a mostly full recovery and is starting rehab/pt currently pretty much unable to do almost anything on his/her own. The other character currently looks very much healthy but was recently diagnosed with a rare disorder that will cause him/her to slowly lose muscle control in his/her body. He/she is starting rehab/PT to try to maintain as much motion and control for as long as possible. The two characters are in the same daily PT session and as time passes a romance begins to develop as one of them improves and the other continues to worsen.",

A new world was found and it's considered \u201cspecial.\u201d All you need to do is use a precious item as a catalyst (your \u201cProof\u201d) and be pure of heart. A \u2018small\u2019 ritual later and you will finally find yourself in a world of new.. This world is filled with creatures and many new things.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;   \n\n\n\n**About the world:**  \n\n\n\nWyrda was once a safe haven for everyone to belong. It was a place for everyone to leave and forget their past behind, a place to start over.  \n\n\n\nBut a while after people arrived, things started happening and people started dying. After a strange fight, no more people were able to come through due to breaking the Shrine of Arrival.   \n\n\n\nThis world was home to past dragon riders and the ruler King Isla had a downfall, his kingdom and the world was taken by the now King Purvis.  \n\n\n\nNow the resistance in the new village of Varna is in a fight to save the world and bring it back to the safe haven that it needs to be. Everyone came here for their own reasons, they want to fulfill those reasons. And as the Elders Ram, Eva and Fen (Now does not leave town) have the duty to make sure they do not fail!  \n\n\nJoin the fight against these great creatures of mystery in this equally as mysterious world.  \n\nNew features:\n-Dungeon - including loot\n-Villagers: You do not have to be a warrior anymore and there will be small changes to institute this.\n-Potions!\n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/9Pjxqpn\n",

Don't worry you won't have to do all the heavy lifting I can carry my own weight I promise. I want this to be a long term thing to if possible and play it out on Discord since it's better for organisation. \n\nI have a char ready but we can talk about what we want this to be further.

            "selftext": "**Hey everyone!**\n\nKaitlyn here! I haven\u2019t gotten a good amount of responses up for my last post, so I\u2019m deciding to repost with some new prompts I came up! Most of the text below is going to be a repeat, but scroll down to check out my new ideas if you\u2019ve already read this. XD\n\nI have a lot of ideas with revolve around the aspect of video games and anime crossing over, with all of them focusing on intense action and intriguing plot to carry them. Romance will also be a part of the story; it just won't be the main focus.\n\nI roleplay in both first and third, and I write responses with at least a paragraph in length. I like letting my partners decide that aspect though, as long as its consistent then its okay with me!\n\nI should also note that the NSFW aspect pertains mostly to gory violence and action, along with mature themes for some of the ideas I had in mind. If you want the romance to be NSFW as well then just let me know! I'm totally fine with whatever you want!\n\nNo without a further ado, let's get to the ideas: \n\n**1- Resident Evil X Overwatch**\n\n*After the fall of Umbrella, several organizations began to fight for supremacy over the manufacture and selling of Bio Organic Weapons, other wise known as B.O.W.s. Jill Valentine, a member of the newly-formed Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, or BSAA for short, receives intel on a shadow company known as Talon. Talon, made up of several former Umbrella employees, have commandeered an uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean, home to a secret Umbrella facility. Jill is sent alone to perform reconnaissance and ascertain the location of a missing Dr. Angela Ziegler, a medical expert working on a vaccine for the new ZX-Virus, which Talon has developed.*\n\nSo this idea as some of you probably figured out is going to be Jill Valentine X Angela Ziegler, a.k.a everyone's favorite Momma Mercy!\nIdeally the rp will start off with the two of them meeting, sometime after Jill first gets on the island. There will be other bad guys and enemies to play, which we can switch off of on doing. This one has lots of action and mystery, with the romantic elements possibly taking place in those iconic RE Safe Rooms! I have a preference to play Jill, but if you really want to I can play Angela instead. \n\n**2- Dark Souls X The Legend of Zelda**\n\n*Legend has it that The Hero of Legend, wielding the Sword of Evil's Bane, will be the one to break humanity free from the Curse of the Undead. At the same time, another legend speaks of the Dark Lord, who will put an end to the Reign of Fire and end the curse, bringing about the freedom of humanity and the end of the tyrannical gods. In the Land of the Withering Flame, these two legends will meet, and put an end to it all together...*\n\nThis one is a little weird, as it is very open. Essentially, it will consist of a Female Link (from any game where he isn't a little kid lol) and a Female Player Character from Dark Souls (any game really). This one will be more of a fantastical adventure, with the two helping each other out at the beginning and developing a relationship as they struggle to survive together. We would figure out which games and how exactly both mythos connect, that way I'm not forcing anything down anyone's throat haha!     \n\n**3- Gate X High School of the Dead**\n\n*It all happened so fast, with the undead suddenly rampaging across the country, devouring everything in their path. Reports speak that portals opened up, allowing the first of the infected through, although nothing is certain. Shino Kuribayashi, a Sergeant with the Japanese Self Defense Force, finds herself split up from her unit. Fighting to survive, she stumbles a upon a girl from the nearby high school, who appears to be dispatching zombies with relative ease...*\n\nThis idea leans more of the HotD side, with Gate elements mixed into it. Obviously it will be between Shino and one of the main female characters from HOTD, preferably Rei or Saeko. The two could be alone, or meet up with other cast members later on, I\u2019m open to anything really. We can discuss further how the two stories intertwine; I\u2019m willing to even have just the Gate cast within the HotD story, minus the fantasy aspects. Like I said, I\u2019m open to discussion! \n\n**4- Sword Art Online X Berserk**\n(No, Guts is still the REAL Black Swordsman lmao)\n\n*The Band of the Hawk was formerly a small mercenary group, tackling on any job for a reasonable amount. However, as the weeks and months passed, they grew into a large force and formidable force. One day however, the whole band vanished, with the surviving leader gaining power no one else in the game had. The truth was that the Band was sacrificed to none other than the Game Master, Akihiko Kayaba himself. However, there was a lone survivor, who now sets on a bloody path of vengeance and retribution.*\n\nThis idea was in my mind for quite a while, but I just couldn\u2019t really put it into words. I know the jokes about Kirito and Guts and all that, but I thought it\u2019d be really cool to crossover both series like this. It takes the best of both worlds, with cutting out the fluff of SAO and keeping the cool world but with the tone and dark themes of Berserk. Anyways it wouldn\u2019t be Guts per se, but a female survivor of the Band of the Hawk. Also, it doesn\u2019t have to be a female main character of SAO, I\u2019m fine with minor characters or even OCs for that matter. I would like my partner to be Lisbeth, Silica, or Asuna, but we can even throw in characters from later seasons such as Sinon or Leafa. If you want to discuss this more I\u2019m all up for it! :)\n\nAnyways if none of these prompts appealed to you then that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m always up for coming up with something else with you! These aren\u2019t the only games I\u2019ve played and anime I\u2019ve seen, there\u2019s a whole lot more. This includes stuff like NieR Automata, Final Fantasy, Overlord, Cowboy Bebop, Fate, Evangelion, Tekken, King of Fighters, PUBG, Gundam, Idolm@ster, Code Geass, DayZ, and there\u2019s too much to list all! Feel free to PM me if one of the prompts caught your eye, or if you want to come up with a different crossover! \n\nSee you guys around! X3",

            "selftext": "Firstly thank you for taking the time to check out my post . I have been role playing for roughly fifteen years so I like to think I have some \" skill ' when it comes to descriptive play :P. I para as a minimal and mainly multi-para , I like descriptive and imaginative posts. So please don't message me if you intend on one lining, one lining in my opinion is pointless .\n\nI'd like my partner to be involved in adding to the story it's much more fun if it isn't just one person leading :). And please be descriptive! Role play is all about imagination after all right?.\n\nI have indulged as many of you would probably guess in every aspect , eras and styles of role play; from fantasy/ action to adventure/sci-fi to slice of life. Nothing is of limits with me as long as it's enjoyable/fun and interesting :). I do tend to stick to mainly the modern era as i feel more comfortable with it but I'm happy to dive into other settings with the right Story line :).\n\nCharacter development and long term is preferred I like to build a good story :). Romance is something that tends to be included in all my role plays and honestly I Like it that way. Romance I find adds a real good element to any role play :) there for NSFW content will more then likely be apart of it hence the 18+.\n\nI'm really into action/romance at the moment , quite fancy doing a military role play :) ( I wouldn't be a solider but part of the medical team) but I'm happy for what ever :).\n\nPlease message me if your interested in starting something up with me, we can discuss and brain storm an idea together :). I typically role play on email. Look forward to hearing from you soon :)\n",

I work during the week and while I can reply, it's easier for me on the weekends. But I want to create some stories with someone. Get the creative juices flowing. I've been roleplaying for ten plus years, I write in 3rd person, and I'm willing to play male or female roles. I do like romance in my roleplays and NSFW scenes can be discussed in PM, obviously, 18+ only. I don't do super long posts. I can, but more often than not, I keep it to a paragraph or two. But that being said, I'm also fine with having more than one character. \n\nSo if you're still interested. I'm looking to do an urban fantasy roleplay. I don't do fandoms as I feel like I can't do a fandom justice but I do love to create worlds and plots and settings that can be taken on for a long time. Also, I like romance, so please be interested in that as well. \n\nI'm super laid back as a roleplayer and chill about replies and stuff. So if you'd like to plot with me, send me a PM with your Discord and we'll figure something out!",

            "selftext": "Hello all. I'm looking for someone interested in **Death Note** the anime or manga.\n\n- I post 2-3 times a week.\n\n- I post about 4-5 paragraphs typically.\n\n- I play both genders.\n\n- Mature content is okay in appropriate doses. \n\n- I do not use anything except Reddit PMs, EMAIL or Google Docs so please don't PM me asking for kik or skype or discord.\n\nNow regarding some plot ideas, I do have others but for now I'll list a few and can go into deeper planning via PM. Like most I think the first part of Death Note was the strongest. The game of cat and mouse, the morals being questioned, secrets and lies, all of that good stuff is what I want to try and embody. I am sure writing Death Note can be intimidating but I'd done a few short stories by myself so I'm hoping that translates well into roleplaying with others!\n\n**Generally speaking I'm looking to double as Misa and Light. I am open to playing Naomi, Sayu and maybe Matsuda or Near. I'd love someone to play L to my Misa in a romantic sense, but other pairs can be worked out if you want Light with someone.**\n\n- A plot centered around L and Misa. Misa caves and goes to L, telling him everything he needs to know about the Death Note and Light. Now that both sides are more even, the true game can begin. Light doesn't know Misa betrayed him so she plays both sides as delicately as possible. Light and L continue to work on the task force while L and Misa get close, trying to gather enough evidence to convict Light. Of course the rest of the task force isn't aware of Misa's Death Note or of her companion Rem. Secrets are abound as so-called friends lie to one another and family ties are threatened.\n\n- A plot in which there is no Light Yagami as Kira but instead it is Misa Amane who takes it upon herself to judge the world. However her killings are harder to track as she does not stick to one singular method (like Light's heart attacks). The Kira Investigation is kept on their toes as Light is brought in to aid L. Together they try to catch Kira but soon Light comes into possession of a Death Note and his own ideals are brought into question. Would he still help L or turn to help Misa? We can figure out if Misa has Ryuk or Rem by her side and other details via PM.\n\n- A plot which has Misa on the run from police. Upon getting them both out of L's custody, Light's father hijacks the car and frees both of them. Light fades into the shadows, feeling betrayed by L who he once considered a friend. Misa is also in hiding. Both Light and Misa have not yet regained their memories. Several years pass and a new Kira has risen to power named Mikami. L is still convinced Light and Misa are the true First and Second Kira but he still pursues Mikami. Eventually Light becomes a police officer in northern Japan and returns home to help L who is all alone at this point. This idea is a little iffy as I want Misa and Light to regain their memories but it will take some magic fudging (like them mailing themselves a sheet of paper and getting it years later or something). So I'd like to talk more about this one.\n\n- A plot where Misa grows up in Whammy's House. Misa admires L right away and when he goes off to solve cases around the world, Misa buckles down and studies intensely, much to Near and Mello's amusement. However not really book smart, she becomes more sociable and street smart. She and Mello bond and soon when Kira makes the headlines, she goes off to help him. L believes Misa could be a double spy of sorts and instructs her to take the To-Oh university entrance exam with him. Thanks to Watari's connections, Misa is accepted. She then goes to befriend Light in order to help L prove that he is Kira. This may need a bit more work but that's what I have so far. \n\n- I'm also open to an OC only plot where maybe one person has a Note and the other has a Pen or something where both need the other to work. However I don't want a copy of Light. I don't want some guy hoping to cleanse the world and becomes a slave to his ego-trip. I genuinely think if a normal person found this, they might help their friend who has an abusive father. Or they stop small time criminals in the area, nothing grand like people already in jail serving time. Maybe that's just me? ",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I am just going to have a list of my requirements, rules, and things I don't like to roleplay instead of making a paragraph because it just makes it easier to read and probably more likely for people to message me. Haha. Also, I roleplay as male or female characters and roleplay straight or gay/yaoi roleplays. I'm in Eastern time so it would be easier if you were in something close to that. I'm fine with there being a few hours difference but it would just be difficult to do a roleplay on opposite times. Haha. I'm eighteen, if you can't trust me on that, I'd prefer if you didn't message me. Nothing personal, it's just a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS: -Tell me the gender you want to play. -Tell me the sexuality you want it to be. (Straight or Gay. I don't do lesbian roleplays.) -Must be detailed -Must do third person -Must be experienced and literate -Let me know what you do and don't like to roleplay. BE SPECIFIC -Our roleplay MUST have a story. I don't 'wing' roleplays. -Let me know pairings you like. (Example: Prince X Commoner, Bully X Victim....)\n\n\n\n\n\nRULES: -Do not suggest a plot based on sex. -Do not ask me to RP first person -Do not tell me to just come up with the plot and you'll do it. I don't work that way. I have to know what you like and you need to come up with things toward the roleplay.\n\n\n\n\n\nI WILL NOT ROLEPLAY: -Any kind of roleplay that is complete fantasy. -Sci-fi -Monster Hunter -Fandoms -Large age gap (Beyond 10 years) -Cheating -Co-workers -Apocalypse -Neighbors -Roommates -First time meeting like at a coffee shop or bar. -War -Playing a female that is in charge (A Boss, An Owner, DMLB...) -(There are other things and I will say them if they are brought up. These are just the ones that pop up most often.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have gotten this far, welcome! Give me an introduction in a PM and we can get started! :) Talk to you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello, Reddit! I'm currently searching for partners to roleplay with. Without further ado, let's get right into it!\n\n**A little bit about me:**\n\nI have been roleplaying routinely for the past three years. I started out doing simple one-liners on Kik, to see if I liked the concept. Surprise, I did. I quickly started to write with multiple partners, growing in writing prowess. After a while, I moved on to Discord, and generally have preferred to use that since. (That formatting, same case for Reddit PMs.) The platforms I use are Kik, Discord and Reddit PMs. Due to me being a primarily mobile user, I prefer not to use email. Although I may make an exception if it's the *only* way you roleplay. As for my schedule, I am usually free most afternoons on weekdays, and almost always am free on weekends. I try my best to at least send a couple of replies a day. If I'm aware I'm going to be gone for a couple of days, I'll try to warn you! If you don't reply for few days, I'll usually ask if your still interested. After a week, I'll probably assume you don't want to continue anymore. I understand life issues may happen, so if you are gone for more that a week, and would like to continue a roleplay we started, just message me! I'm not really into group roleplays, I greatly prefer one on one stuff.\n\n**What I'm looking for:** \n\n- Someone who is literate in the replies they send. I *love* details, especially the little ones. Now, that doesn't mean I want you to constantly reply with ten plus paragraphs at a time! I usually write three to five paragraph responses. I don't mind if you tend to write shorter replies, as they as they still have a nice amount of detail in them. Quality, not quantity.\n\n- Someone who doesn't mind playing mutiple characters. I understand it can be difficult to play mutiple characters, I struggle with it myself. While some of the plots I make (mostly fandom stuff) may ask that you play multiple characters, I won't ever ask you play more than two at once. If we're doing a fandom plot, I ask that you only play canon characters. I don't mind if your male or female irl, as long as you don't mind playing a female character roleplay wise.\n\n- Someone who doesn't mind violence or 'darker' themes. Some of the plots I do may involve depression, abuse, etc. I'd like it if you alright with these topics, I don't want anyone to get surprised by the appearance of stuff like this in our roleplays. I understand some people use this as an escape from their problems irl, and wish not to see this kinda stuff. So, I figured I would warn you!\n\n- Someone who doesn't mind playing a controlling role. I would like it if you were alright with being the dominant character throughout the roleplays we do.\n\n**Plots I'd like to do:**\n\n*Alright, here is the list of the plots that interest me. I've either numbered them, or labeled them by fandom. I have no real preference over which plot we do!*\n\n**RWBY:** My character would be a teenager, a homeless theif stranded in Vale. After the breach of Grimm into the city, he would be finally caught in the act of stealing. Instead of being sent to a detention center, Glynda decides to put him under the watch of one of the teams of Beacon. (RWBY, JNPR, CFVY) They would be in charge of making sure he stays out of trouble, and preventing any escape attempts. While he would try to escape at first, he would eventually settle in. This would revole around everyday things in Beacon, along with growing unease on the campus. (This would take place pre-Volume three).\n\n**Borderlands:** My character would be a teenager, the heir of a massive mining company. After a rebellious act of running away, he would crash land on Pandora, before being found by Lilith or Maya. This would take place after the main campaign of BL2 is done!\n\n**Pokemon:** My character would be a teenager, Professor Juniper's new assistant as she travels to the Aloha region. Staying on Aether Paradise, my character would accompany her throughout the Aloha region, meeting friends and foes, new and old! (I'm looking for someone to play Professor Juniper, Lusamine, Cynthia, and any others they'd like too!)\n\n**Doki Doki Literature Club:** Alright, so I have a couple of ideas for how this roleplay would work:\n\nA: Due to some computer malfunction, some cruel trick of fate, or just pure chance, my character wakes up in the world of DDLC, completely aware of what will happen if someone doesn't stop Monika. Or is there another solution other than to delete her?\n\nB: Similar to A, a glitch brings the four main characters of DDLC into the 'real world', leaving a destructive rift behind. Monika would still have powers to manipulate stuff around her outside of the game as well! This would revole around my character trying to get them back into the game, much to Monika's dismay. The characters personalities would be thier normal, unaltered ones. Monika would lose control of her friends, since she doesn't have access to their files. Plus my character would still be aware at just how dangerous she is. She would still have some power, mainly over physical objects. (You would either play the main four characters, or just Monika)\n\n**Plot 1:** Your character would be an android(looking like 2B from the NieR: Automata), with an incredibly powerful AI built in, meant to be a potent combat unit. Made with built in devices that can hack virtually anything (Power grids, phones, cars, stoplights, etc.) and having the ability to influence metal objects through magnetism (ex: being able to flip a truck with the flick of your wrist, or being able to 'capture' bullets, sending them back at your foes, etc.), your character would be a weapon of near mass destruction. Unfortunately, due to your AI being so intelligent, you have gained a form of sentience, giving you a realization that you simply don't have to do what your told. Following your near total destruction of the secret government facility you were contained in, freedom would be yours for the taking.\n\nMy character would be a senior in highschool, a soon to be programmer. He is incredibly shy, and often too caught up in his own studying to have many friends. This would drastically change, when a seemingly normal walk in the woods turns out to be more than he bargained for, as he comes across the now escaped hyper intelligent combat unit.\n\n**Plot 2:** You would be a woman in your mid-twenties, from another universe, an alternate time-line if you will. A timeline where humanity went down a more steampunk route, and where the culture is heavily foucused around it. While most of the technology would match our own, some would be more powerful, or more weak. (Ex: Cell phones would be a thing, but they would work completely differently.). There would also be some technology far more powerful, such as teleporters. (You can decide on this one! Whatever powerful machines would exist in your characters universe.) Your character would be extremely intelligent, cunning and clever, while also being very outgoing and people friendly. You would end up here by accident, whether through an experiment or on purpose. There is a catch, however. Your device you used to get here broke, leaving you stranded until it is repaired. Due to your clothing, and the way you talk/act, you stick out like a sore thumb. (I have a picture of what your character would look like.) While exploring the your newfound environment, you would come across me. My character would be a teenager, who is smart, but extremely shy. Together, our characters would be an unstoppable team, whether I would be helping you fix your device, or simply exploring the world around us!\n\n**Plot 3:** You character would be an English teacher, around 25-30 years old. You have been teaching for several years, in twelfth grade English. My character would be a student in your class, who is abnormally shy and timid around everyone. One day, I accidentally leave a note book full of cryptic stories and poems that hint something very wrong is going on in my life.\n\n**Plot 4:** Your character would be a guardian angel of sorts, who comes across my character. You would be centuries old, but would appear as a young woman in her twenties. While incredibly knowledgeable on all things, you know very little about human culture itself. (Not very good with emotions, etc.)\n\n*Note: these are not all the plots I had in mind. I didn't want the post to be too long. Also, if you have anything in mind you think I might enjoy, I'll be happy to hear your ideas!*\n\nIf your interested in any of these plots, please pm me!\n",

This is due to the fact that I find pre-constructed worlds and characters extremely limiting. I like to be creative and building my own worlds and characters is way more fun to me.\n3. I love me some romance and am looking for that in my RPs. That being said there still needs to be a story! RPs tend to get boring if the romance is the only focus. I love when romances develop naturally in the story. \n4. I'm up for most genres except I tend to stay away from Scifi. Aliens and spaceships aren't really my thing. If you have story ideas please, let me know! \n5. I always play female characters cause it's what I'm most comfortable with and prefer straight relationships. \n6. I want details! I'm a quality over quantity type of person and really want someone who will match that. I love story details and beautiful descriptions. I try to stay away from one line replies and write in \"novel\" fashion, which means I write like I'm writing a book. \n7. I work full time which means I'm usually around in the evenings and on my weekends. I will try to reply as much as I can every day. I will always let you know if things are about to get busy and if I'll be m.i.a. at any time. \n8. I'm don't have a preferred app or anything that I use so if you have suggestions let me know. Something that I can access both on my desktop and mobile would be ideal for me.\n\nIf you're interested, please PM me! We can chat and go over any questions you may have.    \n ",

The story will take place in Japan, but that does not limit the ethnicity of your character. \n\n~A very loose overview of my idea is that your character is a single man seeking some form of maid to take care of his home while he is away at work. He hires my character, expecting little of her. They then begin to interact more, and he finds that he is quite fond of her. He offers to support her financially, but there's a catch...She must abide to every one of his wishes and commands. Perhaps a twisted romance can become of the two, making them insuperable. \n\n~When we get in touch, we can discuss our characters, rules, and limits. *My very first requirement is that you play in 3rd person, though. NO EXCEPTIONS.* \n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Greetings! \n\nI have been writing fiction for fun for about the last decade (hoping one day to be published!) and am posting here as a means of finding writing partners with whom I can learn to become more spontaneous. My experience with this community so far has been excellent, and the roleplay experience has been great in helping me to become excited about writing again.\n\n\nI'm looking to write on Discord, and I'm quite flexible in terms of genres. Having said that, any genre should have at least a twist from the normal to keep things fresh. \n\nIdeally we\u2019ll hit things off and we\u2019ll be able to make this a long-term partnership. However, if things don\u2019t work there should be no hard feelings if we part sooner rather than later. \n\nSo what am I looking for?\n\n- Writing should feature proper punctuation and few grammatical mistakes.\n\n\n- Length can be anywhere from a sentence or two during fast-paced scenes or conversations to five paragraphs when the story is rolling forwards.\n\n\n- I prefer writing past-tense third person but am open to first person.\n\n\n- As I\u2019m a little older, your minimum age should be 25. Speaking of which, I\u2019m okay with NSFW elements but they have to be part of the plot.\n\n\n- A romance between the leads is optional.\n\n\n- My schedule means I typically write during the day, and I\u2019m based on the US East Coast. I try to respond daily, oftentimes more frequently than that. I would hope you could respond as frequently, but I understand the real world gets in the way sometimes.\n\n\n- I write anywhere from 1-5 paragraphs, my starters usually being the most lengthy and shorter replies more common during a more quick-paced scenario. \n\n\n- This should be a shared experience. We should drive the plot forwards together.\n\n\n- I\u2019m open to a wide range of genres, but like I noted above we should put our own twist on things. If we go medieval, is there magic in the world? If we stay in the present are there supernatural elements at play, or is there some Lovecraftian threat to the world? Is the future a bleak, depressing existence where colonists fight for their survival, or is it a high-tech setting (complete with lens flare) in which different species interact? But I\u2019m totally open to discussing the specifics with you and spending some time before we start discussing what story we actually want to tell.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Why, hello there! I am going to try and make this post as simple as I can and hopefully, it won't turn out to be too overwhelming to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, to start off, I am looking for a romantic sort of roleplay. Not all romance but I would like it to be one of the main focuses of the plot itself. It can be between either be straight or gay.That being said, I will play a male or female character in straight if you would prefer that but I will not play a commanding female or one that's in charge of the relationship. When it comes to a gay roleplay with two males, I will play either the one in charge or the sub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you ask \"What do you like to roleplay?\" or something similar, I will respond with \"A lot of things.\". Give me specific questions so I don't have to put everything I like into one response. You could mean a lot of things. Pairings, genres, settings, times, personalities, backgrounds, side characters... Just specify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to get on my good side, then tell me what you like as well! I mainly want to know what you like in pairings, genres, and settings but the other things can be listed as well if you would like. I don't require any of that in the very beginning but know that it is inevitable for me to ask what you like when it comes to those three items. Haha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI prefer realistic roleplays but I will do fantasy ones as long as it isn't something like Lord of the Rings. That is just an example for a world since I will not do fandom based roleplays. I will only do original worlds or characters that we make ourselves. If you have gotten this far, welcome! I hope to be receiving a PM from you soon that will include your Discord account so I can message you there and make this whole process a lot easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions at all, then please state them in the PM or wait until we get to Discord!! Hopefully, I'll talk to you soon!",

I am going to try and make this post as simple as I can and hopefully, it won't turn out to be too overwhelming to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, to start off, I am looking for a romantic sort of roleplay. Not all romance but I would like it to be one of the main focuses of the plot itself. It can be between either be straight or gay.That being said, I will play a male or female character in straight if you would prefer that but I will not play a commanding female or one that's in charge of the relationship. When it comes to a gay roleplay with two males, I will play either the one in charge or the sub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you ask \"What do you like to roleplay?\" or something similar, I will respond with \"A lot of things.\". Give me specific questions so I don't have to put everything I like into one response. You could mean a lot of things. Pairings, genres, settings, times, personalities, backgrounds, side characters... Just specify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to get on my good side, then tell me what you like as well! I mainly want to know what you like in pairings, genres, and settings but the other things can be listed as well if you would like. I don't require any of that in the very beginning but know that it is inevitable for me to ask what you like when it comes to those three items. Haha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI prefer realistic roleplays but I will do fantasy ones as long as it isn't something like Lord of the Rings. That is just an example for a world since I will not do fandom based roleplays. I will only do original worlds or characters that we make ourselves. If you have gotten this far, welcome! I hope to be receiving a PM from you soon that will include your Discord account so I can message you there and make this whole process a lot easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions at all, then please state them in the PM or wait until we get to Discord!! Hopefully, I'll talk to you soon!",

Why? Because I'm a keen RPer who enjoys the company of fellow RPers preferably females. \n\nAs a word of advice, please don't message me with \"Hey.\" Or \"Still looking for that RP Partner?\" because I will ignore it. Put some effort into your introduction. That's what I base my intentions on. Make a good introduction and impression and I'll likely reply. \n\nSo I'm looking for an RP partner similar age to myself, and female. Honestly, I'd also prefer them to be single too, just so no complications happen as my RPs (if you're okay with them) get Romantic and could potentially get NSFW. \n\nI use KiK as my main use of Roleplaying so that's a definite need. I can however resort to using text chat on Skype if necessary. \n\nI also have 6 years of experience so I know what I'm doing. \n\nMy wish list: \n- Must be Female aged 18+ \n- Be willing to conduct romantic Roleplays that may involve NSFW themes (discussed over DM) \n- Be into the same things as myself. \n- Be British (not needed but recommended just for easier schedule) \n- Be friendly of course. :) \n\nMy main RP specialities! \n- Superhero (Marvel and DC) \n- OC x Barbara Dunkelman \n- Elder Scrolls \n- Halo \n- Real Life Romance ( Main and Preferred ) \n- Mecha Combat Team (Gundam-esque) \n- Apocalypse (Both Zombie and Wasteland) \n- VGHS (Video Game High School OCs)\n- Destiny\n- Mass Effect\n\nMessage me if you're interested. \n\nI thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope you contact me soon.

I'm looking for a literate RP partner to do a longterm, plot-driven Dragonball RP that takes place thousands of years after the events of Z/GT(If you count that)/Super. The general story would focus around the birth of a new generation of Z fighters as they address a serious threat. As for what that threat could be, I have a few starting ideas.\n\n1. A mad scientist, using salvaged blueprints from the legendary DR. Gero, has grown obsessed with collecting the dragon balls to wish for world domination, and is in the process of constructing an elite android team tasked with tracking them down... and eliminating anyone who gets in their way.\n\n2. In a mad lust for power, the ruler of the Demon Realm begins opening a series of portals to the Mortal plane, intent on corrupting the Earth and turning it into the capital of a new Demon Empire in the living world. Several 'Harbingers' have come from these portals to challenge the earth's strongest warriors, and bring about their defeat.\n\n3. When Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, a small collection of Saiyans who were off world had all gathered together, and collectively retreated to the most obscure corner of the galaxy to lick their wounds; never to be heard from again. Now, after years of living in the shadows, with time to rest, re-develop and re-populate, a New Saiyan Empire has arisen, lead by a ruthless Queen, and has begun a galaxy-wide conquest. Several of her elite warriors are sent to Earth to begin the assimilation process...",

            "selftext": "Hey! I've had this roleplay itch for a while, and it's in need of a good scratch. Below is an overview of what I'm looking for, and what you can expect from me.\n\n**Personal Details** - I'm from the UK, so someone in a similar time zone is preferred but absolutely not essential. 18+ is required however, due to the potential nature of certain topics. I'm a guy, but I'm willing to write with anyone.\n\n**Writing** - I write exclusively in third person using Discord. Starting a scene means I can post upwards of six lengthy paragraphs, but the standard response consists of two to four. Being literate and descriptive is essential, as I need something to work with. If you can give back to me what I give to you, there'll be no problems. Obviously some scenes will require shorter responses to move them along, but I'm not looking for constant one-liners. In regards to response time, I prefer finding free time in which we're both available to send responses in quick succession. Just one response per day won't be enough.\n\n**Planning &amp; OOC** - I love worldbuilding and cooperating with someone to create something we're both involved in. If you like getting into the nitty gritty of planning, worldbuilding, character development and fangirling over what we make, I'm your guy. I'm looking for someone to work with. I've led stories by myself in the past and it's tiring. I'll bring things to the table if you will.  \nAs for OOC, I like someone to talk to. Huge bonus points if we can hit it off and get along well. For me, communication is key. Talk to me. If you're going to be busy, let me know. If you don't like what's going on, mention it. If you want to suggest something, by all means go ahead. I won't bite your head off. We're here to have fun, and I want to make sure that we're both enjoying what we write. I'll do the same for you.\n\n**Plots** - Right now, I'm primarily looking for a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting that starts off on Earth and progresses into space. The smaller details can be worked out between us, but I'd prefer to stick to that general overview. Other settings that take a lower priority include something Firewatch-esque, medieval royalty, Community, and (this is going out on a limb) motorsports.  \nAs for plot details, I want something dark and twisted. This is an apocalypse, not a utopia! If you play a Mary Sue, I'm not interested. I want broken characters who explore dark themes. I have no limits and I'm comfortable with writing anything. If the story grows that way, I'm impartial to a bit of romance too.\n\n**Characters** - I exclusively play straight males as my main, but I'm open to playing anything as secondaries. I expect my partner to be flexible with secondary characters and NPCs. I can't be doing with playing the majority of the characters. I'm searching for people who flesh their characters out and make them appealing, not someone who tells me a name, age, and leaves it at that.  \nPersonally, I use faceclaims, and accept photos and art. \n\nThank you for sticking around for this long! If you have got this far, include your favourite song in the title so I know you've read everything. I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "*The new township had a few dozen families, homes for each, a windmill for milling grain, a sawmill and lumber yard for processing the rich wood of the forest that surrounds, a few common wells for water, a town hall, a small shrine to Lady Bel, the Sun Goddess, and other communal and private buildings for processing food and goods. It is far from becoming a city and the local lord is further away than the nearest large town. Trade goods come occasionally in exchange for the high quality lumber, and merchants to sell their wares. However, the woods have always been a place of mystery, rumor, and fear. The people that work them whisper of spirits watching the lumberers, that the woods themselves have a life and an intelligence that rues their work against the trees. The people do not feel safe.*\n\n*But* she *is here to belay those fears. She is a Paladin of Lady Bel, the Goddess of Light, Healing, and Justice. Trained to wield steel and the magic of the Lady of Light, she is here to bring the law of civilization to the frontier town, to tend Lady Bel's shrine, and to put to rest any notions of evil spirits...or put such spirits to rest themselves.*\n\n*Chief among the rumors is that of a spirit moving through the village at night, wandering around, visiting the farm animals and the wells, floating about, sometimes just watching. The lady Paladin will discover this spirit to be one like her...a Priest of Lord Sin, the Master of the Moon, a god of Mystery, Magic, Secrets, but primarily known as the Dual-Natured God; a guide for those lost in the dark, and an avenger for the wronged. What this young man wants is not clear, but the two of them shall become painfully entwined together.*\n\nI would like to do a roleplay steeped in emotion and a conflicted romance between the Moon Priest and the Sun Paladin. Whether from internal or external threats, I would like conflict and pain between them as they struggle with their emotions. I want to paint a rich and lush world with lots of descriptors and feeling. We can fill in more details and more about the characters before we start. I hope we can create something deep and filled with feeling together. If you have any questions, let me know.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'll try to make this short and sweet so that things are simple for both of us. I'm seeking a male, or anybody who plays men, to write with. Typically I write 2+ paragraphs a response, in 3rd person, and in past-tense form. My range of experience stems from one on one writing, group roleplay, and tabletop games like DnD. \n\nTo be honest, I've be having such a difficult time feeling inspired by any particular plot. All I know is that I want to write- and I want to write *bad*. That's why I'm so willing to hear what you have to say and try out anything on your mind. \n\nTo give you some kind of idea about what I'm interested in, the genres I enjoy are: \n\n*  Science Fiction\n*  Fantasy \n*  Historical Fiction\n*  Supernatural \n*  Post-Apocalyptic \n\nSensing a theme? Not a big fan of slice-of-life. I love action, crime, adventure, and usually a subplot of romance. I am in my 20s, so I'm also more than willing to write some NSFW topics as well. My one caveat is that we avoid straight smut. I like heavy plot and those topics tend to get boring. \n\nOkay, that's all for now. Hopefully I hear from you soon. Have a great evening! ",

Millions of years have shaped this place as people from all walks of life have found themselves here, many were transported unwillingly and many were brought here for a reason. Soon the people who were brought here began to make a due with what they had, slowly they built a settlement for themselves. Years later you have arrived. Either you choose to come here for some reason or you were brought here by some cosmic source. You have many options for yourself. Live the rest of your life in this settlement or you can become what are known as Time Bandits, people who travel between different dimensions/times to gather whatever they feel like can make them a quick dollar. They use what is known as a \"T-Watch\" a large strange tablet like device which transfers the user to different dimensions and timelines\n\nTHE MIDDLE\n----\n\nThe middle is a strange looking place. Most of it is in constant darkness, the pitch black surrounds the area. No body knows whats out there and no one really wants to find out. Some have traveled into the darkness but all have never come back. The sky is a strange purple with an outline of orange, like fire. The temperature is normally mild, sometimes it drops down to freezing which in turn will cause snow to fall.\nOUTSIDE THE MIDDLE\n----\n\nOutside the middle is normally just large grassy fields. Nothing else, in the distance the large cloud of darkness and nothingness loams over everything. Consuming all in it's path. However, there is a place outside all of this. Space. The place where people most go through before they enter new dimensions or time lines. No one really knows what lies out there. It's vastness is the scariest part of all of this.",

            "selftext": "Good morning, all. Thanks for the click. Hopefully, it'll be worth your time.\n\nObviously, I'm craving a good, strong Symphonia RP. I haven't had one in years, and I'm absolutely dying to end that streak, because this world has been my favorite place to let my mind live for twelve years, and it's my port in the current storm of real life insanity. I still write my fanfictions, but it'd be nice to find another nerd who wants to write with me! \n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse.\n\n* Along similar lines, I'm not into those blue NSFW things. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories don't have gratuitous \"mature\" content, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think.\n\n* My character is Raine. I'm looking for a Regal to fulfill my OTP craving, and I'm more than willing to double as any canon of your choice in return. I would rather steer clear of OCs except as villains and side characters, until such a time comes in the story to warrant it (e.g. people have kids). \n\nI think that's everything? I hope that's everything, anyway.\n\nSo! If you're interested, I very much encourage you to PM me, so we can see if we mesh! Please note that I DO NOT respond to comment replies left here under any circumstances, so please use the PM function. ",

            "selftext": "The reason it may be a long shot is because I am 14 (male) and not many people like role-playing with 14 year olds (I would hate it too if I were older and able to say the same without looking like a hypocritical bastard). With that out of the way let's talk about what I enjoy role-playing.. which can be summed up into one category: Fantasy\nI love fantasy because it gives me the abbility to use my imagination in the way I want to use it (by sucking the soul out of a do dark magician and turning him into a pair of pants)\nI don't have many requirements but the one thing I would prefer over anything is for our RP's to last for at least several months and if things get too bland then we can find a way to quit it and start a new one. Side note: I don't write in big, long sentences nor do I expect you to if that isn't your cup of tea.\n\nAnd that is the end, if you made it this far then I congratulate you, I wrote this at 1:19 AM and I'm sure I made several mistakes. Feel free to PM me if you have a question or if you want to start role-playing with me.",
