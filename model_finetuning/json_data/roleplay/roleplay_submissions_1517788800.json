            "selftext": "\nHowdy fellow role players,\n\nFirst off, a bit about myself. I'm 20 y/o female, with a wealth of role play experience having Dm many times in the past. I'm happy to play both male and female characters and when it comes to relationships. I'm up for involving gay/lesbian themes if it directs that way.\n\nWORLD BUILDING:\n\nI'm looking to do a OC world as I find it 1)easier to roleplay, 2) more entertaining and worthwhile. I'm open to most genres of story ideas; romance, crime, action, slice of life and everything in between. I'm not going to fully leave it up to you to pick a theme but would love to find out what your most into and work from there. I do have two prompts semi plotted out, there is plenty of room for change and adaptation with your input.\n\nIDEA PROMPTS:\n\n- Common post-apocalyptic backdrop, maybe something in the vain of 'The last of us'.\n\n- Dystopian blade runner style world mixed with noir crime elements.\n\n- A small town that experience a terrible event (A kidnap child, A series of murders, something paranormal...Etc). Our character's  are the ones investigating the event. \n\n{I would be more than happy to use any prompts/story ideas you have already planned as well}\n\nTHING TO NOTE:\n\n- I'm mainly looking for a partner who (like me) is willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. Delving deep into each characters histories and personality.\n\n-Someone who isn't afraid to move the story along and even spring sudden plot twists without warning.\n\n-Commitment wise, I would say for me personal I'd be replying once or twice a day. I don't expect you to do so but keep your replies frequent and often. I usually go for two to three paragraphs but it all depends on the time in the story. I do expect a fair amount as I'm not going to be the only one sharing into the story.\n\n-I'm looking for the roleplay to go into some dark themes, plus a probable romantic element which means players 18+ is a must. \n\n-Your character is fully up to you, but try to base it loosely around what genre we have decided on. I don't expect 'I'll play whatever' as that shows me your lack of interest. I want someone who is excited to play there character. \n\n\nWell I commend you all for making it this far. If this interests you please feel free to message me with a little bit about yourself and what your looking for in a roleplay.\n\n",

            "selftext": "He sat alone at the edge of a forest, tending to a small bonfire as he squatted on a single upright log which had proved far too stubborn for kindling. His horse, normally laden with everything he needed for his life on the road was tied to a nearby tree, drinking water from a bucket he had filled for it at the small lake next to his campsite. His belongings sat in a great pile next to it, allowing the horse some much needed respite. Most mercenaries travelled in small groups or larger bands, but not him. He had grown used to the quieter life fate seemed to have forced him into, relishing in these small moments of peace between jobs as he travelled the lands looking for work. \n\nHis name was Andrew. A man in his prime at the young age of 26, with short wild brown hair, a matching beard and green eyes which reflected the colours of the forest around him. Normally he wore his armour, a mishmash of different types and styles which he had collected from various parts of the kingdom with the money he earned from his work, though for now it lay in a sack with the rest of his possessions to allow his shoulders to recover from bearing its weight. In its place, a simple tunic and trousers with a belt over the top where he stored a small amount of tools and pouches along with a short knife he used for cooking. \n\nThe air was still and calm as evident by the wisps of smoke that rose gently upwards from the fire where he cooked the lone rabbit he had managed to snare overnight. The smell of wild flowers and trees clashed with the smoke and meaty smell from his fire. All around him, birds sang, trees rustled in the wind and his small fire crackled away adding its own flare to the ambiance. \n\nThen suddenly, a strange wail pierced the air. Well, less a wail and more like a whimper. He jumped at this rather jarring change and ran for his sword, retrieving it from under the pile of his other belongings. He listened carefully as he initially thought about brushing it off as his mind playing trick on him. But there is was again, louder and clearer than before. He didn\u2019t know why, but it made him feel sad, like some primeval part of his being could share in the sorrow of whatever the source was. \n\nHe cautiously made his way through the dense trees of the forest as he followed the sound to its source, his body tense as he ventured further towards the unknown. After a walk which seemed to last an eternity, he saw it. A metal cage that seemed to shimmer as if its very surface were a liquid, but this wasn\u2019t the source of the sound he sought after. The source lay within.\n\nAs he drew closer, the form of the creature inside became more apparent. It was human, or at least it appeared so at first glance. Upon closer inspection, it bore features that he would have sooner expected to find on a wild animal like a long fluffy tail and small triangular ears mounted near the top of its head. His intrigue growing in tandem with his sympathy for this creature, he lowered his guard, stepped forwards and spoke in a calm yet inquisitive tone.\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\n**The Details!**\n\nHey there! This is my first post here, so please be kind :P Basically the idea for this prompt is that my character (Andrew) finds a spirit of the forest trapped in an enchanted cage and goes to free it. The spirit can be anything really; I just went with sort of a half fox appearance because it\u2019s the first thing that came to mind while writing this. \n\nAndrew himself I see as kind of a loner, someone who has just settled into the idea that his work is easier done when he carries it out alone. He can\u2019t use any sort of magic and only understands enough about it to know that he should probably avoid the hostile forms, so I thought it would be interesting to stick him with a creature that is basically pure magic and can do things he would never even have dreamed of. I think it could lead to them working off each other in some pretty interesting ways given the two different skill sets involved and his probable reluctance for company. \n\nSo the themes I was planning on for this were sort of medieval/fantasy/adventure with maybe some romance elements in there if things develop that way with the characters. Given the nature of his job, and some of the possible directions that this prompt could go I would say that NSFW content could potentially happen and therefore this RP will be 18+ only. As is evident in the prompt, I can write quite a bit when the mood takes me but it\u2019s usually around 2-3 paragraphs in length and 3rd person style. I am fairly active online and so replies from me should be relatively frequent. \n\nI have probably gone on for too long about this already, so that\u2019s it for now! Please send a message if you are interested in this prompt and want to discuss ideas. I look forward to hearing from you!\n",

            "selftext": "Hello there, I am Demetrius Morgenroth, writing on behalf of a roleplaying project named Hawthorne Institute of Legends. We need some people who are equally passionate about writing to play the role of new Professors in our school.\n\n**Who Are We?**\n\nHawthorne Institute of Legends is an online school that allows its students to fulfil their dreams of becoming Heroes, Guardians, Royals or Villains. Our website has several functionalities that enable students to interact in a fully-immersive environment, such as lessons pertaining to their chosen courses, assignments graded by real people, a real-time chat for all RP endeavours in a tight-knit community, deep plotlines written by the Staff to keep a fresh sense of adventure, a completely fleshed new universe with all its corresponding lore and the execution of group activities with the entire student community.\n\nThe first version of the website, which can still be accessed [HERE](http://hawthorneinstitute.com/), was discontinued because a total of four people wrote 14 Professor characters. Upon their departure at the same time, the project was left unsustainable and had to be placed on pause until we rethought our approach.\n\nWe are currently striving to re-open this rich roleplaying community with the help of people that, like us, share our love for the creation of stories. Over the span of the last two months, we were able to hire a total of 12 Professors - still, this is only the beginning to make sure the project can be a success.\n\n**Who Are We Looking For?**\n\nWe look for people who love writing and fully fleshing out a character, as well as using this character to write lectures that are engaging, yet informative. All characters have a [deep background story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V71Mv-wQV-OVdfIgc1ttQRS0hd3l5jZsB3nueu-2jpQ/edit?usp=sharing) and enable the writer to play a new concept both [inside lectures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-w_L5vvBABxfJf2zoTlx9DlRNuyq2LwXdEoR0qelHt0/edit?usp=sharing) and in one-to-one or group roleplaying settings.\n\nIn case you'd like to check out which courses are part of our curriculum, as well as which courses still require a Professor, you can access our [Course Directory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s_3b_-K3syLAIXOQj7_RpNhgqB5W0QnwxKu_sXkwcfs/edit).\n\nThe link to our Professorship Application can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VZIFQ74oqm3ga5uno1jMZxdkh4BaJT-iGSEWnABgw5Y/).\n\nHope to hear from you soon, so we can create a story that is different from anything seen before.  \nDemetrius Morgenroth.",

            "selftext": "Once upon a time, there was a king. The king was a wise and powerful man, with a lovely wife and three strong sons. The eldest was clever, skilled with numbers and strategy. The second was handsome and won the hearts of the country and her neighbors. The third was mighty, a skilled leader able to fell any foe that may arise.\n\nWhen the queen announced she was with child again, it was as though the very world rejoiced, so eager was she to deliver a new blessing to her people.\n\nBut this new prince was cursed.\n\nThe queen fell ill in the last month of her pregnancy, the babe forcing her into an early labor - and an early death.\n\nThe king, they say, went mad with grief, offering a kingdom's worth of riches for any sorcerer who could bring his wife back from the grave. Many tried, and all failed - each beheaded for their crime of deceit.\n\nThe king then searched his prison for any capable of performing the task, offering freedom, riches, any gift their heart desired in exchange. Again, many tried... and this time, one succeeded.\n\nYears after her death, the queen arose from her grave, as young and as beautiful as she was the day she passed. The king fell to his knees and wept, promising the necromancer anything he wished.\n\nThe mage smiled and asked for one thing - to become the king's most trusted advisor.\n\nAt the feast to celebrate the new appointment, the three eldest sons begged him to reconsider. It was unnatural, they claimed. Wrong.\n\nDuring the feast, all three fell.\n\nWhen they rose, they had no further complaints.\n\nUnder this new reign, the world is dark and fearful. Most opposing kingdoms have fallen, either by truce or by sword, and the army of the king marches slowly toward the last survivor, three immortal princes at its head.\n\nYet for all the darkness, there is still hope. The fourth prince, the cursed prince, has come of age. While he might not be clever or handsome or brave, he has hope - and that may be just that the world needs.\n\n--\n\n&gt; Hey there, and thanks for reading! As you may have guessed, I'd love to do a somewhat dark medieval fantasy rp in which I play the young, cursed prince trying to save the world from his father's reign. How we get there, who you play as my counterpart, and all the details are up to you.\n\n&gt; How do we bring light back to this dark world?",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I\u2019m looking for a long term partner to roleplay in a classic \u2018forbidden romance\u2019/\u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019-equse story involving witches and the magically inclined. \n\nTo save time, I won\u2019t go to deep into the overarching lore of the universe in my canon, but to make a long story short Witches and other magic users have been in hiding for hundreds of years do to a group of super religious zealots called Purist or \u2018The Pure\u2019. Over time witches have formed societies of their own in hiding or have taken to hiding amongst humans in the cities. \n\nIn order to eliminate witches and the magical artifacts used to enhance magic the Purist have created a group of people to serve as witch hunters. Hunters are either kidnapped as children from cities and villages, or are bred within their base as \u2018born-hunters\u2019. They are tortured, brainwashed, and at times forced to hunt witches. \n\nOur story will begun at a temple located deep within a once magical Forrest where my character, and witch hunter named Rowan and her two partners have been sent on a mission to recover a particularly strong magical artifact: a moonstone which is spoken to have the ability to enhance the powers of water elementals. \n\nYour character, a witch, will also be trying to recover this magical artifact with his own small party. Eventually the two groups will become aware of one another and a fight ensues. Rowan will continue her search for the moonstone and will find it just in time for your character to witness her a.) touch it and not instantly die from the overwhelming about of magic and b.) have the water surrounding her react in a way that signals to your character that she must be magically inclined. \n\nFrom there, for reasons of your choosing, your character will save Rowan and take her back to your camp/city/whatever and try to rehabilitate her enough so that you can discover if she is truly what you think she is, an elemental. \n\nOf course this won\u2019t be as easy as he would have hoped considering the wild and intense fear/hatred Rowan has for witches. Eventually I plan for her to come around and a romance to ensue. \n\nIf this sounds interesting to you please send me a message and I\u2019ll get back to you. Just as a heads up, I usually play in 3rd person and prefer para style roleplay.  ",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve actually been out of the role-play game for a little while. But after recently working on getting back on a daily writing habit I realized how much I\u2019d like to get back into it. I\u2019ve done a few of these posts looking for people recently but don\u2019t have much to show for it. So here we are, still looking. \n\nQuick intro I\u2019m 26, I\u2019m female, and I work at a comic/game shop full time. I play a lot of dungeons and dragons and a lot of my writing involves characters/worlds I\u2019ve created for either my own or my friend\u2019s campaigns. I like a lot of grit/realism in my fantasy, grey ass morality, imperfect characters, complicated conflicting emotions, all that fun stuff. I can write in both third and first person past, I think both have merits and I\u2019m up for either. While I mostly play women I can play men too. I have characters of lots of different sexualities/gender and it\u2019d be cool if you did too. And while I\u2019m not really aiming for a NSFW game I also understand that sexuality can play a roll in storytelling/character development so I\u2019m not going to avoid it if it fits. That being said if that\u2019s all your looking for, maybe I\u2019m not the person for you.\n\nSo on the more technical side of things I\u2019ve always role-played at the \u2018advanced\u2019 level. But I found those role-plays ended up moving so slowly people almost always lost interest. While I often write long posts I also think some good paragraphs can work fine depending on the situation. I\u2019m much more concerned with quality of character and writing than length. So I guess I\u2019m still hoping for the story quality of advanced, just with occasional shorter posts and more frequency.\n\nQuality is a big sticking point for me right now. But I\u2019m not really sure how to talk about it without coming off as a conceited asshole. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the greatest writer who ever lived, I\u2019m honestly doing this to try and improve upon my many flaws. But I would consider myself above average as far as my characters and dialogue are concerned. And I want to role-play with someone who matches or even exceeds me. Again I\u2019m really not trying to be a dick here. I feel like there\u2019s no polite way to say I don\u2019t want role-play with people who after some self scrutiny don\u2019t feel the advanced label fits them. \n\nAs far as post frequency, ideally I\u2019d like to aim for a rate of weekly at the very least. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t be patient if there are delays, we all have lives. As mentioned above I also work full time so I may be having some of those delays myself and I understand things can get hectic. I'm not going to be super pushy as long as you don't ghost me. I\u2019m also not opposed to sharing multiple posts in a day if we get particularly inspired.\n\nSettings I\u2019m interested in the moment are mostly fantasy and variants on that. I currently have a Dnd setting I\u2019ve invested way too much work in that I\u2019d love the chance to flesh out with some roleplaying. (To clarify, while this setting is from dnd, I\u2019m interested in borrowing the setting for role-play, not dming for you) Though to be honest I'm more motivated by good characters than settings so feel free to suggest your own things too!\n\nMedieval Fantasy (Classic or my own world or something entirely different) (Top pick!)\n\nGothic Horror (Monster hunters, Madness, Werewolves and eldritch abominations. Bloodborne &lt;3)\n\nPost Apocalyptic (Original or Fallout, I have a nightkin character who I just love to pieces, but he never fits in anything :c)\n\nModern Fantasy (I don\u2019t have anything in mind for this, but it can be fun) \n\nModern Super Powers (This is one I actually have a fairly fleshed out setting for if interested, less super hero oriented and more super powered people with problems.)\n\nSteampunk (Let\u2019s be over the top airship pirates! Or Historical based settings with steampunk flair.)\n\n A heads up pretty much anything involving badass women will be pretty easy to sell to me. So feel free to suggest something I haven\u2019t put down.\n\nLastly as far as medium is concerned I recently signed up for discord which I've been usually pretty frequently even if I haven't figured everything out. If you use another medium you think is pretty great I probably wouldn\u2019t mind that either. And that's about it, shoot me a message if you're interested. I'm willing to send samples or characters if asked.",

I'm a believer of quality over quantity, so I would rather have a partner who writes less but aims to move the story too. I like romance as much as I love action, so both lovers are expected to kick ass.\n\nI'm usually in for sudden and undiscussed plot twists.

            "selftext": "When she was just barely beyond being considered a toddler, Ava was lost in the vast forest. It was a grizzled old druid with scars that ran deep in his mind and across his skin that took the child in. For years he raised her as her own among the trees, in a series of rooms that were built in the branches; they contained books and vials, stacks of scrolls and maps. There were remnants of a life long since passed for him and of the magic that had begun to fade. He brought to life the magic within her that had others had only glimpsed before.\n\nUlwin taught her the ways of the world and how to speak with the earth and the creatures that inhabited it. In time, Ava could whisper to the trees and they would bend their branches, stretch their roots for her. She could encourage ivy to climb and lilies to bloom in the moonlight. The forest creatures listened when she spoke and gathered near when she sang, more pleased with her singing than her teacher\u2019s murmured attempts.\n\nAt the age of seven, the girl began to change. In the beginning she could shift only into a field mouse, small enough to sit in the palm of her teacher's hand. The creatures grew in size as she did from a mouse to a sparrow, a rabbit to an owl, a bobcat to a deer. Ava explored the forest and saw it, not as human, but as one that belonged in its sanctuary.\n\nEven as Ava learned the extent of her abilities and knowledge far beyond anyone so young should, she remained very much a child. The freedom her forms gave her allowed her to dart off like a fox when she grew tired of lessons, leaping about to catch butterflies. She defied Ulwin often, pushing the boundaries of his patience. Any semblance of routine, of a time for bed, a time for teaching, a time for reading was lost on her.\n\nTragedy, in a sense, struck just before her sixteenth year. Ulwin became ill and she found herself unable to heal him, despite the medicines he had taught her to create. The only person she had ever known was fading but with his final words he shattered her young, innocent heart.\n\nAva was never lost. She had been stolen from her family by the very man that raised her. They owed him a great debt they could not pay and when he saw the magic within her, he took her as payment. He took her to a part of the great island they would never find her. They were still living, somewhere beyond the trees; he had watched their tireless search for their only child.\n\n*Ashdown* was the name he left with Ava before his spirit became one with the earth's once more. She demanded answers, even as the confusion of loss and unwelcome realization washed over her. She cried for clarity and begged for understanding, even as she returned his body to the ground. She was only a child and all she had ever known, the truth she had believed, was gone.\n\nIt was weeks before Ava mustered the courage to leave the tree house. It was a few more of leaving, going a little further each day and returning to the safety of what she knew. It was in the dead of night with a satchel full of what she deemed important that she finally set off for good.\n\n________________\n\n\nI would like to give you a better idea of what I am looking for beyond a solid, longterm story. Of course I am seeking adventure and drama. There exists the possibility for romance, for darkness, for any number of things as Ava finds her way in the world. But in terms of who you will be, what sort of world we should create, I am uncertain. I am open and eager to hear to your brilliant suggestions!",

            "selftext": "Based on a handful of of cliches from the cyberpunk ideology. To get into the mindset I had when I was thinking of this story, I'd like you to listen to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEcggRukZCs) to get a slight idea of what I was going for. \n\nAs for the backstory, our characters were enhanced soldiers working for the Conglomerate as killers. More importantly, our two characters were married. A relationship that made them a deadly mix on the field. Him wearing a [combat suit](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/allyouneediskill/images/3/38/SEOT-FsEAsT.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170105075332) that made him a walking tank, and her wearing a [stealth suit](http://www.zbrushcentral.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=225976) that made her a ghost. \n\nThis isn't a story about heroes though, the two of us were working for the bad guys and we knew it. One day, the woman is taken by the rebellion and a device attached to her neck that blocks all of her memories of her past life. She begins a new life as a champion of the rebellion. \n\nAnd while she fields their battles for them, she struggles with nightmares of her past, she thinks they aren't real. Until the day she faces her husband in combat. \n\nWhat happens after is going to come down to us and our roleplaying. \n\nAs for the world itself, it's a massive galaxy with thousands of worlds. The Conglomerate controls the majority of the known universe, with the rebellion fighting back against them. \n\nI'm hoping to give us the opportunity to grow and develop our story a lot over time. \n\nIf this sounds awesome to you, feel free to hit me up.\n\nI do have one stipulation, I would like it to be story and combat focused. So if combat isn't your thing, I apologize in advance for turning you away. \n\nAnd finally, I'd prefer to use something easy to use on the go for our messages. Email, Skype, Discord. Any of those are preferable. \n\nQuick edit: I'm totally open to any changes you might have in mind. Though I definitely want the whole divided couple shtick still in there.",

However, do keep in mind that I know very little of most fandoms, so something original/historical would be best. Any setting except modern is appreciated. I'm willing to take a more GM type role as well! Anything from a dystopian hellscape or a floating island wonderland. I'm also unlimited in what I'll play, from ghosts to space pirates and pixies.

            "selftext": "Hey there, looking for someone to partner with me for a story idea. As the title says, the idea is for it to be a drama between a soldier and a nurse falling in love over time. The setting can be adjustable for anything from fantasy to future, war to slice of life. All I want to keep certain is the soldier and nurse bit. \n\nI'll play the role of the nurse, a soft younger male who has a heart of gold and cares deeply for others. \n\nYou'll play the role of the soldier, freshly returned from a war and burnt out, cynical and all that. (Adjustable if you have a different idea for how you'd like to work it.)\n\nThe two characters would go through the trials of friendship and ultimately a relationship as they grow closer. \n\nIt goes without saying that I would prefer you to be 18+ since there will be adult themes involved. \n\nA few variations of the story that we could pursue are as follows;\n\n- The two were childhood friends and after the soldier went off to war, they lost contact for years when the soldier was announced as MIA. One day the soldier returns back to the nurse and their life continues.\n\n- The soldier was wounded during a battle (the severity of the wound is up to you. I'd prefer nothing too drastic like paraplegia.) and the nurse is assigned as their personal assistant. Maybe the soldier is harsh at first but eventually a break through happens that causes them to start caring for the nurse. This story could involve verbal and physical abuse stemming from the soldiers PTSD and them lashing out at the nurse.\n\n- They are both in the military and the nurse is a fresh recruit in the soldiers squad. His lithe features make him seem useless in the battlefield, but he risks a lot to keep his brothers-in-arms healthy.\n\n- The soldier and nurse are from two enemy nations, an accident leaves the two of them trapped together and the soldier wounded. The nurse, bound by their oaths to heal those that require it, forgoes the grudge against the soldiers nation and heals them. The soldier is eventually rescued by his people and they take the nurse as a prisoner of war.\n\nThese are the main ideas I have for now, if you have any others I'd be more than happy to hear them. If these I've posted sound interesting to you, please let me know!\n\nAs for mode of role-playing. I personally prefer Skype, E-Mail, Discord, and Reddit PM. \n\nI wish you best of luck in future endeavors and hope to hear from someone soon. ",

Be it a medieval or other historical setting, fantasy, urban, or even sci-fi. Let\u2019s embark on this journey together and see what we can come up with. Whatever we choose to do with this world, whether it is romantic in nature, adult/NSFW, or even an exciting adventure, I am interested in all of that.\n\nI personally feel that post length should be dictated by the scene, so do not feel obligated to post lengthy paragraphs if it doesn\u2019t make sense to do so (but at least be able to, if the story requires it!).\n\nContact me if all of this sounds interesting to you, and:\n-\tYou are 18+\n-\tPlay OCs (no fandoms, please)\n-\tAre flexible with posting schedule\n-\tEnjoy using Discord\n\nLet\u2019s make this a long-term partnership.\n",

I have been role playing for roughly fifteen years so I like to think I have some \" skill ' when it comes to descriptive play :P. I para as a minimal and mainly multi-para , I like descriptive and imaginative posts. So please don't message me if you intend on one lining, one lining in my opinion is pointless .\n\nI'd like my partner to be involved in adding to the story it's much more fun if it isn't just one person leading :). And please be descriptive! Role play is all about imagination after all right?.\n\nI have indulged as many of you would probably guess in every aspect , eras and styles of role play; from fantasy/ action to adventure/sci-fi to slice of life. Nothing is of limits with me as long as it's enjoyable/fun and interesting :). I do tend to stick to mainly the modern era as i feel more comfortable with it but I'm happy to dive into other settings with the right Story line :).\n\nCharacter development and long term is preferred I like to build a good story :). Romance is something that tends to be included in all my role plays and honestly I Like it that way. Romance I find adds a real good element to any role play :) there for NSFW content will more then likely be apart of it hence the 18+.\n\nI'm really into action/romance at the moment , quite fancy doing a military role play :) ( I wouldn't be a solider but part of the medical team) but I'm happy for what ever :).\n\nPlease message me if your interested in starting something up with me, we can discuss and brain storm an idea together :). I typically role play on email. Look forward to hearing from you soon :)\n",

Just don't message me only to spoil it. \n\nNow that that's over with, I have characters for the Clone Wars, the Civil War and whatever the new one is called, I want to do them in that order. For the Clone Wars, I have a Jedi who turns into a gray Jedi over time, she's a knight when Order sixty six goes into effect. For the Civil War, I have a bounty hunter who's around while the empire is still alive, basically the entire time they're around, she is. I also have another proper Jedi for the tail end of that time period. And I have a rebel that I haven't gotten to use at all that can either be during the Civil War or the new era.\n\nI go to school full time, so I can't be on until about four pm pacific time every day, except on weekends, but those can change every time. Before then, I can't do anything. And the wifi here usually shuts down about eight during the week, and can stretch up to eleven thirty on Friday nights. It's a small window, I know, but its all I have to work with. So if you're interested, message me with which era we'll be in in the title of your message, and whether or not we'll be here or on Discord.

Most of the world is still reeling from the outcome. The previously defunct Witcher caste has been reinstated by the few remaining Witchers there are. The remaining Schools, Cat and Griffin, have traded their knowledge of mutagen creation so that they can perform the Trials once again.\n\nNow it is 1775, in the midst of the aftermath of the 2nd Conjunction, and you can have a role in what the future looks like.\n\nA WitcherRP is a story-based RP subreddit and is open to any and all with a desire to tell the stories of their characters. It\u2019s a big world with hundreds of role to choose from, and maybe you'll find one you'd like to play!\n\nYou can visit our Character Creation thread and if you have any questions our Discord chat is open to you!\n\nHope to see you join us in the new world on the Continent!\n",

I am going to try and make this post as simple as I can and hopefully, it won't turn out to be too overwhelming to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, to start off, I am looking for a romantic sort of roleplay. Not all romance but I would like it to be one of the main focuses of the plot itself. It can be between either be straight or gay.That being said, I will play a male or female character in straight if you would prefer that but I will not play a commanding female or one that's in charge of the relationship. When it comes to a gay roleplay with two males, I will play either the one in charge or the sub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you ask \"What do you like to roleplay?\" or something similar, I will respond with \"A lot of things.\". Give me specific questions so I don't have to put everything I like into one response. You could mean a lot of things. Pairings, genres, settings, times, personalities, backgrounds, side characters... Just specify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to get on my good side, then tell me what you like as well! I mainly want to know what you like in pairings, genres, and settings but the other things can be listed as well if you would like. I don't require any of that in the very beginning but know that it is inevitable for me to ask what you like when it comes to those three items. Haha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI prefer realistic roleplays but I will do fantasy ones as long as it isn't something like Lord of the Rings. That is just an example for a world since I will not do fandom based roleplays. I will only do original worlds or characters that we make ourselves. If you have gotten this far, welcome! I hope to be receiving a PM from you soon that will include your Discord account so I can message you there and make this whole process a lot easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions at all, then please state them in the PM or wait until we get to Discord!!

            "selftext": "Howdy fellow role players,\n\nFirst off, a bit about myself. I'm 20 y/o female with a wealth of role play experience having Dm many times in the past. I'm happy to play both male and female characters and when it comes to relationships. I'm up for involving gay/lesbian themes if it directs that way.\n\nWORLD BUILDING:\n\nI'm looking to do a OC world as I find it 1)easier to roleplay, 2) more entertaining and worthwhile. I'm open to most genres of story ideas; romance, crime, action, slice of life and everything in between. I'm not going to fully leave it up to you to pick a theme but would love to find out what your most into and work from there. I do have two prompts semi plotted out, there is plenty of room for change and adaptation with your input.\n\nIDEA PROMPTS:\n\n- Common post-apocalyptic backdrop, maybe something in the vain of 'The last of us'.\n\n- Dystopian blade runner style world mixed with noir crime elements.\n\n- A small town that experience a terrible event (A kidnap child, A series of murders, something paranormal...Etc). Our character's  are the ones investigating the event. \n\n(I would be more than happy to use any prompts/story ideas you have already planned as well)\n\n\nThere are a few fandom universe's I would be happy to explore though I would rather OC worlds.These are the main three.\n\n-Star Wars (I'd probably go OC characters with this one)\n\n-Marvel comics (I'd be using Canon characters but its up to you if you'd use OC or Canon)\n\n-DC comics (this is the same as the marvel RP)\n\nTHING TO NOTE:\n\n- I'm mainly looking for a partner who (like me) is willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. Delving deep into each characters histories and personality.\n\n-Someone who isn't afraid to move the story along and even spring sudden plot twists without warning.\n\n-Commitment wise, I would say for me personal I'd be replying once or twice a day. I don't expect you to do so but keep your replies frequent and often. I usually go for two to three paragraphs but it all depends on the time in the story. I do expect a fair amount as I'm not going to be the only one sharing into the story.\n\n-I'm looking for the roleplay to go into some dark themes, plus a probable romantic element which means players 18+ is a must. \n\n-Your character is fully up to you, but try to base it loosely around what genre we have decided on. I don't expect 'I'll play whatever' as that shows me your lack of interest. I want someone who is excited to play there character. I would prefer a female partner as that's what I'm used to but male partners are still welcome. \n\n-I mainly write in first person but I'm willing to change to third person if needed.\n\n\nWell I commend you all for making it this far. If this interests you please feel free to message me with a little bit about yourself and what your looking for in a roleplay.\n\n\n\n",

A small town somewhere in middle America, or the southwest. Think Hawkins (Stranger Things) or Mayberry (The Andy Griffith Show), and the Sheriff who keeps the peace there. But think of this in the near future. The farms have automated machinery, the Sheriff has a cybernetic arm after a war injury, the cars have plenty of technology (maybe they even fly???). \n\nWhat if something happens? Someone goes missing, or something happens that casts a dark cloud on the town, and it's up to my character and yours to investigate.",

A lot of it is based from taking Japanese (and some from other mythologies and some original) mythical creatures and reimagining them , and mixing the culture of Japan in the Heian, feudal, and Meiji periods of Japanese history with modern technology to world build a unique setting, but all this is just explaining it lightly. \n\nThe setting fits into the following genres: high/epic fantasy, Dark Fantasy, sci-fi fantasy, space opera, and in some cases dying earth \n\nInfo on the setting here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vzpYYSTGClELDZNWIwamdr2JOpP_7m1RZunY_sg87E\n\nPlease be prepared to deal with some pretty dark issues, if anything triggers you please let me know. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required(but welcome), but please be detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

What if she and Elsa saved Arendelle together? That would mean Kristoff would still be just a normal ice harvester on the outskirts of Arendelle, with Sven as his only friend. I was thinking he and my OC could meet in the same way as he met Anna. Then, we could brainstorm some ideas from there.\n\nWhen we get in touch, we can discuss our characters, rules, limits, etc. /My number one requirement is that you play in 3rd person, though./\n",

            "selftext": "\nThe intriguing thing about Jhonathon was that he never wanted it. He never desired or craved to be famous or be wealthy\u2026 With the way he was treated by his parents and peers growing up, all he ever wanted was to get out from under the thumb of oppression that the world seemed to push down upon him. Despite no opportunities in his childhood, he pressed on\u2026 it was as though the character of the demoralizing souls around him encouraged him to perform even better. The destitution that seemed to plague the world only pushed him to succeed more, and succeed he did, he grew himself intellectually and powerfully through this city to become one of the most wealthiest men to live here, owning Brent\u2019s enterprises, a wildly known company which made millions every year. He did it on his own, proving to those who told him he would never be a somebody wrong. Because now he was, he was a somebody, there wasn\u2019t many who didn\u2019t know his name now, and didn\u2019t that feel good?. \n\nJhonathon was in his late 20\u2019s now, he never had anyone who he would consider a \u201c girlfriend \u201c. That\u2019s not to say he was short of female attention because he wasn\u2019t , he was hardly a bad looking man. He was tall and muscular framed. Grey mysterious eyes, mousy blonde hair , and a stubbled beard which framed his chiselled facial features, some called him gorgeous.. some handsome. He was charming, intelligent.. everything perhaps someone would want. Trouble was his wealth, his money made it hard to trust anyone, his nights were full of women who were more then happy  to keep his room warm, but anything more?. Never happened. Perhaps because they didn\u2019t want it, or perhaps because he didn\u2019t trust them. The world was full of cruel ruthless people who craved his wealth and power, how could he possibly tell the good from the bad?. \n\nThis week was no different from any other in his busy life now, meetings meetings and more meetings. It was Friday night, he had a meeting pending; another late night closure on a deal he\u2019d been working on for months, but he just needed a breather. He stepped out of the office, after telling his secretary he\u2019d be right back, and just took a stroll to a convenience store down the street.\n\nThe night was cool thick clouds billowing above his head obviously setting the theme that rain and perhaps thunder was on the horizon his eyes were so focuses on the swirling storm above him that he hadn't noticed the woman in a hurry in front of him, his shoulders connected with something with a thud and he stumbled back managing to stop himself from falling over , he heard the tumble of books as he looked forward and noticed a woman against the cobbled stones and quickly hurried forward to assist her in picking up her bits - \" I'm terribly sorry.... I wasn't looking where I was going...\" - he stumbled shoving her books into his hands he watched her rise and his eyes for the first time met her own.... His heart stopped for the briefest of moments as he stared up to the woman basked in the soft white light of the shadowed moon.... Who was she?.....\n\n(( so that was obviously a prompt to start us of... Happy to start it in a different manner if you prefer . Im seeking a female for long term literate play. Semi para and upwards only ( no one liners ). My preferred method of role playing is in email... Interested? Drop me a message and we can discuss it . Thanks for reading :) )) \n",

            "selftext": "Hello and greetings! I am going to keep this pretty short and sweet. I am looking for others that enjoy a story driven roleplay with adventure, drama, romance as well as other themes that may end up in the scenes. \n\nPlease do not use text lingo ( u, lol, :D ) when it comes to our rping. And also, please be patient if I do not message for awhile. I am usually very busy due to college and work.\n\nExamples:\n\n1.) Like the famous fairy tale, there are rumors of a beautiful mermaid who swims to the shore of beaches or follows along mighty ships to watch the land-folk in pure fascination. A sweet, caring female with a beautiful singing voice, she hopes to find her true love to help bring this wandering female some companionship. Or perhaps a sea-person/creature will be able to coax the ideas of meeting someone on the surface out of her innocent mind.\n\n\n2.) Whether due to her family infuence or her beautiful and healthy genes, it shouldn't have been a surprise to this woman that she had been chosen as a bride for a person she has never met. She isn't quite sure what to make of her new partner (may they be older that her or a different species), but even if they are less than thrilled to have someone they did not fall in love with, she will do her very best to be an amazing wife for this stanger. Besides, this an adventure! \n\n\n\n3.) After finally breaking through to join intergalatic relations and politics, the humans have hit an immense obstacle. They are at war with an opposing race. Due to various reasons, the enemy is angered at the humans progressing and wish to conquer/destroy them. For now, things have been going in tie results. But now the humans worry a tie-breaker has been made. One of the captains' daughter has been discovered to create a mutation in her body that allows reproduction with anything that can inseminate. Not only that, but the offspring carry on her regenerative traits and are quite strong compared to any of the \"father\"'s kin. For now, she is being kept under a watchful eye in the labs to perhaps create super soldiers to help win the war. But if word gets out, the enemy aliens may be thinking of the same thing. \n\n\n4.) I would like to try out a teacher/student situation with forbidden love. If you want, there can be maybe a father/mother-daughter thing to this, but since I prefer the character to be quite older, no brother or sister. Males preferred for this too.\n\n5.) Being in the Terello Village used to be a paradise. Plentiful fruits and vegetables, perfect soil, many animals roamed about, and there would always seem to be lost treasure to be sought due to the burial of a lost civilization. Indeed, it was wonderful until around 100 yeara ago. A large creature took up residence in the towering mountain near the village and demanded tribute. The people gave him their treasures,but those soon ran out. Then they handed them their luxurious furniture and building materials, but that depleted too. Finally, the beast decided that as long as he was given a sacrifice every 15 years and livestock whenever he pleased, that would suffice. Now it is a woman with three children's turn to appease their \"god\", but a maiden has stepped forth and offered herself to travel up to be tribute. Will she be enough to intrigue this powerful creature? Or will she just be another snack?\n\n6.)This woman is always such a treat to watch. Those soft curves, the luscious hair, her sweet yet playful smile. It has always brought you joy to see her in the bakery, greeting you by your name and watching you grow embarrassed if she innocently compliments you. But you know that despite her kindess, she doesn't see you as partner worthy. Perhaps it is due to being chubby, older, clumsy, shy, or something different, you could only dream of being with someone like her. You were seen as \"unattractive\" to the rest. But she would make such a perfect wife for you if she found you charming enough. Somehow you would love to get a date with her. And for a darker scenario, you would love to force her as your own and make those who want her envious of you.\n\n\nWhat kind of characters am I looking for people to play?\n\nCan be male or female. For body appearance, normally I enjoy those with muscular limbs and a pretty big belly. Or if not that, more chub than muscle. With anything else, I am not terribly picky. \n\nIf you have anymore questions or want my Kik, discord, or skype please send me a message! Be sure to send me ideas of what you wish to play or anything to add to what I have. Thank you and have a lovely day!",

The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nI'd like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. I would also love a Dragon Age Inquisition plot. I'm no expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed the game.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",

We used to have over a half dozen concurrent role plays, and the goal is to get to that point again. \n\nWe have recently started new Fantasy and Primal RPs  and we're accepting new characters, whether completely original characters or characters loosely based off of other universes. Our rules are straightforward, and our staff will help if there is a dispute. The styles of role play differ from channel to channel, but it's mostly open, free-form role play, with some dice rolls. \n\nAt some point in the future we are going to run another D&amp;D campaign, if we get enough willing participants. (who are willing to deal with dice rolls)\n\nIf you are interested in joining us, you may contact me directly, or follow [this discord link.](https://discord.gg/y2e7PDu)\n\n*PS: This server has several NSFW sharing channels, if you don't like that, just don't apply the NSFW role for yourself.* ",

            "selftext": "The year is 2019 in a small tourist town known as Juxtapose, Oregon. Things are relatively peaceful, the lake waters are clear and the islands surrounding the town always make for good sight-seeing opportunities. \n\n\nHowever, the lake itself is not what's important, it's what inside the lake. A long, long time ago, a meteor struck Earth, creating the crater in which the lake and its islands now reside in. This meteor permeates the entire town with the virus that grants people the ability known as a Stand, and for some mysterious reason, pulls other Users towards the town. These qualities have garnered attention from a lot of people...some more sinister than others.\n\n\nHey everyone! As some of you may know, we're a Discord based freeform JoJo RP in which you make your own original character and role-play with ones other have made. Our goal is to provide a Part 4-esque slice of life feel, while also having entertaining Stand battles and an interesting plot. We've recently begun our second story arc, so now is a fantastic time to join if you're interested. We have also created a consistently updated summary of all plot events and Enemy Stand battles that have occurred so far, so there's no need to feel intimidated.\n\n\nHere's the link: https://discord.gg/wvDPNvj",

I am Abstract, and after some time away from writing, and with some actual free time back, I am hoping to find a few new stories with romance and adventure. \n\nI have two very specific (and let's face it, maybe a little cliche and just, well fun) plots - a dystopian mutant plot and a medieval fantasy plot, both with heavy elements of romance (NSFW) and adventure. \n\nNeither of those strike your fancy? What else am I looking for you say?\n\nSomeone 18+ with 21+ preferred. \n\nI love in depth, intriguing plots. I am not much of a genre stickler; all eras and styles are welcomed! Fantasy, science fiction, slice of life (with romance), modern, historical, post apocalyptic... throw 'em at me!\n\nLiteracy. Not going to get out my thesaurus and word count ... while I adore long, detailed post with intricacies, I also love shorter posts sometimes too. It all depends. If you give me something to interact with, activity and interest, I will be a happy lil' lady.\n\nLong-term. Please! Let us dive into a story and get lost. Have our fingers itching to get that ding of an email in our in boxes. It's like a crush. And it's great - or I am crazy, who knows.\n\nRight now I am looking at playing a female main character, but I would be open to playing more, including male characters as well. I actually tend toward males, but have been wanting to play more leading ladies as of late. \n\nHave more questions? Need more specifics on genres, limits, samples of my writing \u2013 all that jazz, check out my [website](http://abstractboredom.weebly.com/)\n\nHope to hear from you PM :)",

Under the employ of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the crew has been contracted to deliver provisions, supplies, equipment, and other cargo to a colony struggling to thrive on an alien planet located just outside the outer rim.\n\nOur story begins with the crew waking from hyper sleep; some have been with the Ethelred for years, while for others this is their first deep space contract with the Company. Regardless, they're on final approach to Haven and preparing for the mission ahead.\n\nOur community includes fans of the Alien (film) franchise, who have come together to write our own chapter within this science fiction horror universe introduced nearly 40 years ago. Whether you're an ardent fan of the franchise, someone who shares a passion for the science fiction genre, or perhaps someone looking to try something new, we're excited you're here and look forward to writing with you!\n\nAfter initially sharing our Discord server with r/Roleplay, we quickly welcomed several new writers who've created and introduced some incredibly interesting characters! There are several roles available and it's still early on in the opening scenes that you can enter the story with ease. Check out our Discord and say hello!\n\nDiscord Server: https://discord.gg/b3VpbXQ",

            "selftext": "Do you like [The Elder Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls)? Do you like roleplay?\n\nIf you like both of these things then you will love [/r/Khagburdugk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Khagburdugk/)!\n\nSet in the iconic third-era Wrothgarian Mountians, the RP follows the internal and external workings of an Orc Stronghold, with players creating a character who performs a role in said society.\n\nFrom the official RP [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Khagburdugk/comments/7v117h/ooc_frequently_asked_questions_version_10_faq/):\n\n''**Question I: What is the purpose of /r/Khagburdugk?**\n\n*Answer: The purpose is to create an immersive, stable, and sound 'The Elder Scrolls' Roleplaying experience, in the format of the Orcish Stronghold life for Orcs in the Late Third Era.*\n\n**Question II: How do I join in to this RP?**\n\n*Answer: Simply apply in the comments of [The Census and Excise Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Khagburdugk/comments/7v1hpj/3_suns_dawn_3e_426_imperial_census_and_excise/), using the appropriate format shown below:*\n\n**Character Name:**\n\n**Character Race:**\n\n**Character Sex:**\n\n**Character Occupation: (Hunter, Smith, Warrior, Priest / Priestess, Censor)**\n\n**Question III: How does this RP work?**\n\n*Answer: The process is quite simple; Users create posts equating to an event happening in the Roleplay, and other users act and react using the comment section. These posts must in In Character (IC), unless their is a valid reason to create a [OOC] post. Generally, these events are interactions between the members of the stronghold, from hunters organising their next hunt, to two warriors sparring, to a priest giving a sermon before the Statue of Malacath.The RP is real-time, in that everyday that passes in real-life passes in the stronghold.

My idea starts in high school where I was always the shy quiet kid and you were my older sisters friend that decided to constantly tease and pick on me making my high school experience less than ideal. Fast forward 4 years and you're whole friend group from high school is getting back together to spend a summer camping in my grandparents RV. Much to both of our surprise I am being forced to go as well since my parents are leaving for the summer.\n\nSo it is quite basic and not super fleshed out, but thats the general gist of it I hope to hear from you guys soon. Message me here and we can discuss moving to a different platform in PMs.\n\nUntil then,\n\nAlistair",

            "selftext": "PlayStation 4\n\n\nHello fellow Role-Players! Do you play ARK: Survival Evolved? How about the DLC Scorched Earth? Well we have an RP server in Scorched Earth and are looking to populate it with like-minded Role-Players! \n\nThe idea is to awaken on the Ark in Scorched Earth and find yourself surrounded by the local wildlife and harsh environment. With one difference. A \u201cHaven\u201d has already been built here! We built a \u201cHaven\u201d here and are already finishing up the second one. You could even build your own, and we can show you how!\n\nThere are a few requirements you need to meet to help maintain a good RP experience for you and your friends, like having a small group of people for your new \u201cHaven\u201d in order to start and build one. Or If you decide to move into the first Haven you see your character will just need to acclimate appropriately to the haven\u2019s rules and reap the benefits of having so much at your disposal. Just make sure to start a job right away, nobody likes a moocher.\n\nHavens all need Jobs and Wages! So if your character performs certain duties it will get paid in your RP interaction. We have different positions so you can actually be really good or the best at what you want! \n\nNot interested in Havens? Wanna set out on your own? Become a Vagrant and live it out in the dangerous untamed wilds of Burning Sands RP. You could be a good Vagrant with a deep mysterious backstory or even a bad rough and violent one. A Bandit, perhaps? Go for it! It\u2019s our world and we\u2019re in here to make it come to life! Just know that Vagrants are like outcasts and Havens won\u2019t really do much for help in supplies. Unless you bought them!\n\nSo join us if you are like minded Role-Players and want to dive into the harsh and unforgiving Ark of Burning Sands RP!\n \nburningsandsrp.com",

With the death of Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow and Cersei Lannister, the seven kingdoms now have broken off, forming their own independent nations and making their own alliances. The plates keep shifting as the struggle for power and strength continue from region to region.\n\nNow broken off into six different kingdoms: The Northern Vale, The Westerlands, The Crownlands, Storm\u2019s Reach, Dorne, and the Iron Islands, the future of Westeros is now up in the air. Will a king or queen ever sit on the Iron Throne again? Will the kingdoms that have already joined together break away and create even more conflict and instability in Westeros? Only time will tell as the story unfolds.\n\n*Westeros: the Severed Kingdoms is a new Game of Thrones server. We have friendly Staff and welcoming players that are eager to expand their story with other literate players. 18+ only server. The story thrives in free form storytelling, if this is something that sounds appealing to you, feel free to stop by!*",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to DM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have. Firstly, a few important notes about me and what I'm looking for.\n\nI roleplay in first-person. Your choice in point-of-view doesn't matter to me at all, I'm fine with whatever you pick!\n\nI want you to be the DM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.\n\n**If any of the ideas below strike your interest, please send a PM to /u/LordDurand and we can discuss further. I will not reply to PMs sent to this account.**\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during or after the events of the anime, with my character being an OC who ends up joining the SOS Brigade. He could either be an ordinary human or not depending on what we decide and how you want the RP to play out. The RP could also take place in the Disappearance Universe if you wanted, with that version's Haruhi meeting up with and forming the SOS Brigade with my character.\n\n**KonoSuba**\n\nMy character would be a member of the Adventurer Guild in the world of KonoSuba, though he could either be a native there or end up there like Kazuma. The RP could be entirely OCs or have canon characters, though I'd prefer canon characters to be in it, whether on their own or with OCs sprinkled in (especially since I'm absolutely in love with Megumin).\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**\n\nThis would work best in a completely alternate Universe from any of the Parts, but versions of the canon characters could still appear. However, if you'd rather have it set in a canon Universe, or even during one of the Parts, that'd be fine too. For setting, I think either a school setting or some kind of grand adventure (like Parts 3 and 7) would work best, but I'm open to any ideas you may have.\n\n**Dragon Ball**\n\nThe idea I had for this one is actually heavily inspired by one of the Parts of JoJo. My idea is that, in the far-future of the main series (or in an alternate universe), the dragon balls become closely guarded to prevent anyone unworthy from making wishes. Each of the dragon balls is held by a Keeper. Every year, the Keepers set up a world-spanning event, where everyone is invited to participate. All participants gather at one place, at which point the locations of all seven Keepers is revealed to them. From then on, it's a race to not only reach the various Keepers, but to pass their tests in order to obtain their dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are taken from their Keepers, the location of a hidden shrine is revealed to everyone who has at least one of the dragon balls. The dragon balls only work when gathered together at this shrine, drawing all the holders to one spot for a final battle.\n\nI think this idea would be great in terms of character development. All characters would be working towards the goal of having their one wish granted while on a long journey, giving them plenty of time to develop. I'm thinking that before the race begins, some time can be spent showing the main characters training for it. Maybe they're training together, or maybe they're miles apart and only meet for the first time at the starting point of the race.\n\nIf you don't like that idea though, I'm open to any ideas of your own you may have.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody who's trying to regain his heart and, over time, remembers his past and why he lost his heart in the first place. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe. Of course, if you have other ideas, I'd love to hear them.\n\n**Star Wars**\n\nThis RP could be set before, during, or after any of the films, or in an alternate Universe. My character would be a Mandalorian bounty hunter who left his home planet to work as a bounty hunter while trying to find his lost, force-sensitive sister. Eventually, he's dragged into the Sith and Jedi conflict once he learns that both sides may know what happened to his sister.",

Quality over quantity, and keeping the story moving is important to me. With that being said, I'm not interested in writing with people who write one paragraph or reply in asterisks. To use a RP term, I'm looking for a lit to adv lit writer. \n\nI write characters of all orientations and genders, and am fine with pairings of all kinds.\n\nRegarding sex and violence, I don't go into overt descriptions of the acts. \n\nI prefer writing with partners aged 21 and above, and can write over Discord, Gdocs and email. Generally, if I RP over Gdocs or email, I'll OOC on Discord. OOC is very important to me, as I find it helps keep the RP alive and the ideas flowing.\n\nOn to the good stuff.\n\n- Trollhunters: I'd love to explore changeling lore with this. I'll adore you forever if you play Strickler for me.\n- The Shape of Water: No canons for this. Perhaps something inspired by the setting, an experiment that is aided by a worker in the facility where it is held at, etc.\n- Legend of Korra: Something set in Republic City, specifically dealing with The Triple Threat.\n- RuPaul's Drag Race: It doesn't have to be set within the race itself, but it could be a story dealing with drag queens.\n- Harry Potter: Preferably set in the Fantastic Beasts era. I don't want to write within Hogwarts or Ilvermony, the wizarding world is huge and we have plenty of room to explore. \n\nThanks for reading so far! \n\n\nFeel free to come at me with your ideas regarding the fandoms listed below. I generally only write OCs unless otherwise specified. Do contact me with your Discord tag. ",

            "selftext": "\n\n###I am currently looking for a male or someone who can play a male to do a modern day, romance roleplay! I exclusively use Discord and am not willing to use any other platform. Sorry! \ud83d\ude05\n\nI have been roleplaying for about 5 years now, and I guess one could say I am pretty good. I also am currently writing my own novels. I always roleplay full lit, and my responses are typically 1-3 paragraphs. Of course, that will vary between responses, as they depend on the course the plot is taking. Usually at the beginning, my responses will be pretty long (3-5), but of course, they will go down in length as the scene and characters are introduced and established. Remember, quality over quantity! I do usually do NSFW in my role plays, and would like someone who is capable of integrating it into the plot without making it the main focus or rushing into it.\n\nThough I'm pretty open to all role play idea's I prefer, if not exclusively, do romance plots. However, this does not mean its sub-genre can't be something else! For example, I did a role play a while ago involving a mayor who was at a constant risk of being assassination and her bodyguard, who protected her with all he had. The main genre was romance and the sub-genre was drama/action! ***I do not, however, do fandoms, fantasy, or any pre-modern plots, especially medival (Though the most back I am willing to go in a time era is the 1930\u2019s)***\n\n###Here are some good things to do, and bad things to do/be when roleplaying with me!\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0Please be literate! I don't ask you to speak like a human dictionary, but I do ask you to be mindful of basic grammar skills. *For example, knowing the difference between to/too/two, their/there/they're, wear/where proper spelling of simple words etc.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Try and 'mirror' my replies. *For example, when I write a reply of a few paragraphs, I would expect the same in response. Likewise, when I write a few sentences, you don't have to write a whole novel of a reply.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0I would really love to be able to talk out of character, both for planning and just to talk! It's absolutely not necessary, but I just because I feel as though a good relationship between partners can always improve the role play and better the communication of what is going on in the plot.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Though not an absolute requirement, I prefer when the partner I'm role playing with chooses characters that have the 'Alpha Male' Personality. (Being confident, Dominating, Cocky, Aggressive, Possessive, sometimes a total dick)\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I like when my partners can come up with new characters and personalities unlike the last for the different role plays we may do.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do pretty much only Third person. I just prefer it, but I may be willing to change it to First\ud83d\ude04\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't use text speech or little asterisks when you write. I really prefer when my partner writes just as a book would be. *For example; She looked up at him with big eyes, shining from the tears in them. \"You don't understand, do you.\" She murmurs lowly, trying to contain herself. \"I love you and you don't even look at me\"*\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just I will you, please understand if my replies aren't immediate. I do go to school full time and I hope you can understand when I don\u2019t respond quickly. I will be able to reply throughout the day, just don't get upset if I reply a little later than when you sent it. I will, of course, be just as understanding with you!\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though a character face claim is not necessary, I like them to get a better image of what your character looks like. Also, I need all characters to have a bio, as it makes things like personality and background more clear. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD *PLEASE* NO ANIME FC. \n\nThough I don't have very many plot ideas at the moment, I have lots of OC's and I am more than willing to hear any ideas you have and even brainstorm a new one together!\n\n###REMINDER! If I go a few days without replying/messaging you, *please* don't think I left you hanging! I am likely either busy, or your message didn't come through to me! I will never end a role play without telling you I am doing so.\n\nWith that being said, if you're reading this, you just got brownie points for reading until the end! Congrats! \ud83d\ude0a I hope to hear from you soon! Have a super awesome day!\n\nMuch love, Apple Valentina\n\n***PS!

This new land that has called to them is of a shattered world. In danger of being destroyed by a strange army of evil. This army is led by a man clad in black armor, only known as Zephaiel he leads his army with the might of a God. \n\nMany of the heroes stolen away from their world have one burning question; 'Why fight for a world that kidnaps heroes to do it's bidding?' the answer is quite simple. Astra serves as a nexus point for all of the multiverse, if it falls then Zephaiels armies can launch an attack against any realm with ease and unchecked. The Vanguard acts as the main force of Heroes fighting against the invading darkness. It is a long road ahead but in time they may prove victorious in this fight and returned home.\n____________\nThis is just starting up and a lot of things are currently under construction. It is finished enough for people to hop in and begin character creation and plotting. Pop in to get in on the Ground Floor! This RP is inspired by FEH mainly. Duh.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/bDNkW4R\n",

            "selftext": "My name is Valentine. I'm male and 20 and I quite enjoy playing around with anime ideas I like. Particularly at the moment is Dragon Ball yet I have some more I quite enjoy if asked, including but not limited to Hunter X Hunter, the Fate/ series, Infinite Stratos, and Overlord. Onto the one in the title.\nI have three major ideas, the first being quite simple and based on Xenoverse. The idea being that we both use OC's and our characters have been paired as Time Patroller partners, the reasoning for which can be varied. My idea originally is that one of us is a veteran and the other a new Time Patroller being trained, or we could both be rather strong, or both new or something entirely different with any added elements we want.\nThe second is more complex, where one of our OC's, for one reason or another, have been forced into the main plot of Dragon Ball at some point. This can be for a variety of reasons, but my idea is mostly avoiding too many outside characters aside from one of our own and playing around with the main group and where things would go differently from their arrival.\nThe third and final idea is my personal favorite. An alternate version of the events of the Goku Black arc being one where Zamasu was sent back in time when he wished to have Goku's body. Altering the timeline from the beginning of the original Dragon Ball, Goku is replaced by Goku Black as a child, altering the timeline from the beginning. Depending on where we start, we could have this go a multitude of ways, depending on how long we thing Goku Black would remain evil before becoming good. The possibilities with this idea abound and I would love a creative and intelligent partner to complete any of these ideas.\nPlease message me privately to discuss ideas. Thank you very much for reading and I look forward for the responses I may receive. If you would kindly name your favorite anime character in your first message, I would appreciate it.",

            "selftext": "Kal-el lay in the middle of the large room deep below Lex Tower, his blue suit now hung loose over his female body. Lex had trapped him a house before, forced to wear a kryptonite necklace that Lex had slung over him, causing him to falter and weaken. Soon Lex started to smile and chuckle to himself \"Oh what I have in store for you\" Lex smirked before kneeing the alien in the gut which caused blood to fly from his lips. The doors opened and Superman was shoved into the dimly lit room, falling to his feet he saw a glass case with a glowing pink gem inside which almost looked like kryptonite but it couldn't be, he knew every version of kryptonite but there was no pink. Mercy Graves, personal bodyguard of Lex smiled as she lifted the glass, Lex nodded and smiled \"Ready the car, won't be long until his friends show up.\" Lex nodded gripping the pink crystal with an evil grin \"Superman, I'm afraid you're no longer able to use that moniker.\" He laughed as he lay superman down, resting the pink gem on his chest as he took the green. Superman felt his body burn and crack, screaming in pain like he\u2019d never felt before. He felt his hips change and shift along with every other bone in his body, soon the pain was all too much and Kal-el passed out in shock as the justice league burst in\n\n------ \n\nThanks for reading! I'm a huge fan of male to female transformations and Superman which is mostly where this idea came from, if you like it please don't be afraid to message me!\n\nFeel free to be whoever you like!

            "selftext": "First, I have been writing for well over 15 years. I've done smut, I've done story. And everything in between, now that I'm married and no longer a teenager, the thrill of smut is gone and now I'm trying to get into writing a book with a very good friend. A hobby may become a money maker one day, unfortunately for me. The story we write is totally orginal, and my buddy doesn't like what I'm looking for here. Stay tuned below for what I want to do. :)\n\nGrowing up, I had a big interest in my video games, mostly platformers but the other happened to be Fighting Games, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, King Of Fighters, hell even Bloody Roar. I loved them all, was never very good but the back stories are what brought me to those games.\n\nBe literate and willing to write multiple paragraphs. I can go up to 5+ when the time calls, and mirroring is a huge thing for me. I'd rather not write a well thought out post only to get two sentences in reply. However, I'm not gonna smack your wrists with a ruler everytime something is a little off, I get writers block. Trust me, I do. And more than anything, I just want to have fun, so more often than not I'm pretty chill with everything. I tend to write quick fire replies and would prefer someone who could do the same but this is in no way a requirement.\n\nBe willing to plan. I'm looking for a partner, not someone to string along with me through the roleplaying process. Give some ideas, bring up some thoughts, chat with me, I don't feel like I'm planning with myself. Be willing to play NPCs as well as Side Characters. It's no fun whenever I'm writing everything myself and playing as everyone!\n\nI write via Kik and Email. Refuse Googledocs as it is just too strange for me to mess with. I usually reply right away unless I happen to be at work or spending time with my family. :)\n\nMy idea: As far as this goes it's more a list of characters I want played against my OC, now I'm not against doubling. Matter of fact I thrive on it! Give me a ship for your OC too! We can definitely make it work. Setting...I'm not sure I'm thinking some kind of big tournament or something along those lines, I'm not opposed to say injecting SF characters into the MK world.\n\nCharacters I would like YOU to write as: This is by no means a list to end all lists but a rough one of female fighting Characters I enjoyed using in the past. Feel free to pick. :)\n\nJuri(Minus pigtails), Cammy(), Chun-Li(), Skarlet, Frost, Tanya, Jade, Mileena, Katana, Sonya Blade(), Cassie Cage() (Stars indicate characters I would really enjoy you writing as!)\n\nAlso, am willing to provide Google and wiki links to all names I have given here.",

            "selftext": "Hey there. This is my first time posting on here despite having been around for a while and thought that I'd try my luck advertising rather than seeking people out. The title says it all really. I'm driven largely on adventure-driven stories revolved around a singular character that acts as the proto-protagonist as they muck about in another person's Medieval Fantasy world whose story encompasses violence, exploration of the unique cultures, races, nations, forgotten places left in mountains and holes in the ground, as well as discovering new monsters, magics, etc. In a way, I sort of enjoy being able to describe it as a universe similar to the Witcher. A bitter, unpleasant world that's coming to a new age as fantasy and the harshness of reality bleed together to create a profoundly dark world that drafts real concepts from reality like economics, geopolitics, causes for conflicts amongst rulers where they use casus belis to flimsily give themselves cause to push for their real ambitions...so on and so on. If it's a world that can manage to make me uncomfortable, then you're probably doing something right with it.\n\nI don't care about the gender of my partner or any other circumstances related to them. It's not my business unless you care to make it; that being said, I've been at this long enough that if you're someone who self-describes themselves as a 'detailed writer,' then ninety-percent of the time ti doesn't actually mean anything. If you know how to structure a paragraph and can convey the feelings you want to get across, then that's more than enough for me. I'll provide a writing sample further down. Obligation has me say that I have no trouble with smut whatsoever, though the character I had in mind was a female with a favortism shown towards the same sex, which may very well come into conflict with the societal norms of the world, or be something entirely ignored. Either works for me, and, indeed, having sexuality be a point of tension can be quite fun if designed and plotted out well.\n\nI use Discord, Skype, as well as GMail/GDocs; message me for contact details for that.\n\nThanks to Kevin for giving the chance for this piece.\n\n&gt; His attire was the usual of his imperious self, a simple pair of pressed trousers above polished leather boots. Over his shoulders was draped a collared shirt, and a light leather jacket above it; an odd choice in the hellish waste which was the Prestor's hold. Still, the man wasn't even sweating as he stepped forward, his limp obvious, while his hazel eyes gazed down at the girl with a thousand emotions flowing through, making a single indiscernible amalgamation. Her gaze met his, and she felt just as many, the strangest among them, among the fear, the anger, the respect, was the love. Not of a woman to her man, but of a daughter to her father. The man, for his part, did not look older than thirty, making it rather strange in the looks, but she had spent centuries with him... And while she felt nothing so strong as for the princess of her dreams, it was still enough to stop her strangling him until he inevitably forced her away. Instead, she just keeps a grim, determined look, causing him to sigh, and set the cane against the table, before pulling the chair on his side out, to sit down, with some struggle, due to the weak leg.\n\n&gt; When he has situated himself in the chair, Saria's eyes following him coldly as he does, he pulls it in, resting his arms on the table as the weak leg splays out for better comfort, before his eyes finally rest on her once more. The man seems unwilling, or at least unable, to say anything, wordlessly watching her in a mutual contest of whom could maintain poise longer. And Saria wasn't willing to play, yawning fakely to break the manufactured tension in the room, before leaning forward in turn; keeping her back straight and hands held perfectly, as she finally says, her first words since she'd talked to Raven's graving into the bedside, \u201cWell. You look good. Is that a new hair style you have?\u201d Daas, despite having not cut his hair in weeks, instinctively put a hand on his head to see what she was talking about, before casting an annoyed gaze at her and sighing. \u201cCan you take nothing seriously?\u201d He asks that, after a moment, his tone matching the gaze as his hand returns to the table, which causes her to shrug her shoulders, indifferent.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhen it's worth taking seriously, yes. But unfortunately for you, you aren't worth taking seriously.\u201d His gaze hardens again, his jaw set in a manner to indicate her words had bitten as harshly at she'd expected. There was a primal pleasure in tearing down those you hated; at least to her, and there was no one she hated more. Part of her disliked that pleasure she received, but she didn't care to listen to that; not here, not now. Her mental tangent is broken by Daas' words causing her to jolt; breaking her from the trance she'd already fallen into. \u201cSaria. Are you ever going to stop acting like a child, or am I going to have to treat you like one?\u201d Her gaze casts over him for a moment, coming up with a response which he immediately understands will be sarcastic, causing him to just cradle his head in a hand as she replies with, \u201cWell, I don't know. Children don't have to think, and they get to (Whoops, censored!) until they're nice and happy. Being treated like a child sounds like a dream.\u201d\n\n&gt; Daas' eyes glare her down, indicating she had gone a step too far in the wrong direction. She felt no remorse for the man's annoyance, however, shaking her head as she cuts in, before the man has a chance to criticize, \u201cYou're the one who forced me into this god-forsaken tower. Don't you fucking dare tell me to treat you with dignity or respect; you traded yours a long time ago.\u201d Rather than further annoyance, Daas' expression turns to that of a bemused smile, somewhat forced, as he chose to simply come to her side of thought, for now, if only to warm her up for the questions he had planned. \u201cYou did, too, you know. So I suppose that makes two of us, just pigs, rolling in the mud.\u201d Saria's eyes glance at the man, finding some anger at what he'd said, at the mention of her having given in her dignity. \u201cI didn't really have a choice in the matter,\u201d her tone is far more pressed, now, and her eyes slant. \u201cYou took my dignity... Though, if we're pigs, then I suppose that one of us is magical and the other's a murderer. Sounds like an excellent story for the ages. Maybe one of these days you can say that story to the next woman you kidnap and hold here.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI'll keep that in mind,\u201d He says, softly, before leaning forward, thinking on her remark on dignity. \u201cBut you say that as if you didn't enjoy it. You enjoyed every moment, every kill, every hunt. The difference between you and I is that I don't enjoy my atrocities; and you do, Saria.\u201d The man has barely finished speaking before Saria's chair is thrown into the wall behind her, chipping away the stones behind her as she stands, glaring down at Daas, who shows no chance in composure as he watches her staring down at him with barely-contained fury from his words. \u201cYou...\u201d She says, voice shaking in the same manner as her quivering arms, \u201cYou...\u201d Nothing more came. It was true; what he said, at least about her. But the fact he'd said it, and the way he'd done it, made her want to burn the man down. But she didn't. And slowly, his arm raised, as she saw the familiar deathly black energy running along it, powered from it, as he gestures to the thrown chair. \u201cPick it up,\u201d he says, calmly, \u201cAnd sit down.\u201d",

            "selftext": "One year ago a kid's birthday party was being held at a park, after abit of playing one of the kid's fell and broke thier watch. So they threw it away. Later someone threw away some bad batteries and a water bottle that had gotten a bug in it.a fire had then started in the barrel, the wind pushed the fire into a tree and it spread. In less than 5 minutes the entire park was on fire. \n\n5 people turned out to be heroes that day, one of them in particular. Those five people got the kids and pets out. But one  person went back in and saved not only the kid's birthday presents, but a number of wild animals that lived in the park. This person chose to remain anomomyus.\n\n\nNow its a year later and you are writing a book on it, but there is one resoutce you havent managed to find. The fifth hero. You looked everywher and asked your assistant to help you but it didnt work.  Finally some person walks up to you and tells you they are the fifth hero. The assistant hears this and is wondering now wheter her anonymity is worth being sacrificed for the truth. \n\nIt may seem weird for her to want to be anoymous but when we rp you will discover why she wished to be anyomous. \n\nPm me your discord so we can rp",

            "selftext": "Hello, as the title states I'm in search of a plot-driven roleplay partner. I'll start by knocking a few things out of the way so that we all know where we stand. I'm well past the point of being considered a legal adult in all countries, so I would prefer my partners be so as well. I would like to request that everyone that reaches out to me be at least 21+.\n\nI prefer to write in third person, past tense, I rarely if ever will write in first person. English is my first language but it doesn't have to be yours, as long as your grammar and spelling are up to par I'm still willing to write. Grammatical mistakes and spelling errors happen, we're all human but let's agree to try and keep it to a minimum. I prefer writing with someone that I can have casual conversations with, communication is an absolute must. I want someone I can build worlds and plots with, bounce ideas back and forth and the like. I am a patient writer, we're both allowed to have lives outside of the internet (since we're adults). That being said I do favor writing with someone I can usually expect 2-4 posts out of a day, but again this isn't a must. I have used various platforms when roleplaying but I have found I\u2019m most comfortable with discord and google docs, I\u2019m open to using email as well.\n\nAs a female, I feel most comfortable writing with women, but I\u2019m not against writing with men. When it comes to mature content or dark themes I\u2019m not against them, in fact, I love writing them. But these types of themes need to make sense or have been built up to. If there's ever something you do not want to write you\u2019re never obligated to do so. As a partner, if I ever suggest something or mention an idea that's not something you want to write, you\u2019re entirely free to say no.\n\nNot all interactions have to build towards a romantic relationship either, I\u2019m perfectly fine writing platonic things. I have experience writing m/f, m/m and f/f, if you\u2019re ever wanting to build to a relationship or something of that nature between our characters let me know so we can discuss it together. Most of my one on one roleplays do usually end up being romantic in nature, however. \n\nNow that all of that is out of the way, here are a few of the things I\u2019ve been wanting to explore. I do normally write male characters but lately, I have been wanting to write more female characters. If you would prefer I write a male character, that\u2019s fine but just know that lately, my motivation has been more biased towards female characters. Just because I don\u2019t list a character or ship below that you\u2019re interested in or maybe appreciate doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t get behind it if it\u2019s suggested to me. If you ever have something specific in mind just let me know. I\u2019m always open to new concepts.\n\nFandoms\n\n\nStar wars\n Characters I have experience writing: Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, Kylo Ren, Obi Wan, Anakin, Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron\n Ships: Finn/Poe, Rey/Poe, Finn/Rey, Obi-wan/Padme, Jyn Erso/Cassian Andor \nAdditional: I know a lot of people in this fandom ship Kylo Ren with Rey, I do not and there will be no convincing me to do so, I believe it\u2019s abusive and disgusting. There is no chemistry there. I have really been wanting to write Rey lately, but that\u2019s not an absolute must.\n\n\nA song of ice and fire \nCharacters I have experience writing: Arya Stark, Jon Snow, Lyanna Stark, Oberyn Martell, Jaime Lannister, Asha Greyjoy \nShips: Almost anything, I\u2019m a huge fan of plotting out arranged marriages in previous generations or even current ones and letting those organically play out.\n\nDC (primarily pre-new 52 knowledge base) Characters I have experience writing: Jason Todd, Harley Quinn, Dinah Lance\nShips: Almost anything you suggest if it\u2019s plotted a bit or organically built, I\u2019ll more than likely be interested in.\n\n\nSettings I\u2019m particularly interested in, currently are almost anything fantasy or urban fantasy based. I\u2019m fine with taking a world that\u2019s already been established and placing our own original characters in it together. I love dystopian themes, whether it be zombies or perhaps more mad Max based. I appreciate history based roleplays as well, anywhere within the last hundred years so. I don\u2019t mind modern themes as long as they\u2019re not too average \u201cslice of life,\u201d type things. While I do enjoy plots like that from time to time, I usually lose interest. Never the less, if you\u2019ve got an idea or anything you\u2019ve been wanting to do, feel free to send me a message. I look forward to hearing from anyone and everyone!",

My character notices strange behavior coming from your character, and soon makes the discovery that your character is a werewolf (a natural born one, not s made one). They get romantically involved, but the trouble starts when other werewolves find out that a human discovered their secret, and tries to demand your character kill mine. \n\nIt\u2019s not fully fleshed out, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nThis plot could possibly delve into some dark themes, so just be aware of that. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required(but welcome), but please be detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

A little about me and my roleplaying.\n\n* I am in college so usually am pretty quick about replying but sometimes there will be days when I am super busy or doing stuff with friends and won't reply. Also I sometimes go through stretches where I feel super down and might not reply. That being said 95% of the time I reply pretty quickly.\n* I am a semi-literate to literate RPer. My post length varies based on that of my partner usually I can match pretty well whatever the person I am doing the RP with is writing. Also if you want me to change something \n* Partners must be 18+ I never aim for anything intentionally that would require it but if the RP goes that direction I don't want to worry about it.\n* I prefer modern realistic RPs although I don't mind somewhat recent historical pretty much 1900-present I can maybe do\n* Major interests as far as material: medical, sports, war (more as a setting), combat (I really like RPing fights as well as the aftermath from it), romance, drama, slice of life and angst\n* I do ask that anybody I am playing with if you want me to change something or have suggestions for me to improve please do give them, I don't want someone silently steaming at me because I am doing something minor that can be easily corrected\n* I prefer discord but can also do PM\n* I can play either gender and am fine with any gender pairing \n* I can also play multiple characters\n* I also had an idea for an RP of some major event which is 1 on 1 but with each person playing many different characters\n* I need all main characters to be 18+ as well\n* I am open to plot suggestions and also feel free to look at my old prompts\n* I am a little weird also if you decide after a little while that your not interested in the RP just let me know that is fine but please don't just disappear.\n\nNow the prompt I thought up that I really like right now. It is written with the genders that I think fit best however I am open to changing up the genders of the characters. \n\n**Meeting Again**\n\nMuse A and B had been dating since the start of their sophomore year of college and now having just graduated were beginning to contemplate taking the next step in their relationship when the accident happened severely injuring B. Her family blamed Muse A for what had happened and told him that she never wanted to see him again despite the fact that she still loved him and needed him more than ever. Over the next few years neither of them could find someone else when chance would bring them back together although things were not the same as they were before.",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to DM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have. Firstly, a few important notes about me and what I'm looking for.\n\nI roleplay in first-person. Your choice in point-of-view doesn't matter to me at all, I'm fine with whatever you pick!\n\nI want you to be the DM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.\n\n**If any of the ideas below strike your interest, please send a PM to /u/LordDurand and we can discuss further. I will not reply to PMs sent to this account.**\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during or after the events of the anime, with my character being an OC who ends up joining the SOS Brigade. He could either be an ordinary human or not depending on what we decide and how you want the RP to play out. The RP could also take place in the Disappearance Universe if you wanted, with that version's Haruhi meeting up with and forming the SOS Brigade with my character.\n\n**KonoSuba**\n\nMy character would be a member of the Adventurer Guild in the world of KonoSuba, though he could either be a native there or end up there like Kazuma. The RP could be entirely OCs or have canon characters, though I'd prefer canon characters to be in it, whether on their own or with OCs sprinkled in (especially since I'm absolutely in love with Megumin).\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**\n\nThis would work best in a completely alternate Universe from any of the Parts, but versions of the canon characters could still appear. However, if you'd rather have it set in a canon Universe, or even during one of the Parts, that'd be fine too. For setting, I think either a school setting or some kind of grand adventure (like Parts 3 and 7) would work best, but I'm open to any ideas you may have.\n\n**Dragon Ball**\n\nThe idea I had for this one is actually heavily inspired by one of the Parts of JoJo. My idea is that, in the far-future of the main series (or in an alternate universe), the dragon balls become closely guarded to prevent anyone unworthy from making wishes. Each of the dragon balls is held by a Keeper. Every year, the Keepers set up a world-spanning event, where everyone is invited to participate. All participants gather at one place, at which point the locations of all seven Keepers is revealed to them. From then on, it's a race to not only reach the various Keepers, but to pass their tests in order to obtain their dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are taken from their Keepers, the location of a hidden shrine is revealed to everyone who has at least one of the dragon balls. The dragon balls only work when gathered together at this shrine, drawing all the holders to one spot for a final battle.\n\nI think this idea would be great in terms of character development. All characters would be working towards the goal of having their one wish granted while on a long journey, giving them plenty of time to develop. I'm thinking that before the race begins, some time can be spent showing the main characters training for it. Maybe they're training together, or maybe they're miles apart and only meet for the first time at the starting point of the race.\n\nIf you don't like that idea though, I'm open to any ideas of your own you may have.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody who's trying to regain his heart and, over time, remembers his past and why he lost his heart in the first place. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe. Of course, if you have other ideas, I'd love to hear them.\n\n**Star Wars**\n\nThis RP could be set before, during, or after any of the films, or in an alternate Universe. My character would be a Mandalorian bounty hunter who left his home planet to work as a bounty hunter while trying to find his lost, force-sensitive sister. Eventually, he's dragged into the Sith and Jedi conflict once he learns that both sides may know what happened to his sister.",

            "selftext": "At this point I prefer Discord due to actual logs/able to make servers specifically for an RP but I can do Steam too if one would prefer it.\n\nI'm looking for a high fantasy adventure RP of either fandom or original origin. Think action anime-level stuff like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on. The roleplays wouldn't be taking the storylines directly from those, but would rather draw inspiration from such titles. Characters facing long odds and dire situations with strong enemies with moments of explosive action and displays of power and at some point or another pulling out against the odds and getting that win. Not to say there can't be any temporary setbacking failures though. Since I have a bit of a thing for causing my characters certain problems from time to time. While I'm looking for over the top adventure scenes I prefer the focus to be on exploration and interaction with just plot driving conflicts littered in there but not being a total constant. Romance can happen too but I'm typically exclusive to F/F pairings and it'd take an overwhelmingly compelling partner for me to maybe bend my female character into being a male one or taking an interest in a male character. Either OOC gender is fine, what someone is IRL doesn't bug me as far as IC stuff goes. NSFW stuff at most for me is mostly gore/violence. Smut is only an option if the two characters are all lovey dovey/the plot justifies it. It's not even remotely my main interest.\n\nAs of late given a lack of people able to actually make a character for my original setting since it lacks the typical races and just has my own humanoids and \"rulings\" I've been leaning more towards fandom settings. Some I'd just throw/alter my original stuff OC into or use an OC built specifically for that setting. As far as what fandom settings I'm into from most to least it's: Pokemon (Trainers), Splatoon, My Hero Academia, DBZ, Legend of Zelda, Skullgirls and Shantae. So if you don't want to have to have a bunch of lore/info dumped on you to form a competent OC for my setting there's always this option. While I'm iffy on people playing canon characters since people usually bastardize them I can roll with a partner wanting to play as one from said settings if they want.\n\nAnyway I prefer the characters to heavily contrast both in personality and/or in their lives/lifestyles. My characters are usually on the low energy/deadpan end of the spectrum but without most of the negative tropes associated with that like anti-social edge.  So in turn I prefer more energetic, ambitious, maybe even bubbly partner characters, as long as it doesn't come off as utterly obnoxious anyway.  Generally someone that knows the buttons to press to get to see more than just the stone faced surface.\n\nI can range from 1-5 paragraphs depending on the scene and what's going on, sometimes dropping down to one lining if it becomes back and forth chatter for a bit.\n\nI'm also more of the type for \"cute\"/anime style characters/faceclaims rather than realistic/photographic ones. So I may not be entirely interested if that ain't your bag. But apart from that feel free to send me a PM and we'll see what we can do.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm DualDaggers and I'm looking for someone to write as a sophisticated and cultured international crime lord against my street-smart, sassy and scrappy female character. Think The Blacklist's Raymond Reddington meets Shameless' Fiona Gallagher.\n\nI'd like a long-term writing partner that is interested in plot, story progression and character development. Romance will play a large role in this story, but there will also be plenty of action and drama to go along with it. At least two to three detailed paragraphs per post is what I am aiming for and I'm open to writing over email, Google Docs, or Discord. I ask that any potential partners be over the age of 18 due to me being 21+ and the writing of graphic/adult themes being likely.\n\nYour character is a sophisticated and cultured international crime lord who has had a place on the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list for almost fifteen years. He's amassed an extensive criminal empire, dealing in counterintelligence, weapons trafficking, and other crimes against the US government - however, he has his own set of morals and doesn't dirty his hands with the trade of women, children, or drugs. He's been called a hedonist, enjoying all of life's pleasures, and is known for being charismatic, with a silver tongue. There are two things he has in overabundance, money and enemies. (Note: this is mostly an example of the type of character I'd like to write against and what I've outlined is not set in stone - just looking for a morally gray, sophisticated crime lord.)\n\nMy character is a mid-twenties street-smart, scrappy and sassy young woman. Her upbringing was rough and she's cared for her five younger siblings since her mother skipped town when she was fifteen. She's a hard worker and doesn't like handouts, and while she's extremely smart she hasn't had much of a chance to put her knowledge to good use. She has a talent for computers and considered a career as a software engineer before college became more of a dream than a reality. As a desperate teen she learned the fine arts of pick-pocketing and lock-picking, but has left such pursuits behind her. She's put her life on the back burner to raise her brothers and sister, and provide them with the best she can. Family is the most important thing in the world to her.\n\nShoot me a PM if you'd like to explore a relationship between these two characters. We can start either when they first meet, or after their relationship is already established. Hope to see some orange envelopes come my way!\n",

            "selftext": "Okay...let's try this again with some needed revising here and there.  Can probably slow down with my ads again after this one.  They also need to make titles editable so I can switch out tags on a whim and stuff.\n\nAt this point I prefer Discord due to actual logs/able to make servers specifically for an RP but I can do Steam too if one would prefer it.\n\nI'm looking for a high fantasy adventure RP of either fandom or original origin. Think action anime-level stuff like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on. The roleplays wouldn't be taking the storylines directly from those, but would rather draw inspiration from such titles. Characters facing long odds and dire situations with strong enemies with moments of explosive action and displays of power and at some point or another pulling out against the odds and getting that win. Not to say there can't be any temporary setbacking failures though. Since I have a bit of a thing for causing my characters certain problems from time to time. While I'm looking for over the top adventure scenes I prefer the focus to be on exploration and interaction with just plot driving conflicts littered in there but not being a total constant. Romance can happen too but I'm typically exclusive to F/F pairings and it'd take an overwhelmingly compelling partner for me to maybe bend my female character into being a male one or taking an interest in a male character. Either OOC gender is fine, what someone is IRL doesn't bug me as far as IC stuff goes.  NSFW stuff at most for me is mostly gore/violence.  Smut is only an option if the two characters are all lovey dovey/the plot justifies it.  It's not even remotely my main interest.\n\nAs of late given a lack of people able to actually make a character for my original setting since it lacks the typical races and just has my own humanoids and \"rulings\" I've been leaning more towards fandom settings.  Some I'd just throw/alter my original stuff OC into or use an OC built specifically for that setting.  As far as what fandom settings I'm into from most to least it's: Splatoon, Pokemon (Trainers), My Hero Academia, DBZ, Legend of Zelda, Skullgirls and Shantae.  So if you don't want to have to have a bunch of lore/info dumped on you to form a competent OC for my setting there's always this option.  While I'm iffy on people playing canon characters since people usually bastardize them I can roll with a partner wanting to play as one from said settings if they want.\n\nAnyway I prefer the characters to heavily contrast both in personality and/or in their lives/lifestyles. But that's best detailed in an actual PM so I don't take up space here.\n\nI can range from 1-5 paragraphs depending on the scene and what's going on, sometimes dropping down to one lining if it becomes back and forth chatter for a bit.\n\nI'm also more of the type for \"cute\"/anime style characters/faceclaims rather than realistic/photographic ones. So I may not be entirely interested if that ain't your bag. But apart from that feel free to send me a PM and we'll see what we can do.",
