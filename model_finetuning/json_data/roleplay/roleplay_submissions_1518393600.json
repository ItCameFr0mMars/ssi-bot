            "selftext": "**Hey /roleplay!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\n&gt; I am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\n&gt; I don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n&gt; When it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. If you prefer a different platform I can possibly try it. Please note that email is often a last resort for me.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\n&gt; Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n&gt; This is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* The Witcher\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n* And more!\n\n**World Building**\n&gt; I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

As you may have guessed from the post, I'm looking for a long-term roleplay partner.\nHere's some things you need to know before contacting me:\n\n* **Age:**I'm 23, so it is a **must** that you are 18+, and preferably 20+\n\n* **Timezone:** I'm in EST, but I'm up at all kinds of crazy hours, so don't worry about me not replying because of timezones. Note: I do still sleep. Sometimes. \n\n* **How often I reply:** I literally have nothing to do all day, so I'll reply as often as you do, without hesitation. \n\n* **Preferred contact:** I prefer initial contact through a Reddit DM, then we can either move to Discord, or email, depending on your preference. \n\n* **Length:** I match my partner, but I prefer longer, 1-3 paragraph posts. \n\n* **Writing style:** 3rd person, past tense. \n\n* **About the Writing:** I really love romance and plot building, but I'm not opposed to smut that makes sense. I prefer M/F pairings, but I don't care who I'm writing. You *may* be able to talk me into a M/M or F/F if I really like the characters. That leads me to my next point...\n\n* **Character Preferences:** I really *really* love Draco, Hermione (Dramione usually), Sirius, Remus, and just the general Marauders Era. I prefer Marauders or post-Hogwarts in the main timeline. I have written some Next Gen, and I prefer Scorpius Malfoy in that cast of characters. Let me know if you have any others you'd like to explore or play with, I'm open to suggestion! \n\nI think I've rambled on enough, so let me know if you'd like to know more!\n\n",

I\u2019m currently looking for: A Vanitas roleplayer, Sora roleplayer, or Soranort roleplayer.\n\n&gt;-Important Notes: I\u2019m looking for those who are accepting of a demon OC. Rebellious and defiant, especially to those who are strangers. I have a full reference image for her, Kingdom Hearts based information, and some rather risqu\u00e9 information IF NEEDED.\n\n&gt;-I\u2019m looking for non-weak versions of the characters as well, aka Dependent. My character will not be there to hold your character-of-choice\u2019s hand.\n\n&gt;-Please ask for my character\u2019s information before messaging me.

            "selftext": "\nA BIT ABOUT ME:\nI'm 23 y/o female, I would consider myself a proto-expert writer. I'm happy to play both male and female characters and I am open to a relationship if the story moves that way. Post length for me depend on what fits with the story,I'd be happy with 2-3 paragraphs to 5-7; no one word/sentence replies please. I am new to this format but not to roleplay as a whole. \n\nWHAT I'M LOOKING FOR :\nI'm looking for a partner who is happy and willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. I want these character to eventually care for one another over time. Someone who isn't afraid to move the story along and create plot twists without warning.\n\nTHEMES:\nTheme and genre wise. I'm looking for the roleplay to go into some dark themes(E.g. blood and gore), plus a probable romantic element which means players 18+ is a must. Action,crime,fantasy....etc. I'm also a fan of the father/daughter relationship (Logan,The last of us,Telltales the walking dead) ,so if that's a possibly, great. \n\nYOUR CHARACTERS:\nFor your character. It mostly up to you. Each one of my prompt have some gender limits due to story reason but others are open. I'm a big fan of unique characters that aren't just a cookie cutter version of every other character. Another point is that I'm more then happy for doubling but, me personal isn't that versed with it. Face claims are also welcome, I will be using them with my characters.\n\nPROMPTS:\nI have four prompt ideas that I'd like to play out. They are open to being altered. If any of the ideas don't appeal to you; I'd be happy to hear any prompts you may have.\n\nNow I do have characters set out for most of the prompts which I'm more then willing to share once we get to chatting.\n\n\nPost apocalyptic prompt [M/F]:\n\nI'm looking for a story revolving a apocalyptic scenario where humanity had fallen to a unknown parasitic spore that turns human into monstrous creatures (similar to 'the last of us').The government tried everything; biotech (this comes into play with my character), genetic engineering, animal testing, nothing seemed to work. The last surviving groups live primarily in military run safe zone scattered across America. All residents are tagged and have to undergo strict quarantine procedures to maintain a health balance. \n\nAnyone who living outside the safe zones have to fend for themselves, or join the ravengers; a well-known faction that only looks out for there own and have a tendency for bringing violent and death wherever they go.\n\nThe roleplay takes place ten years after the outbreak and follows your character (You have creative freedom over your character) possible lives in one such safe zone. (I'm not going to plan this part in detail as I'd like your input with ideas). \n\nMy character is a bit out there. He is a prototype Android (humanoid in appearance) that the government tried to build to combat the outbreak. He was only in the early stages before he was scrapped. He somehow made it out and lives in solitude out beyond the safe zone.\n(I am willing to play a actual human if you wish but would prefer the unique option) \n\nI know it isn't the usual partnership in a zombie apocalypse, a robot man and (Insert your character here) but that's what I wanted. Something different and unique. I do love the father/daughter relationships that are commonly well portrayed in the post apocalyptic theme, so maybe we could go that route.\n\nPre apocalyptic prompt [F/M&amp;F]: \n\nSo the ideas for this one is that the roleplay starts just before the apocalypse (probably zombie virus) with our character possibly not knowing each other before hand. When thing go south...our characters meet up and decided willingly or not to stick together. The roleplay from there is us surviving and exploring what's left. This idea opens up for any character really; Doctor to student, homeless person to cop and anything in between.\n\nModern mystery prompt [M&amp;F/M&amp;F]:\n\nI was think-and this may be a bit vague-that it could be set in a small American town. A series of unusual/tragic event take place (Something like a string of missing persons reports or a series of brutal murders or even sightings of a strange creature in the woods). My character; a brash and hotheaded private detective has been task by someone involved to look into these strange event. You character is up to you. Are they involved with the strange events, maybe your the cause or maybe one of your friends/family members fell victim to the events and your doing some investigating of your own; its up to you. The idea is barebones at the moment but thats what a partner is for, to spit ball with.\n\nSuperhero/vigilante prompt [M&amp;F/M&amp;F]:\n\nA simple superhero/vigilante concept. One or even both of us are vigilante that have been brought together for a similar cause. I'm thinking to keep it street level based. This is the least planned out of the prompts which leaves a lot to build apon. I'm even happy to set it in the Marvel comics or Dc universe's as I have a few go to characters that I think will work well. \n\n\nThanks for making it this far. If any of the prompts and ideas stand out to you. Feel free to send me a message. Could you included a bit about yourself and what sort of thing you'd like to include (If you have a character idea already, send that over as well; only if you have it of course)\n\nHope to hear from you all soon:)\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello r/roleplay. After spending a while lurking and responding to a sliver of posts I decided to stick my toe in the pool so to speak, post and hopefully find a few people interested in roleplaying with me. First a bit about myself. I\u2019m 29, reside within the Eastern Standard timezone and have been roleplaying for well over a decade. I love utilizing my imagination and creative spirit into a story we can both enjoy. I\u2019m flexible in the types and genders of the characters I play as well as the themes of roleplay I enjoy.\n\nI have a ton of experience in slice of life, romantic, X-Men. Game of Thrones. Harry Potter roleplays as well as criminal syndicates, historical re-enactment scenes and just about anything else under the sun. While I enjoy playing using established universes I rarely stick exactly to canon and find it dull to do so. I love developing roles that we both enjoy and playing them out in the direction that either of us desire. All I ask is that my partner has an idea of the type of characters and roles they'd like to play. \n\nApathy doesn't lend to great roleplay in my experience. Also I will be forthright in saying that sex doesn\u2019t tend to be the focus of my stories however it does have its place in well progressed scenes. Being that my scenes tend to lean towards the mature I\u2019d prefer all potential partners be at least 21+. If my lack of desire to rush into heavy sexual detail is a dealbreaker for you then I\u2019m probably not your girl. \n\nIn terms of availability I\u2019m around most afternoons and early evenings for chat and prefer to play via discord, google hangouts or e-mail. I keep my responses somewhere between 4 to 9 paragraphs depending on the scene and tend to be detailed in my writings. Someone who feels capable of matching that would probably be the best match for me. I also have a regular life and relationships outside of roleplaying so there will be times periodically that I won\u2019t be able to play however I\u2019ll always let you know before I go no contact. Anywho if this ad interests you feel free to message or reddit chat me to speak further or exchange contact details. If this ad is still up regardless of it\u2019s age I\u2019m still seeking new partners.",

            "selftext": "[Discord] Hello adventurer! Have you ever dreamed about venturing around the world fighting monsters and demons? Maybe you'd like to be a villain and cause chaos and mayhem? Well then, I think I have a place just for you fellow adventurer. Tale of Hope &amp; War, a place where you can make your own story. Hello! my name is Xeno, co-founder and developer of a dice-based roleplay called Tale of Hope &amp; War. Tale of Hope &amp; War is a roleplay set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world, where only a few cities have survived and mobilized the cities themselves. We offer a unique system that consists of traits, skilltrees and items with unique abilities. Lore-wise the world of Tale of Hope &amp; War is riddled with corruption from the gods, who have tried to invade the corporeal plane to obtain artifacts left behind by the elder gods, objects of immense power. Sadly these artifacts are also what keeps the world alive. So in order to survive mankind and other species have to become strong, strong enough to fend off the avatars of gods and perhaps the very gods themselves. For a god stepping into the corporeal plane is the cause of cataclysm. If you wish to join us please feel free to take a look, we're always happy for new players to join! Come on down and join us as we tell you a Tale of Hope &amp; War! https://discord.gg/uUx6Q7Y",

            "selftext": "Once again I'm on the prowl for some good roleplays! I've currently got a lot of my own ideas going so I'd love it if you had some ideas to pitch when you message me. I'm really into anything Fantasy related. Medieval, modern, futuristic, apocalyptic. If it's got fantasy attached then I am down. This doesn't mean I'm not up for something else though, if the idea intrigues me when I'd love to try it. So don't be afraid to throw other ideas at me. The only thing I won't do is fandom. I'd rather everything be OC. If you wanna play a fandom character in our original world then go for it but I'll be playing OC and our world will be OC. \n\nSo, besides that id like my partner to be 18+. I do love some good nsfw stuff in my roleplays, though it certainly won't be the center and will come naturally along the way. I like plot and story over everything else. Id also like this to be 3rd person past tense as that's what I'm most comfortable in. I consider myself literate, I've been role-playing for 10+ years but I don't mind if you aren't. As long as you give me more then a sentence and I can understand what you've written then we'll be good to go. Another note is that I'm on quite frequently so I'd like my partner to be as well. At least one post a day would be great. I get life happens though, just let me know if something comes up and you'll be gone for an extended time. \n\nI think that's about it! If you've made it this far feel free to PM me! Thanks. =)",

I love building worlds, love fantasy and making some oc that over time grows and learns; becoming a super badass. I like little bits of romance and drama, tension and strong development. I am all for NSFW not the focus of course but more than willing. I like doing multiple npcs between the two of us to have the world feel bigger. You must be able to rp independently without to much help, unless its questions about the world. Im looking for a long term rp, so try to be available on a semi regular bases. Now for the world I been developing for awhile....Laruna. \n\nBefore all things, there was a single entity - the Elder God. Older than time, it grew weary of the nothingness that was the universe and chose instead to dream. Brilliant colors, life and death, and all manner of wonders sprung to life, pleasing the Elder God. While it dreamed, there was no shortage of majesty or splendor in the universe. When it woke, all that it had created would vanish, returning to the ether of its mind. The Elder God was displeased with this. Tired of this process, the Elder God returned to his dreams with the intent of capturing his favorite creations and bringing them over to the place he knew when he was awake. Once there, these slivers of dream would be shaped into children. They would fill the space with their gifts and tend to the Elder God as it slept. Six wonders were given shape. The Young Gods would watch over the Elder and marvel at the magnificent things it would dream. There in the dreams they could see an enchanting land and wondered how they might experience it. Vayne, the voice, taught them how they could work together and catch this dream. They crafted a globe, a dreamcatcher, and crowded round the Elder\u2019s bed and stole from him a dream\u2014a land they named Laruna. THE AGE OF PURITY The Land of Laurna\u2019s history began when the young gods secured it safely in the dreamcatcher. For historians, this marks the beginning of the First Age. During this time, the Young Gods are said to have watched the land in wonder, marveling at the amazing things they witnessed. Though no one can be sure how long this lasted, it remains a favored topic of sages and bards alike. Laruna was pure, untouched by the Young Gods and a paradise without equal. It is said that there are dragons and unknown creatures beneath the sea who can still recall the splendor of the First Age, but it has mostly passed into myth. ( I have each age written up but that\u2019s to much detail for an introduction.)\n\nWhat is legacy? In Dreamscape: Laruna, we take on the role of people who have inherited a special kind of magic called Legacy. This extraordinary magic power was the byproduct of a mad wizard\u2019s quest for godhood. Fortunately for the people of Laruna, the wizard Alshara was stopped by his apprentice Forenon. Afterward, Alshara\u2019s stolen god-magic was crudely thrust back into the land and now random people across Laruna are being born with a fraction of this power. Inheriting great power is only the beginning for the role players of Laruna. This power manifests in specific ways, mimicking the tendencies of the many heroes who once wielded it in the past.\n\nI have countries, factions, all the types of magic, races, there relationships; everything we need. Just send a private msg and we can chat if it\u2019s good for you =^ ",

It is about a bunch of badass half incubus men who are part of a secret military society of monster hunters tasked with preserving the veil that keeps the supernatural world hidden from humans.\n\nI'm looking to add maybe one or two extra players, keep in mind this is a serious RP game with story and character progression and 'adventuring'... but it is heavy with adult themes and we do roleplay the dirty details.\n\nThe format of the game is kind of 24/7... we have a private IRC chat server we hang out in and whenever people feel like playing they can just drop in and play. \n\nIf this is something you feel might interest you, drop me a line! \n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am writing this to seek out one new writing partner. I have embarked on the long and arduous journey towards a PhD, which will limit my availability considerably. But fearot, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nI'd like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. I would also love a Dragon Age Inquisition plot. I'm no expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed the game.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",

            "selftext": "Firstly thank you for taking the time to check out my post . I have been role playing for roughly fifteen years so I like to think I have some \" skill ' when it comes to descriptive play :P. I para as a minimal and mainly multi-para , I like descriptive and imaginative posts. So please don't message me if you intend on one lining, one lining in my opinion is pointless .\n\nI'd like my partner to be involved in adding to the story it's much more fun if it isn't just one person leading :). And please be descriptive! Role play is all about imagination after all right?.\n\nI have indulged as many of you would probably guess in every aspect , eras and styles of role play; from fantasy/ action to adventure/sci-fi to slice of life. Nothing is of limits with me as long as it's enjoyable/fun and interesting :). I do tend to stick to mainly the modern era as i feel more comfortable with it but I'm happy to dive into other settings with the right Story line :).\n\nCharacter development and long term is preferred I like to build a good story :). Romance is something that tends to be included in all my role plays and honestly I Like it that way. Romance I find adds a real good element to any role play :) there for NSFW content will more then likely be apart of it hence the 18+.\n\nI'm really into action/romance at the moment so happy to hear any ideas you might have :). \n\nPlease message me if your interested in starting something up with me, we can discuss and brain storm an idea together :). I typically role play on email or discord Look forward to hearing from you soon :)\n",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Merry, and I'm so pleased that you've stopped in to check out my thread. I'll start off by telling you just a bit about me. I'm 26, a recent college graduate with two bachelor's degrees: one in English literature and the other in education. I've been co-writing with others for over a decade now and have recently been fortunate enough to be able to return to the hobby after a lengthy hiatus.\n\n\nI write exclusively\u200b in the **third-person** perspective, **past tense**. My main characters are always women, but I'm quite capable of playing a wide variety of characters of any type to support the plot and fill our world. I don't care whether my writing partner is male or female, but I'm only looking for stories with a little bit of *good* organic **romance** that will be just one facet of a hopefully-complex story, so I'm looking for someone with an interesting male character. \n\nMy responses *will be* **lengthy**, and as a result I can't write a dozen posts a day, which is why I'm looking for long-term partners only. This comes with the  understanding that I'll typically only respond **once a day** at the most due to life, work, and so on. I'm generally always available ooc though, and I'm a pretty laid-back\u200b and friendly person. Making friends is part of the fun, but it's not at all a requirement. I'd like a decently sociable partner with a creative mind, who's able to help carry a plot. I want someone who can give me quality and quantity. Potential partners should be **over 21** years of age. If you're easily offended, we'd likely not be a good match. You can probably expect cursing, violence, gore, and other things of a generally dark nature from my writing. I like stories that have a certain amount of action and grit--not too sunshine-and-roses, you know?\n\n\nI only use **Google Docs** because it archives the entire story without quoting or clipping, is editable in real time from all my devices, both writers have immediate access, and it's nice and tidy-looking. For planning and **ooc**, I'm happy to use discord, email, pm, or kik. Initially it would be best to send me a private message rather than to comment in this thread, but feel free to do so if you have any questions or if you're interested in chatting about genres. Happy hunting!\n\n**I'm into...**\n\nWar\n\nAction\n\nWestern/Frontier\n\nHistorical Fiction\n\nSupernatural\n\nHorror\n\nZombies\n\nSurvival\n\nFantasy/High Fantasy\n\nSlice of Life\n\nSpace\n\nApocalypse\n\nFuturistic\n\nDystopian\n\nI'd love to hear your ideas, too. Craving something you don't see mentioned here? Ask me! I have a really broad range of interests. As a warning, I'm not comfortable with most fandoms so I'll typically decline those. Hope to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "A BIT ABOUT ME:\nI'm 23 y/o female, I would consider myself a proto-expert writer. I'm happy to play both male and female characters and I am open to a relationship if the story moves that way. Post length for me depend on what fits with the story,I'd be happy with 2-3 paragraphs to 5-7; no one word/sentence replies please. I am new to this format but not to roleplay as a whole. \n\nWHAT I'M LOOKING FOR :\nI'm looking for a partner who is happy and willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. I want these character to eventually care for one another over time. Someone who isn't afraid to move the story along and create plot twists without warning.\n\nTHEMES:\nTheme and genre wise. I'm looking for the roleplay to go into some dark themes(E.g. blood and gore), plus a probable romantic element which means players 18+ is a must. Action,crime,fantasy....etc. I'm also a fan of the father/daughter relationship (Logan,The last of us,Telltales the walking dead) ,so if that's a possibly, great. \n\nYOUR CHARACTERS:\nFor your character. It mostly up to you. Each one of my prompt have some gender limits due to story reason but others are open. I'm a big fan of unique characters that aren't just a cookie cutter version of every other character. Another point is that I'm more then happy for doubling but, me personal isn't that versed with it. Face claims are also welcome, I will be using them with my characters.\n\nPROMPTS:\nI have four prompt ideas that I'd like to play out. They are open to being altered. \n\n**If any of the ideas don't appeal to you; I'd be happy to hear any prompts you may have**\n\nNow I do have characters set out for most of the prompts which I'm more then willing to share once we get to chatting.\n\n\nPost apocalyptic prompt [M/F]:\n\nI'm looking for a story revolving a apocalyptic scenario where humanity had fallen to a unknown parasitic spore that turns human into monstrous creatures (similar to 'the last of us').The government tried everything; biotech (this comes into play with my character), genetic engineering, animal testing, nothing seemed to work. The last surviving groups live primarily in military run safe zone scattered across America. All residents are tagged and have to undergo strict quarantine procedures to maintain a health balance. \n\nAnyone who living outside the safe zones have to fend for themselves, or join the ravengers; a well-known faction that only looks out for there own and have a tendency for bringing violent and death wherever they go.\n\nThe roleplay takes place ten years after the outbreak and follows your character (You have creative freedom over your character) possible lives in one such safe zone. (I'm not going to plan this part in detail as I'd like your input with ideas). \n\nMy character is a bit out there. He is a prototype Android (humanoid in appearance) that the government tried to build to combat the outbreak. He was only in the early stages before he was scrapped. He somehow made it out and lives in solitude out beyond the safe zone.\n(I am willing to play a actual human if you wish but would prefer the unique option) \n\nI know it isn't the usual partnership in a zombie apocalypse, a robot man and (Insert your character here) but that's what I wanted. Something different and unique. I do love the father/daughter relationships that are commonly well portrayed in the post apocalyptic theme, so maybe we could go that route.\n\nPre apocalyptic prompt [F/M&amp;F]: \n\nSo the ideas for this one is that the roleplay starts just before the apocalypse (probably zombie virus) with our character possibly not knowing each other before hand. When thing go south...our characters meet up and decided willingly or not to stick together. The roleplay from there is us surviving and exploring what's left. This idea opens up for any character really; Doctor to student, homeless person to cop and anything in between.\n\nModern mystery prompt [M&amp;F/M&amp;F]:\n\nI was think-and this may be a bit vague-that it could be set in a small American town. A series of unusual/tragic event take place (Something like a string of missing persons reports or a series of brutal murders or even sightings of a strange creature in the woods). My character; a brash and hotheaded private detective has been task by someone involved to look into these strange event. You character is up to you. Are they involved with the strange events, maybe your the cause or maybe one of your friends/family members fell victim to the events and your doing some investigating of your own; its up to you. The idea is barebones at the moment but thats what a partner is for, to spit ball with.\n\nSuperhero/vigilante prompt [M&amp;F/M&amp;F]:\n\nA simple superhero/vigilante concept. One or even both of us are vigilante that have been brought together for a similar cause. I'm thinking to keep it street level based. This is the least planned out of the prompts which leaves a lot to build apon. I'm even happy to set it in the Marvel comics or Dc universe's as I have a few go to characters that I think will work well. \n\n\nThanks for making it this far. If any of the prompts and ideas stand out to you. Feel free to send me a message. Could you included a bit about yourself and what sort of thing you'd like to include (If you have a character idea already, send that over as well; only if you have it of course)\n\nHope to hear from you all soon:)\n",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI'm looking for role play partners interested in fandom and original concepts!\n\nI have been role playing since I was about 11. Role playing is a hobby and a passion for me. I love replaying at least once a day, including rich insight into my character's thoughts and feelings. I prefer to role play via email and can use some instant messaging service for OOC. As I like to flesh out every character with virtue and sin and quirks, I tend to need about one to three paragraphs to be able to express it. I prefer to write in third person and tend to gravitate to past tense, though the tense is rather irrelevant and will adjust to your preference. As for the relationships, I am happy with any sort of pairing, I love it all and will play any orientation and any preference. I also love to include NSFW scenes in a good role play. As for the characters, I love playing both OC's and canon.\n\nThis time, I have a couple ideas for plots!\n\n**Skyrim: Gallus and Karliah**\nEver wondered how things were for them during their good times? With the guild thriving and their relationship growing? I can play either, we could come up with adventurous plots for them.\n\n**Original: Superhero mess**\nImagined it as M/M. I'd play a rich boy who is not looking forward to following his dad's steps at the head of a large company. He grew up with your character, a super smart (a bit paranoid) and super careful. They're on a vacation trip, some exotic location, doing some incredibly dangerous extreme sport. My character is involved in a horrible accident and appears to be dead for a moment before he rolls over and gets up. Turns out he can regenerate and soon they learn he's also developing super strength and speed, but it comes with a catch. Your character designs gear to avoid that disadvantage while mine goes on his merry way, eradicating crime from their city. \n\nWould you like something different? These are my fandoms:\n\n* Assassins' Creed.\n\n* Mass Effect.\n\n* The Witcher. (Books and games.)\n\n* Star Trek.\n\n* Far Cry.\n\n* Horizon: Zero Dawn.\n\n* Fallout.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls.\n\n* Red Dead Redemption.\n\n* Uncharted.\n\n* Grand Theft Auto.\n\n* Halo.\n\n* Infamous.\n\n* Harry Potter.\n\n* ATLA.\n\n* Death Note.\n\n* Yaoi in general.\n\n* (New to) DC Comics.\n\n* Rurouni Kenshin. (A classic and one of my favorite manga)\n\nAs for the originals, if you have an idea in mind, these are the genres I like to play:\n\n* Fantasy.\n\n* Sci Fi.\n\n* (Pseudo-) Historic.\n\n* Crime. (Bank robbers, thieves for hire, etc.)\n\n* Western.\n\n* Slice of Life.\n\n* Horror/Supernatural.\n\n\nIf you read this far, thank you!\n\nPlease, do message me if you are interested to see if we can click into a great partnership! I'm eager to hear about your ideas!",

            "selftext": "Looking for a Naruto RP community on reddit? Then look no farther than /r/TheNarutoWorld!\n\n---\n\nIt\u2019s a period of uncertainty and wariness among the ninja villages. For a time it appeared the villages might actually enter a period of relative peace, especially after they came together at a Kage Summit to discuss the formation of a coalition and the reappearance of the tailed beasts in the world. But when the village forces met in a united coalition in the Sound, two of the villages initiated a shocking double cross against a third, Kiri. And what\u2019s more, Kiri had been expecting this and dealt a crushing defeat against the attackers. \n\nWhile the war and tensions between those three villages simmers and results in covert missions and sabotage, Kumo continues its attempts to govern, reform, and rebuild the Land of Sound. Yet within that country elements are rising up in rebellion and threatening to destabilize the country once more, and undo the hard work of the Shinobi Coalition. And in all of this, the reappearance of the tailed beasts appears to be overlooked, as more pressing matters plague each village. \n\nMany new leaders are trying their hand at resolving these conflicts, and the next generation of ninja will surely influence what happens next and what the state of the world will be like. What will happen next, now that war has been declared? Responses of each village are constantly evolving and plans are being hatched all the time... how will *you* choose to affect these events?\n\nWill you join others in Konoha under the Will of Fire and fight for your village? Or maybe the way of the sword in Kiri speaks more to you? Join in the reconstruction efforts led by Kumo in the Land of Sound maybe, if the role of peacekeeper and rebuilder speaks to you. Then again, maybe the way of the wanderer will allow you to reach your destiny.\n\n---\n\nCreate your own character to set out to fulfill their own goals and dreams along side other players! We've got a customized and open system with plenty of room for creativity and fun. Our system is well balanced and designed with lots of influence from popular pen and paper RPG games, but enough flexibility to let you have fun RPing without constantly worrying about numbers. RP is similarly flexible and occurs both forum-style and in real-time. \n\nFor more information on getting started, and the basics of our RP group, come on over and check out [our sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNarutoWorld/). With a friendly group of players, helpful mods, and an OOC Discord community there is plenty for everyone and people more than willing to get you set up and kicking some ninja butt in no time! \n\nHead on over to /r/TheNarutoWorld and start down your ninja path!\n",

            "selftext": "Hello, I\u2019m looking for people who would want to do a plot-driven, very minimal romance, modern fantasy roleplay. I have some characters that I really want to use and I would love to find someone who would want to interact with these characters as well as build a story/plot with me. I tend to ramble so I\u2019m just going to write a very basic summary of my characters.\n\n-1st character is a nomadic witch traveling with her grandfather trying to build a business on top of dealing with some trauma. The trauma is affecting her magic as well as her personality. The situation kinda changes depending on the roleplay. The trauma comes from an attack from another supernatural creature (again depending on the roleplay) that she\u2019s grown a nasty contempt for ever since. \n\n-2nd character is another nomadic person but they go to different towns to find someone who can help cure their \u201ccondition\u201d. Basically they\u2019re a highly sensitive medium that involuntary opens their consciousness to any roaming spirits to use as a vessel. So basically someone who has short bouts of explosive/erratic/unusual behavior due to shortly timed possessions they can\u2019t control.\n\n-3rd character A morally ambiguous shapeshifter who can turn into anybody she has met in her life. \n\n-4th character A Japanese woman looking for a deity that helped her escape a near death experience \n\n-5th character A werewolf who is also a cop.\n\nI have potential plots for some of these characters and with the others I really have no direction. These are characters I really want to play so if you pm me with interest in interacting with these characters, let me know if you have any oc\u2019s you\u2019d want to use. We can do some world building or focus on making a conflict. I just want to do a good quality fun roleplay with a lot of drama and possibly ass kicking, ya feel? \n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nI'm looking for a dedicated partner for a post apocalyptic themed roleplay along the lines of the last of us. I have the plot idea below that gives you a bit of background on the story. \n\nA BIT ABOUT ME:\n\nI'm 23 y/o female, I would consider myself a proto-expert writer. \u00a0Post length for me depend on what fits with the story,I'd be happy with 2-3 paragraphs to 5-7; no one word/sentence replies please. I am new to this format but not to roleplay as a whole.\n\nSTORY:\n\nhumanity had fallen to a unknown parasitic spore that turns human into monstrous creatures (similar to 'the last of us'). Not much is truly know about where this virus came from or what the government's true goal where to combat it, only that it didn't work. They set up military run safe zones scattered across America. All residents are tagged and have to undergo strict quarantine procedures to maintain a health balance. (These quarantine zones are set up in the larger cities). Any known infected are shot on site.\n\nAnyone who living outside the safe zones have to fend for themselves, or join the ravagers; a well-known faction that only looks out for there own and have a tendency for bringing violent and death wherever they go. The ravagers are similar to a cult, using the virus as a excuse to provide their own style of leadership.\n\nThe roleplay takes place 15 years after the outbreak and follows both our characters as they are forced to work together to survive. (We can discuss details and such)\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nFor characters I'm looking for a M/F partnership but like in the last of us I'm hoping to go more down the route of grizzled old man/young teenage girl scenario as I feel it opens up more emotion and uniqueness to the story. I do love the father/daughter relationships that are commonly well portrayed in the post apocalyptic theme E.g. Logan, telltale's the walking dead. Everything else about your character is your own chose. Face claims are also welcome, I will be using them with my characters.\n\n\nI'm happy to play either the grizzled male character or the teenage female character. I have bios and samples for both.\n\nLOOKING FOR IN A PARTNER:\n\nI'm looking for a partner who is happy and willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. I want these character to eventually care for one another over time. Someone who isn't afraid to move the story along and create plot twists without warning. Players 18+ is a must. I want someone that is as excited to explore the world and characters as I am.\n\nTHEMES:\n\nTheme and genre wise. I'm looking for the roleplay to go into some dark themes(E.g. blood and gore) which is a must in a post apocalypse setting. players 18+ is a must. As I mentioned earlier, I'm also a fan of the father/daughter relationship (Logan,The last of us,Telltale's the walking dead) that a must with the story I'm planning. Other themes are more than welcome but romance is off the table as that would be weird. Definitely a relationship between the characters but no romance. Thrills and action are a given as well.\n\n\n\nThanks for making it this far. If \u00a0your interested with the idea ,feel free to send me a message. Could you included a bit about yourself and what sort of thing you'd like to include (If you have a character idea already, send that over as well; only if you have it of course)\n\nHope to hear from you all soon:)",

I am going to try and make this post as simple as I can and hopefully, it won't turn out to be too overwhelming to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, to start off, I am looking for a romantic sort of roleplay. Not all romance but I would like it to be one of the main focuses of the plot itself. It can be between either be straight or gay.That being said, I will play a male or female character in straight if you would prefer that but I will not play a commanding female or one that's in charge of the relationship. When it comes to a gay roleplay with two males, I will play either the one in charge or the sub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you ask \"What do you like to roleplay?\" or something similar, I will respond with \"A lot of things.\". Give me specific questions so I don't have to put everything I like into one response. You could mean a lot of things. Pairings, genres, settings, times, personalities, backgrounds, side characters... Just specify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to get on my good side, then tell me what you like as well! I mainly want to know what you like in pairings, genres, and settings but the other things can be listed as well if you would like. I don't require any of that in the very beginning but know that it is inevitable for me to ask what you like when it comes to those three items. Haha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI prefer realistic roleplays but I will do fantasy ones as long as it isn't something like Lord of the Rings. That is just an example for a world since I will not do fandom based roleplays. I will only do original worlds or characters that we make ourselves. If you have gotten this far, welcome! I hope to be receiving a PM from you soon that will include your Discord account so I can message you there and make this whole process a lot easier.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions at all, then please state them in the PM or wait until we get to Discord!! Hopefully, I'll talk to you soon!",

            "selftext": "\u201cLong ago, legions of monsterous creatures called Kaiju arose from the sea, bringing with them all-consuming war. To fight the Kaiju, mankind developed giant robots called Jaegers, designed to be piloted by two humans locked together in a neural bridge. However, even the Jaegers are not enough to defeat the Kaiju, and humanity is on the verge of defeat. Mankind\u2019s last hope now lies in the hand a group of experimental pilots in new modeled Jaegers. This group is known as \u00dcbermenschen and the ability they have within their arsenal is game changing.\u201d\n\nThe year is 2045 and the world is in complete ruin from the relentless and strategic attack from the Kaiju. It has been 45 years since the last Kaiju uprising where Ragnarok and Sleipnir; two prototype model Jaegers designed to \u201cevolve\u201d in combat against a Kaiju closed the hellish portal from whence the creatures came. It was believed to be a major victory for mankind. But what the world didn\u2019t know was sacrifices had to be made to achieve such an unforeseeable victory; a sacrifice humanity couldn\u2019t afford to take.\n\n45 years later and the portal reopens by unknown means. Mankind is rebuilding, reforming, and standing together. But the Jaeger Program never ceased and production continued as planned. The Kaiju attacked with tactics and skills never before seen. Settlements fell to brimstone raining from the sky, and vital Shatterdome Headquarters sunk to coordinated attacks. In a matter of months, only 50 Jaegers remained with only three Shatterdomes still operational.\n\nBut humanity stood steadfast; The  \u00dcbermenschen Program swung into effect yet again. Jaeger Pilots with modified DNA charging head first into combat. The remaining government could no longer keep this program a secret. The world knew it was time to fight monsters with monsters; Kaiju with Kaiju. \n\nThis story takes place in one of the three remaining Shatterdomes. In the Pacific Northwest; located deep within the base of Mountain Rainier. This is where a handful of the best and \u201csuccessful\u201d \u00dcbermenschen lie; waiting for their turn to fight for mankind once again.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nThis is a prompt based of Pacific Rim, Kong Skull Island, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Rampage, and any other \u201cgiant monster/epic mech\u201d media one can think of. This story is about a male and female pilot fighting godly beasts and trying to solve the mystery in how these monsters came back.\n\nI will be playing as a pesudo Game-Master, so certain player choices will have impact on this ever growing world. There will be adventure, character growth, and other adult themes. If one is into world building and epic story-telling, then this prompt will be for you. But also, if one happens to be looking for Something along the lines of NSFW this prompt is also for them too. So if you\u2019re one of those people and  managed to read all this and like what you see, below will be my contact information if the board I\u2019m posting this on allows it, if not a PM here on reddit will do just fine. So hit me up and let\u2019s brainstorm some ideas, build characters, and get immersed in some good monsters slaying action.\n\n:]",

            "selftext": "Have you heard of Aokigahara, the Sea of Trees? It is a forest in the Northwestern Mount Fuji area in Japan, where trees sprout from twelve square miles of hardened lava from Fuji\u2019s last eruption in 1707. Incidentally, it also has a reputation as being a home for ghosts and has become a ritualistic site for suicide. Signs litter the trails, urging those that enter to talk to someone, to not end their lives\u2026 yet up to 105 bodies have been found per year in various states of decomposition.\n\nGrant Sawyer nearly became one of those statistics. Grant had been a quiet loner most of his life. As a youngster, it seemed he clung to his imaginary friends much longer than other children. Even into his teenage years, he\u2019d claim to see people that no one else could. What he didn\u2019t realize at the time was he was extremely in tune with the spirit world, and those \u201cfriends\u201d he saw were actually the ghosts of the departed\u2026.\n\nFast forward many years, and Grant is in his mid-twenties and at a friend\u2019s urging signed up to an online dating site. Within a couple weeks, he began messaging back and forth with a young woman named Emiko who lived in Japan, but spoke English. They even spoke on the phone a time or two, and Grant realized he was falling for the woman who seemed many worlds away from him. He eventually gathers the courage, and the money, to fly to Japan and visit her\u2026when he realized there was no \u201cher\u201d. He fell for a scam where groups of Japanese youths would portray a single woman online to swindle foreigners out of their money; when he arrived in Japan he was robbed by the gang who masterminded the charade, and was left penniless and heartbroken.\n\nAnd so he journeyed to Aokigahara, intent on taking his life, until he meets the spirit of a deceased woman who reaches out to him and convinces him not to harm himself.\n\nCan a living being love a ghost? Perhaps. It seems the more time they spend together, the more of a connection they form\u2026even eventually being able to touch one another. But are her intentions pure, or is she using him for some evil purpose?\n\nMessage me and let\u2019s find out! I'm in the US, eastern time zone, primarily RP during the day Monday - Friday and am capable of multiple responses a day. Anything else you'd like to know, just ask.",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to DM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have. Firstly, a few important notes about me and what I'm looking for.\n\nI roleplay in first-person. Your choice in point-of-view doesn't matter to me at all, I'm fine with whatever you pick!\n\nI want you to be the DM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.\n\n**If any of the ideas below strike your interest, please send a PM to /u/LordDurand and we can discuss further. I will not reply to PMs sent to this account.**\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during or after the events of the anime, with my character being an OC who ends up joining the SOS Brigade. He could either be an ordinary human or not depending on what we decide and how you want the RP to play out. The RP could also take place in the Disappearance Universe if you wanted, with that version's Haruhi meeting up with and forming the SOS Brigade with my character.\n\n**KonoSuba**\n\nMy character would be a member of the Adventurer Guild in the world of KonoSuba, though he could either be a native there or end up there like Kazuma. The RP could be entirely OCs or have canon characters, though I'd prefer canon characters to be in it, whether on their own or with OCs sprinkled in (especially since I'm absolutely in love with Megumin).\n\nI do have one idea for the story that's pretty far detached from the story and structure of the show. My character would be a native to the world, or at least someone who's been there a long time. He'd be a monster hunter who runs a restaurant. He goes out and hunts monsters solely to supply meat for the restaurant. It'd be a mix of a restaurant management type of thing, as well as having a lot of monster hunting. He could also take on quests for people, in exchange for getting to hire them as employees (either working as party members or in the restaurant). There could even be sections where he travels to other places to set up more restaurants or to hunt exotic monsters. Just an idea though, I'm open to any others that you may have.\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**\n\nThis would work best in a completely alternate Universe from any of the Parts, but versions of the canon characters could still appear. However, if you'd rather have it set in a canon Universe, or even during one of the Parts, that'd be fine too. For setting, I think either a school setting or some kind of grand adventure (like Parts 3 and 7) would work best, but I'm open to any ideas you may have.\n\n**Dragon Ball**\n\nThe idea I had for this one is actually heavily inspired by one of the Parts of JoJo. My idea is that, in the far-future of the main series (or in an alternate universe), the dragon balls become closely guarded to prevent anyone unworthy from making wishes. Each of the dragon balls is held by a Keeper. Every year, the Keepers set up a world-spanning event, where everyone is invited to participate. All participants gather at one place, at which point the locations of all seven Keepers is revealed to them. From then on, it's a race to not only reach the various Keepers, but to pass their tests in order to obtain their dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are taken from their Keepers, the location of a hidden shrine is revealed to everyone who has at least one of the dragon balls. The dragon balls only work when gathered together at this shrine, drawing all the holders to one spot for a final battle.\n\nI think this idea would be great in terms of character development. All characters would be working towards the goal of having their one wish granted while on a long journey, giving them plenty of time to develop. I'm thinking that before the race begins, some time can be spent showing the main characters training for it. Maybe they're training together, or maybe they're miles apart and only meet for the first time at the starting point of the race.\n\nIf you don't like that idea though, I'm open to any ideas of your own you may have.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody who's trying to regain his heart and, over time, remembers his past and why he lost his heart in the first place. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe. Of course, if you have other ideas, I'd love to hear them.\n\n**Star Wars**\n\nThis RP could be set before, during, or after any of the films, or in an alternate Universe. My character would be a Mandalorian bounty hunter who left his home planet to work as a bounty hunter while trying to find his lost, force-sensitive sister. Eventually, he's dragged into the Sith and Jedi conflict once he learns that both sides may know what happened to his sister.",

            "selftext": "Ugh, so I've just finished the main story of TW3 (onto Hearts of Stone now!) and I'm madly craving to write something in that universe. \n\nParticularly, I'm craving to write Ciri. Especially against Eredin or Avallac'h or Caranthir or any elf, really (I'm trash, I know). Some alternate plot where there's marriage and politics and that sort of thing. Like an AU where Eredin isn't defeated, Geralt fails, and Ciri is in the grasp of Eredin until she can figure out a way to kick his ass. Or not. Maybe there's some Stockholm Syndrome.\n\nAlso: OCs are welcome, but I would rather do OC/OC rather than OC/canon. Aen Elle and Aen Seidhe elves would be amazing to write as and against. Indulge me.\n\nOf course, I'm open to things of a NSFW manner. Would rather it not be the focus of what we write, but I'm not opposed to writing blood and gore and sex. \n\nSo, readers. Perhaps you'll indulge me in my weird ideas and let us create something weird and wonderful.",

            "selftext": "**Loethea Roleplay**\n\nIn the beginning there was only light and darkness. It was a balance for you could not have one without the other. The creatures and races of the sun frolicked in the sun and the warmth it offered. The creatures and races of the moon bathed in its eerie light and how it would illuminate the darkened dwellings. Nothing can last forever. \n\nFor centuries there was peace and happiness. Little by little a darkened evil started to rear its ugly head in the far reaches of the realm. Except it was not a product of darkness but rather of light that slowly gave way to an evil nature. Wanting reign over all the Kingdoms that washed over the realm. Control over all the races to manipulate in their own gain. An army was quickly rising filled with those whom were called by the darkness as well. The many Kingdom know that a threat looms but have hope the light will be strong enough to not let the sway pull enough to the wrong side. The war has yet to come but make no mistake it is coming. Whose side will you be on? \n\nThis is a medieval fantasy group rp. We are looking for the best of the best! After having been in many groups as a member and moderate I decided to create one along with my co-creator. A world of light and dark. Good and evil. Heros and villians. \n\nAre you looking for an adventure of the most epic proportions? If you are then feel free to shoot me a PM and we can talk all about it. As this rp is just getting off the ground there is a lot your character can delve into. Be one of the first members to join the rp! \n\nThis rp will be played over DISCORD. As will many other rps 1x1 or group we do have guidelines that we would like met by each member looking to join. Listed below you will find them. If you are interested and can check every one of them off then this group might just be for you. We want enthusiastic members who are eager to play in a medieval fantasy realm! \n\nGuidelines\n\nMust be 18 years of age or older. If you are not please do not respond. Please do not lie and say you are 18+ just to be part of the group. If it comes to light that you are under that age that will be an automatic boot.\n\nMust be capable of writing multiple paragraphs per post. This does not mean you have to write a novel but a 2 well written paragraph minimum is required. \n\nMust be capable of sustaining multiple characters. You do not have to start off with more than one but as the rp progresses there will be other cities/regions in the realm that will need characters catered to it. Of course all characters can move around to different places and are not mandated to stay in the same place they entered in at. \n\nPlease be capable of writing in the third person for this is how the rp will be done. It is more fluid that way especially given there will be many characters moving within this realm. \n\nThis is an 18+ group, we are all adults, don\u2019t be a dick. If you are having a clash with another member please message either the creator or the mod. We will address the situation and try to find a solution to it. Give us time though because we are busy people and have things going on outside the group. Do not take it upon yourself however to be rude, mean or hurtful because you will be kicked from the group if doing such.\n\nAlong with this being an 18+ group know that there could be some gorey scenes. If you do not want to read them if they do not pertain to your character that is to your discretion. Scroll past it and get a brief summary from another member. All NSFW scenes such as sex between two characters should be moved to a private 1x1 chat. While I understand romances will spark between characters it is courteous to move those scene out of the public eye. Implying they did the deed in scene in a room is fine, just keep all the juicy details private. \n\nJust to emphasize and make it clear so there can be no misconstrue of words. This is NOT a RAPID FIRE group. While, yes, some members will be on more often so at times there will be rapid fire responses that will NOT be ALL the time. Please do not get bent out of shape over this matter. We have no expectations that our members be capable of going back and forth at all times of the day. Many will have jobs, families, IRL situations that crop up and can only manage a couple if not one post per day. So if you are looking for a rapid fire rp then THIS group will not be one you want to join. Please be patient and understanding of this matter. \n\n\nTRIAL PERIOD\nThere will be a mandatory two week trial period for all new members. This is not to deter you from the rp in the slightest. This trial period is only to ensure the members with interest in the group are serious about wanting to be here. Two weeks is enough time to come up with a character concept, establish a backstory for them, enter them into a room and mingle with the members. This will give the administration time to see how you not only participate in the rp but how you interact with the current members. We do not want anyone in the rp that does not want to be here or is only going to give 10% effort to it. If you are more than thrilled and have a deep love of the idea of the rp and meet all expectations listed above then you will no doubt make it through the trial with flying colors. This is only to insure our group is thriving with fantastic and excited members.\n\nThank you for reading and we hope to hear from you soon!",

We run what is basically a science fantasy slice of life adventure group. Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.\n\n\nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence. \n\n\nThe world is alive with tons of lore and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature. \n\n\nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.",

I\u2019d also be open to something like Kars/Lisa Lisa (or all the Pillar Men at once if you know what I mean), Giorno/Jolyne, weirder stuff like Jotaro/Jolyne... I just need my fill tbh.

            "selftext": "They thought that the virus might have originated in South America. Not that it would matter for long, anyway. If you caught it, you were dead in a month. First the blindness, then the uncontrollable bleeding. The only people who weren't getting sick were children under the age of 10. It seemed their young immune cells could fight the virus off. Research began, and soon rumors of a cure spread. Russian demanded that the United States share the cure. The United States refused, stating that they had found no cure. Tensions rose, and in a last act of desperation, Russia declared war. Citizens were already rioting, and by the time the armies we're ready to mobilize, almost everyone was already dead. \n\nThat was almost 75 years ago. Everyone over the age of 10 has long since died, and the knowledge required to run society died with them. Hungry children, desperately trying to survive, killed and scrounged, and eventually banded together. With only an elementary education, the children could read, but not well. By the 3rd Generation, reading was rare, and manner had devolved almost completely.Now, these groups resembled native tribes. Those who could kill would rule. In Northeast Kansas, several tribes inhabit the area, and have named themselves according to signage and features of their surroundings. \n\nThank you for reading! This is mostly just an outline of a world, but I do have a couple of plot ideas. They would definitely take place in northeast Kansas, but other than that, things are pretty open. If you have any ideas, I am always open to suggestions. Send me a message if you would be interested in rolepaying this setting.",

I mostly enjoy fantasy style stories. I'm a sucker for magic, anything from subtlety to dragons blasting fireballs left and right. I do enjoy me some sci-fi from time to time so don't hesitate to inquire about that too!\n\nI'm currently sticking to email as my medium for play due to my work schedule and how easy it is to read and respond on my phone if needed. Anyway send me a PM and we can discuss interests and see what we can get going! Hope to hear from you soon!\n\n~Kael",

            "selftext": "My name is Valentine. I'm male and 20 and I quite enjoy playing around with anime ideas I like. Particularly at the moment is Dragon Ball yet I have some more I quite enjoy if asked, including but not limited to Hunter X Hunter, the Fate/ series, Infinite Stratos, and Overlord. Onto the one in the title.\nI have three major ideas, the first being quite simple and based on Xenoverse. The idea being that we both use OC's and our characters have been paired as Time Patroller partners, the reasoning for which can be varied. My idea originally is that one of us is a veteran and the other a new Time Patroller being trained, or we could both be rather strong, or both new or something entirely different with any added elements we want.\nThe second is more complex, where one of our OC's, for one reason or another, have been forced into the main plot of Dragon Ball at some point. This can be for a variety of reasons, but my idea is mostly avoiding too many outside characters aside from one of our own and playing around with the main group and where things would go differently from their arrival.\nThe third and final idea is my personal favorite. An alternate version of the events of the Goku Black arc being one where Zamasu was sent back in time when he wished to have Goku's body. Altering the timeline from the beginning of the original Dragon Ball, Goku is replaced by Goku Black as a child, altering the timeline from the beginning. Depending on where we start, we could have this go a multitude of ways, depending on how long we thing Goku Black would remain evil before becoming good. The possibilities with this idea abound and I would love a creative and intelligent partner to complete any of these ideas.\nPlease message me privately to discuss ideas. Thank you very much for reading and I look forward for the responses I may receive. If you would kindly name your favorite anime character in your first message, I would appreciate it.",

As soon as the wiki is done, the roleplay will begin. \n\nThe roleplay will be done on discord, there is no limit to the number of people, all that is required is that if you join, you must be able to commit to it. Reason being, if I go through the trouble of integrating your character into the story, then you drop out two days later, I have to retcon you out of it and that's stressful.\n\nReal, genuine work is being put into the lore, background and rules of this RP. It will not be shut down randomly, and it will have rules to protect the fun and interests of its RPers. \n\nThe roleplay will be:\nSemi-literate (paragraphical),\nSerious,\nR+ (Blood, death, fighting, alcohol, all that jazz will be present. If you must use sexual content, keep it to PMs lol)\n\nI hope to see you all on Jehetma! \n\n \n\n\n",

            "selftext": "\nThe intriguing thing about Jhonathon was that he never wanted it. He never desired or craved to be famous or be wealthy\u2026 With the way he was treated by his parents and peers growing up, all he ever wanted was to get out from under the thumb of oppression that the world seemed to push down upon him. Despite no opportunities in his childhood, he pressed on\u2026 it was as though the character of the demoralizing souls around him encouraged him to perform even better. The destitution that seemed to plague the world only pushed him to succeed more, and succeed he did, he grew himself intellectually and powerfully through this city to become one of the most wealthiest men to live here, owning Brent\u2019s enterprises, a wildly known company which made millions every year. He did it on his own, proving to those who told him he would never be a somebody wrong. Because now he was, he was a somebody, there wasn\u2019t many who didn\u2019t know his name now, and didn\u2019t that feel good?. \n\nJhonathon was in his late 20\u2019s now, he never had anyone who he would consider a \u201c girlfriend \u201c. That\u2019s not to say he was short of female attention because he wasn\u2019t , he was hardly a bad looking man. He was tall and muscular framed. Grey mysterious eyes, mousy blonde hair , and a stubbled beard which framed his chiselled facial features, some called him gorgeous.. some handsome. He was charming, intelligent.. everything perhaps someone would want. Trouble was his wealth, his money made it hard to trust anyone, his nights were full of women who were more then happy  to keep his room warm, but anything more?. Never happened. Perhaps because they didn\u2019t want it, or perhaps because he didn\u2019t trust them. The world was full of cruel ruthless people who craved his wealth and power, how could he possibly tell the good from the bad?. \n\nThis week was no different from any other in his busy life now, meetings meetings and more meetings. It was Friday night, he had a meeting pending; another late night closure on a deal he\u2019d been working on for months, but he just needed a breather. He stepped out of the office, after telling his secretary he\u2019d be right back, and just took a stroll to a convenience store down the street.\n\nThe night was cool thick clouds billowing above his head obviously setting the theme that rain and perhaps thunder was on the horizon his eyes were so focuses on the swirling storm above him that he hadn't noticed the woman in a hurry in front of him, his shoulders connected with something with a thud and he stumbled back managing to stop himself from falling over , he heard the tumble of books as he looked forward and noticed a woman against the cobbled stones and quickly hurried forward to assist her in picking up her bits - \" I'm terribly sorry.... I wasn't looking where I was going...\" - he stumbled shoving her books into his hands he watched her rise and his eyes for the first time met her own.... His heart stopped for the briefest of moments as he stared up to the woman basked in the soft white light of the shadowed moon.... Who was she?.....\n\n(( so that was obviously a prompt to start us of... Happy to start it in a different manner if you prefer . Im seeking a female for long term literate play. Semi para and upwards only ( no one liners ). My preferred method of role playing is in email... Interested? Drop me a message and we can discuss it . Thanks for reading :) )) \n",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! I'm currently looking for a long-term romance/drama type of RP. Since the RP will have NSFW elements, I would prefer it if my partner was 18+. I have several prompts up for disposition, some of them are original universes, but I'm also looking for someone willing to play Goro Majima from Yakuza/Ryu ga Gotoku for me (if my partner wants, I can also play a character from the series for them as well, just to keep things fair). Either way, I'm alright with either! \n\nSo my prompts are as follows:\n\n1. 5 Years Apart\nThe princess, a powerful sorceress keeping her powers a secret in a kingdom that abhors witchcraft,  is forced into an arranged marriage with a man she doesn't love; she is also assigned a bodyguard. The story would be of a typical bodyguard/princess romance, however, the fiance, angry that the bodyguard would dare to usurp his place as her husband (despite his vicious abuse towards her), and kills the princess before the bodyguard. \n\nThe princess appears years later, having been revived by her soul wielding black magic. She doesn't remember her life previous to her murder nor how to use her magic and believes she is a normal human. Her beloved soon finds her, and the two begin to renew their love, with memories of her past, abuse and romance with the bodyguard, begin to flourish and torment her, and she finds that her kingdom is now in the hands of a madman, still obsessed with her but now for both his odd passionate obsession and his need to be a proper king.\n\nThe two can decide to live their life in a slice of life, or continue on to conquer back their kingdom.\n\n2. Ex-Lover from the Dead\nMy OC is a fallen angel, cast down from the Heavens for having betrayed the rule of God and having fallen in love with a Demon; she was a powerful warrior angel, brainwashed and emotionless, viewing her prey as nothing but prey until she met Him, a Demon that managed to best her in combat, but didn\u2019t kill her because he no longer follows the path of wanton destruction and merely wants to live in peace. They fall in love, and their love is lived only for a short while. \n\nHer kind finds out about this however, and capture the two. They kill the Demon before her eyes, strip the white from her wings, and cast her down to Earth as a traitor to her kind, spared from death by the mercy of God, whom could not deny the purity of the love he had witnessed. She falls into the merciless care of priests who saw her as a challenge to proof their worth to God and suffered abuse at their hands. \n\nTwo years later, my OC is working as a singer in an old lounge, where she meets your OC (can be a demon or not); on that night, a mysterious spree of murders of religious folks begins to happen, and when someone close to either your OC or mine ends up dead, my OC and your own take it upon themselves to investigate.\n\nIn the shadows of these murders, however, lies the hatred that formed when love died two years ago in Heaven\u2026\n\n3. [Yakuza/Ryu ga Gotoku universe] Songbird\n\nMy OC is a singer in a new, hip jazz lounge in Kamurocho. Having run away from her homeland of Europe to seek her freedom after an arduous visa process, she lands herself in Kamurocho. Her lounge is frequently visited by yakuza from the Tojo clan who protect the perimeter due to the owner being an upstanding citizen that has done right by them. The owner is protective of my OC having grown fond of her, as well as seeing her as an asset, and has asked the Majima family for her protection, as they funded the construction of the club.\n\nMajima visits the club every now and then, and meets her personally one night after disposing of an undesirable trying to attack her. She is hesitant and avoidant of him, and soon it is revealed that her brother was murdered by yakuza, and she is being gunned for a pendant that he had given her, which unbeknownst to her, is worth a quantifiable sum of money.\n\nAs she involves herself more with Majima, she finds herself knee-deep in the harsh realities of the life of yakuza, and must choose between a life of blissful ignorance over her brother and his shady dealings that have caused her to be a target, or continue head-on with the Mad Dog of Shimano besides her.\n\nThese are the current prompts I have, let me know which one appeals to you the most through a message! We can trade Discords, and discuss all the details there or through the message before we start! Thanks guys!\n",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nTo make a long story short, I'm looking for someone to roleplay with.\n\n**Who I am:** Nice to meet you! While I don't want to give out my irl name, you can call me by the name of my first OC, Cyrus- or just Cy! I'm a university student, 18 years old. I've been roleplaying since I was about nine years old, starting with simple RPG games to text-based roleplay on Wetpaint.com-hosted sites about Warrior Cats. I'm fond of anime and web-based stuff, such as Undertale and Homestuck. Some of my favourite video games include Skyrim and Undertale, actually! \n\nRoleplay wise, I like to think I'm fairly good. When I'm invested in a roleplay, I can write paragraphs for replies. My style has been described as eloquent and flowery, but it often reflects the roleplay I am doing and the character I roleplay as- for example, a laid-back teenager would have a much more relaxed way of talking and looking at the world, then, say, a primordial being of creation.\n\nI have a broad roster of OC's as well, both male and female (and some neither). If I had to take a guess, I would say that around 20% of my characters are actually straight. A lot of them are bisexual, with some of my guys being gay. I only have one lesbian character. One of my genderfluid characters and one of my female characters are pansexual, while another male is ace. They're all over the spectrum! \n\nI also like to take time in developing my OC's. Each one has a physical description and faceclaim, a dynamic personality, likes and dislikes, and varying body types. Each one is capable of unique and enjoyable roleplay which I surely hope you enjoy!\n\n**Who you are:** You're a likeminded, creative roleplayer, capable of detailed roleplay and seeking something longterm. You enjoy roleplaying and you're capable of writing paragraphs as well. You also have a wide roster of well-developed OC's and enjoy roleplaying a lot. Who you are OOC **does not matter-** just don't be underage! I enjoy doing nsfw roleplay with my partners, but I absolutely will not do it if you're underage- which is bad, because I really enjoy doing it. \n\n**What kind of roleplay we'd do:** When I find someone I truly *click* with- which is what I'm hoping to find here- I'm capable of doing many different roleplays with them at once. I once juggled six roleplays at once- some longterm, and others just things we began- with the same partner at the same time! \n\nAnyways, we'd do a diverse range of roleplays, with both of our ideas coming into play! I've done everything from simple Slice of Life's to Epics, and I really do enjoy it all. I've done roleplays where I transplant my characters into a video game, and I've built worlds with my partners from a simple start. Our rps would be both sfw and nsfw, so if that last bit is a dealbreaker, I understand.\n\nI can afford to be very flexible with my roleplays because of my characters- my OC's can easily be transplanted into any sort of scenario, thanks to the fact that I've developed who they are and their personalities to the point where I know how to handle them in situations ranging from the fantastical to the apocalyptic. \n\n**If you're interested:** Send me a message on this account! Tell me a little bit about yourself, your character's, and a little bit about you OOC (Age, gender, etc). Let me know what kind of roleplays you prefer, some ideas you have, and just anything else you feel like would be a good impression. \n\nI really do want to find someone I can click with when I roleplay, so don't be shy. Shoot me a message and let's see what happens! ",

After we shut down a year ago with over one hundred members on skype we have decided to move to discord due to its superior features and user friendliness. Our goal is to provide a place to chat with other roleplayers, post ads, and find partners. Unfortunately, many of the websites which had these functions died out or are very slow with posting the latest adverts due to the high traffic they have. \n\nWe have recently opened the server and are always open to feedback to improve our community. Join us, invite your friends, and make some new ones!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/jnTgavF\n",

If you're unfamiliar, the basic premise is it's a slice-of-life story where the main characters are only 9 cm (or 3.5 inches) tall and live in a tiny world of tiny humans and forest wildlife.  I wanted there to be all sorts of RP types, anywhere from casual RPing out a normal life, to crafting and creating new tools or inventions, to exploring uncharted parts of the woods, even some tiny combat with massive creatures (relatively) such as deer or great horned owls!  If anyone's interested post here and I'll work with everyone to get a discord server set up.",

I\u2019m looking for more partners to explore worlds, and enjoy detailed plots with. \n\nI\u2019m 20, have a job and work overtime.... a lot. I tend to not have enough sleep, some days I won\u2019t reply. If I\u2019m no longer interested I will tell you. So please don\u2019t worry. \n\nWith that being said, I still want to be in and absolutely love this hobby. So HMU. \n\nWRITING : \nI only write Male characters, and M4M.... I cannot write female characters or play with them. Unfortunately experiences in the past have ruined it for me. \nThird person is my preferred writing style. Im not set on length nor do I expect you to deliver a specific length but tend to throw out 2-3 para. NSFW, is fine, I don\u2019t want it to be the center of the story though. Keep that in mind. \n\nGENRES : \nLet me just say, these are some I\u2019ve played and enjoy doing. I\u2019m open to mostly anything though, please don\u2019t hesitate, I\u2019m open to something new. \nSciFi \nFuturistic \nSupernatural\nRomance \nModern \n\nTHINGS IM NOT OKAY WITH:\n\u2022I\u2019m not interested in is, FANDOM RP. I can take ideas from shows/books/movies/ etc. I will NOT however play an already developed character. ONLY OC\nStill, there are a couple characters I will refuse to play with. \nEXAMPLE : Marry Sue\u2019s/Damsel\u2019s in distress, those who cannot hold their own. If you character cannot speak three sentences without sounding like they\u2019re having a seizure.... I\u2019m out.  \n\u2022No power/God mod, it makes the Roleplay boring if your character had the answer for everything. \n\nOOC : \nI love making friends. I\u2019m more then okay to chat about other things then roleplay. I believe it opens up a lot more to discuss, along with with introduces great ideas. All in all, well both be more comfortable talking about the roleplay as well. \n\nCONTACT  : \nI\u2019m currently only using the app, Discord. \nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far! Thanks so much for reading, I hope to hear from you. Truly hope I didn\u2019t scare too many people away. ",

I've been roleplaying for just about 5 years now I think.\nI am looking for someone to do a long term roleplay (or roleplays) with.\n\nI'm looking for someone who:\n\n- Shares my view that roleplays should be enjoyed by both (or all) parties.\n- Literate (not text talk; u, y?, that sort of thing).\n- Knows when a short response is acceptable (I saw people saying that short responses cause an immediate ban on their side, but sometimes it's the best that can be done in a situation).\n- Understands that outside of our roleplay and chat, we both have lives, and sometimes it's not possible to roleplay or talk at a specific time.\nSorry if it seems my demands are too much, but I think that's the bare minimum (And I'm pretty sure most people here meet these criteria).\n\nRegarding what we'll be roleplaying, it's up to use as to what it is, and we'll be able to decide together!\n\nAnyway that's it for me, hope to hear from you soon!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I'm a 21 yr old Male, and I've been RPing for around 6 years as of now. I have a few active RPs as of now, and I am looking to expand a bit. 18+ is a must for me, as nothing is really off of the table for the plots I delve into, from blood and gore, to edgy subject matter, to romance. I like to keep things real, and hardly ever fade to black when things get rough or romantic. I prefer 3rd person plots, and can play either male or female characters. I prefer not to do gay or lesbian relations if I can help it, but I am very open to the subject of it presents itself in the right way. Below are a couple of my prompts, feel free to send a DM if interested! If you also have any other ideas, feel free to discuss as well!\n\n1. A young cop finds him/herself on the force of a large city's PD, on the rise of gang related activities taking the city by storm. He/She (Female preferably) would have joined the force to do good in the world, but more importantly to investigate her parents murder by a gang some years earlier. After a few months, YC is sent in to become the partner of MC, and relations would be very tense at first, however a romantic relationship develops as life or death scenarios bring them together.\n\n2. 2019, Arizona. A new student is enrolled in an Ivy-League university. They are roped into a dangerous group of people, a mafia of sorts, taking out a loan to pay bills, and YC would be their best friend, eventually finding out what is happening and trying to help their friend out, but the mafia is roped into many things unseen. Preferably YC would be a teacher or professor, befriending and possibly blooming into romance through the hardships they endure.",

The offer is open to everyone, though I apologize in advance as I am a tad bit picky with my partners, but I'm trying to open up more.\n\nAbout me, I've been role-playing for over 8 years, and love setting up intimate scenes and world building with whatever plots that I find interesting.  My specialties tend to lie more in supernatural and darker themes, though I can easily do slice of life and fandom plots as well. I am male so keep that in mind when approaching. \n\nWhen it comes to more adult themes,I'm fine with them, though don't just expect one out of the gate. They're only gratifying if there is a build up and struggle. If interested in a male x male plot, I prefer being the more dominant partner.\n\nI'm hoping to find some long term plots that we can build and expand upon, and I would like to use discord.",

We will take out the canon characters, that way we can have true reign of the world. (Of course Gold. D Roger still exists otherwise it isn\u2019t really One Piece)\n\nSo if you\u2019re a fan of One Piece or simply want to roleplay just send me a message, I welcome anyone and everyone I\u2019m not fussy.",

            "selftext": "The Lands of Asteria ( TLOA ) is a Roleplay set in a Fantasy universe that contains various different planets and races. It has an in-depth lore that contains the history of the universe, it's people and the development of magic, weaponry and civilization.\nBut recently in the year 466 ( Late 5th Century ) tensions between races have been rising at a steady pace. The race known as \"Aisrux\" ( An evolved species of human, since regular humans are extinct. ) and \"Orcs\" are at each other's throats and the planet of Talos is worried that war will break out soon. \n\nBut the Overworld isn't all there is to Asteria. There is also the \"Spirit Realm\". A sort of Fantasy-Apocalypse situation where a zombie-like virus is spreading throughout the afterlife and sending spirits into a state of eternal darkness. And at the same time the capital of \"Lerwick\" ( The main city where the dead go after their death. ) is being terrorized by a group of savages known as the \"Derelict\".\n\nI should emphasize that there is a lot of lore. Like so much lore that we had to organize it into multiple different documents to keep it from getting messy. You don't have to read all of it to RP, but you need to read enough of it to make a proper character and backstory. If you don't see a race you want on the race list, custom lore can be accepted.\n\nOne last thing I should point out is something about Inactivity. If you join the server and do completely nothing you'll be pinged. A lot. Probably until you either do something or leave. We are currently having issues with inactivity as it is, so just don't join if you plan on being inactive. \nInactive for us is roughly about 6-7 days without doing anything.\n\nThat's about it. If the invite below doesn't work for some reason I'll post a new one in the comments. \n\nIf enough people actually end up joining, I'll start hosting more server events and such.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/sUMaSDP",

            "selftext": "Hi y'all!\n\nMy lovely significant other got me Assassin's Creed: Rogue, as an early Valentines Gift last week and unfortunately (or fortunately.) it's sent me into something of a spiral of Hyperfixation, meaning that over the last week I've 100% completed Rogue, ran through 3, and I've just now started Unity for the first time ever and honestly. I might be spending a full week on this game alone, if not more~\n\nA little about me before we dive in, just so we're all good! I'm Ceri/Tez, either name is good! I'm a 21 year old, genderfluid person from Norway who has not much to do on their days and look to fill them out with roleplay and games! I'm available frequently and almost all the time to chat and write and all that, but I don't require you to be, even though it'd be nice! I write most in 3rd person, past tense and can be convinced to do 1st person if you ask nicely! I've RP'd for giv eor take ten years, so I'd say I know my stuff fairly well!\n\nBy now, it should be pretty clear what I'm looking for, but I'll summarize beneath this paragraph~! But, I'm looking for a partner that's hopefully pretty into the AC Franchise and willing/wanting to write a story with me! I've got a few ideas that we can debate and decide on together but I'm mostly interested in exploring unchecked areas of the ages and places, and I'm only interested in Original characters~! I'm also really only interested if you're looking for long-term, I don't want to plot out something for you to vanish after a few days, or few hours even. That being said, if something happens, or you just don't feel it anymore? Totally cool. Just give me a message at least, I don't need or demand an explanation, but I do want at minimum a message saying you're done!\n\nSo, here is a summary for what I'm looking for, in flashy bullet points!\n\n**What I'm looking for**\n\n* Committed writers with an interest in the Assassin's Creed franchise\n* People who can write more than just one paragraph (Between 2-5 is ideal!)\n* Someone who understands that life happens, and so does downtime.\n* Ideally someone who can at least give me responses once a day, a few times a day would be fantastic, but I don't really care!\n* A person of any gender who'll respect me and my genderfluidity!\n* Someone friendly, and laid back who would be willing to just chat and talk without too much pressure~\n* Someone who likes bullet points as much as me.\n* A person who will bring their own ideas and suggestions to the table, I don't want to have to do all the work!\n* Someone who likes romance, action, story, drama, and a little side of smut here and there would be nice! (Smut is not mandatory or required, perfectly happy keeping things SFW)\n* Ideally wanting to use Discord, but Hangouts and Docs are all good with me!\n* If I've left something out, or you've got questions please feel free to ask!\n\nSo! I hope by now I've caught your eye and impressed you enough to make you wanna write with me! I can promise open and honest communication on my part, as long as I can get the same from you! If you're interested; Send me a PM here on Reddit! Tell me a lil' about yourself, and some stuff about you as a writer! Anything more than a 'hi wanna rp?' would be appreciated! And if you wow me, I will help you find a Piece of Eden~\n\nIn short, hope to hear from, and write with you!",

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nI am looking for an advanced, long-term roleplay partner to do a romantic, slice of life roleplay with over PM, that includes lots of drama and twists and turns. I am looking for someone who is literate and can write multiple paragraphs per response. This is meant to be a story that we create together, so input and ideas from both parties are necessary to make this enjoyable for both of us.\n\nA little forewarning, I only play original characters and would like your character to be an original character too. Straight off the bat, I'll let you know now that I don't do roleplays that are based on the generes of fandom, supernatural, fantasy, medieval... etc. so if that's what you're looking for, then this is the wrong post for you.\n\nAnyway, a bit about my roleplay history... I've been doing text based roleplay for about 4 years now, with a main preference for romance and slice of life roleplays. I have been told that I am a literate and detailed roleplayer, and I put a great emphasis on using correct spelling and grammar in my responses. In terms of response length, I usually write a few paragraphs, dependant on the situation. As a general rule of thumb, the more I get, the more I give back, but it's never less than a paragraph. \n\nI am looking to create a roleplay where our characters already begin in an established relationship together, and can explore that relationship throughout the course of the roleplay, as different events and situations arise in their lives. I know this may sounds strange and a little boring, but I have a few ideas in mind that you can read over if you choose to PM me.\n\nAs for NSFW, I am comfortable with NSFW elements in a roleplay, but am happy to exclude them too. If NSFW elements are incorporated, I personally prefer my roleplay's to revolve around the plot and storyline, rather than the NSFW elements themselves.\n\nI'm hoping that I have expressed enough detail for you to be interested, without writing an entire essay. If you would like to roleplay with me or hear more about my ideas, feel free to send me a PM. If you have any ideas then I'm more than happy to hear those too, if you feel that they align with what I'm looking for.",
