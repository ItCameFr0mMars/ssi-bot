For the last couple of months I've been writing with several others in a group-style RP on Discord, but I'm hoping to find more 1x1s or a different group setting. \n\nI have found that I really enjoy using Discord as a writing platform, as we can create our own server for the story, with various channels for storing content. Email works fine too, if Discord is not an option. I write in third person and I tend to pump out 2-3 paragraphs at a time, but also enjoy quick dialogue responses when appropriate. Rapid fire often works well for me as I spend much of my work day writing. Response length also depends on current events (both in role and out) \u2013 some responses will get paragraphs and others (dialogue driven) will be shorter. Also, I don\u2019t expect perfection! Spelling errors are going to happen on my end, so I\u2019m not going to lose it if my partner has a few errors here and there. As long as effort is put in, and the creativity is flowing overall, we are good to go :)\n\nI enjoy romantic aspects within the writing that I do. I get plenty of satisfaction from the action and adventure, however I thrive when writing romance, whether it be dramatic, heartbreaking, cruel, etc. I\u2019m not always nice to my characters! With that in mind, I do prefer main characters to become involved, I always include various NPCs and side characters to get as deep into the plot as possible. Violence, language, and sex are themes I do include in most stories. NSFW is fun and I enjoy writing smut scenes too. This can be discussed further in PMs!\n\nI have no issues with writing graphic scenes (in terms of violence and sex), and neither should my partner. I go where the story does, and explicit content only adds to a story in my opinion.\n\nSo right now, I\u2019ve been on a kick of writing females as my main character, with either gender as side characters. I don\u2019t have a gender preference for my writing partner, but I would ask that anyone interested be up for portraying a male opposite my female. I\u2019m more than happy to incorporate other characters and do the same for my partner in story as well!\n\nHere are a few ideas I\u2019ve had recently. These are in no way set in stone, and I\u2019d love to chat more to see if we can come up with a way to incorporate your own, or to develop a new idea. \n\n1. Fantasy/Medieval: My main female is heir to the throne in a neighboring kingdom. She is captured during the sacking of her region and is the only member of her family left alive. The king in the setting decides he will marry her off to one of his sons or even marry her himself. Your main character could be the prince that is to marry her, a guard, or even a spy/assassin/something else cool from her own regions sent to procure her. I imagine the two regions are very different in terms of customs and languages, so she is very much alone and has to adapt. (I use the term medieval loosely...I mostly imagine this being similar to a Game of Thrones type setting, but not necessarily with the fantasy aspects. Different races are okay, but I don't mind if the magical elements are not included.)\n\n2. Modern day/realistic: A new graduate returns home after being away at boarding schools/college for the majority of her youth and young adult life. She is the daughter of the leader of a crime organization/mob. She would know that illegal activities are happening, however, I'm thinking that she doesn't know the extent of the business. Early in the role, she would be kidnapped by a rival organization. The main male could be a member/leader of the rival group, a henchman working for her father, or even an undercover agent that has worked his way up in the ranks of either organization. Lots of possibilities with this one! \n\n3. Demon/Angel: I've been toying around with an angel/demon roleplay for some time. The main female would be a fallen angel, who chose to become fallen after the death of her younger sister, in order to infiltrate hell and do spy on much of the demonic presence in both hell and earth. She's also a warrior and healer. She's struggling with retaining her angelic qualities while doing this mission, which would be interesting to write her conflicting thoughts. I'm thinking the process could take months or even years for her to gain the trust of Lucifer and other demons of importance. Lots of options in this role pertaining to prophecies and outcomes. Her character would be something totally different than what I typically write, in that she's going to have evil characteristics with an inner struggle to retain her angelic qualities and goodness. There are also plenty of options for the male character - another angel, fallen, demon, etc. I thought it would be cool for him to be someone of importance.\n\n4. Fantasy/Supernatural: I have only done one supernatural roleplay before and I had so much fun for the few weeks that it lasted. It was a shame it didn't continue like I'd hoped. I like vampires, lycans, witches, etc. I had a thought that a half human/half vampire female was hired at a company run by lycans, the leader being the main male character. Maybe she doesn't know she is a vampire, and would be going through her transition in the near future. The initial conflict could be that the two main characters are forming a close relationship and then she goes into her transition - leading the lycan to be distrusting of her, but maybe even feel some sort of obligation toward her if those feelings are strong. She could even be sired by a vampire leader just for story's sake. ALSO! This is dependent on whether or not you are okay with vampires being a species rather than undead. If it bothers you that they would be a species, the same storyline could work, with the exception that she would be turned in some sort of attack rather than a transition by heritage.\n\nGeneral things I enjoy - Victorian-era romance, arranged marriages, kidnapping, bedslaves, powerplay, Marvel universe, post-apocalyptic\n\nAs you can tell, I thrive off the drama and angst! Again, these ideas are not set in stone, and I\u2019m happy to chat about your own ideas. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read my post! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. PM me on Reddit, and we can exchange Discord handles or emails.\n\nEDIT: Please do not respond with only \"Hi\" or \"I'm down, let's RP.\" Give me a little bit to work with, tell me what interests you!",

            "selftext": "**About me:** Hello! I'm a writer in his 20's and, above all else, I love world-building and character writing. I've written several short-stories (some have been published anonymously) as well as some longer works of fiction that are currently in their editing stages.\n\n**Genre:** I usually stick to Sci-Fi or Fantasy. I love them both. Modern-day plots seem to always fall on the generic side of things for whatever reason, so Fantasy or Sci-Fi is always an easy way to spice it up in RP.\n\n**Characters:** I create original characters for every single Roleplay. I don't re-use anyone. I tend to write darker characters, not in tone, but in execution. As in, characters with deep, deep flaws that aren't just \"he's sad because his mother died,\" or some schlock like that. I really enjoy crafting three-dimensional roles that challenge my partner, as well as creating for a story with no true heroes.\n\n**Plot:** To be determined. I do have ideas, as always, but I much rather create one with the partner. If you have an idea feel free to send it my way, as well, however, chances are we'll probably be going over things anyway. I just like being introduced to something new. I dislike unoriginal worlds that are fandom-oriented, they feel restrictive and honestly, kind of lazy. I do have a fantasy story i'm working on, however, if you have any original ideas as well, don't hesitate to message me.\n\nMy stories are often on the darker side as well, as in, 18+ themes. Gore, sex, drugs, and all that fun stuff! That doesn't mean they are doom and gloom, though. There will be plenty of comedy to go around, I assure you.\n\n**Partner Requirements:** Have fun! Love to write! Love to really engage! Have a passion for what you are doing. There is nothing more tedious and banal than a partner that seems to not care about what she is writing. You don't have to be George R.R Martin, just write something you care and are interested about.\n\nAlso, if we click and do create a fun idea together, I would like at least a modicum of commitment. Being ghosted is never fun. I will always show you the respect of telling you if the RP isn't interesting me or the characters aren't engaging. I expect the same from you.\n\n**Smut:** Ahh yes, we all love smut. Including myself. Smut is fun. While I don't really want a roleplay dedicated to it... usually, I quite like including it into facets where it belongs. Diagetically. I also enjoy partners that are creative, original, and unique when it comes to this. If your tastes are a little out of the norm, that is totally okay! We can discuss this further if you decide to message me.\n\n**Overall:** Don't be afraid to shoot me a message. Just tell me a bit about yourself. What ideas are wrapped up in that beautiful mind of yours? Lets have an awe-inspiring adventure together!",

            "selftext": "Alright so first things first you can find my RP Gateway profile [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/7x1xjh/idealpressure/) that has more info about myself than this post will contain.\n\nI'm 25 years old, been RP'ing now for about 12+ years now and honestly it's a hobby that I don't think I could ever truly give up. I've always been about writing short stories and world building, which is primarily what most of my RPs consist of. I am married and do have a small family of my own, so please be aware that there will be times when I just am simply unavailable. I do still try though to give at least 1-2 replies a day depending on work and other factors.\n\nWhat am I looking for? Well, my gateway profile will show what all I am on board for, but right at this moment I have three different ideas.\n\n* *A Post-Apocalyptic Journey Feat. Cyberpunk Elements*: Now hear me out on this one cause it's a little out there, but definitely on the top of my list. So, this is based on some art by Simon St\u00e5lenhag which you can find the gallery [here](http://www.simonstalenhag.se/). Imagine an America where technology boomed in the mid-70s through the 80s. During this time, machines with AI began to be the norm. Eventually, the machines wound up thinking for themselves and slowly realized they were better than their makers. Slowly, devices such as AR headsets and the like began to enslave humans and use them as power sources/sentry units. As a result, a war broke out that left mankind scrambling to survive. In a last ditch effort, mankind opted to create a device that caused a black out to occur and basically destroy everything. Unfortunately, the device failed and what remained of humanity reverted back into the shadows. Now, this story would take place in the late 90s / early 2000s where mankind has built outposts/villages/towns far outside the main cities and opted into a life using limited technology. They don't use devices that were once powered by the machines, and instead use things that run off small batteries and the like. Towns communicate and set up trade with each other here and there, but one day a certain town notices another has gone silent and sends two characters to go check things out. What they stumble upon leads them to journey across America in search of a way to finally rid the world of the machines. It's a rough idea that can be fleshed out numerous different ways, but at least the main setting is there.\n\n* *Modern Fantasy*: This idea comes with some familiar territory for myself at least. I actually have a character who is an occult detective that I've never really had the chance to flesh out much. He practices magic and what not and I'd love to do a neo-noir type thing with him involving various supernatural creatures. This can be set in a real city/town or in something completely fictional. Doesn't matter, but I'd like to build up a world with all this as well.\n\n* *Neo-Noir Cyberpunk*: This one is a bit more in line with Blade Runner/Cyberpunk 2099/Johnny Mnemonic in terms of the setting being more futuristic high-tech than the first plot point. Basically, just looking for some sort of tale to do with another detective character I've had for a bit. I'd love to incorporate several different aspects of corporate espionage, forbidden romance, and gritty detective stuff in it. Once again, I'm very lenient on what the story will entail, just giving a basic idea of the setting more so than any major plot points.\n\nWho I'm looking for:\n\nSomeone 18+ (preferably 21+) that doesn't mind spending a lot of time building up a world/universe and then getting down to the writing. Like I said above, my time is kind of all over the place so if you're looking for someone to crank out 5+ replies a day, sadly that's not me. A lot of my RPs are slow burns, focusing more on getting story aspects down first before finally diving into the RP itself. NSFW is fine, but if that's not your cup of tea then no problem! If you can get behind one of the ideas, or have your own spin on things then please don't hesitate to reach out!",

            "selftext": "I searched on RpNation, but I couldn't find anyone there. I am willing to roleplay via any medium, but I'd prefer PM or RpNation.\n\nNote: This is based on the Netflix iteration of the characters, not the comics. Also, Season 2 spoilers. You must have watched the first two seasons of Daredevil, but no other lore is necessary.\n\nDaredevil thought that it was just another adventurous night with Elektra when they broke into the mansion of Rosco Sweeney, the man who killed his father. In the television show, Daredevil refuses to kill Rosco and Elektra abandons him, only for them to re-meet years later. What if in this alternative timeline, Matt Murdock kills Rosco and Elektra consequently abandons her mission with Stick. The two of them would remain together. If anyone is interested in this highly specific roleplay, I would like to incorporate Foggy (I know some people don't like him), Karen, and Fisk or Punisher as NPCs (or we could potentially double up). It would begin in the moment that Matt kills Rosco instead of being adamant against it. This roleplay would definitely consider Matt's Catholic beliefs versus Elektra's sadistic ones. We could go anywhere with this story line. It could be a romance. They could become mortal enemies. We could emphasize the Hand and Blue Sky or ignore it. Anything's cool. I just find Elektra to be a really endearing character.\n\nI would be willing to role play as either Matt or Elektra. And, yet again, we could double up.\n\nRequirements\n1. Every response should be at least four lines, preferably longer. I like to do roleplays that read like stories.\n2. I appreciate good grammar. Perfection is not necessary, but proper use of quotations and punctuation is preferable.\n3. The person must stay true to the original material to an extent. We can change a lot but it would be a shame if Matt wasn't Catholic or if Foggy became a doctor.\n\nI'd also be interested in various other roleplays. This is just one I have an interest for. I like fantasy, adventure, romance and especially superheroes. I'm down for almost any superhero plots (including comics).",

            "selftext": "\nThe intriguing thing about Jhonathon was that he never wanted it. He never desired or craved to be famous or be wealthy\u2026 With the way he was treated by his parents and peers growing up, all he ever wanted was to get out from under the thumb of oppression that the world seemed to push down upon him. Despite no opportunities in his childhood, he pressed on\u2026 it was as though the character of the demoralizing souls around him encouraged him to perform even better. The destitution that seemed to plague the world only pushed him to succeed more, and succeed he did, he grew himself intellectually and powerfully through this city to become one of the most wealthiest men to live here, owning Brent\u2019s enterprises, a wildly known company which made millions every year. He did it on his own, proving to those who told him he would never be a somebody wrong. Because now he was, he was a somebody, there wasn\u2019t many who didn\u2019t know his name now, and didn\u2019t that feel good?. \n\nJhonathon was in his late 20\u2019s now, he never had anyone who he would consider a \u201c girlfriend \u201c. That\u2019s not to say he was short of female attention because he wasn\u2019t , he was hardly a bad looking man. He was tall and muscular framed. Grey mysterious eyes, mousy blonde hair , and a stubbled beard which framed his chiselled facial features, some called him gorgeous.. some handsome. He was charming, intelligent.. everything perhaps someone would want. Trouble was his wealth, his money made it hard to trust anyone, his nights were full of women who were more then happy  to keep his room warm, but anything more?. Never happened. Perhaps because they didn\u2019t want it, or perhaps because he didn\u2019t trust them. The world was full of cruel ruthless people who craved his wealth and power, how could he possibly tell the good from the bad?. \n\nThis week was no different from any other in his busy life now, meetings meetings and more meetings. It was Friday night, he had a meeting pending; another late night closure on a deal he\u2019d been working on for months, but he just needed a breather. He stepped out of the office, after telling his secretary he\u2019d be right back, and just took a stroll to a convenience store down the street.\n\nThe night was cool thick clouds billowing above his head obviously setting the theme that rain and perhaps thunder was on the horizon his eyes were so focuses on the swirling storm above him that he hadn't noticed the woman in a hurry in front of him, his shoulders connected with something with a thud and he stumbled back managing to stop himself from falling over , he heard the tumble of books as he looked forward and noticed a woman against the cobbled stones and quickly hurried forward to assist her in picking up her bits - \" I'm terribly sorry.... I wasn't looking where I was going...\" - he stumbled shoving her books into his hands he watched her rise and his eyes for the first time met her own.... His heart stopped for the briefest of moments as he stared up to the woman basked in the soft white light of the shadowed moon.... Who was she?.....\n\n(( so that was obviously a prompt to start us of... Happy to start it in a different manner if you prefer . Im seeking a female for long term literate play. Semi para and upwards only ( no one liners ). My preferred method of role playing is in email... Interested? Drop me a message and we can discuss it . Thanks for reading :) )) \n",

Discord is my preferred medium, but I'm open to other suggestions. I'm not a stickler to volumes of writing, as sometimes the right story requires paragraphs, but sometimes a handful of sentences. That being said, a sentence or less in each response will likely draw my boredom.\n\nThere will be action and adventure to pair with the romance. Any perspective partner should be 21+\n\nAs for timing and play, I'm in the central time zone and available most weekends and after 6pm most weekdays.\n\nMessage me if you're interested and we can discuss details.\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nI'm looking for a dedicated partner for a post apocalyptic themed roleplay along the of the last of us. I have the plot idea below that gives you a bit of background on the story. \n\nA BIT ABOUT ME:\n\nI'm 23 y/o female, I would consider myself a proto-expert writer. \u00a0Post length for me depend on what fits with the story,I'd be happy with 2-3 paragraphs to 5-7; no one word/sentence replies please. I am new to this format but not to roleplay as a whole.\n\nSTORY:\n\nhumanity had fallen to a unknown parasitic spore that turns human into monstrous creatures (similar to 'the last of us'). Not much is truly know about where this virus came from or what the government's true goal where to combat it, only that it didn't work. They set up military run safe zones scattered across America. All residents are tagged and have to undergo strict quarantine procedures to maintain a health balance. (These quarantine zones are set up in the larger cities). Any known infected are shot on site.\n\nAnyone who living outside the safe zones have to fend for themselves, or join the ravagers; a well-known faction that only looks out for there own and have a tendency for bringing violent and death wherever they go. The ravagers are similar to a cult, using the virus as a excuse to provide their own style of leadership.\n\nThe roleplay takes place 15 years after the outbreak and follows both our characters as they are forced to work together to survive. (We can discuss details and such)\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nFor characters I'm looking for a M/F partnership but like in the last of us I'm hoping to go more down the route of grizzled old man/young teenage girl scenario as I feel it opens up more emotion and uniqueness to the story. I do love the father/daughter relationships that are commonly well portrayed in the post apocalyptic theme E.g. Logan, telltale's the walking dead. Everything else about your character is your own chose. Face claims are also welcome, I will be using them with my characters.\n\n\nI'm happy to play either the grizzled male character or the teenage female character. I have bios  for both.\n\n\nLOOKING FOR IN A PARTNER:\n\nI'm looking for a partner who is happy and willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. I want these character to eventually care for one another over time. Someone who isn't afraid to move the story along and create plot twists without warning. Players 18+ is a must. I want someone that is as excited to explore the world and characters as I am.\n\nTHEMES:\n\nTheme and genre wise. I'm looking for the roleplay to go into some dark themes(E.g. blood and gore) which is a must in a post apocalypse setting. players 18+ is a must. As I mentioned earlier, I'm also a fan of the father/daughter relationship (Logan,The last of us,Telltale's the walking dead) thats a must with the story I'm planning. Other themes are more than welcome but romance is off the table as that would be weird. Definitely a relationship between the characters but no romance. Thrills and action are a given as well.\n\n\nThanks for making it this far. If \u00a0your interested with the idea ,feel free to send me a message. Could you included a bit about yourself and what sort of thing you'd like to include (If you have a character idea already, send that over as well; only if you have it of course)\n\nHope to hear from you all soon:)",

That got me thinking and wondering what is the best way to deal with people ghosting or disappearing in an RP? I was also wondering what is the best way to make sure an RP partner is engaged and actually enjoying the RP. I like some weird subjects (I love medical scenes and sometimes that can go weird because I also like realism) and also can be a bit overbearing but I don't know how to tell if the other person is enjoying themselves or not without seeming overbearing. Because imo if both people aren't having fun their is no point to RP. So does anyone have any advice or tips ?",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nI'm looking for a dedicated partner for a post apocalyptic themed roleplay along the of the last of us. I have the plot idea below that gives you a bit of background on the story. \n\nA BIT ABOUT ME:\n\nI'm 23 y/o female, I would consider myself a proto-expert writer. \u00a0Post length for me depend on what fits with the story,I'd be happy with 2-3 paragraphs to 5-7; no one word/sentence replies please. I am new to this format but not to roleplay as a whole.\n\nSTORY:\n\nhumanity had fallen to a unknown parasitic spore that turns human into monstrous creatures (similar to 'the last of us'). Not much is truly know about where this virus came from or what the government's true goal where to combat it, only that it didn't work. They set up military run safe zones scattered across America. All residents are tagged and have to undergo strict quarantine procedures to maintain a health balance. (These quarantine zones are set up in the larger cities). Any known infected are shot on site.\n\nAnyone who living outside the safe zones have to fend for themselves, or join the ravagers; a well-known faction that only looks out for there own and have a tendency for bringing violent and death wherever they go. The ravagers are similar to a cult, using the virus as a excuse to provide their own style of leadership.\n\nThe roleplay takes place 15 years after the outbreak and follows both our characters as they are forced to work together to survive. (We can discuss details and such)\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nFor characters I'm looking for a M/F partnership but like in the last of us I'm hoping to go more down the route of grizzled old man/young teenage girl scenario as I feel it opens up more emotion and uniqueness to the story. I do love the father/daughter relationships that are commonly well portrayed in the post apocalyptic theme E.g. Logan, telltale's the walking dead. Everything else about your character is your own chose. Face claims are also welcome, I will be using them with my characters.\n\nI'm happy to play either the grizzled male character or the teenage female character. I have bios and samples for both.\n\nLOOKING FOR IN A PARTNER:\n\nI'm looking for a partner who is happy and willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. I want these character to eventually care for one another over time. Someone who isn't afraid to move the story along and create plot twists without warning. Players 18+ is a must. I want someone that is as excited to explore the world and characters as I am.\n\nTHEMES:\n\nTheme and genre wise. I'm looking for the roleplay to go into some dark themes(E.g. blood and gore) which is a must in a post apocalypse setting. players 18+ is a must. As I mentioned earlier, I'm also a fan of the father/daughter relationship (Logan,The last of us,Telltale's the walking dead) that a must with the story I'm planning. Other themes are more than welcome but romance is off the table as that would be weird. Definitely a relationship between the characters but no romance. Thrills and action are a given as well.\n\nThanks for making it this far. If \u00a0your interested with the idea ,feel free to send me a message. Could you included a bit about yourself and what sort of thing you'd like to include (If you have a character idea already, send that over as well; only if you have it of course)\n\nHope to hear from you all soon:)",

After falling in love with The Canterbury Tales, As well as several ballads, in English class, I resolved to roleplay something to quell my thirst for romantic era chivalry. This can be either plain medieval or fantasy. Of course, if we choose just medieval, there'll still be some elements of fantasy, it just won't be focused on purely a fantastical element.\n\nRules-\n\n1. No smut. It just makes me feel uncomfortable. But for maturity's sake, male partners between 17-25 please.\n\n2. Please have decent grammar. Improper grammar just really irks me. I'm a bit of a perfectionist.\n\n3. Length doesn't matter. If you're the type who's writing a paragraph or two per response, that's excellent! I love reading detailed responses. I just don't write like that, and if you don't eitger I'm completely okay with it. My rule is at least no one worders/liners.\n\n4. I really only roleplay on kik. In a pinch I'll roleplay on here, but kik is just so much more convenient to me.\n\nAnd that's it! My idea is loose, and we can really take this anywhere. PM me to get my kik user, and then we can discuss details on there. I look forward to hearing from you!!!",

            "selftext": "The Witcher Series follows our hero named Geralt of Rivia. The most notable game to date being The Witcher III. Here, we see your own characters explore the lands of Novigrad, Velen, Oxenfurt, Skellige and Toussaint. However, Novigrad and Velen (As well as the surrounding areas) will be the only areas as of now. You may choose to become a: \nPeasant, Warrior, Hunter, Mercenary, Vampire, Werewolf, Witch, Pellar and such, but we all know who you wanna be. Witchers. Witchers, like other characters, are accepted, but must take much of what they do seriously, and understand what a Witcher is, what they do, and how they are made. Witchers will also have access to a Bestiary and have the upper hand against different monsters.\n\nWitchers hunt monsters for coin, quite literally being monster hunters. Said monster hunters have two blades, Steel for Humans, and Silver for Monsters. They can also use several different Oils that can weaken monsters. You will learn more via research or becoming a Witcher yourself. \n\nWe're looking for any kind of roleplayers, honestly. With more people, we can expand to places like Skelliege, or Toussaint. As long as you're alright, you'll probably fit right in.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/kTHdvkS",

            "selftext": "Alright, this is a prompt that I pitched to another rper and it fizzled. I feel it had promise so here is the short and sweet background. There is a military academy that trains talented warriors and talented battlemages who go on to make their kingdom proud. Usually, they train separately as magic as their respective members come from different walks of society. However, an ingenius military commander sees a future where such people can bolster one another, build one another's strengths, lessen their weaknesses. That is where our characters come in, two students on either side who are going to experience their first exercises together.   \n**Now, what I am looking for in a partner!**  \nLiterate and capable of multiple paragraphs a post.  \nCreative and willing to pull the setting and story in their direction as well.  \nNo overly tragic characters.  \nOOC chat is not necessary but if you want, I have a Discord as well.  \nWilling to roleplay over Gdocs or E-Mail.  \nMale or Female character is fine but I rarely roleplay with romance as the focal point. I am alright with it, just not forced.  \n\n**Onto the Prompt!**  \n\nIt had to be a rain it was raining down whole lakes, hadn\u2019t it? It could not be a day when the sun was shining cheerily on the hills of rich green, when the birds were filling the air with their songs, and the breezes cut through the sultry afternoon with enough respite to bring an air of contentment to all. No, it had to be a day just enough freezing with the courtyard turned into a mire and the wind plastering fallen leaves against the heavy stone walls of the Ridge Fire Academy. That was the day that Lenners called Camdon an \u201canus faced cat fucker\u201d during morning inspection and send every lad within earshot into a helpless fit.   \nNow they stood in the pouring rain with hair plastered to their heads and their white tunics nearly clear with the wet, trousers wicking uncomfortably to their legs, and their boots sodden. Standing before them was the entirely neutral faced Headmaster Stephens, which meant he was furious and creative at the same time.\n\n\u201cI was going\u2026.to wait until a nice day for this little exercise! But since you princesses have the giggles, today will have to do.\u201d His voice carried beyond the steady sound of rain and wind with ease, he was a war hero used to shouting orders to whole armies. In his elder years when his hardened body was developing a paunch and his formerly steady hands a shake, he busied himself teaching war to boys. \n\n\u201cI am going inside to a warm fire, a roast, and some wine. I am locking the door behind me. I am putting Lieutenant Averans\u2026.\u201d He referred to a youth barely older than the boys with a currently soaked dark uniform and a permanently glum expression. \u201c...at that door with a bowl. Out here I hid twelve..brass balls. Since you lads have none, you are to work in teams of two to find them. You will notice there are twenty six of you. Two unfortunate lazy bastards will have nothing to give to Lieutenant Averans and will have to learn how fish survive.\u201d Youths started to eye one another in line, eyeing their roommates, friends, and kinsmen for preliminary pairing. \n\n\u201c....and\u2026\u201d Not a good sign. \u201c...before you milkmaids start picking your girlfriends to go frolic in the forest with\u2026.you have to pair up with someone outside your school. Shields, find yourself a Torch and make pals. Torches, find yourself a Shield and make nice. Any of you fail to do this, you can find all the balls in the world and Lieutenant Averans will direct you to the dryest bit of wet he can find because he is such a nice lad. You sneak in any door but this and you get to clean latrines for a month. You come in through a window, latrines. You hide in the cellar, latrines AND cellar. I make myself clear, lads?\u201d \n\nThere was a resounding \u201cYes, Headmaster\u201d which was punctuated by a crack of thunder, the thick ceiling of clouds showing no sign of respite upon the horizon. Demarc scowled as he had been eyeing Lenners, his bunkmate, and a boy who could find a virgin in the King\u2019s own court. He hadn\u2019t much experience with the Torches, he only saw them at mealtimes. He was a tall lad, near man now with a head of brown head that was currently plastered to his head. He stood a head taller than the tallest other boy and had a pedigree of soldiers stretching back to his great-grandfather on his father\u2019s side, his grandfather on his mothers. \n\nThe Headmaster dismissed himself back into the dry academy and left Demarc rubbing the back of his neck and groaning as Lenners elbowed him. \n\n\u201cSorry, mate, guess you have to carry a big heavy sack of mewling cats through this one. I better find my own to strap to my back and sink in the mud with. Headmaster is such a pile of moldy bullshit.\u201d Demarc laughed and shook his head, a dramatic groan. \n\n\u201cFind the smallest one and you can toss him into high places or shove him into holes to search for you, like a badger killing dog.\u201d  \n\n*P.S. Shoutout to Oglaf for the bestest of insultery.*  \n",

I prefer shorter fast responses, but like longer ones when they\u2019re called for. \n\nWith all that being said, I primarily play male roles but I\u2019m flexible. As this is romance please be 18+ as I like some smut with my plot. I\u2019m willing to do any kind of pairing, male/male, male/female, female/female. \n\nI\u2019m interested in doing a fantasy or slice of life plot. I love pairings like vampire/human, angel/human, demon/human, etc. Now romance can get old if it\u2019s not exciting so I want some drama filled ideas too, maybe the pair have to sneak around or something. \n\nSo if you have an idea or want to hash something out, message me!

He saw that he had powers no one else had he didn't question it he was better than everyone else and that's all that mattered to him. His parents taught him others were weak and he was perfect mostly out of fear, Abraham was a spoiled brat and in a tantrum he removed them from his life so they could not bother him. It didn't bother him they were dead if they died they were weak. He led a solitary life asserting his dominance in small ways until the age of 12 when he had an idea. \"I'm the strongest I should be in charge.\" So he marched up the front steps of the white house tearing it apart as he did obliterating everyone in his wake. Word spread of the boy with god like powers and attempts on his life were made, with every failed assassination Abraham seemed stronger and with new powers to wipe his enemies off the face of the earth. Soon Abraham was the undisputed ruler of the earth no army could match him so most followed his every command out of fear. Now at the age of 25 his will his absolute no one daring challenge him. People live in constant fear with Abraham now calling himself Paragon viewing himself as perfection ruling with an iron fist.\n\nI am looking for someone to rp the above story with me my primary character will be another superhuman looking to usurp Abraham your character will help do so. Your character can have powers or not whichever you prefer. As stated in the title this will be third person rp and have detailed responses. I use Discord or reddit pms as my mediums. I am fine with romance but only m4f and if it doesn't feel forced. Pm me if interested where I can go into more details there I can describe the world better and my own character and his powers. I am very open to input of the world especially the origin of the powers.\n\n",

            "selftext": "**About Me:** \n\n- I'm in college so posting won't be rapid. And also working.\n\n- I give about three to five paragraphs.\n\n- I want us to use canon characters.\n\n- I stick to third person, past tense.\n\n- I tend to stick to reddit, google docs, or email. I am open not open to groups right now. I have enough responsibilities here and on another site to juggle groups or stuff like discord or kik or skype. So please don't message me looking for discord or groups.\n\n- It's important we keep in touch to plot and stay on the same page. My partner should be happy and eager to post and that means voicing what we both want to happen. I love chatting with my partners. I also like knowing if any delay is gonna happen, if you need to wait a couple weeks, that's cool. I'm a patient person. I try to be chill but try not to keep me on the hook for too long. Generally speaking if we need a break, I'm fine as long as I'm not kept in the dark about it.\n\n- Mature content is okay with me but I don't like it creeping into the RP frequently. My focus is on storytelling, not ripping off one another's clothes or seeing who can create the music epic combat scenes. Also any characters who might be under 18 will be aged up to be 18 for romantic plots. \n\n- Lastly the general tone of my RPs tend to be light and focused on slice of life stuff. I don't need tons of action or dramatics happening all the time because it's just going to drain my motivation to post. To me writing is about escape and life is too dramatic to have it being written about as well.\n\n**Fandoms:** Okay so below are a collection of canons I can play and ones I am seeking for someone to play for me. I am open for doubling and sharing roles. Please PM me to talk about plot and pairs.

I am only a beginner so skill level is irrelevant: I\u2019d appreciate tutorage from a higher skilled guy, but I\u2019m very happy to just be two newbies throwing themselves at it. I\u2019m pretty much flexible about everything which I know isn\u2019t ideal but I don\u2019t know where to start really. I like fantasy and sci-fi but I\u2019m willing to broaden my horizons. Romance is optional, I quite like the idea of a day to day romantic interactions but if you don\u2019t want to do that that\u2019s ok too. Telegram and Skype are very similar so either one is fine we can message or if you really want to push my poor self-conscious self we could talk face to face to discuss the kind of world we're writing in and whatnot. I\u2019m currently in sixth form so I\u2019m busy for at least half of each day however I will usually respond as quick as I can. Since I\u2019m new what we write on is up for debate, though google docs seems like a decent choice. Tenses aren\u2019t an issue for me, neither is the person, first and third are fine, so is present and past tense. Anything I\u2019ve missed I\u2019m open for debate about.

            "selftext": "Hello r/roleplay. As the title suggests I'm looking for interesting, experience and literate new roleplaying parterns.  I\u2019m 29, reside within the Eastern Standard timezone and have been roleplaying for well over a decade. I love utilizing my imagination and creative spirit into a story we can both enjoy. I\u2019m flexible in the types and genders of the characters I play as well as the themes of roleplay I enjoy.\n\nI have a ton of experience in slice of life, romantic, X-Men. Game of Thrones. Harry Potter roleplays as well as criminal syndicates, historical re-enactment scenes and just about anything else under the sun. While I enjoy playing using established universes I rarely stick exactly to canon and find it dull to do so. I love developing roles that we both enjoy and playing them out in the direction that either of us desire. All I ask is that my partner has an idea of the type of characters and roles they'd like to play.\n\nApathy doesn't lend to great roleplay in my experience. Also I will be forthright in saying that sex doesn\u2019t tend to be the focus of my stories however it does have its place in well progressed scenes. Being that my scenes tend to lean towards the mature I\u2019d prefer all potential partners be at least 21+. If my lack of desire to rush into heavy sexual detail is a dealbreaker for you then I\u2019m probably not your girl.\n\nAlso I'm not a fan of anime, video games, WWE, celebrity roles, Star Wars or aliens so if you're looking for any roleplay based in that I'm not interested.\n\nIn terms of availability I\u2019m around most afternoons and early evenings for chat and prefer to play via discord, google hangouts or e-mail. I keep my responses somewhere between 4 to 9 paragraphs depending on the scene and tend to be detailed in my writings. Someone who feels capable of matching that would probably be the best match for me. I also have a regular life and relationships outside of roleplaying so there will be times periodically that I won\u2019t be able to play however I\u2019ll always let you know before I go no contact. Anywho if this ad interests you feel free to message or reddit chat me to speak further or exchange contact details. If this ad is still up regardless of it\u2019s age I\u2019m still seeking new partners.",

            "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nAbout me: I'm located in the Pacific time zone in the USA and I'm in my 30s. I started text-based roleplay back in the AOL days when RhyDin was around. Besides text-based RP (AOL, Yahoo chats, MUDs), I also play D&amp;D and various video games. \n\nI'm looking for long-term, 1x1, story-based roleplay. I like to play original characters set in a medieval/fantasy setting but am also open to crossovers, original ideas, and new settings. Depending what setting/time period we agree upon depends on the character I make up so they're always fresh and new!\n\nI do ask that my partner be 18+. No exceptions. I don't mind getting into mature themes but I do not want the roleplay to be based around that only. I like character development, telling stories with our characters, I like them building a life for themselves and going on adventures. The most important thing is to let things happen organically between the characters.\n\nIt's okay if you don't want to play an original character or a character that isn't from the medieval times. I don't like to play complete fandoms, though, so I don't want my character to be stuck in a pre-made world. World building is part of the fun!\n\nI like to be rather active in roleplay so 2-3 days between posts doesn't work for me. I can post several times a day depending on time zone differences. I understand that life happens and I'm very understanding of that as long as you communicate with me.\n\nI prefer role-playing in the third person. I'll do my best to match your length but I tend to average 2-3 paragraphs, depending on the situation. Hopefully, we both understand that sometimes the situation does call for a few lines here and there. It's okay, no pressure, it's all about fun.\n\nWhen it comes to grammar and spelling it's okay if it's not perfect. Goodness knows mine isn't! But please no text speak! I'm okay with changing the way a word is spelled if it's being pronounced differently (i.e. \"yer\", \"tae\", etc).\n\nWhat else, what else...\n\nI should add that I enjoy OOC talk. I realize this isn't everyone's cup of tea but sometimes we just need a break, to chat about the RP, go over plots, or need a few days off. Open communication is a must in this regard. I'm so tired of people ghosting because they don't want to say something isn't working.\n\nThe only thing left to cover here is where I prefer to role-play. I've come to prefer Discord because of their servers which help organize things. I will not RP over Kik, Reddit PM, or email.\n\nIf any of this sounds good to you please message me! When you do give a short introduction plus what you're looking for so I have an idea and we can go from there. Looking forward to it!",

I've been looking for roleplay servers, but I really couldn't find any of my type. So I made my own roleplay server!\n\nHonorable Features\n\n- A complete map of the roleplay server\n- Over 15 free houses, and over 13 stores you can buy\n- Restaurant, electronics store, etc.\n- House maps!\n- Different channels for locations\n- An NSFW channel, a fluff channel, but if you're not that kind of person, you can request for a SFW role, which will remove all nsfw channels for your perspective\n\nDescription\n\nBennyvampire, the title says it all! It's a server about vampires, werewolves, wolfs, whatever you like! As long as it's not OP, it's allowed. (Disclaimer: Characters must be approved by Bennyvampire (me) first to make sure they are not too OP)\n\nChannels\n\nYou have a music channel, various channels for memes, a pictures channel and art channel, polls, voice chat, and a general chat channel.\n\nLink\n\nhttps://discord.gg/Cr8MXbj\n",

            "selftext": "Hi, hey, hello!\n\nI\u2019m just going to jump right to the point so we can save all the chitchat for OOC Chat. ;D \n\nI\u2019m 26 and I have been roleplaying for about ten years, on several platforms, though my favorite right now would be email because I can access email at work. I work Monday through Friday from 9am-6pm EST so majority of my week day is busy, but I do have quite a bit of time to write during down time while I\u2019m at work. \n\nI prefer third person for my writing, and it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to share writing samples (from previous roleplays). I like fantasy, horror, fandom, drama, sci-fi, slice of life, etc. Romance is fine, but not as a plot genre- sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Also, cannon characters are fine but OCs allow for more character development. As far as OCs go, I prefer writing as female, but will do FxF and FxM pairings. \n\nI don\u2019t mind NSFW subjects but I would want to work it all out in OOC ahead of time instead of throwing it into the roleplay last minute. The only thing I ask is please be 18+ (honestly 20+ is preferred), and please communicate with me. If you have limits/triggers, please make me aware. \n\nCommunication is extremely important, without it the both of us will be clueless, so feel free to contact me about anything and I\u2019ll do the same for you! I could use email/discord/kik for OOC but would prefer email for the actual roleplay itself (though you could try to convince me otherwise). \n\nI have a couple of prompts/plots but I would love to hear your ideas. I don\u2019t want to carry the team the whole way by myself, so help pull your end of the rope and we will do awesome together! :)\n\nIf interested, PM me!",

I\u2019d love to find someone to RP with.\n\nI RP multi-paragraph and prefer that my partner does the same. I\u2019m not a super stickler for grammar, but I do prefer proficiency. If our story really vibes, I don\u2019t mind some exchanges being longer or shorter if we click. \n\nI\u2019m a huge sucker for romance- but I really love to build up (the relationship and the story behind it are what makes the romance great!) I\u2019m cool with leading into some NSFW situations, but only if you\u2019re 21+. I\u2019m 24, so I prefer someone who is older than I am, it\u2019s just a comfort thing. \n\nI usually play an OC that I\u2019m quite fond of. I\u2019m cool with most realistic/SOL plots. I have a few, but try throwing me a new one! I\u2019m also a *huuuuge* sucker for accents (southern US usually, but not a necessity). \n\nHopefully we can connect! Thanks for reading!

I want this to be Longterm with elements of romance, action, drama and all the things like that, I want it be adult as well, like the movies and comics. Your character can be anything from a girl in my school I\u2019ve had a crush on for years or maybe someone else who decides to be a hero! Choice is yours as long as it\u2019s interesting, detailed and well thought out. If your interested send me a message on here with a bit about you, your character and what you want from this RP. ",

            "selftext": "Hello ladies of r/roleplay, I'm hoping to find another with a similar interest in a less than hospitable world. I'm looking for a darker tale filled with pain, anger, joy, and lust. While I do enjoy the anime style stories where the hero prevails and all is good in the world I want something with more struggle.\n\nSo here I am looking for a partner who would like to join me in this self created world. I only ask that you come to me with the intent of creating an original character and that you are descriptive with responses. I will get bored if you lack detail and only respond with one or two sentances at a time. A paragraph at least when our characters are talking back and forth isn't too much to ask for. I am open to either 3rd or 1st person text so let me know which you prefer to use. As mentioned in my title I use discord and if you want to discuss more there PM me your username.\n\nFor the plot I have a few ideas and worlds in mind so you can either pick one below or we can come up with something new together. Let me know what you like most and we can build the rest of the world together.\n\nIdea 1: Death, hate, and power are the only things humanity understands anymore as their world is beset by chaos. Death comes in the form of insane cultists follower dark impulses. Demons litter the landscape being the monsters that lead the cults against any who refuse to join their dark gods. Few countries have any form of goverment left as humanity flees ancient homelands finding refugee across the sea. Things are no better as they are now seen as invaders by the other races that live there. \n\nIdea 2: tyrants and monsters the emperor sends his armies to conquer the rest of the relm wanting to be ruler of the known world. His war marches from one country to the next but corruption in it's wake begins to slow his war efforts. The lands he conquers are left in ruins from earth shattering magic. The keepers ment to bring law and order only give in to greed hampering the war and sowing discord among the different nobel factions fighting in their lords name. \n\nIdea 3: A tale of two worlds, the underworld is open to the mortel relms. At first war breaks out but now there is a fake peace between some groups on each side. The mortals are often seen as peons and worthless for nothing but food or laborers. The mortal's see those of the underworld as monster and demons needing to be killed or controlled. Life is hard for those who try to live peacfully at the borders of the two worlds.",

            "selftext": "Scott had settled back in his pilot seat of his freighter after activating the FTL drive, and watched the viewscreen for a moment. He glanced over at the empty co-pilot seat, and sighed, lamenting that his friend had quit. Maybe I'll find someone at the next station, he thought. On top of being his co-pilot, the woman had been a casual lover. Scott was young, just shy of being thirty Standard Years old, and was handsome enough. He had light brown hair, a bit long and shaggy, and pulled into a tight ponytail at the moment. He had bright green eyes, and an easy smile. He thought well enough of himself to be confident that filling the seat would be no difficult task.\n\nHe picked up a datapad, and started to scroll through galactic news, and froze as he heard a noise from below. That's not normal, he thought, and set the datapad aside. He unstrapped his crash webbing, and stood up from the seat, and pulled his blaster. Probably a rodent from the station. He set the blaster to its stun setting, and went down the ladder to the common area.\n\nNothing out of place here. He continued on, and opened the hatch to the cargo bay. He palmed the control near the door, activating the lights. \"Come here, you little...\" He held the blaster low as he walked among the crates, searching for whatever had made the noise. He heard a scuffle behind himself, and whipped around. \"Gotcha,\" he yelled. \n\nHe lowered the blaster immediately, lest he shoot the girl crouched between a row of crates.  After a moment, he lifted it back up, in case she was a threat.  \"Easy, now,\" he said as much to himself as to her, \"let's not have to use this.  Hands where I can see them.\"\n\n--------\n\nThat's a possible way our characters meet.  The universe is undecided.  It could be Star Wars, Star Trek, Wing Commander, etc., or none of them at all.  While there would be alien races, I would want your character to be human, as this will likely lead to some adult action, and interspecies play isn't my thing.  On top of this, there may be dark themes, the kind which come with combat, boarding parties, the kind of scum one deals with at a space station, etc.\n\nSpeaking of adult action, I am an adult.  You must be, as well, though I would prefer your character to be younger than mine.  \n\nI usually do 2-3 paragraphs per post.  Sometimes more, sometimes less.  It all depends on what's called for.  I would like the same from you.\n\nIf you're interested, hit me up, and we can exchange Discord IDs to discuss this further.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, I guess I am what you would call a veteran roleplayer. I have ten years of experience with writing and have many blogs on Tumblr dedicated to roleplay- however, I can't seem to find the right people on Tumblr anymore. So I have expanded my horizons and began to look elsewhere, but that's not important. As a part of the Tokyo Ghoul community for a little over four years, I would like someone who is somewhat committed to the series. This includes reading TG:RE as I am not spoiler free.\n\n**Where?**\n\u3010 \u27a2 I am open to anything. Email, tumblr, kik, whatever. I will go out of my way to meet you half way. \u3011\n\n**Who Do You Roleplay?**\n\u3010 \u27a2 Touka Kirishima. I am able to flex to Kaneki or any other TG characters of your choosing, but I am most experienced with Touka. \u3011\n\n**What Are You Looking For?**\n\u3010 \u27a2 I would love to find myself a Kaneki or Haise to RP with, but again, any TG characters. I am hesitant with OCs but it can't hurt to ask. \u3011\n\n**How Much Writing?**\n\u3010 \u27a2 I really don't mind. I have roleplayed with it all. Single sentence, paragraph or literate. It's up to you. \u3011\n\n**What'll be in the RP?**\n\u3010 \u27a2 There is a reason I would like a mature partner. This means 18+ and there is absolutely no way around that. 18+ set in stone. This is because I am alright with immense violence and smut. \u3011\n\n**Shipping?**\n\u3010 \u27a2 Yep. I will never start a roleplay with romance however, as I believe it has to be earned between the two characters. Canon or not, the characters must develop together. \u3011",

            "selftext": "Helloooo everyone!\n\nI'm looking for a long-term RP partner to join me in exploring the characters we create and the worlds we help build through out our RP adventure. I'm also looking for a friend I guess, someone to talk to in OOC about the RP and anything else!\n\n**Settings I'd love to RP in**\n\n*Overwatch* -Big lore nerd for OW. One of my favorite characters to play as is Sombra, I love busting out google translate to add some Spanish in dialogue as well :P. As for what you would play I don't really care, I love everyone in this freakin' game. I do love romance in this as well. Bonus points if you are interested^in^playing^Widow.\n\n*Warcraft*- Been playing WoW for a decade now and I still fuckin' love it. I've been RPing in that game for around seven years now so I have all sorts of characters I can bust out. The universe is huge so there is endless possibilities.\n\n*Elder Scrolls*- I'll be honest, I don't know a great deal of the lore but I am a sucker for Skyrim and Oblivion. If we choose this I'll need to be guided a little bit, sorry!\n\n*Fallout*- Loooove me some post apocalyptic RP. I can play in any of the games settings and I know a lot about the lore and such. Interested in playing a raider to a BoS member, perhaps. Lots of ideas in my mind for this prompt as it is my favorite at the moment.\n\n*Soul Eater*- It's been awhile since I've watched the anime but I enjoyed it a lot. Feel like it is a great setting for 1 on 1 RPs because being a weapon and a mister is such a personal experience between two people.\n\n*Monster Girls*- Don't know much about the lore of the actual universe but I love the concept. Some ideas I have for this is I am some exotic creature your character has to hide in a big city or your character crash lands on an unknown island that is owned by some monster lady.\n\nSuggest one! If you have a cool idea for some prompt be sure to tell me! I'm keeping an open mind to anything and everything! I know these are all really bare bones but trust me, I have loads of ideas bouncing around in my mind. I just didn't want to make my post even longer!\n\n\n---\n\n\n**What I'm looking for in a Partner/What I can offer**\n\n-\tLooking for someone who can post around a paragraph per response or more. I try to aim for a paragraph per response but I tend to increase or decrease the word count depending on whats going on in a story.\n\n-\tRP on Reddit. I only RP on Reddit, Sorry!\n\n-\tOpen to NSFW themes. I'll be honest, I do love me some smut every once and awhile but I -don't- want it being the main subject in an RP. Violence is a-okay with me too.\n\n-\tBe around the PST timezone or able to work around it. I live in California and I do like doing back and fourth responses. Basically I just don't want the story only progressing at a snails pace because of one of us being asleep. I totally understand being busy with irl things, would just like a heads up and I will do the same!\n\n-\tCreativity! I love partners with interesting ideas brought to the table. I also try my best to bring up new and interesting ideas to make things feel fresh!\n\n-\tI also like to draw so maybe if we are really enjoying the story/characters I can doodle something up! :3\n\nAnyways, I really appropriate you reading my prompt and I hope we can make something amazing together! Please don't have a one line response, tell me about yourself and what you like to roleplay with! Please PM me if you're interested! &lt;3",

You don't have to know everything about the game, just at least be somewhat knowledgeable of who the characters are! I'm looking for someone who will put detail and effort into their replys. I don't expect walls of text, just enough detail appropriate for the situation! I would like someone who can play mutiple characters as well. I don't expect anyone to play 10 characters at once however! The most I would expect in most situations is two, maybe three if it feels needed. I also would prefer if you were okay with being in a controlling role, and be alright with some violence/darker themes in rp. I don't mind if your male or female, as long as your okay with playing female characters! I would like if you could send at least one reply daily, although I have much more free time in my schedule! I am free almost every weekend, and in the afternoons on most weekdays. I will try to alert you if I have to go suddenly! If you know you are going to be gone for a while, just tell me!(Unless it's some sort of emergency, I understand people aren't able to simply predict when something bad is going to happen!).\n\nSo the story would be this: My character would be a 17 year old teenager who ran away from home, sneaking aboard a cargo ship. For the last 6 months, I've been traveling the world this way, before accidentally coming across Watchpoint: Gibraltar\n\nIf your interested, please pm me!",

Most of the world is still reeling from the outcome. The previously defunct Witcher caste has been reinstated by the few remaining Witchers there are. The remaining Schools, Cat and Griffin, have traded their knowledge of mutagen creation so that they can perform the Trials once again.\n\nNow it is 1775, in the midst of the aftermath of the 2nd Conjunction, and you can have a role in what the future looks like.\n\nA WitcherRP is a story-based RP subreddit and is open to any and all with a desire to tell the stories of their characters. It\u2019s a big world with hundreds of role to choose from, and maybe you'll find one you'd like to play!\n\nYou can visit our Character Creation thread and if you have any questions our Discord chat is open to you!\n\nHope to see you join us in the new world on the Continent!\n",

I do not want smut to be a focus but I have no problem with sexual stuff coming up in RP and enjoy when it does (provided it makes sense). I do not play canon characters, and I only play females. I'd prefer that you play men, but I'm open to FXF pairings and don't care what your sex is. \n\nYou must be over 21 (I'm 31). ",

I'm married, very happily, I tend to avoid smut as it doesn't really add much to the story, willing to fade to Black on it\n\n--I'm in the Central Time zone\n\n--I usually work evenings and nights, but I post as often as I can and sometimes that schedule changes. Sometimes it's once a week, sometimes it's more. Just please understand that I have a life outside of the internet and I'll respect that you have a life schedule as well\n\n--As previously mentioned, I like plotting with my partner before we start. I also like chatting! I find that roleplays flow better when I good chemistry with my partner, so that's what I strive for\n\n--My post lengths vary, usually between 1-3 paragraphs. I try to match my partner, but sometimes I get bit by the writing bug or I get a case of writers block. I at least strive for 2 paragraphs on my bad days. Happens to everyone right?\n\nHere's the deal.\n\nThe Evil Dead, it was a movie I loved growing up, and really was what made me as sarcastic as I am to this day. The campyness, the over the top Gore, the pure insanity of it all! I love it and still do to this day. Seeing the main character back in action is awesome, and the new show itself is amazing! Considering a plot that revolves around a small paranormal investigative team similar to Ash vs. the Evil Dead The team can be as big as we'd like, but the initial thought is to focus on three main people working on various cases. However, I encourage doubling (at least minor characters) for this RP! As we get more of a plot going, in time we can switch out the characters doing \"field work\" (besides, the world is bigger than the two of us, right?) But the main ship that I want is my OC/Kelly from the show itself. Definitely not against an OC/OC ship, that is just a preference.\n\nAs for the cases we deal with, we can play around with it! Ghosts! Witches! Demons! Maybe throw in a naga or a yandere for good measure! Whatever we want! I've never done an RP like this before, so it'd be interesting to see what stuff we can come up with!\n\nI imagine that a decent amount of action, horror, and suspense will go into this, so we can discuss how NSFW this RP can get. Also, I'm a sucker for romance, but not at the start. It'd be nice to include it, but obviously not all at once. I'd like to plan this as a long term RP, so we can take the plot in stride as we need\n\nIf this plot seems interesting, then let's discuss! PM me.",

I'll be playing a character from scratch, and it'll be your job to help me build the world by controlling all the enemies I could face.\n\nNow, there will be few changes to how equipment is handled. Things like catalysts, weight, elemental resistance, and all that will apply. The main difference will be that some weapons wouldn't have existed in the games, and the weapons won't be locked into a single moveset.\n\nSo anyway, about me. I am male, 18, single, and bored. I'll be playing any gender. The story can be SFW or NSFW, it doesn't matter to me. I tend to reply as often as I can, but understand that I'm narcoleptic, so I may legitimately just pass out on you once in a while.\n\nAnywho, if you're interested, PM me here and we can talk out the details, and I can get you on Discord.",

            "selftext": "I'm just here to advertise a not so unique theme for roleplaying but my standards and ideas for it are a lot more specific so let's see if anyone is interested! \n\nI imagine \"Magical Girl\" RP could entail a lot of different things but I am more specifically looking for someone who is comfortable crafting a longterm plot within the genre which would include OC's and some basic worldbuilding. I am not looking to RP any canon series at this time but if you are a fan of series like Cutie Honey, Sailor Moon, or Cardcaptor Sakura, you are definitely in the right direction for the genre.\n\nI enjoy most aspects of the magical girl genre, especially cartoonish drama, avid girlishness, flashy powers, high amounts of action, colorful and detailed sequences, the potential for romance, and much more. If some of the appeal it has for me sounds rather cliche and silly, well... that is kind of the point. I like going overtly over-the-top with this sort of thing so if roleplaying a realistically dramatic magical girl plot is something you've wanted to do or think you'd enjoy, then I'm definitely a roleplayer for you!\n\nI am usually a rather easygoing partner, meaning that I am not too strict about having a dedicated plot ready. I am more than happy to play as we go and figure out specific details out through discussion but I do require a partner who is literate and social enough to communicate such things outside of roleplay. I also require at least a multi-sentence reply standard for the roleplay. I am always happy to find mutual creativity with partners and would love to hear any ideas or interests you might have! :) \n\nThere is no set story for this right now, I'd like to figure out most of that with a partner who likes most of the stuff I mentioned in this ad, which I think will make it quite easy to do after that.\n\nAs the ad reads, this is a F/F roleplay so if it sounds like something you might enjoy and all the requirements check out, just send me a message on reddit and we can talk here or move onto another site like Discord, Skype, etc! Thanks and I hope to find some interested roleplayers! :) \n\n(If you would like to continue off the site, please leave your Discord/Skype in the message in case I'm not on so I can add you without delay.)",

Something romantic but nonsexual, something cuddly and happy and snuggly. I know it's not for everyone but I'm just looking for someone who'd want to give it a shot. I roleplay third person paragraph style and I can play either a man or a woman. I prefer to work over PM or Discord but I'm openminded. If you'd like we can discuss plots and scenarios over PM :) And if you'd like to try a fandom we can discuss it! I'm open to trying a fandom! I know they\u2019re real life people but maybe something with the Rooster Teeth personalities, I\u2019m open :)",

            "selftext": "English Version:\n\n\nIt is 2033. In 2013 the Soviet Union entered a Third World War, this war only lasted mere weeks before the entire country was destroyed by Nuclear Bombs. The local population flooded into the nearby Metro Tunnels throughout the Country. Two of the biggest targets were Moscow, and Leningrad. Years after the bombs dropped genetic mutations began to appear within those who were affected by the Nuclear Bombs. Animals became savages, and humans either died of radiation poisoning, or became something horrible. Factions began to appear throughout the Metro's of Leningrad, also known as St. Petersburg Metro. The first faction appear being the Red Line, and the Rangers of the Order. The Red Line is a Neo-Communist group believing in the pre-war teachings and portrayals of communism. The Rangers consist of some Pre-War military members, and believe more in their personal integrity, and honour. \n\nThroughout the years more factions in the stations of Leningrad appeared. The Spetsnaz Remnant of Leningrad, the Fourth Reich, Bandits, Children of the Underground of Leningrad, Brotherhood of Lenin, and the Kartooshkan Police Force. The Kartooshkan Police Force originated by a group of Rangers who were exiled, forcing them to retreat past a Red Line station as a means of avoiding their angered Ranger counterparts. When they came to Kartooshka, the station was a mess, unorganized, and had no political structure. They solved these issues overtime, fixing the power situation, establishing contact with traders, and ensuring the stations economic prosperity. Unfortunately, by 2032, the Red Line, and the Fourth Reich's war approached the station. Kartooshka, now stuck in the middle of the war, is at constant risk for invasion by either the Reich, or the Reds. But they also remain a trading hub for the nearby factions.\n\n**Want to join the KPF or experience life in Kartooshka?

            "selftext": "The car came to rest at the trunk of a tree. Smoke poured from the radiator as Nate lifted his head, now bloodied by the impact of the wreck. His vision was blurred as he looked to the passenger seat to see, Amanda. Her eye was black as the now deflated airbag rested below her as the seatbelt held her snuggly. \"How did we get here?\" His inner dialogue began. A few days prior they were simply seniors in high school, but his hunt for bigger game brought them together, as did her potential nymphomania. Amanda was different to say the least. A wild girl, with a leash. Her mouth getting her in more trouble then it was really worth. \n\nNathan on the other hand, when he was 12 his mother drove them to a lake to feed the birds nearby, after a few word exchanges and one last kiss. The troubled woman drove thier car into the lake. Killing herself and leaving Nate and his father alone. This began a bout of animal murder, and some self mutilation. His hand was scarred from placing it on a smoldering stove burner when he was 13. He had a bloodlust from his adolescence that lead him to mutilate small animals. But he needed more, that's when he found, Amanda, a fellow senior with a passion for being brash, and very rude. However, it's very apparent that he was unsuccessful in his venture to kill her twisted soul.\n\nHope my excerpt got people interested! It's basically a plagiarized version of a show/comic called \"The End of the fucking world\" the female is totally up to you however, I just needed a name to include along with my OC. I do hope this finds a potential Partner, I want to explore the minds of two slowly maturing 18 year olds. The akwardness that it will provide, and the wonderful story we can make.\n\nI'm 29 years old. I'd like a partner that's preferably someone in their 20s or older, simply because I mesh better with that age group. I'm married, very happily, I tend to avoid smut as it doesn't really add much to the story, willing to fade to Black on it\n\n--I'm in the Central Time zone\n\n--I usually work evenings and nights, but I post as often as I can and sometimes that schedule changes. Sometimes it's once a week, sometimes it's more. Just please understand that I have a life outside of the internet and I'll respect that you have a life schedule as well\n\n--As previously mentioned, I like plotting with my partner before we start. I also like chatting! I find that roleplays flow better when I good chemistry with my partner, so that's what I strive for\n\n--My post lengths vary, usually between 1-3 paragraphs. I try to match my partner, but sometimes I get bit by the writing bug or I get a case of writers block. I at least strive for 2 paragraphs on my bad days. Happens to everyone right?\n\nIf this plot seems interesting, then let's discuss! PM me.",

Thus, I decided to create a group by creating the future version of one of my favorite canceled shows, Young Justice. Odds are you've seen the show and you want in. The link to the Google doc will be provided down below. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me on Discord! (Schroeder#6760)\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/161wjGaihYQPzxJomLxMr_tPvCVRzDbuFhUEmEmxDNak/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThis Google doc outlines the basic idea of what I envision. It is in the future (30 years or so), so it allows for new characters (OCs) to be integrated into the group as well as developed characters in this appropriate timeline. For now, the group will be accepting OCs only and will be expected to spend some time creating a biography sheet. I do have some storylines that I want to help flesh out with the involvement of other characters as well as develop relations with other characters. If you are interested, please don't be shy :).\n\nThank you and have a nice day. ",

Ever wanted to see Len and Rin team up to investigate the disappearance of Hatsune Miku on Valentine's Day? Or Neru and V4 Flower at the kissing booth? Anything goes in this wild and wacky place! We're a super friendly, casual Discord roleplay group, but be careful of the Australians, they really get you :thinking: \n\nThere are a large number of characters available such as DEX, Piko, Maika and so on! We also accept gender bent versions of Vocaloids such as Mikuo and Kaiko. \n\nStill interested?

I'd like to do build-up romantic roleplay. Sex can be involved but is not the focus of the roleplays. \nI like things to be centered around the characters growing together towards a romance.\n\nIf you're interested please message me in the Dm's. I'd love to talk and work something out.\n\nI don't mind chatting OOC but if you don't want that then it's fine as well.\n\n\nAnyways, I'll see you soon hopefully.\nCheers!",

            "selftext": "#Hello there! First things first, I only have Reddit on my laptop. Therefore, I do not receive notifications when a PM is sent. Please have patience as I will likely respond between a 2-hour time window. I promise I'm not ignoring you! I just go to school full time. \n\n###I am currently looking for a male or someone who can play a male to do a modern day, romance roleplay! I exclusively use Discord and am not willing to use any other platform. Sorry! \ud83d\ude05\n\nI have been roleplaying for about 5 years now, and I guess one could say I am pretty good. I also am currently writing my own novels. I always roleplay full lit, and my responses are typically 1-3 paragraphs. Of course, that will vary between responses, as they depend on the course the plot is taking. Usually at the beginning, my responses will be pretty long (3-5), but of course, they will go down in length as the scene and characters are introduced and established. Remember, quality over quantity! I do usually do NSFW in my role plays, and would like someone who is capable of integrating it into the plot without making it the main focus or rushing into it.\n\nThough I'm pretty open to all role play idea's I prefer, if not exclusively, do romance plots. However, this does not mean its sub-genre can't be something else! For example, I did a role play a while ago involving a mayor who was at a constant risk of being assassination and her bodyguard, who protected her with all he had. The main genre was romance and the sub-genre was drama/action! ***I do not, however, do fandoms, fantasy, or any pre-modern plots, especially medival (Though the most back I am willing to go in a time era is the 1930\u2019s)***\n\n###Here are some good things to do, and bad things to do/be when roleplaying with me!\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0Please be literate! I don't ask you to speak like a human dictionary, but I do ask you to be mindful of basic grammar skills. *For example, knowing the difference between to/too/two, their/there/they're, wear/where proper spelling of simple words etc.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Try and 'mirror' my replies. *For example, when I write a reply of a few paragraphs, I would expect the same in response. Likewise, when I write a few sentences, you don't have to write a whole novel of a reply.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0I would really love to be able to talk out of character, both for planning and just to talk! It's absolutely not necessary, but I just because I feel as though a good relationship between partners can always improve the role play and better the communication of what is going on in the plot.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Though not an absolute requirement, I prefer when the partner I'm role playing with chooses characters that have the 'Alpha Male' Personality. (Being confident, Dominating, Cocky, Aggressive, Possessive, sometimes a total dick)\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I like when my partners can come up with new characters and personalities unlike the last for the different role plays we may do.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do pretty much only Third person. I just prefer it, but I may be willing to change it to First\ud83d\ude04\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't use text speech or little asterisks when you write. I really prefer when my partner writes just as a book would be. *For example; She looked up at him with big eyes, shining from the tears in them. \"You don't understand, do you.\" She murmurs lowly, trying to contain herself. \"I love you and you don't even look at me\"*\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just I will you, please understand if my replies aren't immediate. I do go to school full time and I hope you can understand when I don\u2019t respond quickly. I will be able to reply throughout the day, just don't get upset if I reply a little later than when you sent it. I will, of course, be just as understanding with you!\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though a character face claim is not necessary, I like them to get a better image of what your character looks like. Also, I need all characters to have a bio, as it makes things like personality and background more clear. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD *PLEASE* NO ANIME FC. \n\nThough I don't have very many plot ideas at the moment, I have lots of OC's and I am more than willing to hear any ideas you have and even brainstorm a new one together!\n\n###REMINDER! If I go a few days without replying/messaging you, *please* don't think I left you hanging! I am likely either busy, or your message didn't come through to me! I will never end a role play without telling you I am doing so.\n\nWith that being said, if you're reading this, you just got brownie points for reading until the end! Congrats! \ud83d\ude0a I hope to hear from you soon! Have a super awesome day!\n\nMuch love, Apple Valentina\n\n***PS!

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am writing this to seek out one new writing partner. I have embarked on the long and arduous journey towards a PhD, which will limit my availability considerably. But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nI'd like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. I would also love a Dragon Age Inquisition plot. I'm no expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed the game.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",
