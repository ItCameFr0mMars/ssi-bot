            "selftext": "We are both crew on some kind of small transport vessel and we get to visit far and away colonies that most people don't even know exist, places the long arm of the new galactic government hasn\u2019t reached yet, picking up work where we can find it. Or maybe we're colonists headed out to settle on a freshly terraformed planet, people with a mysterious past looking for a fresh start. Or maybe you have an idea that is way more interesting than either of those! \n\n\nFull disclosure, I just finished Firefly and I\u2019m itching for something similar, but not chained to the fandom. I would love to do some light world building together to make a similar but original universe. So hopefully you\u2019re up for that! \n\n\nI tend to play a by-the-book, judgemental, high-and-mighty hot girl with a superiority complex and a fatal attraction to morally ambiguous scoundrel types. So if you color yourself a Han Solo/Malcolm Reynolds type, sign up here, please! Lemme be your Space Princess, ala Leia. Having said that, a good sense of humor goes a long way. We have to have chemistry so I\u2019d like to get to know you a little before we commit and start writing. I want to know that we\u2019re going to have a good time. I\u2019m not looking for a serious RP, more just a fun ride where our characters can poke fun at each other and get into all sorts of danger and mischief together. \n\n\nI can write in any tense and perspective, and don\u2019t really have a preference. I have high availability and ideally I\u2019d like someone who can respond more than once a day. But for a reliable, quality partner, I\u2019ll take less frequent exchanges. As far as post length, it varies. But aside from dialogue, I\u2019d say single line responses aren\u2019t very satisfying. \n\n\nI am looking for long term over short term. And because this is, after all, a romance, all romantically involved characters must be consenting adults. There will be plenty (but not an overwhelming amount of) opportunities for scenes of a NSFW/mature nature. So if you aren\u2019t comfortable with that, miss me with that prude schnit. \n\n\nSide note: I\u2019m a hugely visual person. I like to exchange character artwork/faceclaims. It isn\u2019t necessary but it\u2019s fun! So be prepared and open to an avalanche of inspo links. \n\n\nHope to hear from you soon! \n\n\n",

            "selftext": "It all happened so quickly.  There were rumours, sure, about a sickness, and quarantines, and eventually, the riots.  By the time anyone really started to do anything about it, it was too late.  It was all over the world.  The dead flowed over the landscape like a slow-moving tsunami.\n\nAlex had fled the city in the second week.  He'd tried to hole up in his apartment, but a fire that had started blocks away had spread.  He'd barely had time to get out, and it was a hard fight through the dead.  Others had tried to flee, and their screams had lured the zombies away from him, their sacrifices saving his life.\n\nMiles out of the city, ashes still fell.  Appropriately enough, he'd taken shelter at a campground.  A couple of trailers were still there, though he lived in the small office near the road.  He'd tried to flag down the occasional driver, though the last one had taken a few wild gunshots at him.  Luckily, the sound hadn't attracted any of *them*.  \n\nThe power had gone out on his third day here.  He'd filled up every container he could find after that with water, in case that ran out as well.  Five days after that, his supply of canned goods was dwindling, and he'd have to move on.\n\nHe had fallen asleep without realizing it, and woke when he heard someone prying open the door.  He felt around blindly for the pistol he'd brought with him. A quarter moon left little light to filter in through the windows.  When the door finally opened, it was with enough force to swing wide and rebound off of the wall with a bang.  Alex had almost pulled the trigger at that. \n\nHe aimed the pistol at the silhouette in the doorway, and yelled out, \"freeze!  Don't move, or I'll brain you!\"\n\n\n\n-------------\n\nHello.  I know the whole zombie thing is overdone, but that being said, what's one more story?  This setting has the classic Romero zombies, slow and shambling, and while they're always a threat, it will ever be the worst that humanity has to offer that makes the world truly dangerous.  No Resident Evil style mutants, nothing with tentacles, just biters and terrible people. The location and time of year can be discussed.  The climate can be as much a detriment to survival as anything else.\n\nWhile I want the focus to be on 'regular' role play, some sex will be involved, as well.  It's a great way to relieve stress, to bond with someone, and perhaps to barter for goods.  Besides, someone has to repopulate the world, right?  I have no sexual preference, so I'm open to playing with male or female characters.   Heck, I could play a female, if you're a male and wanted to play against a female character.\n\nIf you're interested, message me with your Discord ID.",

            "selftext": "I'm Alex 23 from Zurich in Switzerland, nice to meet you and thanks in advance reading my post.\n\nNow I know that celebrity roleplays are the very king of clich\u00e9s, but if you don't immediately feel sick to your stomach, please read on. I promise I'm not looking for your generic, *oh I wanna do my celebrity crush*, kind of plot.\n\n***\n\nHer career had been at an all-time high. Her latest album was selling better than even her very optimistic agents had predicted. Her stadium tours across the globe sold out in minutes. It was all going so well...\n\nThen, one day she got a cold. Nothing to worry about, she thought, lost my voice for a few days, drink a lot of.hot tea and get back to it next week. Only the cold went, but her voice never came back.\n\nA myriad of doctors and specialist later, she had her answer. Years of singing had damaged her vocal chords, which had, unbeknownst to her, always been genetically predisposed for frailty. Then finally the cold was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nShe would never be able to sing again, not the eay she had been, not the eay her fans loved and that sold her music. In fact, if she sang at all, she risked losing her voice permanently.\n\n***\n\nNo news could have been more devastating to her. Her entire life up to this moment had been about her music. Now she had nothing, well with with the unwelcome exception of the paparazzi's incessant hounding.\n\nShe decided to escape it all. She left the states and moved to England. She'd always had a thing for the English countryside after all. Money was never going to be an issue, so when she saw that a gorgeously renovated Victorian mansion was listed for sale in one of the quietest parts of southern England, she didn't thing long on it.\n\n***\n\nHer neighbour in fact the seller of her new home was in a similarly miserable position, though for very different reasons. Only weeks ago he had been happily studying for his PhD, not a care in the world, with the exception of the next paper maybe. Then his father passed away...\n\nHis entire world changed. He was, as his father's only living relative, heir to *the estate*. The word filled him with dread. He had always hated the world his father lived in. This was a modern world, there was no need for nobility of forgone eras to maintain huge estates across the country.\n\nAnd yet, after the funeral he found himself in exactly this position. He bitterly resigned himself to his role as the new lord of his father's estate. He even sold his mother's little villa just outside the park of the main estate, that he had been lovingly restoring since it passed to him after her death 10 years ago.\n\n***\n\nSo first of all, if you've made it all the way down here, congratulations and thanks for taking the time!\n\nI'm thinking this roleplay will explore the relationship between our two \"unfortunate\" characters.\n\nI value detail and literacy, so I'm not looking for a one line at a time kind of partner. I want this to be long-term, with elements of politics, drama, intrigue etc on top of the romantic aspects.\n\nOne key plot point I want to explore is how your character will struggle fitting in with the world that being with mine catapults her into. On the other hand she will be his salvation from the dreariness of that world, forcing him to leave and go on adventures with her.\n\nThe celebrity I had in mind when I wrote this is Taylor Swift, but I'm willing to discuss other options. But please keep in mind that I want it to be someone who is both at the height of their career now, but also has been in the business for a number of years.\n\nIf I've peaked your interest, feel free to pm me with comments, questions, suggestions, (productive) criticism or to discuss your ideas. I'm looking to eventually move to discord for the actual roleplay.\n\nHope to hear from you and thanks again for taking the time to read all this.\n\nx Alex",

            "selftext": "Fuck. Your last roommate was a complete deadbeat, his room still smells, he never paid last month's rent, and *this* month's rent is due frighteningly soon. You've already posted your ad for a new one, and friends are still mulling over the possibility of moving in (which *of course* they're taking too long to decide when you need rent money last month and not in a few months when they know how their new jobs are working out). \n\nBrowsing Craigslist turned up people who have also posted some pretty sketchy offers, and you're only really checking the newspaper because your out-of-touch parents suggested it, but one ad in particular catches your eye:\n\n\"Wizard Seeking a Place to Crash\n\nI'll be arriving at your town tomorrow and placed this ad in advance. Can pay three months' rent in advance, plus any security deposit, and would prefer to have a roommate rather than board alone. Happy to provide the dankest sorcery pro bono, but will not kill anybody, bring anyone back from the dead, or force someone to fall in love, same rules as genies. Other possible unethical spells subject to discretion. Non-smoking, weed okay, no drugs please.\n\nDraw a pentagram in the space intentionally left blank below to begin our cohabitative adventure today!\"\n\n[So yeah. Ever heard the term \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl?\" Well, the character I hope to play is pretty much the male equivalent to that, some fun-loving magical hobo ready to drop into some lonely, overly serious girl's life and show her what she's missing. \n\nThis RP is intended to be a slightly surreal slice of life story, and while I'm not specifically seeking out sex scenes and romance, I'm open to them as long as it feels believable.]\n",

            "selftext": "The car came to rest at the trunk of a tree. Smoke poured from the radiator as Nate lifted his head, now bloodied by the impact of the wreck. His vision was blurred as he looked to the passenger seat to see, Amanda. Her eye was black as the now deflated airbag rested below her as the seatbelt held her snuggly. \"How did we get here?\" His inner dialogue began. A few days prior they were simply seniors in high school, but his hunt for bigger game brought them together, as did her potential nymphomania. Amanda was different to say the least. A wild girl, with a leash. Her mouth getting her in more trouble then it was really worth. \n\nNathan on the other hand, when he was 12 his mother drove them to a lake to feed the birds nearby, after a few word exchanges and one last kiss. The troubled woman drove thier car into the lake. Killing herself and leaving Nate and his father alone. This began a bout of animal murder, and some self mutilation. His hand was scarred from placing it on a smoldering stove burner when he was 13. He had a bloodlust from his adolescence that lead him to mutilate small animals. But he needed more, that's when he found, Amanda, a fellow senior with a passion for being brash, and very rude. However, it's very apparent that he was unsuccessful in his venture to kill her twisted soul.\n\nHope my excerpt got people interested! It's basically a plagiarized version of a show/comic called \"The End of the fucking world\" the female is totally up to you however, I just needed a name to include along with my OC. I do hope this finds a potential Partner, I want to explore the minds of two slowly maturing 18 year olds. The akwardness that it will provide, and the wonderful story we can make.\n\nI'm 29 years old. I'd like a partner that's preferably someone in their 20s or older, simply because I mesh better with that age group. I'm married, very happily, I tend to avoid smut as it doesn't really add much to the story, willing to fade to Black on it\n\n--I'm in the Central Time zone\n\n--I usually work evenings and nights, but I post as often as I can and sometimes that schedule changes. Sometimes it's once a week, sometimes it's more. Just please understand that I have a life outside of the internet and I'll respect that you have a life schedule as well\n\n--As previously mentioned, I like plotting with my partner before we start. I also like chatting! I find that roleplays flow better when I good chemistry with my partner, so that's what I strive for\n\n--My post lengths vary, usually between 1-3 paragraphs. I try to match my partner, but sometimes I get bit by the writing bug or I get a case of writers block. I at least strive for 2 paragraphs on my bad days. Happens to everyone right?\n\nIf this plot seems interesting, then let's discuss! PM me.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! ^^ \n\nRight now I'm looking for someone to do a specific idea with me. It's only a short prompt at the moment but I'm hoping that we can sort something out and work on it together. \n\n*Idea:*\nIt's based around an immortal (male) and a human (female) as well as the concept of reincarnation. Likely you understand where the idea is going. In her prior life they were lovers, yet him being immortal she was destined to die and leave him alone. \nThe roleplay would pick up after she is 'reborn'. From there, it's up to as as partners to figure out what direction we would like to take the play. Maybe someone killed her in her first life because of him? Maybe being forced to see the woman he loves die over and over is his curse? \n\n*Guidelines:*\nI have a few requests as not to waste anyone's time. \n-I'm only looking to play female character/s.\n-Romance would be the core point of the roleplay. There will be other side aspects, of course, but romance is the main point. \n-Please be able to help form the plot. If I wanted to do it all the planning myself I would have written it myself too.\n-No one liner replies.\n\nThank you for reading! Feel free to message me in  DMs with any ideas and your preferred platform (and ID for it!)",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi** and **Cyberpunk RP** in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars, Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**.",

My name is Syd and I am fond of using discord as means of communication! \n\nI prefer original universes and original characters, both of which we can create together. If you have any ideas, don't hesitate to tell me! I would love to hear them all! \n\nAs of right now... I'm into just about anything. \nFrom a southern gothic, weird west to a high fantasy political RP, I am pretty open minded to the time and setting of the play. I do not typically go with modern days... so sorry if that's your cup of tea! \n\nI would prefer any partners to be 18+, as I do appreciate some NSFW themes of horror, violence or romance. I love to explore healthy and dark relationships and I defenitely prefer writing F/F or M/M romances. \n\nIf anything aforementioned caught your fancy, please hit me up with a PM! I'd love to talk further on discord!  \u30fd(*\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)\uff89\tI'm very laidback and open-minded so don't be shy! Thanks for reading!",

Mages are those who have seen through the Lie of reality: That the world is Fallen, and it must be returned to the way it was. They use magic to manipulate the world around them, and assert their 'will' over that of the makers of the Lie-the Exarchs, god-like ancient mages whose greed wanted them to be the only ones to use it. They cannot meddle in the Fallen World, but they act through the Seers of the Throne, their servants on earth (who are also mages, some of which are granted special boons by the Exarchs.). They also utilize the Abyss (the shield obstructing the Fallen World and the Supernal World (where mages get their powers from and aim to fuse it with the Fallen world to make it whole) to further the Lie.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/W6adBYU",

            "selftext": "Alright, this is probably gonna get a little long, and I might ramble a bit. Also marking this NSFW because I don't really wanna RP with anyone under 18 (mature content aside). Now, to the meat of this post...\n\n**First things first:** I want to rp with other people who are, like me, interested in exploring dark, mature and probably edgy topics. Everyone has limits of course but mine take a while to push compared to others, probably. I'd also love to get to know you before we dive into RP--I don't want to be RPing with strangers!\n\n**Second things second:** I don't want to do an rp without *planning.* I want a plot, and I want to know where it starts and where it ends. Having specific story beats to hit is also great but we don't need to know everything, we just need to know where things are going to end up going. Without that, the pacing dies and I tend to lose traction/interest because I run out of steam or run out of ideas. I also love creating characters with friends, and planning out their connected stories. Same for connecting existing characters that are gonna be in the RP (especially if it's through their backstories).\n\n**Finally:** I have no lower or upper limit on reply length. Quality over quantity and I understand sometimes there's not enough to say. Don't feel the need to pad things out just to hit a word count. I do paragraph-based RP for the most part, but fun one-offs in script or chat format are always fun. Long-term stuff is best, but one-offs can be fun too. All depends on what we decide. Hell, maybe we won't find an RP we want to do together but we click as friends or have a ton of fun discussing characters--that's great too!\n\nThat out of the way: here's what I want to RP!\n\n**Genres:**\nSci-Fi\nHigh Fantasy (especially if the time period/tech level is different from the standard \"Medieval\")\n\"Real World\" (either historical or contemporary)\nUrban Fantasy\nSci-Fantasy\nLovecraftian/Horror (especially combined with any above genre)\n\nA quick note: I tend to prefer things to be a little toned-down, with limits on how many non-human beings are running around and defined rules and such for the fantasy/magic elements. That can be discussed further during the planning phase though.\n\n**Fandoms:**\nFallout\nElder Scrolls\nWildstar\nMass Effect\n\nI have my own plot ideas and a couple original settings, but feel free to throw any of your own ideas at me.\n\nI **DO NOT** do role play based solely on character pairings, unless it's specifically an erotic RP (which I am willing to do, but only if kinks line up... something I'm down to discuss only if I feel comfortable that I can do so without being judged).\n\nAnd finally... my typing style over Discord is incredibly casual and full of abbreviations and lack of capitalization etc... if you're the type to get upset over that, think less of me for it, or whatever... move along, please. It's just how I am.",

I run a PG-13 roleplay site set in the world of RWBY but on a small, rather isolated island known as Bellmuse to remain separated from the ever-changing canon. This is a site for OCs only, without ties to the main cast (Outside the likes of passive knowledge which would make sense within the series) as well as an academy for students to learn and become hunters. The site has a minimum of 150 words per post and utilises a simple stat based system for combat. We have active and helpful staff and accept roleplayers of all skill levels. Whether you're just starting out or have experience feel free to stick your head in and take a look around or join us! Here's the link to the site; http://www.rwbyrpg.com/",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm Lily. I'm 18+ and I prefer if you were as well. I've been having some cravings to write lately. In particular, I wanted to write either...\n\n\n* Marauder's Era of Harry Potter or next generation OCs in the Harry Potter universe\n\n* Some sort of mystery with murders and plot twists\n\n* Something Alice in Wonderland inspired\n\n* Not-so-distant sci-fi oneshots, a la Black Mirror\n\n\nI am super open to suggestions as well! The only roleplays I don't like doing are high fantasy and historical before the 60's. I am happy with pre-made or original universes, but I prefer playing canon characters over creating my own. If you really want an extensive list, check [this old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/36i83x/f4a_longterm_partnerships_with_crossover_cravings/) out.\n\n\nI *love* talking plots. Romance isn't necessary, but I haven't written it in a while, so it would be fun to write again. I typically don't roleplay smut. I enjoy playing multiple characters and write 2-3 paragraphs in 3rd person on average. I can also range to writing over a page, depending on the partner. \n\n\nOne thing that I'd like is if we don't get lost writing the plot. Sometimes we can get so wrapped up in plot ideas that we don't end up actually writing too much! Let's get some ideas down and start writing. c: PM me with your contact info if you're interested!",

With twelve years of experience under my belt, I can post up to a page of dialogue and action but find that it's rather tedious and intimidating, so two to three paragraphs is my preference. I do want a partner over 18 as I do like adult content and romance but I don't write smut. I'm very much a collaborative writer, I want my partner to feel they're able to use their own ideas and plots if they have any and not just mine, otherwise it gets boring real fast. \n\nAnyways, onto the general plot idea I had, should you be interested! Ideally, your character would be the son of Astrid and Hiccup, his looks, name, very identity are up to you. While my character would be a girl who grew up in an isolated village on a hidden island just outside the archipelago, that had been completely cut off to the outside world until she was rescued from what appears to be the remains of a ship wreck. From there, we'll see how things go.",

If the RP is good, then I'm happy) and enjoy NSFW themes (I prefer them not permeating the RP too much though). I enjoy OCs and original settings, but I also enjoy some fandoms. Though I don't profess to know the best about some, I'll list them anyway:\n\n-Hunger games\n\n\n-Star Wars\n\n\n-Harry Potter\n\nI'm interested in more, of course, but these are the three I'd be interested in doing as of now. I don't play many canon characters at all- I don't feel very comfortable doing it- with the exception of Star Wars, and two select characters from it (Kylo/Rey). Of course, I'm especially open to OCs and original plots in that setting- if you'd prefer that, we can definitely do so.\n\nI roll with 2-4 paragraphs per response. I'm rapid fire, and I'd much prefer someone who's the same.\n\nPM me your discord name, and we'll get started brainstorming! Thank you.\n\n",

            "selftext": "*I don't remember exactly when it started happening. It was some time last year, though I've felt the warning signs my whole life. Always sitting too close to the fireplace, burning toast even though the toaster was set to do a light toast, and even the fire alarms sounding off near me. As a kid, I wanted to be a firefighter. Now that I'm 18, though, I just want the burning to stop.*\n\n*They sent me to Pike Hill after the house burnt down. The old, run down psycho joint on the hill at the edge of town. Said something about pyromania, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. I hate fire. I don't want any more burning, I can't take it, can't take the screaming and the crying and the smell of burnt hair, smoke, and roasting flesh. I was a vegetarian for a long time, but the people at the ward made me eat the meatish substitute slop. I was miserable, I couldn't take it. No more burning. So....i took a telephone cord, strung it up, and hung myself.*\n\n*I woke up in the hospital. The doctor said I'd been out for 2 days, and there was someone to see me. That didn't make sense....my parents were embarrassed of me, my older sister was scared of me and my dog certainly couldn't visit. That's when a man, tall and tan skinned, with a neatly trimmed beard and the brightest blue eyes I've ever seen, walked in. He asked for some alone time with me, and began to speak. His voice was warm, had a smooth spanish accent. It was the kind of warmth I hadn't felt in a long time: emotional warmth. Kindness. He explained what I was, what was happening. He said when I was out of the hospital he'd take me with him. I smiled tiredly and chuckled, closing my eyes. A university for teens with superpowers? Bullshit....*\n\n\nHey there!! Thanks for taking the time to read all that! I'm an 18 year old female who just loves to write and roleplay, and this is my latest idea. I'm looking for someone to play a male character, preferably another, more experienced student. I love world building and character development, and I hope we can get both of those into the roleplay.\n\nRules:\n\n1.  Males between 17-25. There won't be any smut, I'm just asking for that age range for maturity sake. This roleplay is gonna get a bit gritty, with darker themes, and I want someone who can handle that well and not be a dork about it.\n\n2.  PLEASE have good grammar. Improper grammar irks me so much as a literature nerd and as a perfectionist. It doesn't have to be perfect, just good.\n\n3.  Some people write in paragraphs. If you're one of those people, great! That's awesome, I love reading the creative responses people can come up with. It's not required though, and I don't expect that much from anyone because I, myself, don't write like that. One worders/liners aren't allowed though, because you can't advance a story that much with just one sentence. 2+ sentences are alright.\n\n4.  Again, this is a non smut roleplay. I hate smut, it makes me uncomfortable. But I do like romance, so it likely will turn into a romance down the road.\n\n5.  This is on kik. Pm me to get my kik and we'll discuss details over on there. Again, thanks for taking time to read this and I hope you consider yourself up for the challenge! I look forward to hearing from you!!",

I don't want to play the same characters, just enjoy the idea of somebody being sent back to an older era and trying to adapt. This can be anything you'd like, from ancient civilization up to the 60s, though it would probably be more fun for us if we picked a century with a good amount of social or political turmoil. \n\nThat's about it.

I am obsessed with Shinsou Hitoshi, cats, anime, learning about cultures, true crime, food, and drawing.\n\nWhere you RP: Kik, Skype, Discord, Email, maybe somewhere else if you ask!\n\nWhat you RP: Boku no/My Hero Academia, Naruto, Monster Munsume, One Piece, Pokemon, Super natural (genre) and more so just ask me! It will mostly be movies, anime, cartoons, books.\n\nWhat you are looking for: I am looking for a mainly romantic story for my OC. I WILL double with you no matter what, M/M, F/F, whatever else you are looking for. Angst, fluff, hurt/comfort, slice of life, horror, supernatural (genre) is fine with me!\n\nCharacters you RP: I will usually always play as an original female character, but I will be happy to double as whoever you would enjoy!\n\nCharacters you\u2019re looking to interact with: These are listed from MOST to LEAST wanted.\n\nMHA: Shinsou Hitoshi, Ojirou Mashirao , Sero Hanta , Bakugou Katsuki , Inasa, Yosetsu Awase\n\nNaruto: Gaara , Kankuro, Kiba Inuzuka\n\nOne Piece: Sanji, Zoro, Law, Bellemy, Bartolomeo, Luffy???, Chopper??\n\nSuper Natural: Demons , Lamiia/Naga , Were creatures , Faeries, Witches/Warlocks/Wizards , Vampires ???, Whatever else seems fun\n\nParagraph or dialog form?: I prefer paragraph form, please!\nGrammar/Length requirements: Please have some decent grammar! No text talk unless it is in an actual text or note between characters. As for length I prefer two upwards to ten paragraphs depending on how into the roleplay we both are. Two to three should work fine but sometimes I end up rambling.\n\nShort-term or long term?: Both! I vastly prefer long term.\nGenres I roleplay: Romance, horror, fantasy, tragedy, supernatural, hurt/comfort, fluff, angst\n\nI cannot: Absolutely no ghosting me. How hard is it to send a message saying, \u2018I need to drop this roleplay for such and such reason.\u2019 I\u2019ll say 'okay. I\u2019ll be here if you wanna continue later on.\u2019 I don\u2019t have many limits!\n\nAs my partner, a person would have to: Become my friend! I love meeting new people and hearing stories. Talk with me OOC frequently if you can! Respect my boundaries and I\u2019ll do the same with you.\n",

We run what is basically a science fantasy slice of life adventure group. Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.\n\nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence.\n\nThe world is alive with tons of lore and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature.\n\nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.",

I'm not into any kind of fandoms or canon characters. I want to build from scratch. And I wanna build something we both enjoy!\n\nPreferences ~\n\nI enjoy supernatural settings more than anything. Nothing too crazy, vampires mostly. In a normal world. Fantasy, romance, midevil, also been thinking of a plot based around a mafia.\nI don't really have any limits, violence, abuse, torture. Those are all good and fun, I ask that anyone who messages me is over 18, preferably in their 20s. I'm married irl, so nothing will happen ooc. But still want an adult to write with.\nI can write anywhere from 1 to 3 large paragraphs per reply. But it really all depends on what my partner writes and gives me, as well what's going on in the scene. I don't mind if you don't write novellas, but I do really like attention to detail.\nI'm able to play either gender very well. I do prefer to be a woman, but if we come up with a cool plot where I'd want to be a man I can play a damn good one.\n\nAvailability ~\n\nI'm at home a lot. So I'm available pretty much all day and I can rapid fire posts. But I can also take it slow. Obviously sometimes I'll be with family and have to do other things. But for the most part I'll be available a lot.\n\nExtras~\n\nI do have a few plots already in my head that if you'd like to hear I'll tell you! But I always want to make sure my partner loves the plot and characters as well.\nI'd appreciate you not disappearing. If you have an issue with me or in rl, I'd like to at least be told so..\n\nPlease message me with a little about what you're looking for! I look forward to talking to you~",

            "selftext": "**The devil's in the details, so hang with me....**\n\n\n- Roleplayer and writer for over a decade and looking for some long term, descriptive partners. \n- Should things come up, I typically attempt to warn my partners if I know of the impending issue in schedule. If I do not know ahead of time, that cannot be helped. Life comes first.\n- I prefer that you don't mind OOC chatter sometimes as well, considering some days, one just doesn't feel like RPing and needs someone to talk to. I enjoy being able to ask how you are from time to time and I reserve a different email thread for doing just that as well as any RP question that may come up once we start.\n- I am willing to answer any questions that come my way, all you have to do is PM me.\n- Again, life comes first, and if something comes up that pulls me away from RP, please be aware that I will attempt to warn you before it happens if I can. \n\n\n**Play Style:**\n\n\n- I am perfectly adept at playing either a male or female character in any given setting. Message me about an idea you have. I will respond either way.\n- As my character is not me, your character is not you. It doesn't matter to me whether you are male or female and what your character is. \n- Heterosexual relationships are my first and foremost preference in romance RPs, but I will not discount a different relationship in an RP idea that strikes my attention enough. \n- If something is not working for you, please tell me and do not disappear on me. I do not disappear on my partners, and it would be nice to know what can be improved or changed. \n- Be willing to plan with me. A little world-building can save a lot of floundering later in the game, and I'd like to be able to sketch out at least a little bit before we begin.\n- **I will politely decline to keep responding to you if you cannot produce anything over one line or incomplete sentences.**\n\n\n**Post Schedule:**\n\n\n- I am completely unavailable on Sundays and Wednesdays, there are very few exceptions to this. Most Saturdays, I am unavailable as well. \n- On a good day, I may be able to get in 2+ posts per day or many more. I may be able to rapidfire. Others, I may not be able to post at all. \n\n\n**Post-Length:**\n\n\n- I typically range anywhere from three to six paragraphs or more, depending on necessity. My introduction posts or description posts will obviously be longer than simple conversation.\n- I would prefer a partner that is both literate and descriptive. At least two paragraphs or more.\n- My posts include internal dialogue and conflict, if that bothers you - please do not waste my time. \n\n\n**Platforms:**\n\n\n- I use email. It is the easiest way for me to keep track of everything, and I will not change that. \n- The only acceptable time I will use Google Hangouts is for OOC chatter, and nothing more. \n*My apologies, but I will not be changing to any other platforms, it is simply too inconvenient for me. You will, unfortunately, not be convincing me otherwise.*\n\n\n**Genres:**\n\n\n- Gore, darker themes, survival horror, high or low fantasy, sci-fi, steampunk, crime noir.... a vibrant mix of several, you name it and we can talk it over and see if we can find something we will both enjoy. \n- Romance is a preferred subplot, but in a slow-burn atmosphere. I prefer things to develop organically and I do not want this to be the main focus of any RP.\n- NSFW content is not necessarily off-limits, but please be aware that I would like to discuss things first.\n- I will not change a character completely to suit your wants/needs.\n- I reserve the right to say no. \n\n\n**Time Periods**\n\n\n- Any. Let's talk it out. I prefer an element of fantasy in anything I do, which means I will prefer any offers for it over completely realistic. (Of course, two human characters fighting dragons is not completely realistic, I will accept that.)\n\n\n**Fandoms:**\n\n\n- I will readily attempt to play in a fandom that I like. That being said, I do not prefer to play very many canon characters.... just in canon universes. Want to play OC mutants? New heroes in the DC or Marvel universe? Let's try it. \n- Some canon characters I am willing to play or play against are subjective and vary dependent on the partner and suggested RP. \n- Marvel and DC: Loki (play: dark, manipulative and devious), Thor (against), Bruce Banner/Hulk (play or against), Remy LeBeau/Gambit (against), Harley Quinn (play or against), Pamela Isley/Poison Ivy (play or against). \n- Anyone willing to play in the setting of The Ancient Magus' Bride with original characters is welcome. I do not typically watch or like anime, but I enjoy this one.\n- Kingdom Hearts: Ask on this one, usually willing to play one canon with OC, or both OC. \n- If you don't see something or someone you want to play or play against on the lists, ask me.\n\n\n**Need Not Apply:**\n\n\n- I can and will refuse any RP I want, but it is likely that I will give it a shot first if we mesh well together in our initial conversations.\n- Do NOT contact me with a situation in which I am basically under your thumb and you are a DM/GM type.... I do NOT like this type of RP and I you will not be changing my mind. Thanks.\n- Do not expect rapid-fire posts or conversations from me constantly, I will reply when I am able, I promise.\n- Anyone seeking nothing but NSFW roleplay can keep looking, I prefer rich story and worlds. \n\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\n\n- Please contact me via **message,** I do not respond to comments. \n- Let's talk it out before or after we move to email, I don't mind either way. If I seem to have missed your message or email, send another and I will reply right away.",

Don't ask me for something else, the answer is no.\n\nThere's also a few rules that we're missing out on.\n\n&gt;&gt; * I don't mind doubling or playing a whole handful of secondaries. You shouldn't either.\n&gt;&gt; * Romance is mandatory. I call this a \"junk food\" story, because I want it fluffy. (I can handle multiple romances at once, so don't worry if you want to double up and do a male and a female both, then romance them out.)\n&gt;&gt; * I like OOC chatter, so if you're not into talking, then I am not the girl for you.\n&gt;&gt; * I write 2-5 *paragraphs* per post. You should, too.\n&gt;&gt; * You can get a half a dozen replies *in a day*, or you can get 2-3 in a week. *Who knows?*\n\nMoving on, I don't have a lot of ideas past \"I'm feeling nostalgic and I want to write some sort of cutesy musician romance\" story. Admittedly, the idea of a slice of life struggle with her home and him on tour is pretty appealing, though that means a lot of the story is them apart. Or, y'know, we throw them on Warped Tour and she's their merch kid, slingin' shirts all summer long.\n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a PM and I'll be happy to talk about it!",

I have an OC Witcher of mine, from the School of the Bear, that I rather enjoy using.  I'm fine with my partner using an OC of their own though I also would love them forever if they would be the lovely Triss Merigold.

I'm Amy, I'm 23 years old and pretty new to this subreddit. However, I have been roleplaying for around 10 years now. There is really only one pairing in particular I'm interested in exploring at the moment, and it is as follows:\n\n&gt;*Leslie Thompkins* and Edward Nygma from Gotham\n\nI have several different ideas I can pitch for this pairing, and for clarity, I would strongly prefer to play the role italicized. I enjoy NSFW material but it is not necessary, nor do I want to do anything that is primarily NSFW-centric. Also, I will not write with anyone under 18.\n\nI do love a lot of description but, depending on your preferences, I can write long or short responses--I love both! As the title says, I am willing to RP over email or Discord, with a slight preference towards email for longer RPs and Discord for shorter RPs. I also really enjoy plotting and world-building and other sorts of OOC chat. I should note that I will only write in 3rd person and would rather my partner do the same.\n\nPlease feel free to reply or PM me if you are interested or would like to discuss anything further! Thank you and look forward to hearing from you. \u2665",

            "selftext": "In the hustle and bustle of NYC (New York City) criminals run amuck, law enforcement is corrupt, and the citizens are just cattle to be harvested. The boroughs are as dangerous as ever, but one borough is more dangerous than all the others. That borough is Brooklyn; and there is pure evil brewing in those cutthroat streets. But there are those enhanced humans\u2014Superheroes that thwart the evil forces at be. With their identities hidden and agendas more or less unknown. The people of Brooklyn start talking, and it is decided, the borough is in an all out war. Who will come out on top? Good or evil? Only you can decide.\n\nThis prompt is based of Marvel comics (and will have elements from popular shounen just to keep things spicy and action packed). This story is about an up and coming heroine/vigilant trying to single-handedly (at first) keep Brooklyn safe from all the gangs, corruption, and other superpowered humans hellbent on using their powers for evil opposed to good. Said heroine will be doing this while trying to keep her identity hidden all while balancing high-school life and other teenage struggles.\n\nA bit about the girl (who is 18 years old; senior year in high school): she is a recluse; she rather keep to herself than make friends. But she isn\u2019t a loner by any means, she has a few loyal and trusted friends she can confine in when needed. She is smoking hot; nice face, slim waist, with a big butt. She is very attractive, but not a lot of fellas\u2019 hit on her due to the fact she is a recluse and is prone to \u201cviolence\u201d\u2014prone to hurting the feelings of her potential suitors. She is very smart, a pretty good student despite always being late to class, and comes from a dysfunctional family where her father owns his own construction company and her mother is a receptionist for the biggest technology enterprise in the world. Needless to say, her family isn\u2019t broke finical; only broke mentally and physically.\n\nDespite all the above, she has one secret admirer that has had the biggest crush on her for years; ever since they started high-school. Me; the character I will be playing. My character will be an eighteen year old African-American male who has a future in boxing and music (producing). He is a very outgoing kid who is larger than life and a bit of a social butterfly. He comes from a single mother household and tries his hardest in class in attempt to give her a better future. But school isn\u2019t for him and his grades reflect that. He doesn\u2019t talk to you even though you both share a math class together; he just awkward stares at your backside when you walk and daydreams sinful thoughts most men/teenagers in his position do. He is just your typically eighteen year old stuck in a world with enhanced humans and villains running amuck.\n\nThe role-play will be about how the two get involved in one another. He gets saved by a masked hero (you), and He figures out you\u2019re the masked hero that saves him after a couple interactions with you and purposely putting himself in less-than-ideal situations. This role-play will be about various villains trying to take over Brooklyn and the heroine stopping them. It\u2019ll gradually grow into an Marvels Avengers kind of deal, but that is later. This role-play is also about the \u201chot and heavy\u201d interaction they will have and romance the two characters will develop. Smut will happen, and it will be detailed and hot as all hell. But it won\u2019t be as important as one would think. This is a story about two teenagers trying to cope with the hand life has dealt them. The hot smut is only a bonus (will discuss further in PMs or KIK).\n\nThis is also a kind of CYOA role-play. I will be doing a lot of GM-like events for you when you\u2019re out fighting crime and whatnot. I want to give my partner an epic heroes adventure. This way I can keep the role-play engaging, immersive, and exciting for the both of us.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I\u2019m no sticker when it comes to grammar or punctuation. But I will probably be typing a lot in this role-play (three-four paragraphs per reply). This is only to get myself immersed in the role and give life and feeling into my character. I\u2019m not going to ask any of my partners to do the same. But I am asking that they add as much detail as possible. I want to feel for this heroine; I want to root for her to win and to be able to blossom into a proper heroine/women. I can\u2019t do that if the replies are lackluster, y\u2019know? So, if one takes this and I\u2019m not feeling the replies. I will give three \u201cwarnings\u201d and if no improvement happens you will get ghosted, I will stop the role-play, and you will be blocked. This is for serious writers who like getting immersed in an ever growing world. \n\nI typed so much. I\u2019m sorry.",

Why? Because I'm a keen RPer who enjoys the company of fellow RPers preferably females. \n\nAs a word of advice, please don't message me with \"Hey.\" Or \"Still looking for that RP Partner?\" because I will ignore it. Put some effort into your introduction. That's what I base my intentions on. Make a good introduction and impression and I'll likely reply. \n\nSo I'm looking for an RP partner similar age to myself, and female. Honestly, I'd also prefer them to be single too, just so no complications happen as my RPs (if you're okay with them) get Romantic and could potentially get NSFW. \n\nI use KiK as my main use of Roleplaying so that's a definite need. I can however resort to using text chat on Skype if necessary. \n\nI also have 6 years of experience so I know what I'm doing. \n\nMy wish list: \n- Must be Female aged 18+ \n- Be willing to conduct romantic Roleplays that may involve NSFW themes (discussed over DM) \n- Be into the same things as myself. \n- Be British (not needed but recommended just for easier schedule) \n- Be friendly of course. :) \n\nMy main RP specialities! \n- Superhero (Marvel and DC) \n- OC x Barbara Dunkelman \n- Elder Scrolls \n- Halo \n- Real Life Romance ( Main and Preferred ) \n- Mecha Combat Team (Gundam-esque) \n- Apocalypse (Both Zombie and Wasteland) \n- VGHS (Video Game High School OCs)\n- Destiny\n- Mass Effect\n\nMessage me if you're interested. \n\nI thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope you contact me soon.

The Confederacy of Independent Systems, led by the fallen Jedi Count Dooku of Serenno, clashes against the millennia-old Galactic Republic, led by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine of Naboo, vying for sovereignty and freedom from Republic control. The Republic's forces are already spreading across the galaxy in an effort to snuff out the Confederate flame, and maintain the unity and peace of the galaxy. There are already heroes on both sides, but the question still remains as to who will come out on top in this conflict.\n\n\nWill you be a deciding factor?\n\n\nJoin us for thrilling paragraph-based roleplay and Star Wars discussion.\nWe are a small but dedicated group who love Star Wars and a good story, and for the first time, we are open to the public.\n We like to keep things professional, so be prepared to be tested on your roleplay ability and character creation skill.

            "selftext": "Greetings all,\n\nMany years of RP experience here, located in the US, Eastern time zone, I'm typically active during the week until 4PM or so in the afternoon, and I have some ideas I'd like to write!\n\nI'm searching for someone to play Harley in the Injustice universe. If you haven't played the games, but like the characters, still let me know if this idea interests you! Basically, in this dimension, Superman has killed the Joker and the once honorable heroes such as Wonder Woman, The Flash, etc, have joined with Superman to institute a zero tolerance policy towards all crime, ruling the world in their collective iron fists.\n\nIn the games, Harley eventually ends up working for Batman, who lead the heroic resistance against Superman's Regime, but....what if something else happened instead?\n\nI have an OC I want to pair with her, and in return I am more than willing to double as any canon character you wish. Please message me if you'd like to know more, and hopefully give writing together a try!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm Amy, I'm 23 years old and pretty new to this subreddit. However, I have been roleplaying for around 10 years now. There are really only two dynamics in particular I'm interested in exploring at the moment, and those are as follows:\n\n&gt;*Rey* and Kylo Ren from Star Wars\n\n&gt;*Leslie Thompkins* and Edward Nygma from Gotham\n\nI have several different ideas I can pitch for either of these pairings, and for clarity, I would strongly prefer to play the roles italicized. I enjoy NSFW material but it is not necessary, nor do I want to do anything that is primarily NSFW-centric. Also, I will not write with anyone under 18.\n\nI do love a lot of description but, depending on your preferences, I can write long or short responses--I love both! As the title says, I am willing to RP over email or Discord, with a slight preference towards email for longer RPs and Discord for shorter RPs. I also really enjoy plotting and world-building and other sorts of OOC chat. I should note that I will only write in 3rd person and would rather my partner do the same.\n\nPlease feel free to reply or PM me if you are interested in either of these pairings, or would like to discuss anything further! Thank you and look forward to hearing from you. \u2665",

Just ask and I\u2019ll let you know. I don\u2019t watch any anime, sorry :( \n\nI am best with female characters, but I can also play male. I enjoy doubling but am very versatile and willing to meet your wishes. I like romance in a plot, but I don\u2019t want it to be the main focus. I\u2019m no smutty lass, either, but we can work that out when we get there. My typical approach is letting the characters get up to kissing and then just add some clever implication/timeskip. \n\nI like a good bit of wit in my characters interactions as well, and typically respond in 2-3 paragraphs in 3rd person. \n\nI\u2019m interested in just about every genre, also. Modern, medieval, futuristic, fantasy, realistic and everything in-between. I can work with whatever, I just love to write. \n\nMessage me if you\u2019re at all interested. I prefer female partners who are 18+ but can make exceptions, of course. Skype, discord, email and even iMessage are all viable options. No kik though, I hate the interface. \n\nSend me all those plot ideas you\u2019ve been dying to try! :-)",

            "selftext": "Dust and Echoes is a freeform, plot-driven roleplaying server that takes place in a high fantasy setting, though is inclusive of most character archetypes. We have a focus on allowing players to have agency over the world that they're inhabiting, as well as the narrative at large. We're accomodating of a wide variety of characters, and can try and make as many concepts workable as we can.\n\n &gt;Dust and Echoes takes place on a planet named Kestera, home to three diverse continents and whatever character you choose to make. The initial setting is firmly nestled in the remains of an Empire that's long since fallen, the remnants having settled to form four city states west of the barren landscape their empire once held. A small and quaint land, but still vibrant and full of the chance to make a fortune, make a name, or make a home for yourself wherever you might please.\n\n &gt;Whether you're a fighter, a mage, a scholar, or somewhere in between, you'll be able to find something to do in this land. Annual festivals have begun, kingdoms are looking for workers and contracts to be completed, and other issues are starting to crop up throughout the surrounding city-states that demand a more personal touch.\n\nOur goal is to make a casual environment for players to roleplay in a large-scale setting with plenty of room for player character interactions. While we have a secondary goal of progressing a major storyline, having a place for any roleplayers who are looking to scratch that fantasy itch in an accommodating environment comes first and foremost.\n\nWhile we are a free form setting that doesn't use any form of stats or systems, you're welcome to import a character and adapt to the setting from whatever form they might already be in. D&amp;D, Pathfinder, Fate, anything is fine.\n\nIf any of the above sounds interesting to you, come check out the Discord at:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/rEfEDjW",

            "selftext": "[Dragon Ball ULTIMATE](http://doragonboru.freeforums.net/)\n\nHey all!\n\nI'm posting here to represent a growing Dragon Ball RP site that's looking to grow!\n\nThe site is set in Age 1000, and is heavily AU while also being heavily dedicated to and inspired by the roots of the series. It allows players to roleplay anywhere in the galaxy from Earth to Namek and features several playable races that range from Earthlings to Saiyans, to hybrids of the assorted species of the universe!\n\nRight now, the site is gearing up for its first big event: the World Martial Arts Tournament, which is being advertised on a universal scale and is welcoming combatants from all over the universe.\n\nOOCly, the site is also offering an even right now that gives new characters a boost to catch up to old time members, allowing them to start a slightly higher tier of power compared to the typical fresh character. It also offers them several goodies, like on site currency and items to get them kickstarted!\n\nAs a normal member, I will say that staff is dedicated to the site, with the staff constantly updating and putting out content for the site, helping it grow, even if it is small. For example, the site recently published mechanics for powerful God-tier forms, including the fearsome Super Saiyan Blue from Super!\n\nOn a personal note, if people are interested, I'm actually trying to put together a Z-Fighters-inspired, defenders of Earth group, so that would be an excellent way to get you roleplaying immediately!\n\nFull disclosure: the site has dice-based mechanics, inspired by classic online RPGs. However, they are really simple and staff is willing to give you a personalized tutorial on the mechanics if you ask!\n\nSo, yeah, feel free to drop by the site or PM me here for my discord and we can talk/plot!",

I'd prefer to write over Skype or email, but if you have a site you prefer I'd be willing to use the same. My profile is a little underdeveloped but you can check it out over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/4lts2m/lucyxariel/). \n\n\nI enjoy exploring inner conflict, vices, corrupted morals, and sordid pasts layered through themes of mystery, the supernatural, historical periods, crime, or regular ol' drama. I have couple plots in mind but am definitely open to ideas, I LOVE plotting and chatting ooc in Skype.\n\n\nSome plots to consider:\n\n\n1) A chief of police struggles with the burden of becoming the legal guardian of his two young nephews, grief-stricken and battling alcoholism all amidst his assignment to a particularly gruesome murder.\n\n\n2) Set in the mid-1800s through the Colorado brush, a brutish outlaw runs from a looming bounty after the suspicious death of his wife. Unbeknownst to him he is also being pursued by the surviving, revenge-bent sister of his wicked bride. ",

If you have received this letter and are still within moderate levels of sanity then congratulations! You have been accepted to join the (self-proclaimed) famous archaeologist and adventurer Benjamin Howard and crew aboard the S.S. Everdale! Whether you are an engineer, a navigator or simply a fellow explorer, we welcome you to the crew! (I will fully admit I have already forgotten your occupation\u2026)  Now, as agreed upon in our earlier terms, what will follow is specifically for your eyes only,. If this gets to outside eyes, we may lose our one and only chance at a fortune beyond belief! \n\nNow, as you have probably heard from recent news, British relations with the Americas has slowly begun to heal. This, of course, doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest, other than the fact that traveling merchants have brought back rumors of an ancient civilization down in the Spanish territories in South  America. Not much is truly known about this fallen kingdom, but it is said they were able to harness some strange form of energy to run their civilization, which has been rumored to function 10 times better than the power of steam!  (Which of course is preposterous, surely nothing could outdo the mighty steam engine!) Nonetheless, it\u2019s my job as an\nArchaeologist to uncover the truth of this forgotten kingdom, (and more than likely more importantly to you and the rest of the crew, to uncover any hidden treasure hidden deep within.) Any riches found upon our expedition will be split into equal portions and/or buried somewhere in Scandinavia  in case our wealth is discovered and the government attempts to place taxes upon it. Below, my relations and language expert has listed our foolproof plan in simple steps for easy consumption.\n\n(Below was several lines of crudely written bullet points, some words barely legible.)\n\nTravel to South America.\nUncover location of civilization \n????????????\nProfit\n\nWe will be departing in my airship/gunboat, the S.S. Everdale at the Rivington Docks on the 30th of April. Please be there in time with essential supplies for a long journey, and please, remind your family and friends that trips like this have a 79% mortality rate and that you make no promise to return home. \nRemember: Tell no one!\n\nSincerely ~\nBenjamin Howard. \n\n\n(Hey thanks for taking the time to read this! I\u2019m a male, 19, and as  you\u2019ve probably guessed this is a steampunk style rp, with a possibility of romance if you\u2019re interested. The only requirements I really have is that you need to be fairly literate, as in I don\u2019t care for text talk or short replies, but I also don\u2019t expect an entire paragraph each time. Along with that, the more imaginative you can be the better, so feel free to add your own details and aspects to the world, and don\u2019t be afraid to dive into the ridiculous and insane.  I\u2019ve always thought of this genre as somewhat fantastical, so monsters, ancient curses, hell even lovecraftian nightmares are uo on the table. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!)\n",

            "selftext": "Hello there, whoever's stopping by! I'm hosting a long term Pokemon RP! I already have the story set in place, and everything else is ready to go! We also have a working EXP/leveling system. The battling system is based off of actual Roleplay Fighting mixed with the animes ( throwing aside their inconsistencies ) and there includes custom moves and abilities! The region this place is based off of is Sinnoh! I'm very sorry if I do anything wrong, as this is my first time hosting a server, but I'll try my best!\n\nA fair warning, though. When I mean long term, ideally I mean long term. This isn't going to be something you complete in one week. The story can and will get gruesome and dark at times, and a less than happy ending will be guaranteed. This is also going to be hard. One person alone has no chance of completely beating this story, please don't try to rambo it. It won't work. Team Rainbow Rocket is being led by another figure with drastically different views and ideas for the world, and this team is in no way stupid. \n\nThank you for looking at my ad! The only limit when it comes to typing is to avoid one-liners or very short half-paragraphs outside of battling or really mundane actions. I don't expect an essay for walking. Of course, if you do that, that's okay. I do it too. You can choose any starter you like that isn't a legendary or an evolution! First evos only! Anyways, the discord server is below, and thank you again for taking the time to look at this! \n\nAs of posting this, there's only one active roleplayer - that being me. I do hope you'll join and help liven up the place!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/fPDDEkH ",

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nI am looking for an advanced, long-term roleplay partner to do a romantic, slice of life roleplay with over PM, that includes lots of drama and twists and turns. I am looking for someone who is literate and can write multiple paragraphs per response. This is meant to be a story that we create together, so input and ideas from both parties are necessary to make this enjoyable for both of us.\n\nA little forewarning, I only play original characters and would like your character to be an original character too. Straight off the bat, I'll let you know now that I don't do roleplays that are based on the generes of fandom, supernatural, fantasy, medieval... etc. so if that's what you're looking for, then this is the wrong post for you.\n\nAnyway, a bit about my roleplay history... I've been doing text based roleplay for about 4 years now, with a main preference for romance and slice of life roleplays. I have been told that I am a literate and detailed roleplayer, and I put a great emphasis on using correct spelling and grammar in my responses. In terms of response length, I usually write a few paragraphs, dependant on the situation. As a general rule of thumb, the more I get, the more I give back, but it's never less than a paragraph. \n\nI am looking to create a roleplay where our characters already begin in an established relationship together, and can explore that relationship throughout the course of the roleplay, as different events and situations arise in their lives. I know this may sounds strange and a little boring, but I have a few ideas in mind that you can read over if you choose to PM me.\n\nAs for NSFW, I am comfortable with NSFW elements in a roleplay, but am happy to exclude them too. If NSFW elements are incorporated, I personally prefer my roleplay's to revolve around the plot and storyline, rather than the NSFW elements themselves.\n\nI'm hoping that I have expressed enough detail for you to be interested, without writing an entire essay. If you would like to roleplay with me or hear more about my ideas, feel free to send me a PM. If you have any ideas then I'm more than happy to hear those too, if you feel that they align with what I'm looking for.",

The unit we will be playing as is the infamous E Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th, 101st Airborne, made popular by the hit HBO series 'Band of Brothers'. All roles are currently open such as squad leaders, enlisted positions, and NCO positions, as well as all MOSs that were accepted in the paratroopers such as riflemen, mortars, machine gunners, and more.\n\nOur current numbers are around 40+ members within the Discord with nearly 2 full rifle squads filled completely. We are in need of many more players in various roles for our third rifle squad, as well as mortar men in our fourth squad which acts as a support element. \n\nOur discord: https://discord.gg/ZGrknq7\n\nIf you have any questions about the roleplay, please do not hesitate to join the discord and message any of the admins there!\n",

I don't care how long you've been at it, but I would like someone who has proper grammar and spelling, since it can really throw a story off. Also, I'm in my mid-20s and happily married, so finding someone in the same age bracket is preferable and smut be kept to a minimum (if at all). \n\nWhen it comes to fandoms, I have good knowledge on Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Lord of the Rings, etc. I also really love medieval/Renaissance history and WWII history. But if there's anything else you've been dying to try, I'm more than happy to research and give it a go!\n\nAlso, I don't RP on anything else BUT Discord. Everything else is usually a pain in the butt, and sadly instant messengers have gone the way of the dinosaur (RIP AIM).\n\nMessage me if you're interested!",

I'm really looking for something fantasy related lately, sci-fi, post apocalyptic eith zombies or magic, medieval fantasy, anything really!! This doesn't mean I'm not up for something else though, if the idea intrigues me then I'd love to try it. So don't be afraid to throw other ideas at me. The only thing I won't do is fandom. I'd rather everything be OC. If you wanna play a fandom character in our original world then go for it but I'll be playing OC and our world will be OC. \n\nSo, besides that id like my partner to be 18+. I do love some good nsfw stuff in my roleplays, though it certainly won't be the center and will come naturally along the way. I like plot and story over everything else. Id also like this to be 3rd person past tense as that's what I'm most comfortable in. I consider myself literate, I've been role-playing for 10+ years but I don't mind if you aren't. As long as you give me more then a sentence and I can understand what you've written then we'll be good to go. Another note is that I'm on quite frequently so I'd like my partner to be as well. At least one post a day would be great. I get that life happens though, just let me know if something comes up and if you'll be gone for an extended time. \n\nI think that's about it! If you've made it this far feel free to PM me! Thanks. =)",

I don\u2019t mind if you want to do a canon character though \n- Would prefer someone who enjoys discussing world building/character building (I do like to sketch and will probably draw both our characters if that sweetens the pot for anyone) \n- sci-fi/fantasy/supernatural characters are my forte though modern is fine too!\n- 3rd person writing preferred \n- Romance, smut, murder, gore etc are all fine by my standards though just give me a heads up and I\u2019ll avoid anything not to your tastes \n- I play male, female, nb, trans etc characters and am open to any relationship types between characters as well\n\nI\u2019m a little new here so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve missed anything out but if I have feel free to ask!

            "selftext": "**About Me:** \n\n- I'm in college so posting won't be rapid. I'm also working. Yay money!\n\n- I give about three to five paragraphs.\n\n- I want us to use canon characters.\n\n- I stick to third person, past tense.\n\n- I tend to stick to reddit, google docs, or email. I am open not open to groups right now. I have enough responsibilities here and on another site to juggle groups or stuff like discord or kik or skype. So please don't message me looking for discord or groups.\n\n- It's important we keep in touch to plot and stay on the same page. My partner should be happy and eager to post and that means voicing what we both want to happen. I love chatting with my partners. I also like knowing if any delay is gonna happen, if you need to wait a couple weeks, that's cool. I'm a patient person. I try to be chill but try not to keep me on the hook for too long. Generally speaking if we need a break, I'm fine as long as I'm not kept in the dark about it.\n\n- Mature content is okay with me but I don't like it creeping into the RP frequently. My focus is on storytelling, not ripping off one another's clothes or seeing who can create the music epic combat scenes. Also any characters who might be under 18 will be aged up to be 18 for romantic plots. \n\n- Lastly the general tone of my RPs tend to be light and focused on slice of life stuff. I don't need tons of action or dramatics happening all the time because it's just going to drain my motivation to post. To me writing is about escape and life is too dramatic to have it being written about as well.\n\n**Fandoms:** Okay so below are a collection of canons I can play and ones I am seeking for someone to play for me. I am open for doubling and sharing roles. Please PM me to talk about plot and pairs. Or other fandoms or crossovers.\n\n**The Good Place:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Eleanor, Tahani, Chidi, Jason and Trevor.\n\n*Characters I want someone to write as:* Michael, Tahani, Chidi and Eleanor.\n\n**The Hunger Games:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Katniss, Gale, Peeta.\n\n*Characters I want someone to write as:* Haymitch, Gale, Primrose, Peeta,\n\n**Marvel:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Pepper, Jessica, Trish, Steve, Tony, Colleen, Danny, Raven, Erik, Charles and Laura.\n\n*Characters I want someone to write as:* Logan, Matt, Tony, Steve, Jessica, Kilgrave, Danny and Natasha.\n\n**Harry Potter:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Hermione, Luna, Ron, Ginny, Draco and Lily.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Harry, Draco, Snape, Lupin, Luna and Cho.\n\n**Death Note:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Light, Misa, Matsuda, Sayu, Near, Ryuk, Rem and Naomi.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* L, Light, Ryuk, and Rem.\n\n**Dot Hack:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Blackrose, Kite, Elk, Atoli, Haseo, Pi, Saku, Bo and Endurance.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Haseo, Kite, Saku, Kuhn, Atoli and Alkaid.\n\n**Doctor Who:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Rose, Tenth Doctor, Martha and Amy.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Ninth Doctor, Tenth Doctor, Rory and Eleventh Doctor.\n\n**Fruits Basket**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Kagura, Tohru, Kisa, Momiji, Hana, Kyo, Yuki, Shigure and Ayame.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Haru, Hatori, Kagura, Momiji, Kisa and Uo.\n\n**Naruto:** \n\n*Characters I write as:* Sakura, Ino, Naruto, Hinata and Lee.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Shikamaru, Kakashi, Ino, Naruto, Shino and Sasuke.",

My timezone is GMT.\n\n- The max I'll give is a paragraph and a half. I don't like writing very long walls of text because I believe shorter texts are much more interactive and real-time which makes it more engaging in my opinion. I'm a detailed RP'er, but I also prefer to summarise. \n\n- Been RP'ing for about 7 years.\n\n- I also do enjoy a few anime, such as Dragon Ball Super, My Hero Academia, Hunter x Hunter, and a few western cartoons like Rick and Morty. (I'm sort of depressed, which is why I'm watching very little and doing absolutely nothing at all these days.)\n\nNOTE: ONE THING I DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT.\n\n- RP'ing as canon characters in fandoms. All characters MUST be original. \n\nHello,\nIt is a rather weird title, but it is exactly what it implies. \n\nI'm looking for a small group of people (max 5-6), instead of a single person to create an immersive, small world and RP in it together. I'm someone who enjoys development, world-building and amazing story-line when it comes to RP, and I'd like to create an amazing experience with a group of fairly skilled and determined RP'ers which I hope can be shared long-term. \n\nThe main genre I enjoy is fantasy which includes magic, super abilities and spells and whatnot. In terms of the world and story of fantasy, the main two would be: \nModern fantasy. \nMedieval/Mythical fantasy.   \n\nThis isn't something that I expect to be the main genre of all of our RP, I hope to expand, experiment and enjoy from many different other genres with you guys so I can grow and become better than what I currently am. Some from the top of my head include:\n\n- Post-apocalyptic\n\n- Sci-fi\n\n- Others I can't think of right now.\n\nThat's all, if you're interested, please show this in your PM and I'll have the discord link sent out to you as soon as possible. Irrespective of my full-time job I will make an effort to get back to people and be as active as possible. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Thus, I decided to create a group by creating the future version of one of my favorite canceled shows, Young Justice. Odds are you've seen the show and you want in. The link to the Google doc will be provided down below. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me on Discord! (Schroeder#6760)\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/161wjGaihYQPzxJomLxMr_tPvCVRzDbuFhUEmEmxDNak/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThis Google doc outlines the basic idea of what I envision. It is in the future (30 years or so), so it allows for new characters (OCs) to be integrated into the group as well as developed characters in this appropriate timeline. For now, the group will be accepting OCs only and will be expected to spend some time creating a biography sheet. I do have some storylines that I want to help flesh out with the involvement of other characters as well as develop relations with other characters. If you are interested, please don't be shy :).\n\nhttps://discord.gg/jucbYcE\n\nThank you and have a nice day. ",

            "selftext": "As the title indicates, I'm looking for someone who would like to write variations or stick to a canon version  of this classic novel with me. I've been writing as Darcy for so long that I feel it's a given that I stick with him, but I am not opposed to writing as Elizabeth if someone else would rather write him. I'd love to see another person's take on my favorite male literary character. \n\nI love to stick with canon, but I also adore believable variation. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite novel ever, and while I had read many variations and sequels, I still love coming up with them in my head and bouncing ideas off another person. \n\nWhen it comes to roleplaying in general, I would vastly prefer a partner who is considerate of time, creative, and literate. I would also prefer someone who is knowledgeable about the time period and the social norms and strictures. I prefer third-person narrative with dialogue in quotations and can write anywhere from one to three paragraphs to a brief novella. Obviously, it depends on the time of day, the availability in my schedule to post, and what's happening in the plot at the time. ;) I also do all RP through google docs. \n\nI am an adult and would really prefer someone who is 23+ to write with. \n\nI also would like to say that I very heavily base the Darcy I write on the Darcy portayed by Colin Firth in the BBC miniseries, which, if you haven't seen, I would highly suggest. I know it's upwards of twenty years old, but it's amazing... I currently have two wonderful writing partners but am checking again to see if there's more interest. Carry on! Private message me for more information or a writing sample if needed. \n\nThanks! ",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit!\n\nI\u2019m interested in some of the below plots, so hit me up if any of them tickle your fancy. Please be 18+\n(I prefer to play male, but enjoy playing multiple characters)\n\nBest Friends:  That seems like it would be fun, jumping from story to story as two best friends fall for each other.\n\nOnline: Our characters are YouTube famous, making videos and those Benjamins. So they have to deal with that unique brand of fame and a budding relationship.\n\nKnocked Up: again, it explains itself. Two people have an unplanned pregnancy. It could be two friends, two strangers, the world is open. Or maybe she's pregnant by a guy who is no longer around but is vibing with someone else, which could add more drama. Could be combined with the best friends plot.\n\nRelated to the above: not quite accidental pregnancy. A single man decides to hire a surrogate so he can have an heir. Feelings crop up, shenanagins ensue. And of course, the RP continues after the kid is born. I am super into this one right now for some reason.\n\nArranged Marriage: Can take place in modern day or a historical setting. For the modern day, it could be a business deal on the parent's end that includes a wedding of some sort. As for a historical setting, it could be a few things. Maybe it is how they end a war. Or it is a business deal of some sort. For those two or something similar, I like the idea of them sniping, having hate sex, generally being snippy and then, thing progress and they learn to work together. \n\nInspired by Stranger Things/Twin Peaks/Riverdale: A Bad Thing (to be thought up by us) happens and upheaves a small town or suburb. Our characters try to navigate the aftermath and figure things out. Can be supernatural or not.\n\nThere are some relationship dynamics I would like to explore: hate to love, age gaps (older man, younger woman, up to 15 years), best friends falling for each other, werewolves or werewolf/human, vampire/human, artist and their muse, opposites attract, boss/employee, co-workers or partners.\n",

Superhuman, nonhuman, and all other kinds of beings occupy this city all fighting for their own reasons. In the past it was the idealistic Golden Age heroes, fighting criminals and inspiring citizens. Then came the Silver Age heroes to battle the villains who rose to fight the previous generation. Next came the Bronze Age heroes who fought against whatever the Silver Age generation left behind. Now comes the New Age, yet unnamed. \n\nYou will be playing an up and coming hero in this city. I'd love for this to focus more on interesting characters and fun stories than being the \"strongest\". I would prefer discord and do have a server prepared with some simplified table top style rules where members will have to just be trusted to play in a way that is fun for everyone. \n\nPM me and I'll give you a link :) I hope to get 3-5 people around including myself.",

I've been wanting to get into DnD but haven't been able to find a group but the bit of experience I've had with DnD roleplaying systems, I've really liked. On top of missing good role-play, I want to get back into writing and the \"Dungeon Mastering\" aspect of DnD RP will help me with that. I'm looking for a few people to help me test the system out before I start planning so that I can maybe get most if not all the kinks out. \n\nThe RP we'll be doing tests for is a Walking Dead role-play, so if you're interested in that kind of thing please read on.\n\nAs I mentioned above the system will be similar to DnD where you roll for actions, reactions, luck, etc and I (the DM) will tell the story according to how good or bad you end up rolling. I will try my best to let the players decide the way the story ends and even how early it ends, I'll controll all NPCs and the only character players will control is their own. The idea is to simulate a real world, you cant control how say a dog reacts to your presence but you can control how you react to that dogs reaction. If you're interested in this sort of thing for just the tests or even joining the final role-play please inbox me and I'll shoot you an invite via Discord!",

Calypso, a Facility built underneath the Askifou Valley in Crete, lay cryochambers, able to facilitate 18,000 people until the Second plague dies out. And so 6 factions slept in cryostasis for over five million years. Greece as a whole has changed by then, Demeter, a phenomena where the Spring and Summer is fertile and hot, but the autumn and winters are frigid cold, where rivers can turn to ice. The Wildlife has adapted too, growing ever ferocious, and ever more daring, as their fear of humans has long since been lost. As the last humans awake in this new world, tensions rise, as 6 former enemies are now have to share the same roof. The EU, USA, Scandinavian Brotherhood, Russo-China Pact, Sino-Korean Confederacy and the Oceanic Alliance. Will Humanity prevail, or shall we wipe ourselves out, guns blazing. \nWelcome to the Isles of Lazarus.\nIf you like semi-futuristic survival rps or speculative evolution then this is perfect for you.\nhttps://discord.gg/dUuXXVC",

That is not much to ask, but apparently for most roleplayers it is a death sentence. Anyways, if you can actually be literate, keeps things semi-clean (I am ok with smut), and make things interesting, I'd love to roleplay with you!\n\n-------------------------------------------------- \n\nThe roleplay I want to do is either based off a few video games and one a movie. In each prompt, I would prefer to play dinosaurs over humans.\n\n1. The Isle. A world balancing between dinosaurs and humans. Humans are either against dinosaurs or decide to live with them in peace. Most dinosaurs dislike humans but herbivores are usually ok with them. I can explain more on kik for this one.\n\n2. Ark. Another world where dinosaurs and humans coexist, but humans start off with really nothing. They can tame dinosaurs but it is rather difficult - you have to slowly learn how to survive.\n\n3. Jurassic Park/World. In this one, you can be a dinosaur trainer and I will be the dinosaur you wish to train! Or we can both be dinosaurs, I don't mind, ahah. To further this one, I'd like it where they end up escaping successfully and maybe are able to force the world to come together and stop these dinosaurs, or will they perish to the beasts that once ruled this world?\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n~Hah.. if you can't tell.. I am a major dinosaur nerd..~\n\nI have a kik and discord, PM me yours along with which prompt you like - maybe your own? -3- Have a good day. ",
