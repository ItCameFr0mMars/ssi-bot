            "selftext": "Welcome to Alleira, a realm of monsters and men. On this strange and vast continent exist the living dungeons; sentient structures that grow and evolve consuming men and beast alike. As the consciousnesses of these strange entities consumed material and creatures they began luring adventurers into their depths with treasures and powerful weapons. Despite the risk of having their mind, soul, and body consumed by the dungeon the foolhardy and power hungry descended into these dungeons in search of riches or power. Over time a new class of warrior arose from the dreck, empowered by the very dungeons they fought in these warriors connected the scattered dungeoneer guilds into one. Thus, the age of the Dungeon was born. \n\nOn the far east continent of Alleira lies the great and old city of Vessier. The capital of the enigmatic Magi, this city of deep canals and glittering towers stands as the seat of unrivaled power of these strange quasi-immortals. The Magi themselves masters of science and magic have cultivated the dungeon beneath their city into the world\u2019s only divine class dungeon. One hundred and twenty levels of traps, beasts, obstacles, and puzzles await any Dungeoneer brave or foolish enough to brave her challenges. \n\nOnly Dungeoneers who have proven themselves by clearing ten dungeons before they receive a coveted Grand Dungeon pass. \nThat is why you are here. As a battle-hardened member of the guild, you have fought through your small town\u2019s micro dungeon to Great Dungeon of your region. Now after earning your Grand Dungeon pass you\u2019ve arrived in Vessier during a great celebration. The princess of the Magi, Lady Vel, is celebrating her three hundredth birthday and has invited you amongst other Grand Dungeoneers to attend her birthday party. Rumors abound in the city as the Princess is set to reopen the Grand Dungeon after a ten-year closure and persons of great interest return to the city. \n\nIt\u2019s said that Vallen Blackfire, the great alchemist, and mage, has returned to the city from his long self-imposed exile. A great corsair fleet commanded by the dread Admiral Valla Blackfire floats above the city alongside airships from a dozen different nations. Strange magic and otherworldly sciences are leaking into the city as a massive month-long festival rages in the canals of the great city. Mystery and intrigue abound at every corner, and caught up in all of it is you. Who will you become in this time of change and celebration? If you care to find out simply submit your Grand Dungeon pass to Guild administrator. \n\n***\n\nHello! I'm here tonight to see if I cant interest a person or persons in my little world. This whole world is the remnants of a homebrew I GM'd not too long ago and want to resurrect. In this world, your character can be anything you like be it a centaur mage to an Ork librarian or even if you're feeling adventurous, a human warrior.\n\n\nIf this sounds like fun to you don't hesitate to stop by:\nhttps://discord.gg/SXMMZfn\n  ",

            "selftext": "**WARNING!\nLONG POST AHEAD!**\n\nHallo!I've been roleplaying for seven or so years now. I work in a wide variety of topics; apocalypse and sci-fi are general favorites however I'll happily take up a topic that's interesting. A few on the details about me:\n\n* 22 years old and fine with romance/NSFW when it's a good addition to the plot.\n* EST Time zone- I'm happy to play with someone from any zone, though!\n* I basically work full time, however I'm off by 4pm EST nine times outta ten when I am working.\n* If I'm working, I might be able to get a short reply in. Or a long one, if the manager is nice and it's slow.\n* Preference for long-term roleplay. \n* Loves to read. Please, write me novels. I can mirror fairly well when it's called for.\n* Third person, past tense. The usual here! \n* I'm pretty good about grammar but typos do like to slip out. (I also intermix variations, like color and behaviour)\n* Lots of characters- I prefer female roles (naturally) but I have males as well. \n* Likes to throw said characters under buses. Expect lots of angst. \n* I'll roleplay most things that aren't ponies. General furry stuff I'm not too interested in.\n* I like to draw so I may draw things\n* Discord is preferred, but I also have Telegram.\n* Okay with cursing\n* I'll tell about the *saucy* preferences in chat!\n* I try to reply quickly- sometimes I might be out of it, tired, at work, but don't fret. If it's been a while feel free to poke!\n\n\nAs for a partner, I'm looking for anyone that's at least 20 years old. Romance typically happens in roleplays with me; smut as well when it's fitting. I'd like for someone to have a passion for writing, since I love to get a long response to sit and read. Willing to work with me to create something fun for both of us, as well. I'd like a long term story, but shorter I can be too. Just, please, tell me if you're not feeling like roleplaying. I'm sure we all could tell how we're upset someone we were excited to RP with flaked and blocked us with no explanation. However, I want to add that right now I think Discord is occasionally glitching to where it thinks we are not friends; I can't send a message nor a new request to someone when it happens. I don't know what is going on with it, but if it appears I have blocked you for absolutely nothing, then please do message me on here! \n\n\nAnd to wrap up, here's a couple of starts I've been thinking about. I have lots of characters, so if you have something you've been itching to do, then please do mention it!\n\n\n~~~~~~\n\n\n**Life on the ARK**\n\n\nIf you like dinosaurs, this one could be fun. This will run along with the game ARK: Survival Evolved, where dinosaurs of all eras live on the same land. However such a small island ecosystem it seems they live on, and continue to appear even if we slay them by the thousands on the island. This can be played with any map, though I am most familiar with Ragnarok and Aberration. Will our characters wake up on the land and survive long enough to find each other? Will we tribe up and work hard to become an alpha tribe? Will we start as enemies and one captures the other, eventually growing closer? Who knows! All I do know is I'd love to have a story around this game because I'm a total dinosaur nerd and I have a character I *really* wanna play in this.\n\n\n**Are we cursed? Or are we blessed?**\n\nThis one is using Kovorra Yundu. I want to work with her again, after having her on the backburner for so long- years, in fact! I would like to work with Kov being someone of prophecy, perhaps someone that was to somehow free the world of its shackles to darkness or something. It would probably go something like a child was given to gods to rear as a warrior for ridding demons with angelic  wings in the texts; however the truth is far from that. Your character would some way or another find Kov (or her happen upon yours) most likely. I like the thought that at first it's not even a thought, then it comes to realize that their heroine has wings of glass and is completely blind. This ensues with how in the world was Kov supposed to defeat demons and cast away darkness when a single strike will shatter her wings.",

            "selftext": "So for the past year or so me and my best friend have kind of drifted apart in our interests, especially when it comes to the things we want to roleplay.  As such, I am looking for a new RP partner to help me scratch that creative itch that's going on inside my brain for now.\n\nI am comfortable playing both males and females in RP.  Though I tend to enjoy playing more...assertive characters.\n\nLooking mostly for a chill and relaxed person I can nerd out with about fandoms as much as we play them.  Please do be literate or at least accepting of grammatical criticism...I am a bit of a spelling nazi.  (Not so much grammar though.) \n\nAs such, here's a list of ideas bouncing around in my head that we could roll with:\n\n**RWBY**\n\n1. In this world, Raven Branwen left and never returned.  Abandoned her daughter to the care of her ex and disappeared from Vale entirely. In another world, she came back - only to find that the spitting image of her partner from STRQ had lost her own mother and was tugging on her heartstrings...and honestly, if she had to have a daughter, Ruby Rose definitely did more to match her color scheme.\n\n(AU where Raven takes Ruby under her wing following Summer's death.  It's a case where I want to play a Ruby that was raised differently and explore how her interactions with Weiss, Blake and Yang change, among others.)\n\n2. After being hit with Cinder's spear, Weiss Schnee didn't really expect to wake up staring at the ceiling of Haven Academy.  That, of course, did not mean she expected to wake up staring at the ceiling of *Beacon* Academy. So you can understand her confusion when she woke up staring at the bottom of a bunk bed that no longer existed. And you can probably understand why her heart leapt straight out of her chest when she found herself blinking blearily up at a pair of silver eyes for a brief half second before the piercing shrill of a whistle filled her ears, matched only by the scream that escaped from her throat. \n\n(AU where Weiss dies in the end of Vol 5 and is transported back in time to the day after the formation of Team RWBY.)\n\n3. Salem had won.  Humanity was all but conquered, the last vestiges of resistance existing in the forms of WBY and JNR, but those were token struggles considering that Cinder Fall stood at the door of the cell looking at the heart and soul of both teams, weak and broken on the floor with all the fight drained from her silver eyes.  Somewhere deep inside, the Fall Maiden felt something cold grip a heart she had long thought gone.  And it was in that moment that she realized she had to do something.  Ruby didn't deserve this.  Nobody deserved this.  And while Cinder couldn't take back the things she had done, she could at least try to shove the adorable spark of optimism back into this beautiful girl and give her a fighting chance.  So when she opened the door to suspicion and fear from the girl and moved to loosen her chains, only to feel the body go limp in her arms and the laugh of her Queen behind her, the sudden shattering of that heart, and the eruption of a volcano of despair had everything going white.  ---Now why was she in a cabin and who was this old wizard asking her if she wanted to make up for her mistakes?\n\n(AU time travel where Cinder Falls (heheh) for Ruby and gets the chance to go back and make up for all the things shes done.)\n\n**STAR WARS REBELS** Ezra/Sabine?\n\n1. Sabine didn't know what her family was thinking.  Yes, Ezra was a very good friend, and yes, by Mandalorian standards she was old enough she should have married and started her own family like, five years ago.  And sure, he may be one of the most reliable people she knew, period. But that didn't mean that she wanted to *Marry* him! ...Of course, if they were going to pull tradition on her and make her get married to *someone* she honestly couldn't think of anyone she'd rather be paired with, either.  Especially after the gift he gave her the night after she gave the Darksaber away to Bo-Katan...\n\n(This is a scenario after Sabine gives Bo-Katan the Darksaber, based on Mandalorian lore from legends, where Sabine's family recognizes everything Ezra has done to support Sabine without asking anything in return.  Like any family, they want the best for their daughter/sister.  I can play either Ezra or Sabine.)\n\n[SPOILERS FOR REBELS FINALE]\n\n2. Four years.  Four years that Sabine Wren watched over Lothal like the Guardian it had lost when Ezra disappeared with the Purgill.  Four years she had spent thinking of the best friend she had lost at the same time.  The rest of the Ghost crew had all wandered away over the years, Zeb and Kallus to Lira San, Hera, Chopper, Jacen and Rex to the far reaches of the galaxy supporting the Rebel Alliance.  But Sabine couldn't move on.  A pair of blue eyes haunted her dreams at night, as did visions of other places; planets and peoples she'd never seen before.  A boy that she had seen grow from a childish casanova wannabe who hit on her at every opportunity to one of the most noble individuals she'd ever had the pleasure of fighting alongside.  His lightsaber hung from her hip even now.  Something deep inside her knew, definitively, that the liberation of Lothal had not been the end of Ezra Bridger's story.  He was out there, somewhere.  And looking out over the skyline of a now permanently free Lothal City, the Empire but an awful memory, what *she* had to do, whatever it took:  It was time to bring him back to her.  It was time to bring him home.\n\n(Pretty simple: I just want to RP the adventures of Sabine and Ahsoka over the course of their search for Ezra, and then eventually Sabine and Ezra's reunion. Can play Ahsoka/Ezra or Sabine.)\n\n**PRINCESS PRINCIPAL** Ange/Charlotte\n\n1. Ten years. For ten years each had lived the life of the other, so much so that they were now forever locked in the life that they had chosen.  Dorothy, Beatrice...they don't know the connection between the two, but Dorothy, for all her spy training, can't help but feel that something is *off* when Ange le Carre approaches the Princess at the ballroom, and when Ange so effortlessly impersonates the Princess as if she had been born for the role. But she wants to find out.\n\n(Ange/Princess with a dose of secret keeping from the rest of the team, preferably with a scenario at some point that results in that secret being exposed. Would prefer to play Ange.)\n\n**DARLING IN THE FRANXX** Zero Two/Hiro\n\n1. The Jian.  A bird with only one wing and one eye.  Hiro thought he would never fly until he found Zero Two, but he didn't realize that meeting her he would being to *see* as well.  \n\n(Vague, I know.  This ones really up in the air; I don't have a whole lot of specific ideas for it but it's a universe I would love to play around in. Plus Zero Two is just the best. Would prefer to play Zero Two but I can play Hiro as well.)\n\n**VIOLET EVERGARDEN**\n\n1. Violet Evergarden doesn't miss her arms.  She never has.  Not when they fell off at the Battle of Intense, and not when she finally realized how thoroughly broken she was on the way back to Leiden from Oscar's.  There's something far more important *missing* from her life and she's desperate to find it.\n\n(I want to play Violet in this scenario...you could play whoever you want, really.  Be that the Major, be that Leon, be that Iris or Cattleya or an OC entirely.)\n\n**CW ARROWVERSE**\n\n1. Oliver Queen/Nyssa al-Ghul.  Nyssa al-Ghul expected many things when her father forced her to marry Oliver Queen.  She wasn't expecting to be freed from the chains of her fathers expectations.  She wasn't expecting for her husband to so casually support her and constantly challenge her to be better.  She certainly wasn't expecting to see why, once upon a time, Sara had loved him. \n\n(This is the more standard AU from Arrow Season 3 going forward from there. I am also up for doing an AU of the island with a Sara/Oliver roleswap. I can play either Nyssa or Oliver.  Or Sara if we want to add her in and make it Olyssara.) \n\n2. Oliver/Supergirl.  One thing could be said about the Nazis from Earth-X; they were *rude*.  Seriously, who interrupts someones wedding?  That being said, when all was said and done...after the ashes of Overgirl and the body of the Black Arrow fell to the ground, Oliver Queen was left with the realization that him and Felicity were over.  They wanted different things out of life and they'd done more to hurt each other in the last three years than they had to help each other.  That, and his Nazi counterpart had opened his eyes to an impossibility that he couldn't keep out of his head. An impossibility of an adorkable and perky blonde that he would never be able to hurt, no matter how hard he punched or how many arrows he let loose.\n\n(You can probably tell I *really* don't like Olicity. I would actually probably prefer to play Kara for this but I could play Oliver as well.)\n\n3. Barry/Caitlin.  It's been months since the defeat of Savitar, and while Caitlin Snow understood that it had had to happen, all she could feel in her heart was the crystallizing ice as Killer Frost built the walls around her heart.  All she could think about was that, in a way, Savitar was a piece of Barry that she'd been able to have all to herself.  Sure, Iris was her friend, and Barry was her friend.  After everything they'd been through, they deserved what they had.  They deserved to be together.  That didn't stop Caitlin Snow from wanting that speedrush and those vibrating hugs to warm her soul and make her feel like a little bit less of a monster.\n\n(...Yep. I call KF&amp;Caitlin for this.) \n\n**CODE GEASS**\n\n1. *Checkmate*.  That one word was among the multitude of last thoughts that Lelouch vi Britannia had as he lay dying in the arms of his sister.  Chess, he had wagered many things on games of chess in his past, but this was the first time he'd ever played White while betting on Black.  It was also the last time he would ever get to play a game...Or so he thought.  Right up until the point where he awoke as Luluko vi Britannia in a haze of bleary-eyed confusion, wondering *what the hell* was going on.\n\n(Inspired by Nil Desperandum, among other things.  I just want to play the insanity that is a female Lelouch with the memories of another life.  Could be Luluko/Suzaku, Luluko/Kallen, Luluko/CC, Luluko/Milly...take your pick. Or all of them.  That's an option too.)\n\n2. Kallen Kozuki-Stadtfeld had been unsure of many things in her life.  It had been the catalyst behind the loss of Lelouch's memories, and the question of whether her loyalty was subject to his will or a construct all her own had always bothered her.  Right up to this very moment; when the costumed form of Zero appeared on the horizon and began it's charge towards the Emperor she had once called her leader, the world slowed to a halt and the crippling, heartrending realization hit her all at once that she was absolutely sure she had *screwed up*, and now there was nothing she could do but watch.  There were three things she hated in that moment; Suzaku Kurugi, for going along with this asinine assisted suicide.  Herself, for being so easy to lose her faith in the man of miracles.  And this feeling of helplessness, for she was strapped to a pole and could do nothing to stop it as the man who had turned her life on end sacrificed himself to make all her dreams come true.  In another universe, that would have been her at his side, not Suzaku.  In another universe, he would have a reason to keep on living.  In another universe, she wouldn't have been such a coward. But this wasn't another universe, and she could do nothing but watch as the Emperor found himself skewered on the blade of Zero.  Could do nothing but watch as he took his last breaths in the arms of his sister.  And as he faded away, so too did she.\n\n(Kallen/Lelouch.  Even though there's only a handful of Kallen time travel fics out there, I adore them all the same.  I would play Kallen for this.)\n\n**YOUR NAME**\n\n1. Okay, so I have no real idea for this.  But I adore this movie and I absolutely want to RP it.  There are a few options out there that have given me inspiration.  Your [True] Name which is a Persona/Your Name crossover, and then there's a new fic that I am hoping is updated soon where the body-swap never stops.  But I'm open to brainstorming on this one.\n\n**BLEACH**\n\n1. *Dance, Sode no Shirayuki.*  Rukia had heard those words many times before in her life, tumbling from her own lips.  She was so surprised and dumbfounded to hear them coming from Ichigo's lips when he came to stop Renji and Nii-sama from taking her away to Soul Society that she didn't know what to think.  So surprised and dumbfounded that she didn't feel the sudden yank in her chest as if something were trying to pull her heart out.\n\n(AU where Ichigo doesn't have a Zanpakuto; Zangetsu is his inner Hollow.  Yhwach is his inner Quincy, and Sode no Shirayuki finds herself in his soul when he took Rukia's powers, and finds that he needs some help to find a balance between the instinct of Zangetsu and the wisdom of Yhwach.  With Rukia's life on the line, she takes up that mantle, knowing it may mean that she'll never get to see her original wielder again.  I have other plans for Rukia, so don't worry about her being powerless.)\n\nThis is far from the end of all the ideas I have, but they are the most immediate plot bunnies bouncing around.  ",

            "selftext": "Hi guys! I'm Ker and I\u2019m looking for awesome  stories to tell. \n\nRight off the bat, I\u2019d like to make it clear that I\u2019m comfortable playing an assortment of characters, and generally have two to three main characters. \n\nAs for genres, I prefer sci fi or fantasy. Slice of life can get so mundane. \n\nI\u2019ve been reading a book about J Allen Hynek, and am in flying saucer mode. Give me something with the Men In Black, harassing abductees who then go on the run, or maybe something to do with Area 51. Bonus points if there\u2019s some sort of language barrier or the aliens are really, really alien.\n\nSimilarly, I\u2019ve been working on developing a fantasy world, complete with magic and dragons. If you\u2019re interested, let me know, and we\u2019ll see what we can work out together.\n\nAs for fandoms, I\u2019ll keep the list short. SU, Marvel Cinematic Universe( with some minor restrictions), Dragon Age Inquisition, and Mass Effect (OT and Andromeda).\n\nI'm also open to other suggestions, please tell me if you've got something else on your mind!\n\nWhile I prefer to have romance in my stories, it\u2019s not a requirement. \n\nWe can talk about our personal limits once we start talking, I hate to bog down a post with too much.\n\nOther than that, I love OOC chat, I\u2019m in my mid twenties, work as a waitress and a research assistant, and eventually plan on getting a PhD. \n\nCan\u2019t wait to hear from you!

Some of my favorites are Soul Eater, Sword Art Online, and My Hero Academia. Of course, I'm up for anything you might suggest as well, I'm very flexible and able to play either gender and a multitude of character types. For the genre of RP I am once again flexible, although I enjoy a healthy mix of Slice of life, Combat, and romance, if at all possible in the situation (Although I understand not every RP needs or can include combat). I like my partners to be somewhat available, I understand that daily might not be possible, but more than a couple posts a week is preferred. My posts vary depending on yours, but on my own I always attempt at least 1-2 paragraphs, if not more. I'm not super picky about everything being prim and proper grammatically, we all make mistakes! I'm looking forward to speaking with you, Pm me if you are interested!",

I'm really into anything Fantasy related. Medieval, modern, futuristic, apocalyptic. If it's got fantasy attached then I am down. This doesn't mean I'm not up for something else though, if the idea intrigues me when I'd love to try it. So don't be afraid to throw other ideas at me. The only thing I won't do is fandom. I'd rather everything be OC. If you wanna play a fandom character in our original world then go for it but I'll be playing OC and our world will be OC. \n\nSo, besides that id like my partner to be 18+. I do love some good nsfw stuff in my roleplays, though it certainly won't be the center and will come naturally along the way. I like plot and story over everything else. Id also like this to be 3rd person past tense as that's what I'm most comfortable in. I consider myself literate, I've been role-playing for 10+ years but I don't mind if you aren't. As long as you give me more then a sentence and I can understand what you've written then we'll be good to go. Another note is that I'm on quite frequently so I'd like my partner to be as well. At least one post a day would be great. I get life happens though, just let me know if something comes up and you'll be gone for an extended time. \n\nI think that's about it!

I'm more interested in the dynamics of the pairing than anything else, so the genre is flexible. Modern slice of life would work perfectly well for me, but we could incorporate fantasy, urban fantasy, post-apocalyptic - really just about anything, as long as the pairing retains the dynamic I'm looking for. I will say I'm not particularly keen on writing non-human creatures right now, but hey, if you're super into the idea and want to pitch me something, go for it.\n\nI would like two write two men (probably 20s or 30s, but I'm very flexible about going older) role. I'm looking for someone to write a very dominant personality to play against a meeker personality, which I will write. What I'm NOT looking for is straight up smut. I'm not trying to write literotica, I'm trying to write the day-to-day relationship of this couple. Frankly, we don't need to write any sex scenes at all. I'm also not interested in anything over-the-top or violent. I want once again, the emphasis on the development of an actual relationship and actual character journey/growth.\n\nI do have a few scenarios in mind; I am very open to hearing any other ideas.

            "selftext": "Good afternoon. I'm here in search of a few different roleplay ideas that are just nagging to be written but I am also down to discuss and see if we can come up with something we may both be interested in pursuing. I'll get a few of the usual tidbits out of the way, first, before moving on to the plots.  \n\n&gt; **\u00bb\u00bb** I am old. Been around since MSN chatroom days.  \n&gt; **\u00bb\u00bb** I roleplay in 3rd person, past tense only. I am most familiar with email for roleplay, but I am open to using Discord or trying out Google Docs for it. Patience with the learning curve is all I ask.  \n&gt; **\u00bb\u00bb** My main characters tend to be female. I do not require doubling and won't double, fair warning. I do f/m and f// pairings. For side characters, I play either gender.  \n&gt; **\u00bb\u00bb** If we have a roleplay going, I'm not looking to replace you. I love you, dear partners. &lt;3 I have room for a partner or two more, though, so that's why the ad is still up and being bumped.  \n&gt; **\u00bb\u00bb** I am looking for someone interested in a long-term roleplay (whether the same one or multiple lines) and who enjoys writing as well as plotting. I am also looking for someone who communicates with me: likes, dislikes, if something is causing a stalemate in the roleplay. I like talking to the people I roleplay with, getting to know you, sharing things (music, TV shows, movies, tumblr if that's your things). Just be open and honest, yeah?   \n\nNow to the plots.  \n\n***\u00bb\"Not your first rodeo.\"\u00ab***\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the highest on my list currently. I loved The Punisher and Daredevil. I love Karen Page. I love Frank Castle. I love David Lieberman. I love them all really. \n&gt; **^\uf480Misc:** This will obviously be fandom-based from the Netflix series, mostly, but I am open to the movies. I have Karen, I need Frank. Or anyone else to play Karen against honestly. Let's do this. Obviously m/f for romance. Open to ideas, either canon-compliant, canon-divergent, AUs, all of it. Give me.\n\n***\u00bb\"And blood tears I cry...\"\u00ab***  \n\n&gt; This has always been my #1 love fandom-wise, no lie. I'm interesting in pitting my Noldor healer, Nessavend\u00eb, against just about anyone she would run in to in her time. She spans from the Light of the Two Trees to the Fourth Age, so there is a lot of wiggle room with her, generally, because Nessa is old but she is also kinda cranky. She would have more dealings with other elves and humans, not so much dwarves or hobbits, so just keep that in mind.  \n&gt; **^\uf480Misc:** Oh yes, this desire is back (c'mon, it never really left). I'm down for playing her against originals and canon characters - both well-known canon and little-known canon. Platonic relationships, friendships, hateships, romantic relationships, bring it all on. Nessa can go m/f for romance or f//. This can run the gamut because of the history that Middle-earth is entrenched in (some good ol' freezing times in the Helcarax\u00eb, perhaps? Wars? Fights over lands? It's all there). In the Second and Third Age, Nessa does travel often among the human settlements, so she isn't stuck in JUST Gondor/Rohan/Rivendell/Lothlorien, which means she has dealings with not-so-savory characters as well. I am also game for AU lines (what ifs, things like what if F\u00ebanor's sons all didn't die horrible deaths, etc) and also putting them into a modern setting of some sort. Let's see what we can come up with for her, hm?  \n\n&gt; My second Tolkien offering is a little-history-known canon character by the name of Loth\u00edriel. She is the youngest child of Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth, and she becomes the Queen of Rohan at the end of the Third Age/beginning of the Fourth Age when she weds \u00c9omer.   \n&gt; **^\uf480Misc:** Well, unlike the previously listed Tolkien desire, this one is a little more limited since her timeline is in the Third Age/War of the Ring era. I am game for playing her against a plethora of characters though - her cousins, her brothers, her future husband, or any original character you might have she would come into contact with which includes her future subjects (also have an original character fiance you could play if that floats your boat but he dies so...). Let's see what we can come up with, shall we? Loth is only m/f for romance plotlines but I am down for all other things including friendships. Same for Nessa, I am interested in putting her into a modern setting as well and working something out.  \n\nI am interested in a possible zombie apocalypse roleplay, too (gave up on TWD recently, need zombies in my life).\n\nIf you are interested, please send me a message on here and we can go from there.",

The group uses discord as a linking platform, and requires the members be willing to join AT LEAST, one RP session a week. The server/group has a fully functioning custom currency system, and government system where you keep track of your character(s) items, homes, cars, etc. We believe in the statement: \u201cBy the players, for the players.\u201d \nMeaning that we will ALWAYS put the community before administration, and will always take their suggestions into deep consideration. \nAs well, administration will host AT LEAST three Roleplaying sessions a week, and players may host RP sessions if they choose. All sessions are with using free-aim, and are invite only.\nRegarding characters, each character starts out with $5,000, and a Hotel room. Factions like the LSPD, allow officers to have faction cars, such as the LSPD Cruiser, or an undercover car when deemed practical for use. We have six factions that you can choose from to start out. Your character can always leave factions, or join other factions on the 15th, or 30th of each month.\n\n\n\u2022Los Santos Police Department\nThe LSPD was founded in 1876, it is the standard department for enforcing the law in Los Santos. They make a pretty nice wage, and pensionp\n\n\n\u2022Emergency Medical Services/Fire Dept.\nThe EMS/Fire Dept is a \u201cconjoined\u201d faction, meaning that Fire Department, and the Medical Services are technically sub divisions.\n\n\n\u2022The Vagos\nA Mexican gang, typically forwarding the heavy drugs such as cocaine, LSD, and heroine from the Cartel. They also receive guns from the Cartel, of which, they sell to the locals via the black market.\n\n\n\u2022Santa Blanca Cartel\nOriginating in Mexico, the cartel was eventually pushed out from the area, moving its operation to Bolivia, and then shipping their drugs over to Los Santos for the Vagos to sell for them. They are here to replace the Madrazo Cartel, of which, has been pushed out of the region due to the imprisonment of Martin Madrazo.\n\n\n\u2022The Balla\u2019s\nThe Balla\u2019s are a standard gang, typically forwarding drugs such as Marijuana. They are very surrounded to their Main Street, Temple Drive.\n\n\n\u2022The Families\nThe families are a gang believing in tradition, rather then making big money, they\u2019d prefer to make some small time cash and stray away from the sale of drugs. However, they are in competition with the Balla\u2019s as they have a marijuana operation\n\n\n\u2022Civilians\nStandard citizens of Los Santos. They could be the next best corporate enterprise owner, or they could be the next best bank robber. \n\nIf you found this advertisement intriguing, feel free to join today on our discord server!

            "selftext": "This ad is going to seem rather brief but with the lack of roleplayers I've run into lately, I am trying to be as open as possible. I just miss having roleplay partners added who are as excited and invested in the plot as I am and would love to get back on that wavelength of mutual creativity with an available roleplayer.\n\nMy biggest and main preference for roleplaying would F/F. Whether that is romantically tied to the plot or not is up to you, I just prefer that it play into our characters and roles since I am most comfortable with that dynamic and it doesn't have to bend the entire story to play into it. \n\nOutside of that, I have been open to a lot more than usual lately although my most played genres are usually action and drama orientated but can entail a lot of different things. Although I am big on exciting and active plotlines I do well with plenty of calmer themes, some super serious, some cutesy and mellow. I can give a better list when asked about it, so I will leave it open for now. I can also play the canon from a large selection of series, whether they be anime, video games, etc.\n\nThis is a lot less detailed than I expected but lately I feel as though I won't be able to find someone to play with by being highly specific, so I am just going to leave it with this and talk out the rest of the details with any interested roleplayers. Just send me a message on here and we can talk about where we might like to RP. My main preference is Discord. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask questions or suggest plays, I am quite ready for anything at this point. Thanks and I hope to hear from some of you! :) ",

And whoever comes out victorious of this civil war will shape the future of Tamriel, forever. This is the beginning, of the War of the Ruby Throne\"*\n\n**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**\n\nThe War of the Ruby Throne is the popular name for the currently on-going civil war that is building up across Tamriel. Three people are all seeking to claim and sit on the Ruby Throne, all of them whom are the children of the Last Dragonborn. A person of the Dragonblood, and all the claimants believe that their Dragonblood give them divine right to rule.\n\nFormally, the war was officiated and declared in 4E 265 by the Aldmeri Dominion and the Mede Empire when the high command of the Imperial Legion, decided to abandon the Mede Empire to align with one of the three claimants, this event has later been known as the Imperial Defection.\n\nIt's now 4E 266. The War is properly raging across Tamriel, three siblings caught fighting each other and their supporters, as well as fighting the High Elven dominance established in the form of the Aldmeri, and their puppet Empire. \n\nThe real question is, *who* are you?\n\n**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**\n\nNow that I've set the scene a little. Hi there! Thanks for reading my post so far! I'm Ceri, a 21-year old, genderfluid Norwegian seeking one or two new RP partners for a specific idea! Namely the one above. So if it interested ya' then keep on reading! Bear with me as this could get lengthy.\n\nOkay so. Before I tell you what I'm looking for in you as a partner, let me tell you a little more about the plot itself, I'm really looking to get a mutli-character view, I love having a large casts, with one or two main pairs or characters, and a grand supporting cast to accompany them. I wanna see this civil war from several sides, maybe one of the pairs are a group of soldiers serving one of the Claimants? Perhaps Imperial nobles in Cyrodiil, and their struggle to remain neutral in the growing tension? All are valid options, but there is one pairing I'm really looking to play;\n\nI want to play as one of the claimants, Emperor-Claimant Kordillus 'Stormcrown'. The eldest of the three children. Ideally we'd play him and his spouse/romantic interest. You play mine and I'll play yours! Easy peasy, right? Details can be worked out and chatted about!\n\nSo, about you;\n\n* Dedicated to playing long-term.\n\n* Be comfortable playing characters of any gender and orientation.\n\n* LGBT+ friendly\n\n* Over the age of 18. (Sorry, minors!)\n\n* Creative and comes with your own ideas and suggestions, I don't wanna pull the plot alone!\n\n* Friendly and interested in OOC chatter, not required but greatly appreciated\n\n* Good grammar and sentence structure, some typos happen and what not, no one is perfect! \n\n* Between 2-5 paragraphs, ideally. I don't mind more, but I'm not the most capable on keeping up with 7+ paragraph posts\n\n* A sucker for romance, political intrigue, scheming and all that good jazz\n\n* Knowledgeable in Elder Scrolls (I'm not an encyclopedia about ES, but I can hold my ground.)\n\n* Ideally okay with NSFW-themes.\n\n* Consistent in writing, I don't do much so I usually can do several replies per day, that doens't mean you gotta do that, but definitely more frequently than once a week!\n\n* Uh, more probably. Can't think of anything *right* now though!\n\nGenerally, if you're interested in playing in the Elder Scrolls universe, with many, diverse characters in a large cast with two or three focal pairings, I'm your person! When you contact me, please make sure to send me some text to work with. I'd like to know a little about you as a person, and a little about you as a writer. Sample not required, this is fun, not a job application~\n\nBasically, send me something to work with so I can decide if we should try and work something out! I hope to hear from y'all! ",

            "selftext": "**About Me:** \n\n- I'm in college so posting won't be rapid. I'm also working. Yay money!\n\n- I give about three to five paragraphs.\n\n- I want us to use canon characters.\n\n- I stick to third person, past tense.\n\n- I tend to stick to **reddit, google docs, or email**. I am open not open to groups right now. I have enough responsibilities here and on another site to juggle groups or stuff like discord or kik or skype. So please don't message me looking for discord or groups.\n\n- It's important we keep in touch to plot and stay on the same page. My partner should be happy and eager to post and that means voicing what we both want to happen. I love chatting with my partners. I also like knowing if any delay is gonna happen, if you need to wait a couple weeks, that's cool. I'm a patient person. I try to be chill but try not to keep me on the hook for too long. Generally speaking if we need a break, I'm fine as long as I'm not kept in the dark about it.\n\n- Mature content is okay with me but I don't like it creeping into the RP frequently. My focus is on storytelling, not ripping off one another's clothes or seeing who can create the music epic combat scenes. Also any characters who might be under 18 will be aged up to be 18 for romantic plots. \n\n- Lastly the general tone of my RPs tend to be light and focused on slice of life stuff. I don't need tons of action or dramatics happening all the time because it's just going to drain my motivation to post. To me writing is about escape and life is too dramatic to have it being written about as well.\n\n**Fandoms:** Okay so below are a collection of canons I can play and ones I am seeking for someone to play for me. I am open for doubling and sharing roles. Please PM me to talk about plot and pairs. Or other fandoms or crossovers.\n\n**The Good Place:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Eleanor, Tahani, Chidi, Jason and Trevor.\n\n*Characters I want someone to write as:* Michael, Tahani, Chidi and Eleanor.\n\n**The Hunger Games:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Katniss, Gale, Peeta.\n\n*Characters I want someone to write as:* Haymitch, Gale, Primrose, Peeta,\n\n**Marvel:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Pepper, Jessica, Trish, Steve, Tony, Colleen, Danny, Raven, Erik, Charles and Laura.\n\n*Characters I want someone to write as:* Logan, Matt, Tony, Steve, Jessica, Kilgrave, Danny and Natasha.\n\n**Harry Potter:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Hermione, Luna, Ron, Ginny, Draco and Lily.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Harry, Draco, Snape, Lupin, Luna and Cho.\n\n**Death Note:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Light, Misa, Matsuda, Sayu, Near, Ryuk, Rem and Naomi.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* L, Light, Ryuk, and Rem.\n\n**Dot Hack:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Blackrose, Kite, Elk, Atoli, Haseo, Pi, Saku, Bo and Endurance.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Haseo, Kite, Saku, Kuhn, Atoli and Alkaid.\n\n**Doctor Who:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Rose, Tenth Doctor, Martha and Amy.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Ninth Doctor, Tenth Doctor, Rory and Eleventh Doctor.\n\n**Fruits Basket**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Kagura, Tohru, Kisa, Momiji, Hana, Kyo, Yuki, Shigure and Ayame.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Haru, Hatori, Kagura, Momiji, Kisa and Uo.\n\n**Naruto:** \n\n*Characters I write as:* Sakura, Ino, Naruto, Hinata and Lee.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* Shikamaru, Kakashi, Ino, Naruto, Shino and Sasuke.",

            "selftext": "Because I'm not going to bother to summarize, I'll simply post the whole lore in this text post. It's not too long, so don't worry. Skimreading to get an idea would be fine. (Genres: Sci-Fi; Slice of life to an extent.)\n\nFounded in 1987, The Cinicula Institute is more than one school - \n\nIt's many. The Cinicula Institute started as a small private school in Vancouver, beginning in the first grade, and ending in the final year of college. They were always known to have some of the most intelligent teachers, and some of the brightest students in the world. Not only this, but they manage to get their hands on any new technology before anyone else does, and they have some of the finest scientists seen in the past few decades.\n\nIt grew over time, gaining a larger campus, and even new locations. The Cinicula Institute would use their high budget in order to grow, and build more institutes in other countries. The Institutes would randomly select countries that met very specific criteria, and then randomly choose locations in the country. If the location was deemed worthy, a Cinicula School would be built. Through this, a small, relatively rural area could quickly become a rich college town - Booming with activity. The Cinicula Project continued, and still does continue. To this day, it is one of the most successful education programs in the world... Regardless of their high tuition charge.\n\nThe large tuition fees lead to the Cinicula Institute becoming a school primarily comprised of rich teenagers, staff, and children.\n\nIt was always simply just a very good educational facility, but that changed when a private scientific study done in 2011 discovered a new phenomenon.\n\nMost people had previously thought that the concept of \"aura\" was just used as a gimmick for online personality quizzes, something that hippies believed in.\n\nHowever, this is simply not the case. Dubbed the \"Breakthrough of 2011,\" scientists and professors at The Cinicula Institute of in Vancouver discovered that aura is in fact, real. The first human known to exert aura was a teenager named Kathy. Kathy was always relatively normal, until she accidentally blew the desks, windows, and ceiling tiles out of her classroom during a typical complaint. She had complained about a science project, and then proceeded to punch her desk.\n\nNobody could tell what happened, but the classroom was virtually unusable. Kathy was taken to one of the school's laboratories, where they examined her to discover what happened. They took many measurements, but the thing that confused them the most was the crimson waves of energy coming off her body. They were transparent, and radiated power, almost like the negative charge of a magnet. Through further study, it was discovered that this energy, dubbed \"aura\" was the prime contributor to what gave humans personality, and emotion. The color of your aura, and the energy given off by it not only almost dictated the way you'd act, but it also allowed humans with unlocked aura to weild amazing power, some even being able to control the elements around them.\n\nRegardless of this, the Cinicula Institutes covered up this study, hiding this phenomenon from the world. They kept all the info within the schools, not allowing it to escape. The students at the academy knew, as they were told upon joining, and the more experienced ones were given pamphlets describing this new phenomenon - Besides them, and the professors, only some world governments knew it existed, it was a closely guarded secret. Aura was being unlocked in these students, for some, at the most inconvenient times. When unlocked, the student would seem to exert the same energy that Kathy did, with a different color that corresponded to their personality. \n\nAfter aura was unlocked, the people posessing it could use it to perform the supernatural feats that were previously mentioned. The Cinicula Institutes call these odd abilities \"Aura Expulsions.\" As you might've guessed, the color of your aura dictates what your expulsion would do.\n\nDespite this, aura expulsion is something that takes a very long time to master, and it is very hard to discover what yours will do once you unlock it. Often, people with aura can't fully control their abilities, or use them to their full potential for years after they unlock their aura.",

My preference is a partner who can reply several times a week, but quality is more important than quantity to me and I'd be willing to wait a few extra days for something amazing.  I'd like to discuss early on what our expectations are with writing frequency and length of posts.  Sustainability is the goal.\n\nI live in the West Coast of the United States, but I'm a night owl so I'm on really late (or really early) for most Americans.  I like to keep a channel of communication open if and when possible in case either party has a question or idea we'd like to run by the other person, and find that Google Hangouts and Discord work the best for me.  Ideally, I'd like to do all the pre-writing talk in real time so it doesn't take a month to sort out all the initial details.  If not, then through e-mail is the next best bet.  I am online daily, and am responsive to messages.\n\nFor the actual writing, I prefer Discord, e-mails, or message boards/forums, or a combination of some kind.\n\n---\n\n##What I'm Looking For\n\n* **3rd person and past tense are my preference.**\n\n* **Something longterm is preferred, but I'm willing to take it day by day.**\n\n* **Detailed writing with decent grammar and punctuation.**\n\n* **Medieval Fantasy.**  High, medium, or low doesn't really matter to me as long as we decide on some parameters early on.  I enjoy a good adventure and don't mind world building if that's your cup of tea, but to start things off, I'd like to keep things simple.  I also enjoy a Game of Thrones type of setup, or any plot with a multi-kingdom or -faction type of deal in which different people with conflicting goals are vying for power.  Maybe Kingdom A is invading Kingdom B, or maybe a previously unknown seafaring people has just launched a successful attack on a peaceful port.\n\n* **Science Fiction**, preferably in space or in some sort of setting where space travel is common or possible.  I admit my space/science knowledge isn't great, but I promise to do my best.  The idea of space travel appeals to me because it makes for more versatility and surprise in the story.  One minute, we could be in a technologically advanced planet.  The next?  Shot down by an enemy spacecraft and stuck on a primitive planet and forced to blend in with the locals while we find our way off.\n\n* **Modern/'Real' World**.  I can handle some slice of life, but I *really* enjoy drama and exploration.  That said, I can do modern or real world if there's another element attached to it.  A different historical period, for example, or supernatural, or crime, or post apocalyptic, etc.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, I like my stories dark and gritty with *some* realism.  I don't want to RP in Candy Land and I understand (and even *expect* that) bad things will happen.  I want my character to experience change (either good *or* bad), to see his/her personality and goals change over time.  Other elements I really enjoy are adventure/exploration, war/diplomacy, romance, NSFW, betrayal, triumph *and* defeat, etc.  I enjoy complicated relationships, and enjoy the emotional ups and downs of well written stories.  I also enjoy comedy and lighthearted humor too, though, so don't think I'm only in it for the serious moments.\n\nIf I sound ambitious, I do apologize.  My goal isn't to scare anyone off, but to convey what I enjoy and what I'm looking for.  I hope I will find one or two people on the same wavelength I'm on, and that we can write something fun and interesting for both of us.  I also hope that whoever I'm lucky enough to write with is as flexible as I am, so if Story 1 ever gets boring (or if one/both of us need a change of scenery), we can move on to Story 2 or 3, or whatever else.\n\nAnyway, I think this novel's gone on long enough.  If interested, send a DM my way and we can exchange Discords and storycraft and all of that.  Otherwise, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day and wish you luck!",

            "selftext": "Hello everybody!\n\nI'm looking to do a dramatic SOL that  revolves around YC saving mine from an abusive relationship.  I have two different ideas that I'm interested in trying out, but I'm also of course interested in any ideas you might have towards the topic!\n\nPrompt 1 (Short and Sweet):\nMy character will be a friend that YC has known for sometime (a old friend from college, ex girlfriend, co-worker or preferably your childhood best friend/crush) who is in an extremely abusive relationship that everyone knows about. You are her one friend, the only person she has kept a secret from her abuser. Though you have tried to convince her to leave him, she stays out of fear.\nOne night however, after a fight my character leaves the apartment and calls you from a local phone, asking for your help. You take her home after she refuses to go to a hospital, not wanting the authorities to get involved. Throughout the night you comfort her, make her feel safe, all the while trying to swallow the feelings you have for her.\n\nPrompt Two (A bit more complicated and totally not Beauty and the Beast themed):\nThe story will focus around two characters. One of which is Lily Miller, an average young adult living in the nicest of the worst apartments in town. Lily is in an abusive relationship and had been for sometime. She rarely is at her apartment anymore due to her boyfriend rarely letting her have any time to herself.\nNext is the character I would like you to play. Almost everything about YC is totally up to you, but for plot purposes he needs to be extremely wealthy, vain, and full of himself (aka the \u2018beast\u2019 in our story). He owns the building in which Lily lives, and after a particularly frustrating day he decides he\u2019s had enough of her missing her rent. Normally, he would never make his way to Shady Oaks- after all it isn\u2019t exactly the ritz, but if he can vent his anger out on this stranger and get his money- great.\nHowever, when he gets there he\u2019ll feel some kind of pity for her when he can see the signs of physical abuse that she\u2019s been trying to hide. He tries to relate to her, but due to his poor social graces only ends up offending Lily, which only makes him mad.\nHe won\u2019t see her again for a few months until she misses her rent again. Still fuming over the encounter months ago he decides to confront her again, ready to evict her- but when he arrives he finds himself in the middle of Lily being brutalized by her boyfriend.\nObviously, I\u2019d like YC to step in and save her. From there we can see where the story takes us. But my end goal is for the two of them to come together to better one another. Fall in love. All that cliche stuff that makes it so good.\n\n\nA bit about me as a partner:\n-I'd love for this to be long term but have no problem with something short term. \n-I\u2019m a para style player and can get very long winded \n-I\u2019m willing to play in 1st or 3rd \n-I use discord as my preferred platform\n\nI hope to hear from you! PM me if this piques your curiosity :]",

            "selftext": "After many long hours rping with a number of individuals, I got a flavour for what most people are looking for on these sites. As a fair warning, this is likely to the tastes of the majority of you.\n\nI have a rather active imagination and I love writing large, grandiose tales. World-building, character development, internal conflict and difficult decisions testing the true values of these heroes in our minds. I don't mind doing heavy lifting in terms of your character running through a world, and I control the rest of the world as sort of a DM or narrator, but I find people tend to fall back into easy and weak replies- taking little initiative or doing little at all to push the story forward, seemingly wanting it served on a platter. This isn't stimulating as a writer, reader, or roleplay partner.\n\nIn terms of content, I have little preference, but I am most well versed in high fantasy and sci-fi scenarios. I find magic/tech allows for a wider variety of creative plot devices. I simply despise slice of life.\n\nExcuse my demanding tone, but above all else I would  love to produce a gripping and fantastical tale. Real characters, losses, emotions, etc. If it just so happens that the main character is exactly what you dreamed they would be and you write in first person? Step into the wardrobe and welcome to your own personal Narnia, all I ask is that you bring enthusiasm and some skill to the story. \n\nExpress yourself, I would love to read what you write and the prompt you really want to explore and flesh out. If we have fun, I would love to rp any number of tales over time. I am open to most material, smut or not, except pedophilia. I don't take the story content personally, only the quality.\n\nGrace me with your presence and big, wet, beautiful brain. ;)",

            "selftext": "Hello there everyone! Shocker - I have another idea. This one is a bit darker themed due to vampires and such. It may be possible to make is NSFW if you would like, I'm not opposed. But we can keep it toned down as well and to time skips and the like. I'm looking for a gentleman who knows at least the basics of English (I understand the occasional misspelling and if your learning and such), and can do 3-5 paragraph replies, though it can go down to 1-2 when there is more of a personal interaction. Now onto the idea!\n\nYou're a vampire hunter, born and trained to kill vampires, though you can handle other creatures also. On one raid of a clan in an old castle, you find me, a weak, near starving vampire, to weak to do nearly anything. Seeing the perfect opportunity for a hostage, you quickly take me away and lock me in a cage in your basement. Where I'm thankful to be taken away from that God Forsaken place, I'm far to weak to even talk. You slowly bring me small game to drink from and I eventually get the strength to thank you. Upset by this, you ignore me for months again before you come back with more game. Furious, you question me to the point where I nearly die, prodding for information and why I thanked you. It ruined your entire impression of the blood suckers...\n\nFrom there it can go several ways. I love stories that grow organically, so I try to not make the basics to detailed. If you're interested, feel free to message me! Thanks guys!",

            "selftext": "**The devil's in the details, so hang with me....**\n\n\n- Roleplayer and writer for over a decade and looking for long term, descriptive partners. \n- I always make an attempt to warn my partners if I know of an impending issue in schedule. If I do not know ahead of time, that cannot be helped. *Life comes first.*\n- I prefer that you don't mind OOC chatter sometimes as well, considering some days, one just doesn't feel like RPing and needs someone to talk to. I enjoy being able to ask how you are from time to time and I reserve a different email thread for doing just that as well as any RP question that may come up once we start.\n- I am willing to answer any questions that come my way, all you have to do is PM me.\n- Again, life comes first, and if something comes up that pulls me away from RP, please be aware that I will attempt to warn you before it happens if I can. \n\n\n**Play Style:**\n\n\n- I am perfectly adept at playing either a male or female character in any given setting. Message me about an idea you have. I will respond either way.\n- As my character is not me, your character is not you. It doesn't matter to me whether you are male or female and what your character is. \n- Heterosexual relationships are my first and foremost preference in romance RPs, but I will not discount a different relationship in an RP idea that strikes my attention enough. \n- If something is not working for you, please tell me and do not disappear on me. I do not disappear on my partners, and it would be nice to know what can be improved or changed. \n- Be willing to plan with me. A little world-building can save a lot of floundering later in the game, and I'd like to be able to sketch out at least a little bit before we begin.\n- **I will politely decline to keep responding to you if you cannot produce anything over one line or incomplete sentences.** The purpose of this long, thought-out advert is to deter you from wasting my time and your own.\n\n\n**Post Schedule:**\n\n\n- I am completely unavailable on Sundays and Wednesdays, there are very few exceptions to this. Most Saturdays, I am unavailable as well. \n- On a good day, I may be able to get in 2+ posts per day or more. I may be able to rapid fire. Others, I may not be able to post at all. *Please be patient.* That being said, if it has been 3 days or more since I have responded, feel free to send me an OOC email to remind me. Your email may have been one I opened on my phone and did not reset as unread. \n\n\n**Post-Length:**\n\n\n- I typically range anywhere from three to six paragraphs or more, depending on necessity. My introduction posts or description posts will obviously be longer than simple conversation. I am not asking you to mirror me.\n- I would prefer a partner that is both literate and descriptive. At least two paragraphs or more.\n- My posts include internal dialogue and conflict, if that bothers you - please do not waste my time or yours.\n\n\n**Platforms:**\n\n\n- I use email. It is the easiest way for me to keep track of everything. \n- The only acceptable time I will use Google Hangouts is for OOC chatter, and nothing more. \n*My apologies, but I will not be changing to any other platforms, it is simply too inconvenient for me. You will, unfortunately, not be convincing me otherwise.*\n\n\n**Genres:**\n\n\n- Darker themes, gore, survival horror, drama, high or low fantasy, sci-fi, steampunk, crime noir.... a vibrant mix of several, you name it and we can talk it over and see if we can find something we will both enjoy. \n- Romance is a preferred subplot, but in a slow-burn atmosphere. I prefer things to develop organically and I do not want this to be the main focus of any RP.\n- NSFW content is not necessarily off-limits, but please be aware that I would like to discuss things first.\n- I will not change a character completely to suit your wants/needs.\n- I reserve the right to say no. \n\n\n**Time Periods**\n\n\n- Any. Let's talk it out. I prefer an element of fantasy in anything I do, which means I will prefer any offers for it over completely realistic. (Of course, two human characters fighting dragons is not completely realistic, I will accept that.)\n-  I can absolutely be convinced otherwise, if you have a good enough idea or plot that is also realistic - let's talk.\n\n\n**Fandoms:**\n\n\n- I will readily attempt to play in a fandom that I like. That being said, I do not prefer to play very many canon characters.... just in canon universes. Want to play OC mutants? New heroes in the DC or Marvel universe? Let's try it. (If you're wondering who I am willing to play canon in these universes, please just ask. \n- Other fandoms of note: The Ancient Magus' Bride with original characters, Kingdom Hearts with original characters or original characters and canon. \n\n\n**Need Not Apply:**\n\n\n- I can and will refuse any RP I want, but it is likely that I will give it a shot first if we mesh well together in our initial conversations.\n- Do NOT contact me with a situation in which I am basically under your thumb and you are a DM/GM type.... I do NOT like this type of RP and I you will not be changing my mind. Thanks.\n- Do not expect rapid-fire posts or conversations from me constantly, I will reply when I am able, I promise.\n- Anyone seeking nothing but NSFW roleplay can keep looking, I prefer rich story and worlds. \n\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\n\n- Please contact me via **message,** I do not respond to comments. \n- Let's talk it out before or after we move to email, I don't mind either way. If I seem to have missed your message or email in 2 or max 3 days, send another and I will reply right away. ",

I've been role-playing for the better half of 8 years now, while I'm not the best I tend to try and keep the RP interesting. I always use OCs (original characters) as I feel it gives me a better sync to the RP. And with some of my OCs tend to have traits from the real me so there apart of me. My post length tends to vary depending on the situation, and I can be very detailed when I need to be.

The idea is below:\n\nYou are the heir and only son of a northern, winter kingdom. You're known for being heartless and cold, just like the harsh landscape. A warrior at heart, you were the leader of most of the guards in the city. I'm a princess from a southern, and much smaller kingdom. I'm known for being sweet and gentle. I'm an excellent noblewoman, being skilled in diplomacy, politics, and others customs. Our fathers have engaged us in promise of my father's land, since they're old friends. However, they haven't seen each other since we were born. The other thing, you don't know, but I've known that we were to be engaged for several years.\n\nI want it to be drawn out and dramatic between the two, as when I've done this several years back it was only after several days. I want the odd details of their days between meetings and such. I'm looking for a gentleman who knows at least the basics of english (I understand fully if your still learning, but no text talk or the like), and can do 3-5 paragraph replies, though it can go down to 1-2 when there is more of a personal interaction.

We are made out of eight active members currently.\n\n**We are looking for people interested in roleplaying Organization canon or original characters, and those interested in helping with the building of a Kingdom Hearts general universe and Final Fantasy universe. You aren't required to have played the games or know absolutely everything or be the best at writing to join. Understanding the plot, characters will be necessary though.**\n\nWe have a universe about the Organization 13, called **Organization Vinculum**. In it, you could roleplay one canon character and/or make your own original characters.\n&gt; The theme of this universe is that the Organization is recruiting new nobodies to help their cause. These new recruits must be mentored by an experienced member. Once they learnt their ways, they in turn can teach new recruits. Apprentices who are being taught by a mentor must have a similar weapon and elemental type in order to be taught properly.\n&gt; *Here's all the canon characters that are open for applications: Xigbar, Xaldin, Lexaeus, Saix, Axel, Demyx, Luxord, Roxas and Xion.*\n\n* We are open to drabbles and AUs. Our group is very friendly and chill. We don't hassle each other to reply, and you can also hang out and just chat amongst each other. We are also understanding of triggers, and that life can get in the way. Once applying, you can join our Discord server, chat with the other members and hang out.\n\n* Rules: General RP rules are enforced. Discord RP channels are mandatory to be PG13, but RPs on the Google Drive can be 18+ as long as they are tagged as such and members under 18 aren't active in the RP.\n\n* We use **Discord** and **Google Drive** to roleplay mainly, and when you apply, you must fill an application for either a canon/original character that you can submit into a folder. There will be a mission board, from which you can choose missions along with other people.\n\nMore information can be found in the Google Drive upon request!\n\nAs the DM and manager of this group, you can send me a message to apply or ask questions.\n\nOur group is also seeking to expand, as we have a universe dedicated to a more general Kingdom Hearts universe that would include Sora, the trios and etc, but wouldn't be about the Organization. We are also looking to expand our Final Fantasy universe, which is still a work in progress. If you're interested in either of these, feel free to send me a message.",

Do you long to leave your life behind and become someone or something other than your day to day human? Join us! We're always happy to escape reality.\n\nThe Broken is an urban fantasy group that takes place in and around Boston. We're a group of writers in various stages of skill and intent, harboring people from various platforms (AOL and others). We RP at leisure, fast paced, and just goof around but at the end of the day, story is our purpose.

            "selftext": "Hey! I am an amateur roleplayer that is seeking partners to try out plots, help each other hone our crafts, and also chat and have fun together. Roleplaying is something that I have always had a great interest in, but I\u2019ve only seriously engaged in it a handful of times. Today I'm changing that as I have a lot of plot ideas that I\u2019ve been meaning to try out and I want to improve my writing skills!\n\n**As for platforms,** I have come to enjoy Discord as it\u2019s sleek, easy to use, and I receive notifications without a hitch. It is my first choice, but I also agree to use email or GoogleDocs. I use the latter frequently but never have for roleplaying. I\u2019m interested to see what it could be like (I imagine there is a lot of room for creative post structures). I\u2019m not interested in using any other chatting apps (I like to keep things consolidated) so Skype and Kik are out.\n\n**When it comes to post-length** I\u2019m part of a few \u2018rapid-fire\u2019 groups on Discord, but what I\u2019m seeking is someone interested in slower-paced and longer posts. Anywhere from 500 to 1000 words per post is about the length that I\u2019m aiming for with my own posts  (though, these numbers are negotiable given the plot). I think it\u2019s fair when each partner posts about an equal length; discrepancies of a few hundred words are normal, but it\u2019s never a fun time when one party writes five paragraphs and their partner writes one. This is something we can discuss together so the post-length can be something that fits us both.\n\n**On the topic of tense,** my preferences are past and third-person tense. Future tenses confuse me (I mean, \u201cHe would go to the store.\u201d ...well, will he? Is he just contemplating it?). Present tense I\u2019m not opposed to, but I prefer it in quick-fire settings. First-person feels odd to me, though, I'll give it a shot. And as for any other tense combination: let\u2019s discuss it! Like most of these points, I try to accommodate in the ways that I can. \n\n**Now, where NSFW content is concerned,** it\u2019s not my general aim. I am not actively seeking a partner for that type of content, but I acknowledge that certain plotlines and how characters interact may lead into that territory. I\u2019m open to cross that bridge when it comes to it; I like to see a character\u2019s arc all the way through, even if it leads to territory I hadn\u2019t anticipated. Let me know your stances on different NSFW topics (or if you have any subjects that you\u2019d prefer to avoid) and I will accommodate! Not much phases me, but I will be vocal if a topic begins to make me uncomfortable. \n\n___\n\nBut who cares? Let\u2019s dig into the meat: \n\n\n* My first plot idea is an alternative universe setting of the manga/anime **Basilisk**. I came up with some loose concepts for the AU (OC and worldbuilding ideas) that are more \u2018romance\u2019 driven. I\u2019m open to either using mine or concepts that we plan together. To give a short summary of Basilisk: there are two ninja clans who fight each other to the death. Each of the ninjas has their own abilities: everything from the power to steal one\u2019s appearance to the power to summon a black hole (so there\u2019s a lot of room to be creative here!). The canon plot is that the leaders of each clan are in love, but due to circumstance (a political struggle), their clans are at war. They can choose to either battle each other or watch as their clansmen die before their eyes. In my AU plot, citizens of two opposing nations are selected to compete in a battle-royale of sorts (similar to The Hunger Games\u2026 but with ninja powers!!1!one1). The winning nation dictates political decisions so each respective government is vying to be the champion. As for the individuals competing, their reasons range from a desire to escape poverty to bloodthirst. Amidst this group, I planned that two of the competitors were friends from opposing nations. Both share a romantic interest in each other (non-hetero for clarification) and seek to escape the governments\u2019 sick game. Or, like I said, we can always plan out something else together.   \n* Next up! **Made In Abyss**! Whether it\u2019s an AU or not, I\u2019m down. If it\u2019s non-AU and non-OCs, my preference is Reg. Otherwise, the setting of MIA is rich and open enough that there\u2019s a lot of room to create a fun OCs. To give a summary for non-readers/watchers of the series: there is a massive chasm that exists in the world that is full of mysterious and powerful artifacts as well as fearsome beasts. Some of these artifacts have the power to stop time or bring the dead back to life. But traversing the abyss is no easy feat and delvers often succumb to its many terrors. The mystery of what lies at the very bottom is what keeps the divers risking their lives to discover more. I love this setting so much that I\u2019d want to keep the setting as it is, though we would be free to come up with our own OCs, beast concepts, and treasures if it's an AU.\n* I also have an **original fantasy setting** that I\u2019ve been worldbuilding throughout the years. It\u2019s a high-fantasy setting in which a pantheon of deities, strong in their beliefs and ideologies, have created the races of the world to live out their ideals. Though, the races were born with a trait that the deities never intended: emotion, something amiss from the divine. While many of the landsfolk seek to uphold their god\u2019s wishes, cultures grow, clash, divide and fuse to make something far out of the god\u2019s control. And while these races are budding and finding their own place, a threat from a parallel world emerges. Something with the power to destroy everything they know and love terrorizes the land. The lore that I have of this setting is dense (star systems, climate breakdowns, race physiology, cultural customs\u2026 you know how worldbuilding can get), but if you\u2019re inclined to listen, hoo boy, can I go on about the things I\u2019ve made. There are many races to choose from, nations to explore, powers to unlock, and I can provide some of my canon arcs for the setting as examples of the vibe. On that note, please do share your own original settings as well! I don\u2019t want to feel like a self-absorbed jerk, ya know?\n* Back to fandoms though: **Claymore** is another setting I\u2019d love to start something up. Again, for non-AU/non-OCs my top picks are Raki, Isley, or Rafaela. Like MIA, I love this setting and would prefer to keep the AU close to canon, but with our own OCs and plot lines. To summarize (for those who aren\u2019t familiar with the manga/anime): the world is overrun by flesh-eating beasts known as \u201cyouma\u201d. These monsters infiltrate town and cities by taking on the appearance of a human before devouring them when suspicions are down. To combat the youma, there are all-female half-youma warriors that the people refer to as \u201cClaymore\u201d. Though, in becoming a Claymore, these women give up their humanity and live with the inevitable fate of becoming a youma themselves. But you know the drill, hit me with your thoughts and we\u2019ll take it from there.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there, but that at least gives a general overview of what types of plots/settings/characters I gravitate towards. If it\u2019s high fantasy with a good balance of dark/gritty and cute, then I\u2019m sold. I love watching characters grow, change, and devolve and if you\u2019re of the same mindset then we can plot some great stuff together! PM me for my contact information and to discuss our preferences; My time zone is UTC +1.\n",

            "selftext": "**Introduction:** I am female, in college and looking for one or two writing buddies. Given JJ S2 has just dropped, I thought I'd see if there's any interest out there. I have a few RPs right now but I feel I could add one or two more without much trouble. You can expect a post from me about once a day, maybe once every couple of days. The pace isn't expected to be quick so I do expect more than a few lines even in dialogue situations. \n\nI like to write several **(3-5) paragraphs (5-7 sentences usually)** and hope I can find someone who feeds off rich detail and notices the little things. Ideally my partner should feel comfortable discussing plot or letting me know if a post is going to be delayed. But most importantly, my partner should contribute and feel just as interested in the story as I am. It's awkward when I feel like my partner has lost interest. If my partner does lose interest or is having a tough time, I'd want to be able to help and change things up, but just giving up and ghosting or going silent isn't going to work for me. \n\nGiven the themes of Marvel are pretty mature, mature scenes will likely take place but I am not comfortable with excessive mature content that is forced or unnecessary. I value plot and development above all else. Lastly, this is about having fun. Writing is a treasured outlet for me and I'm sure there are many who feel the same way. If a post takes a few weeks to get back to me, I'm fine with waiting. A post should never feel like a job so only write when you have time and the motivation. But keep me in the loop whenever possible so we can keep things moving.\n\n**Plots:** Below are some rough ideas I have involving the movie LOGAN and the Netflix shows JESSICA JONES and DAREDEVIL. If anyone had any suggestions or tweaks, let me know via PM so we can brainstorm further. Also, some roles can be shared if desired. **As a note these all deal with Logan being a father to Laura. I loved that aspect and would love to explore it further because it brought such humanity to Logan.** If that's not your cup of tea though, let me know and we'll see what we can do. :)\n\n- Set in 2029 (LOGAN-timeline) Raven has lost touch with Charles and Erik. She poses as a nurse named Gabriela in order to keep an eye on Transigen's activites. She befriends Laura and soon the two escape once X-24 has been created. The children and Raven are separated but know to go to Eden and to be there as soon as possible. Raven, still disguised as Gabriela, tracks down Logan looking for help and to introduce him to Laura, his daughter. Logan reluctantly takes the job to escort them to North Dakota and it's Charles who immediately knows Gabriela is in fact Raven. The four take a road trip through America's heartland, pillaging labs owned by Transigen and helping others along the way. Raven wants to find Erik and knows Laura will be a valued asset in bringing down Transigen but along the way, she and Logan develop a deep bond while trying to raise Laura in the real world.\n\n*Roles I can play: Laura, Charles, Caliban, and Raven.*\n\n- Set in modern day. Basically we're inserting the LOGAN plot into JESSICA JONES. Logan is a driver in NYC, making some extra money since the school hasn't been doing so well as of late. There is an underground lab in NYC that has been producing mutants under the order of a man obsessed with special people and special powers: Kilgrave. Kilgrave was saved at the end of season one by a company calleds Transigen. Kilgrave then offered them his DNA to be the first to be tested. Experiments went by quickly and soon a girl named Laura (X-23) is created. Meanwhile Jessica has been following leads about Transigen's actions and soon runs into Logan, needing a getaway Uber, as the two try to save the mutants with the help of Laura, who managed to escape the lab and take refuge in Jessica's apartment building. \n\n*Roles I can play: Laura, Jessica, Kilgrave, Trish and Donald.*\n\n- Set in modern day, between season one and two of DAREDEVIL. Logan and Matt cross paths at Fogwell's Gym one day. The two men bond over a drink and Logan knows instantly that Matt isn't some blind lawyer. He's more than that. One night as Logan is drunkenly wandering back to his apartment in Hell's Kitchen, the Devil of Hell's Kitchen stops a woman from being mugged. Logan steps in and they both realize who the other person is. Now with their secrets out in the open, Matt tries to convince Logan to help him fight justice on the street but Logan doesn't want any trouble. One day a nurse named Gabriela comes into Matt's office looking for help, she found a girl named Laura in an alley and she wants to adopt her. Matt is of course touched and he and Karen work together to help Laura find a new home. Without notice, Gabriela is murdered and Logan shows and interest when he notices Gabriela worked for a company called Transigen, people who Logan has been hunting down since he moved to Hell's Kitchen. Together, they dig deeper to understand Laura and who her father is.\n\n*Roles I can play: Laura, Karen, Matt, Foggy, Gabriela and Donald.*\n\n- Set in modern day. Essentially a mix of LOGAN, JESSICA JONES and DAREDEVIL. Set in the middle of season one of JESSICA JONES and after season one of DAREDEVIL; Logan, Matt and Jessica all find themselves at the same bar. A fight breaks out and the three jump into action out of instinct. The three aren't exactly interested in combing forces and part ways without as much as an introduction to one another. With Kilgrave still on the prowl, Jessica decides it may not hurt to have more muscle on her side so she first tracks down Matt who was easy enough to find. While trying to find out whatever the clawed guy is up to, Jessica stumbles across a young girl who has claws too. She's not who Jessica is looking for but Jessica thinks Laura has gotta be related to Logan so she takes Laura under her wing. Eventually Logan is spotted and the four have a conversation about who Laura is and why the others should be worried about Kilgrave. Kilgrave soon gets Matt alone and gets him under his control, leaving Laura, Jessica and Logan to save Matt and bring down Kilgave. Admittedly this plot isn't as fleshed out but it can be improved upon privately I'm sure.\n\n*Roles I can play: Laura, Karen, Foggy, Matt and Jessica.*",

            "selftext": "Hello there, loves! I've been rather lonely in terms of the roleplay department, only getting one or two here only once in a blue blood moon! (That being said, it's incredibly rare, lol) I'm running out of platforms to request this sort of stuff on ... I hope I can find someone on here. That'd be relieving, gosh.\n\nI don't have that much to say, to be honest? Here are some things I've been interested in going about, as of late:\n\nGENRES:\n// Historical/Wartime. ** \n// Supernatural/Paranormal.\n// Mythological/Religious.\n// Post-Apocalyptic/Dystopia.\n\nI certainly wouldn't mind doing some OC (original character) kind of stuff - I absolutely adore worldbuilding! That being said though, there is one fandom that has my heart (and has for years, though I don't necessarily stick to strictly-canonical personalities), and that's the Hetalia fandom. (Hold on, don't run away, oh gosh ...) There are some others, though I've never really gotten into the roleplaying scene with them. This fandom in particular just, for me, has a large cast of characters with varying personalities to enjoy and adapt to your own liking. (Plus, I'm a HUGE history nerd... like. huge. I want to be a major in it. ////)\n\nI tend to write decently lengthy responses ... though, of course, this is based relatively. On average, I'd say ... maybe 4+ paragraphs. It honestly just depends on the platform we're using, and what's happening in the story. \nSpeaking of story, like how many are, this is probably gonna be romantically driven (but it doesn't necessarily have to be?), and in that department I've only really gone into gay relationships. Mainly because I have a strangely hard time when I primarily roleplay a female, so I tend to stick to males ... [coughs]\nAND SPEAKING OF PLATFORMS! I can provide my Discord or my roleplay email address. ;v;\n\nBut ah, yeah! I think I covered all of my bases here ... maybe. I'll probably add onto this as I see fit. \n\nI can't wait to start! ",

Whether you are an engineer, a navigator or simply a fellow explorer, we welcome you to the crew! (I will fully admit I have already forgotten your occupation\u2026)  Now, as agreed upon in our earlier terms, what will follow is specifically for your eyes only,. If this gets to outside eyes, we may lose our one and only chance at a fortune beyond belief! \n\nNow, as you have probably heard from recent news, British relations with the Americas has slowly begun to heal. This, of course, doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest, other than the fact that traveling merchants have brought back rumors of an ancient civilization down in the Spanish territories in South  America. Not much is truly known about this fallen kingdom, but it is said they were able to harness some strange form of energy to run their civilization, which has been rumored to function 10 times better than the power of steam!  (Which of course is preposterous, surely nothing could outdo the mighty steam engine!) Nonetheless, it\u2019s my job as an\nArchaeologist to uncover the truth of this forgotten kingdom, (and more than likely more importantly to you and the rest of the crew, to uncover any hidden treasure hidden deep within.) Any riches found upon our expedition will be split into equal portions and/or buried somewhere in Scandinavia  in case our wealth is discovered and the government attempts to place taxes upon it.

Along with that, the more imaginative you can be the better, so feel free to add your own details and aspects to the world, and don\u2019t be afraid to dive into the ridiculous and insane.  I\u2019ve always thought of this genre as somewhat fantastical, so monsters, ancient curses, hell even lovecraftian nightmares are uo on the table.

Me and a group of friends are trying to start up a community of people who are into roleplay and politics.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What do we do?**\n\nWe have a server map of Earth, if this grows enough we are thinking of adding multiple worlds, and everyone can claim their territory in the Earth and roleplay their own country and what happens in it. Here is the [map](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/419332413815128074/420714078735171584/The_beginningpng.png) as we are currently posting it (I recommend you join us early so you can get first pick) \n\n**Is it just roleplay?**\n\nNo! We plan events that happens to different people (natural disasters, global uprising etc.) and we also have a war system for declaring war on other countries.\n\n**Are you guys super serious?**\n\nLol no we aren't, we have an empire named Ottomans 2 Electric Boogaloo. I am sure you will fit right in!\n\n**How does the UN this work?**\n\nWe will hold global elections for the 3 person security council, and the leader of the UN. We are still working on rules for this and we are open to suggestions.\n\n**One more thing I want to add**\n\nThis is not the first political simulator I have started but this is my main one now. I can assure you, this will grow a community and you will meet new people. We are open to all and strongly encourage you join!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI want to thank you for reading this, if you have any questions feel free to pm me or comment below. Here is the discord link!\n\n&gt; https://discord.gg/aMFaEd7",

            "selftext": "I am looking for a casual roleplay partner. Be 20+ years old. I am in my 30s and have very few limits when I write. I'd like to find someone like-minded. I am definitely what you'd consider literate, but that doesn't mean I am going to post a wall of text with every single response. As long as you're writing a couple of paragraphs, I'll be happy. I'm not into fandoms, so let's stick to original characters and plots. Typos happen, let's not get too uppity about them. I'd rather focus on good grammar and quality posts! This will be 3rd person, past tense. If you catch me slipping tenses, feel free to point it out. I am into writing all manners of genres, so let's talk about our favorites or the mood we're currently in and I'm sure a fun plot will come out of it. \n\nMy requirements: romance, tension, drama, and conflict. Like I mentioned above, I have very few limits, but the rp is not going to be centered around smut. \n\nMy preferred places to rp are discord and email. I'm not interested in using anything else (sorry!). Send me a pm if you're interested! ",

He saw that he had powers no one else had he didn't question it he was better than everyone else and that's all that mattered to him. His parents taught him others were weak and he was perfect mostly out of fear, Abraham was a spoiled brat and in a tantrum he removed them from his life so they could not bother him. It didn't bother him they were dead if they died they were weak. He led a solitary life asserting his dominance in small ways until the age of 12 when he had an idea. \"I'm the strongest I should be in charge.\" So he marched up the front steps of the white house tearing it apart as he did obliterating everyone in his wake. Word spread of the boy with god like powers and attempts on his life were made, with every failed assassination Abraham seemed stronger and with new powers to wipe his enemies off the face of the earth. One day he decided the world was too spread out so with his powers he forced the continent's of the world together killing millions in the process. Abraham called his new supercontinent utopia viewing it as a country as perfect as he views himself. Soon Abraham was the undisputed ruler of the earth no army could match him so most followed his every command out of fear. Now at the age of 25 his will his absolute no one daring challenge him. People live in constant fear with Abraham now calling himself Paragon viewing himself as perfection ruling with an iron fist.\n\nGuardian Angel- For centuries angels and demons have been at war fighting forcontrol of the earth. In order to remain away from there respective homelands angels and demons must anchor themselves to a willing human soul. These anchors also supply spiritual energy sustaining and empowering the guardian angel or demon. I will be playing the part of guardian angel and you will be my anchor. Your character will be chosen as a possible anchor and my character will appear requesting permission to anchor to your character's soul. Guardian and anchor have a master servant relationship and it is not unheard of anchors choosing to stay out of the war and using the guardian for their own personal gain. Guardians think for themselves, but if explicitly ordered by the anchor they must obey.",

I am looking for someone who is literate and can write multiple paragraphs per response. This is meant to be a story that we create together, so input and ideas from both parties are necessary to make this enjoyable for both of us.\n\nA little forewarning, I only play original characters and would like your character to be an original character too. Straight off the bat, I'll let you know now that I don't do roleplays that are based on the generes of fandom, supernatural, fantasy, medieval... etc. so if that's what you're looking for, then this is the wrong post for you.\n\nAnyway, a bit about my roleplay history... I've been doing text based roleplay for about 4 years now, with a main preference for romance and slice of life roleplays. I have been told that I am a literate and detailed roleplayer, and I put a great emphasis on using correct spelling and grammar in my responses. In terms of response length, I usually write a few paragraphs, dependant on the situation. As a general rule of thumb, the more I get, the more I give back, but it's never less than a paragraph. \n\nI am looking to create a roleplay where our characters already begin in an established relationship together, and can explore that relationship throughout the course of the roleplay, as different events and situations arise in their lives. I know this may sounds strange and a little boring, but I have a few ideas in mind that you can read over if you choose to PM me.\n\nAs for NSFW, I am comfortable with NSFW elements in a roleplay, but am happy to exclude them too. If NSFW elements are incorporated, I personally prefer my roleplay's to revolve around the plot and storyline, rather than the NSFW elements themselves.\n\nI'm hoping that I have expressed enough detail for you to be interested, without writing an entire essay. If you would like to roleplay with me or hear more about my ideas, feel free to send me a PM. If you have any ideas then I'm more than happy to hear those too, if you feel that they align with what I'm looking for.",

            "selftext": "* When Tenedo controlled Trebia rebels in the year 662, with claims of their hidden prince accessing dark magic to end the life of Tenedo\u2019s royalty, the seventh army of Tenedo is formed, to quell the rebellion. Trebia, the arid plains to the south of mountainous snow-covered Tenedo, intends to reform and also conquer Trebia, becoming the dominant nation.\n\nWhen King Leopold catches word of this, he assembles the seventh army of Trebia. The sixth army\u2019s hero \u2014 Captain Lucretia of the cavalry \u2014 wants nothing to do with the war. She retired her spear after the last war, and would rather stay home, protecting her fianc\u00e9, Lady Elena. However, King Leopold persuaded her to at least show up to the new recruits training, for morale reason.\n\nTenedo\u2019s capitol, Nucree, is attacked, four weeks into training, and Captain Lucretia flees with Elena and a handful of cadets to her family\u2019s estate far away from the turmoil hitting the capitol. Left with a very ragtag, motley crew of soldiers, Lucretia has to become involved in this war, to protect her fianc\u00e9 and to, hopefully, drive back the invading forces and regroup with King Leopold on the western shore.*\n\n-\n\nHello! I come to you with a plot that isn\u2019t terribly original. I would be playing Captain Lucretia and Lady Elena, along with anyone else needed. I\u2019m looking for someone to play a cadet and the Baddie, who\u2019s motives can be left up to you.\n\nI\u2019m not looking for a romantic plot, sorry to burst any bubbles. I play in the third person, present or past, and would prefer to keep the plot a mix of adventure and politics. I am open to suggestions, however, and I hope to hear from you!\n\nI prefer discord, since we can create a server and keep characters/roleplay separate from OOC, but I am open to email.",

I didn't have anything to defend myself with. After all, I never killed anyone. I was just a runner after all.\n\nI was stupid to have gotten into this. But I needed the money. I started out small, doing work for small gangs running drugs. I wasn't good at anything else. Eventually I'd become a notorious wheel for hire. Boosting cars and running off, only the tire marks signifying I was there. I ran bank jobs, drugs, get aways, and even saw some cars off into the sunset.\n\nI was feeling lucky. I took up a job for a series of contracts with a notorious gang. One that was so successful for reasons unknown. But that was my mistake. The only regret I had in this messed up nitro fueled life. because you see, they were so successful because they tied up loose ends. No mouths to report them to the feds. Sure, I'd gotten the job done. I got everyone back with their brains in their skulls. But AL, he knew what was about to happen. We exited the car and he turned to me.\n\n\"Run to the hills Dusty.\" He said still using the code name I'd gotten. None of us knew each other's actual names. Kept each other safe if one of us were captured by the feds. That's all we were to refer to each other as. Then the old Greying man was gunned down, some of his blood splashing onto on my jacket. So I turned and started running. They'd gotten all the other seats in my car but I was gone. Now was the time to run.\n\nAn engine started and I was gone. Except for an unmarked vehicle smashing into me. My vision started fading and I saw two figures exiting the front side of the car. Then I blacked out.\n\nNow where does Dusty here wake up? An interrogation room in some fed building? A drug room of another gang? The boiler room of the gang I was running from? I'm giving you some freedom here. Be creative.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm still looking for some good partners for both original and fandom settings. Here, I'm listing my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here (and what I will continue to post despite oddly vindictive people deciding to downvote every time I do xD); however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts, as they're still applicable.  (I also have the beginnings of a fantasy or sci-fi thing based off Nickelback's \"Lullaby,\" if that interests anyone...)\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* Please, for the love of Cruxis, do not ask me what medium I want to use for RP. I use tags in my titles for a reason, and when people ask me questions that I've *obviously* already answered, it's a pretty big turn-off; it means, or at least looks like, you didn't bother to actually pay attention.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina) \n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! (Please note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.)",

My name is David, but if it's really that important to you, then you can call me Dave.\n\n-I'm 22 years old, and I would ask that you be 18+ if you're going to contact me.\n\n-I'm in the EST, although I try not to let it dictate my sleep schedule.\n\n-I'll write a lot. You're looking at about a four paragraph minimum from me, but I tend to get carried away beyond that. I generally prefer partners who value quantity as well, at least three to five paragraphs per response.\n\n-I only do email! Sorry to my fans of instant messengers! If you want to chat over discord, though, that's fine and dandy with me!\n\n-I'm only really interested in LGBT+ roleplays! I much prefer m/m to f/f, but enjoy both. You're probably not going to convince me to include m/f as a main relationship. And I love writing trans and non binary characters, so let me know if you're open and interested!\n\n-Doubling, tripling, quadrupling, side characters are all great! Love it! Tell me you love it too! Definitely not mandatory, though.\n\n-Sharing playlists, Pinterest boards, and doodles relating to our roleplay gives me life, but, of course, is not a requirement.\n\nPairings:\n\nBest Friend / Best Friend || Ex / Ex || Married / Single || Soldier / Ex or Best Friend || Stripper / Client || Artist / Muse || Famous / Fan || Internet Gamer / Internet Gamer || Addict / Friend || Addict / Sober || Country / City || Penpal / Penpal || Closeted / Openly Queer || Royalty / Peasant || Suggest, Combine, or Ask for Plots!!\n\nPlots:\n\n-Best Friend / Best Friend. Let's include some drama, though! Maybe one friend is back in town because of a death of a parent? Maybe one's stuck in a relationship while trying to figure out their sexuality? Maybe they haven't seen each other since one came out as trans and transitioned? Let's add conflict, throw in some angst, and make it burn s l o w.\n\n-Ex / Ex. Really and truly very similar to a Best Friends plot, but with added resentment, regret, and knowledge of how the other looks naked.\n\n-Disney inspired plots. I have plenty ideas, throw some of your favorite movies at me! OCs only!\n\n-Something inspired by Dear Evan Hanson. OCs only!\n\n-American Horror Story. I've seen them all, so we can incorporate any and all stories you'd like. OCs as main characters, but I'm not opposed to included canon characters as side characters.\n\n-Modern Fantasy. Honestly, this is newer to me, but I've found I love playing warlocks, witches, shapeshifters, merpeople, elves, and psychic characters. Very open to hearing your ideas and brainstorming plots with you all!\n\n-Medieval/Medieval Fantasy. New to this as well, and interested in including the same sorts of fantastical characters. Maybe we could include some royalty, though? Dragon gamers, as well? We'll talk.\n\n-Horror / Supernatural. Don't have a whole lot of ideas, honestly, but I love the genre and am super open to hearing your thoughts and plotting!\n\nContact Me!:\n\nSend me a message, and I'll be happy to give out my email to plot there or we can plot here, if you prefer!\n\nPlease be thorough in your message! Include what sort of genres you're interested in, what pairings, if you're interested in doubling, your limits, a little bit of information about yourself, and anything else you feel is important!\n\nHope to hear from some of you soon!

I'm open to both short and long term roleplays, and anything weird you can come up with is fair game. My favourite genres are Scifi and fantasy but I'm certainly open to all others excluding settings in World War 1 and WW2(Sorry if you're into these, I'm not well versed in them). \n\nI would prefer to create our own world, but am also willing to use any novel, anime, game, or film as the backdrop on the condition that both of our characters are our own creation.\n\nThanks for your time and hopefully your consideration as well!",

It must have good grammar and a decent amount of lines, as well as well developed characters. If you have any ideas, feel free to tell me your plots. If not, we can build one up. Personally, I like mystery based roleplays, and also the ones based off in the 1900s and 1800s, though other eras are totally fine too. Regarding smut, I'm fine with it as long as it doesn't take over the plot, which must be the most elaborated and interesting part. Also, have patience! Character can't jump into relationships just in two days time. If you're interested, send me a message or leave a comment with your kik, telling me your ideas or why we should roleplay together",

What if she and Elsa saved Arendelle together? That would mean Kristoff would still be just a normal ice harvester on the outskirts of Arendelle, with Sven as his only friend. I was thinking he and my OC could meet in the same way as he met Anna. Then, we could brainstorm some ideas from there.\n\nWhen we get in touch, we can discuss our characters, rules, limits, etc. \n\nI hope to hear from you soon! Thanks! \n",

            "selftext": "Hi!! My name is Danielle and I'm looking for a teen lesbian story. I am mainly looking for Life Is Strange, Pricefield or Amberprice, since I ship both of those. But I am also totally down for a lesbian OC roleplay. I have a few ideas when it comes to OC characters and AUs for Pricefield, but would love some input from you as well. Here are some things about my roleplays:\n\n- I mainly rp in third person, but can do first.\n\n- I like to write paragraphs up to 3 for every reply but when it's a slow moment in the roleplay I will lessen the amount I write.\n\n- I like literate to semi-literate rps...please make sure that you can fulfil that!\n\n- The main themes I like are: Punk X Nerd, Drama, Romance, Forbidden Love, Angst, Slice Of Life, College RPs, help out of Abusive Relationships\n\nI would love if in your message you write any ideas that you may have. Please message if you're interested!!\nHope to hear from some of you &lt;3",

            "selftext": "**Hey /roleplay!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\n&gt; I am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\n&gt; I don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n&gt; When it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\n&gt; Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n&gt; This is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n&gt; I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

I'm searching for long term, third person past tense paragraph form. As for genre I'm not picky, just no fandoms. I am always down to talk about fandoms but roleplay wise id like to stick to original content stuff. \n\nI'd like the person I roleplay with to sort of know what they are doing. Use punctuation, spelling, all of that. Mistakes happen and that's fine, I type on my phone a lot so I get it! Just don't make your whole post something I can't understand at all. As for post length I usually write anywhere between 100-600+. I'm usually good about matching what people give me, and as long as I'm not getting short one to two line replies then I'm good. Also! Id prefer someone 18+, as sometimes my roleplays can get nsfw and id rather have someone of legal age.\n\nAs for what I'm sort of looking for again I'm not picky. I've kind of been craving some slice of life drama and angst filled roleplay but if that's not your ideal then pitch me something. I like fantasy, medieval, modern, sci-fi. Whatever you got send it my way! \n\nI'm hoping to do this over discord or email, but I also have Skype if that's your thing. Just PM me your user name if you're interested.

            "selftext": "Hello, Internet! It has been a while and I do not feel like wasting time with excessive words, so let's get right to it! I am looking for a Life is Strange RP where I play as Max paired up with Chloe. I will play side characters to help with the story and the plot, but I will not budge at all on this. I only play Maxine, and I am looking for the perfect Chloe Price. \u2764\n\nI do have some ground rules I wanna cover, so let's go over the MUST HAVES of what you need if you'd like to RP with me on this.\n\n1. Descriptive and frequent poster. I get that life gets in the way, but if I'm waiting days for a reply, then it's going too slow to be interesting.\n\n2. Discord. I only play over Discord. MAYBE PMs if you really convince me. But you can message me if you're interested and we'll go to Discord from there. But Discord is an amazing and underused RP tool, I promise! \n\n3. Must enjoy story and plot. Nothing ruins a game faster than sex after sex after sex. Yes, Max and Chloe will have cute, hella gay sex, but that's not what I want the main focus to be. Story over Smut, please! \n\n4. Speaking of hella gay sex, you must be OK with NSFW themes. This goes with sex, suicide, murder and all of the darker, more adult themes that surround the video game. I'll never go too far with it; after all, it's there to enhance the experience and not be gratuitous. \n\n5. You MUST, MUST, MUST be able to capture the spirit of the game and at least play half of the characters with me. This game should be about both of us, but an RP where all we do is RP as Chloe and Max sitting around and being cute isn't any fun. I want to go on an adventure, and that means we gotta write the side characters like Victoria, Jefferson, Warren and all the rest out, too! But I'll always do my part to play at least half of them. \n\nThat's about it! Now let's get to the fun part! Wowsers. :)\n\nI'm fine with setting the RP during or after the events of the game. I would like to AVOID the \"Sacrifice Arcadia Bay\" ending, please. I feel like it's out of character for both of them to just accept that they basically murdered their family and friends and to live on like nothing ever happened. If we were to set it after the game, I'd rather it be in an alternate reality where the storm never happened and we can go from there. Jefferson and Sean will be gone, but there will be new adventures and conflicts and trouble to get in to. We just gotta be creative!\n\nA few possibilities...\n\n- Max and Chloe survive the game and avoid the storm. A year later, Max is attending college, and Chloe works... wherever a punk like her would. They share an apartment and the story would probably start off with something ominous happening that'll kickstart a brand new adventure for the both of them. Something to do with Nathan's father, maybe?\n\n- Max chooses to sacrifice Chloe. When Nathan shoots her, he fails to kill her and is arrested. Because Chloe learned her lesson from the butterfly and is no longer selfish, the universe / butterfly decides that she can be spared and that Chloe doesn't have to die after all. A month later, Chloe recovers from a coma and wakes up in a hospital bed with Max sleeping in a chair by her side and the butterfly on the window sill. Thanks to the butterfly, Chloe has remembered everything that transpired throughout the game during her coma, and wakes up with the memories she and Max shared during Life is Strange, despite them technically never happening in the current timeline. \n\n- We set it during the game, but with a twist. We will still follow the basic structure of the game, but instead of speaking Max and Chloe's lines word for word, we'll improv and add some of our own, extra, non-canon scenes and hijinks for them to get in to, while still covering all of the important stuff, like the diner, breaking in to Blackwell, their scene at the pool, etc.\n\n- Anything else we can both come up with together. :) \n\nMy \"Yes, Please\" List\n\n- Darker, adult themes\n- Romance\n- Passion\n- Kissing and cuddling\n- Descriptive partners and writers\n- Hella amazing Chloes \n- Partners I can call friend and chat with ^^\n- Drama\n- Creative writing \n- Sad, emotional scenes\n- Melodrama \n\nThat's about it... please message me if you wanna be my Chloe! Thank you!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Looking for a Naruto RP community on reddit? Then look no farther than /r/TheNarutoWorld!\n\n---\n\nIt\u2019s a period of uncertainty and wariness among the ninja villages. For a time it appeared the villages might actually enter a period of relative peace, especially after they came together at a Kage Summit to discuss the formation of a coalition and the reappearance of the tailed beasts in the world. But when the village forces met in a united coalition in the Sound, two of the villages initiated a shocking double cross against a third, Kiri. And what\u2019s more, Kiri had been expecting this and dealt a crushing defeat against the attackers. \n\nWhile the war and tensions between those three villages simmers and results in covert missions and sabotage, Kumo continues its attempts to govern, reform, and rebuild the Land of Sound. Yet within that country elements are rising up in rebellion and threatening to destabilize the country once more, and undo the hard work of the Shinobi Coalition. And in all of this, the reappearance of the tailed beasts appears to be overlooked, as more pressing matters plague each village. \n\nMany new leaders are trying their hand at resolving these conflicts, and the next generation of ninja will surely influence what happens next and what the state of the world will be like. What will happen next, now that war has been declared? Responses of each village are constantly evolving and plans are being hatched all the time... how will *you* choose to affect these events?\n\nWill you join others in Konoha under the Will of Fire and fight for your village? Or maybe the way of the sword in Kiri speaks more to you? Join in the reconstruction efforts led by Kumo in the Land of Sound maybe, if the role of peacekeeper and rebuilder speaks to you. Then again, maybe the way of the wanderer will allow you to reach your destiny.\n\n---\n\nCreate your own character to set out to fulfill their own goals and dreams along side other players! We've got a customized and open system with plenty of room for creativity and fun. Our system is well balanced and designed with lots of influence from popular pen and paper RPG games, but enough flexibility to let you have fun RPing without constantly worrying about numbers. RP is similarly flexible and occurs both forum-style and in real-time. \n\nFor more information on getting started, and the basics of our RP group, come on over and check out [our sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNarutoWorld/). With a friendly group of players, helpful mods, and an OOC Discord community there is plenty for everyone and people more than willing to get you set up and kicking some ninja butt in no time! \n\nHead on over to /r/TheNarutoWorld and start down your ninja path!\n",

            "selftext": "So what is kingdoms of Ehlerrac exactly, well simply put, it's a freeform roleplay server that has an entirely custom world and lore. Our staff has put a huge amount of time into making sure everything is exactly as we think it should be, though things can still be changed! The server is in a very early stage right now, we've only just started inviting people! So what exactly is freeform roleplay exactly you ask? Well, it's a sort of roleplay without the traditional dice and character sheets, which you would see in things like DnD or Pathfinder, but keep the roleplay itself. Kingdoms of Ehlerrac is also entirely text-based, so you don't need to have a mic or even a pc to participate! You can simply take out your phone, install discord if you haven't already, join the server and start! Another thing our server offers is an open-world rp, players are not locked to specific areas or towns, they can simply explore the lands as they wish.\n\nNow I'll go a bit more in-depth in the systems that play a part in the kingdoms of Ehlerrac server.\n1, a completely custom magic system! This system was designed by our staff, it has a few elements, or as we call them \"affinities\" that you can choose from, these are completely up to your will, although there is an upper limit as to how much you can have. The magic system is also totally free, how you use it is completely up to you, as long as it is approved by a member of staff.\n2, the fighting system is also completely free, members can fight however they want to, or not at all. The server is set up so that non-combat characters are exactly as important and included in the story as the combat ones. As said before, this is a freeform server, so we do not use stats and all that, instead we use your equipment and any training you may have gotten to see who would normally win a fight, although this may vary depending on what the players themselves decide.\n3, the money and equipment system is entirely set up with a bot, you can earn money by doing requests for the citizens of the cities, taking on jobs or even bounty hunting! It's all up to you.\n\nSo what kind of people are we looking for? We require at least an advanced understanding of the English language, mistakes can always be made, but not too much. Furthermore, we would like people that are okay with reading a lot of text and typing it too! This is not an ERP either, it is allowed in dm's, but not encouraged. This is also a server that has quite a few restrictions, this isn't a place where you can be an all-powerful unicorn that has control over time and space, the characters here are much more toned down.\n\nSo putting it shortly: do you like fantasy roleplay? Do you like to read up on lore and maybe even influence it yourself? Then Ehlerrac is the server for you!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/JwGCrAJ",

I can adapt and make the adventures and the questing more balanced for the more people we have, the more adapt the creatures are. Character sheets. And rolls will be controlled by dm.

            "selftext": "Hello there! Quick intro, I'm a female human being from somewhere in the Americas. If you want to know more I'll happily accept a Paypal donation of 3.99. If you're off-put by this attempt at being humorous, oh boy, you'll absolutely adore me, I swear.\n\nBut first I think I'll need to clarify what I mean by \"building a sci-fi world\" a little, since that must be why you're here in the first place, unless you instinctively click on every F4M post you see, which I can't really blame you for. Anyhow, I'm looking for a partner in crime for the development of a fancy sci-fi world and since this is /r/roleplay, we'll probably have to enjoy a little roleplaying in said sci-fi world, won't we? I do have to warn you however that this isn't an entirely blank slate, I have a couple of bare ideas floating in my head but we'll have to see about those when the time comes, I suppose, and everything is subject to change anyways. \n \nNow, when it comes to my expectations, I'm not very picky at all when it comes to the length of your responses or the overall quality of your vocabulary since I'm not a native speaker myself. But I tend to be more harsh when it comes to grammar and spelling, although I'll forgive a few errors here or there, I'd rather not see lowercase letters where they shouldn't be or too much confusion with various homophones. As for your age, I'd rather have a partner who's 18+ so that we might possibly explore mature themes within our story, but I don't really mind age otherwise, it just limits the subjects we can explore for multiple reasons.\n\nAnyways, if you've managed to read through this entire thing without being disgusted by a crappy personality you're more than welcome to send me a PM with your Skype username if you'd like.\n\nThanks for reading!",
