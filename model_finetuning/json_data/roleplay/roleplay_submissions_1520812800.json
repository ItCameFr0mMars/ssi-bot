I've been binge watching The Killing on Netflix and I've got some serious muse for that sort of genre. \n\nI'd like for those interested to be 18+ as there will be some dark themes. I don't have a preference on writer gender and I haven't decided whether this will be a group Discord storyline or just one on one. I'm not opposed to either. \n\nSo what I'm looking for is:\n\nPeople who are 18+ that are willing to do a crime/drama roleplay. If you have triggers please let me know ahead of time so that I don't accidentally set you off. Romance isn't a requirement. \n\nFeel free to PM this account if interested or if you've got questions!",

I would love to RP in such an interactive universe.\n\nI enjoy romance but not smut. I\u2019m not explicitly NSFW. Implication will always suffice for me (of course, the fun romantic buildup won\u2019t be skipped!). That being said, there may be some overtones that would make me more comfortable RPing with someone 18+.\n\nI love OCs and wouldn\u2019t mind it within the context of any of the following RPs. If we are using established characters, you are more than welcome to choose your preferred character first and claim your role.\n\nWe can workshop the plot together unless you\u2019ve had an idea you\u2019re dying to try. I\u2019m incredibly laid back and more than willing to do things your way. I respond very often (multiple times a day) with 2-3 paragraphs. I really don\u2019t mind how often you\u2019re able to respond.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the direction the plot is headed or if you wanna end the RP, let me know! :) I won\u2019t bite you or be mean. I promise.\n\nHere are the Zelda universes I\u2019d be interested in RPing:\n\n 1) Breath of the Wild\n\n 2) Wind Waker \n\n3) Majora\u2019s Mask \n\n(I\u2019ve played almost all of the games, these just seem the most fun imo. If you want to do something different please ask!)\n\nOther fandoms:\n\n 1) Uncharted \n\n2) Card Captor Sakura (let 6th grade me live) \n\n3) Altered Carbon \n\n4) Westworld \n\n(Again, if you want to try something that\u2019s not listed let me know.)\n\nMessage me if you\u2019re interested and we can hash out the details! :)\n\nI could also definitely go for an original world RP, fantasy, medieval, etc. outside of established fandoms. Just shoot me a plot idea and let me know your age. ",

I'm Casey, a 23-year-old female who loves to roleplay, specifically in the world of Harry Potter, or in a high fantasy world (Skyrim, LoTR, Inheritance Cycle, etc.) As you may have guessed from the post, I'm looking for a long-term roleplay partner.\n\nHere's some things you need to know before contacting me:\n\n**Age:**\nI'm 23, so it is a must that you are 18+, and preferably 20+\n\n**Timezone:**\nI'm in EST, but I'm up at all kinds of crazy hours, so don't worry about me not replying because of time zones. Note: I do still sleep. Sometimes.\n\n**How often I reply:** \nI literally have nothing to do all day, so I'll reply as often as you do, without hesitation.\n\n**Preferred contact:** \nI'm good with either email or Discord. PM me here for that information.\n\n**Length:** \nI match my partner. I prefer 1-3 paragraph posts, but can go up to about 5 paragraphs.\n\n**Writing Style:** \n3rd person, past tense paragraph or multi-paragraph. At least semi-lit please.  \n\n**About the Writing:**\nI really love romance and plot building, but I'm not opposed to smut that makes sense. I prefer M/F pairings, but I play both male and female. You may be able to talk me into a M/M or F/F if I really like the characters. That leads me to my next point...\n\n**Character Preferences:** \n*Harry Potter*\nI really *really* love Draco, Hermione (Dramione usually), Sirius, Remus, and just the general Marauders Era. I prefer Marauders or post-Hogwarts in the main timeline. I have written some Next Gen, and I prefer Scorpius Malfoy in that cast of characters. Let me know if you have any others you'd like to explore or play with, I'm open to suggestion.\n*Other Fandoms*\nI'm open to writing OCs in the Skyrim, LoTR, or Inheritance Cycle (Eragon) universes. \n*Original Plots*\nHave an original plot? If it's fantasy, I'm probably down to at least give it a shot! Message me and pitch me your idea!\n\nI think I've rambled on enough, so let me know if you'd like to know more!",

            "selftext": "**Introduction:**\n\nDespite that title, this is not a Doctor Who RP, unless you'd like it to be. \n\nNow, moving on...I have an itch for a fluffy, cute, slice of life story and thus far my efforts haven't led to much progress. Some RPs didn't get out the gate and others are on hold due to a partner hitting a snag offline. Either way, this is an ad for something new.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\nSome requirements I have is that we stick to Reddit PMs. It's so much easier to stay here than go off-site in my mind. Why move if we're both here already? Another requirement is the ability to give me 3+ paragraphs typically. I write a lot and when my partner doesn't write much, it feels like their heart isn't in the story and I don't want either of us feeling like we're the sole contributor. To me, RPing is based on an equal partnership of plotting together, not just one person leading the other. Another requirement is that I should get a post once or twice a week, I'm not looking for quick replies because life often gets in the way and it should absolutely come first. Lastly, I want there to be communication. Some people just reply to posts and don't plot outside of it but I find that just winging it, leads to complacency. I want us to at least gush about development and direction. We don't need to spill our heart out and get personal but talking about the RP is still a must in my mind. I mean, if someone isn't happy, the other person isn't going to suddenly figure it out unless someone says something, opposed to ghosting.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nOur story begins in modern day Japan, in a small town in the mountains. Life there is quiet and tranquil. Our characters have been friends for almost ten years. Everyone knows everyone and most recent high school graduates are eager to move to a big city and start the next phase of their life. Our two characters are no exception and are spending the chilly winter packing boxes and savoring the peaceful snowy days before they're thrown into chaos come spring when university begins.\n\nOur characters have both selected the same school in Tokyo and are both a little nervous about moving away from home. With a new adventure on the horizon, our characters are filled with many conflicting emotions of excitement and doubt. They decide to take a picnic up to one of the local shrines and camp out overnight in the surrounding forest. It seems like a perfect escape from packing and chores. \n\nWhen our characters arrive at the shrine, they set up their tent outside and get comfortable. That evening, they decide to pray to the shrine, wanting any sort of blessing they can get. As they bow their heads, clap their hands and close their eyes, they're taken back to another time and place. Upon opening their eyes, they're no longer surrounded by light snow and trees, but are in Victorian England.\n\nOur characters are quick to grab some proper clothes and now must figure out what happened, as well as how and why. They get thrown into a mess of social drama and a murder mystery. Will they get back to their own time or will they accept a new life that calls for different responsibilities?\n\n**Notes:** \n\nSo I've been craving something set in Japan, as well as in England for a while now so this is my attempt at combining them. I do want romance to be gradual. If one character has a crush on the other, please don't be creepy with it or push romance right out of the gate.\n\nI do want us to add some mystery and social drama to this. Think Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Jane Austin, Wilkie Collins and such. Maybe one of our characters is mistaken for a distant relative to a famous family? Or maybe one character poses as a detective? Or maybe one character is thrown into a sudden marriage proposal?\n\nI also want to be aware of the different social habits of modern day Japan and Victorian England. I expect us to play a few side characters or share them. \n\nIdeas for my character, maybe she's into history or crime drama shows. Or maybe she's into fashion. She'll likely be fairly outgoing, sweet but honest, and a bit of a gossip. \n\nAll in all, those are my musings right now. I don't need our characters to jump right into the past, nor do I think they will stay there. Ideally this is long term so when our characters do go to college, they could travel to another era in time again at some point. Let me know if you're interested.\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Hello, Internet! It has been a while and I do not feel like wasting time with excessive words, so let's get right to it! I am looking for a Life is Strange RP where I play as Max paired up with Chloe. I will play side characters to help with the story and the plot, but I will not budge at all on this. I only play Maxine, and I am looking for the perfect Chloe Price. \u2764\n\nI do have some ground rules I wanna cover, so let's go over the MUST HAVES of what you need if you'd like to RP with me on this.\n\n1. Descriptive and frequent poster. I get that life gets in the way, but if I'm waiting days for a reply, then it's going too slow to be interesting.\n\n2. Discord. I only play over Discord. MAYBE PMs if you really convince me. But you can message me if you're interested and we'll go to Discord from there. But Discord is an amazing and underused RP tool, I promise! \n\n3. Must enjoy story and plot. Nothing ruins a game faster than sex after sex after sex. Yes, Max and Chloe will have cute, hella gay sex, but that's not what I want the main focus to be. Story over Smut, please! \n\n4. Speaking of hella gay sex, you must be OK with NSFW themes. This goes with sex, suicide, murder and all of the darker, more adult themes that surround the video game. I'll never go too far with it; after all, it's there to enhance the experience and not be gratuitous. \n\n5. You MUST, MUST, MUST be able to capture the spirit of the game and at least play half of the characters with me. This game should be about both of us, but an RP where all we do is RP as Chloe and Max sitting around and being cute isn't any fun. I want to go on an adventure, and that means we gotta write the side characters like Victoria, Jefferson, Warren and all the rest out, too! But I'll always do my part to play at least half of them. \n\nThat's about it! Now let's get to the fun part! Wowsers. :)\n\nI'm fine with setting the RP during or after the events of the game. I would like to AVOID the \"Sacrifice Arcadia Bay\" ending, please. I feel like it's out of character for both of them to just accept that they basically murdered their family and friends and to live on like nothing ever happened. If we were to set it after the game, I'd rather it be in an alternate reality where the storm never happened and we can go from there. Jefferson and Sean will be gone, but there will be new adventures and conflicts and trouble to get in to. We just gotta be creative!\n\nA few possibilities...\n\n- Max and Chloe survive the game and avoid the storm. A year later, Max is attending college, and Chloe works... wherever a punk like her would. They share an apartment and the story would probably start off with something ominous happening that'll kickstart a brand new adventure for the both of them. Something to do with Nathan's father, maybe?\n\n- Max chooses to sacrifice Chloe. When Nathan shoots her, he fails to kill her and is arrested. Because Chloe learned her lesson from the butterfly and is no longer selfish, the universe / butterfly decides that she can be spared and that Chloe doesn't have to die after all. A month later, Chloe recovers from a coma and wakes up in a hospital bed with Max sleeping in a chair by her side and the butterfly on the window sill. Thanks to the butterfly, Chloe has remembered everything that transpired throughout the game during her coma, and wakes up with the memories she and Max shared during Life is Strange, despite them technically never happening in the current timeline. \n\n- We set it during the game, but with a twist. We will still follow the basic structure of the game, but instead of speaking Max and Chloe's lines word for word, we'll improv and add some of our own, extra, non-canon scenes and hijinks for them to get in to, while still covering all of the important stuff, like the diner, breaking in to Blackwell, their scene at the pool, etc.\n\n- Anything else we can both come up with together. :) \n\nMy \"Yes, Please\" List\n\n- Darker, adult themes\n- Romance\n- Passion\n- Kissing and cuddling\n- Descriptive partners and writers\n- Hella amazing Chloes \n- Partners I can call friend and chat with ^^\n- Drama\n- Creative writing \n- Sad, emotional scenes\n- Melodrama \n\nThat's about it... please message me if you wanna be my Chloe! Thank you!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow writers!  \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my roleplay post.  Let me start off by introducing myself \u2014 I\u2019m a man in his mid-20s who (like many of you) is seeking to find a roleplay partner.  I've been somewhat busy due to a combination of work and grad school, but as of late, it has been truly refreshing to connect with so many other like-minded people in this community of writers.  Given that I\u2019m expecting to have a bit more time on my hands in the upcoming weeks, I figured I\u2019d reach out again, and hopefully find a few more mature, talented writers.\n\n**Preferred Genres:**\n\nMy writing tends to span a wide variety of genres\u2014including science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic modern fiction.  My writing has spanned both a personal as well professional nature, and as a result, I\u2019m always up for experimenting with new genres and writing styles.  Recently, I\u2019ve been dabbling a bit more in fantasy themes; however, I\u2019m still a novice when it comes to taking on high-fantasy themes.\n\n**Writing Style:**\n\nI will humbly admit that I tend to be a voracious writer, and as a result, my posts frequently range in the 3-4+ paragraph range.  Granted, there are certain occasions when a shorter length is more desirable (especially in conversational, or dialogue-intensive scenes)\u2014and this is certainly something I implement when necessary.  I\u2019m a strong believer in quality over quantity, and I\u2019m hoping to find a fellow writer who has an appreciation for packing a large quantity of details in a condensed post (within reason).\n\n**Collaboration:**\n\nFor me, the pre-writing, collaborative stage is as enjoyable as the writing process itself.  I know that some writers prefer to jump head-first into writing the story itself\u2014with minimal discussion.  Based on experience, this approach is due to the fact that some writers fear that too much discussion may \u201creveal\u201d too much of the plot prior to writing.  While this is certainly a valid point, it is important for me to mention that my discussions do not pertain to plot;  rather, they pertain to exploring the characters\u2019 backstories, emotional orientations, cultural groundings, and other such factors.  It\u2019s more with regard to developing a creative discourse with my writing partner to truly immerse\u2014and \u201clive\u201d\u2014the experiences of our characters.  To me, it is this level of exploration and collaboration that truly make roleplaying a much more engaging process as compared to solo writing.\n\n**Writing Platforms:**\n\nI prefer to write my stories via email; however, I strongly prefer to collaborate with my co-writers via a text IM platform such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or Discord.  This is largely because an IM platform allows for a truly conversational, back-and-forth discourse about the story (rather than a static series of isolated messages via email).  I also find that my best stories tend to emerge with individuals with whom I am able to cultivate a strong intellectual chemistry with\u2014and as a result, this has led to several long-term stories.  I would be absolutely thrilled to find other writers in this subreddit who are also looking for long-term stories.  \n\n**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 [ideally over 21].**  This is not to suggest that my stories always involve adult themes.  In fact, many of my stories do not involve NSFW themes at all.  However, I feel exponentially more comfortable discussing literary ideas with fellow adults.  As a result, I set this as a strict limit, and I have a zero tolerance policy for those who lie about their age.  As a result, I will be firm for only this particular issue\u2014 *do not contact me unless you are 18 years of age.*\n\n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.**  As I mentioned above, I\u2019m seeking a writer who is truly interested in forming a long-term collaborative writing partnership.  This means not only focusing on issues pertaining to our story at hand, but also to broader issues concerning our writing as a whole.  Ideally, it would be nice to connect with other working professionals who are looking to use writing as a creative outlet, of sorts.\n\n* **Mutual respect.**  As I\u2019m sure is the case with many of you, I simply cannot be in front of the computer 24/7 due to real life responsibilities and obligations.  Because of this, I hope to find a writer who is committed, yet flexible\u2014someone who is willing to maintain open communication while at the same time, respecting one another\u2019s autonomy.\n\nIf this post has captured your interest or imagination, then by all means, I would love to hear from you!  In your post, please tell me a bit about yourself, and your background in writing.  Hopefully we can get a conversation going, and weave our way into writing a story together.\n\nThanks for your time; I hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am currently looking for someone to do a roleplay based around Doki Doki Literature Club. I would like if you knew the characters and the game well. I'm looking for someone who is detailed, and okay with playing a controlling role. I would like it if you alright with playing mutiple characters. (Just the four main characters from the game.) \n\nStorywise, I have two ideas. \n\nA: Due to some computer malfunction, some cruel trick of fate, or just pure chance, my character wakes up in the world of DDLC, completely aware of what will happen if someone doesn't stop Monika. Or is there another solution other than to delete her?\n\nB: Similar to A, a glitch brings the four main characters of DDLC into the 'real world', leaving a destructive rift behind. Monika would still have powers to manipulate stuff around her outside of the game as well! This would revole around my character trying to get them back into the game, much to Monika's dismay. The characters personalities would be thier normal, unaltered ones. Monika would lose control of her friends, since she doesn't have access to their files. Plus my character would still be aware at just how dangerous she is. She would still have some power, mainly over physical objects.\n\nIf your interested, pm me!",

And also a friend, since I enjoy talking to my partner OOC as well.\n\nThe idea I had in mind was a pretty broad one: one of our characters traveling in time to another historical period. Imagine a 21st-century woman waking up in medieval England and being mistaken for a princess, or a member of George Washington's army getting lost in a modern American metropolis, or a Puritan who is shocked by the godless values of our times. And these are only a few examples!\n\nI love the whole fish-out-of-water aspect of this prompt, and hope to find a partner who feels the same. Romance is an option, but certainly not required. I tend to emulate my partner's writing style, so I'm flexible about that, and about a lot of things. Like where the RP takes place. PM me if you're interested, and we can discuss the details!",

            "selftext": "There was a time, many years ago, when Titus was ruled by Warlords wielding vile Necromancy, ruled the lands with sadistic intentions. They were unstoppable, for their soldiers were imbued with rituals performed by their masters. These rituals allowed them to last much longer without decomposing and made them incredibly hardy. In exchange, the Warlords themselves lost parts of themselves with each ritual. Sight, hearing, basic motor functions... by the time of the 7th Year of Scourge  (7 YoS), they were barely human, pieces of bloated meat that held the last scraps of their humanity within ruined minds. Despite the effects... it was, in most cases, worth it in order to consolidate their powers, for resistance was everywhere, and no one would allow themselves to die cowering on corners.\n\nJust as the last remaining forces, survivors of atrocity after atrocity, made their final stand, a miracle occurred. The twelve Warlords looked upon the pathetic beings, and turned on eachother. Each had greed on their minds, none would share the power, and the hasty alliance of these twelve soon broke apart as they fought, dead against dead... by the time it was over, there was one left... and before the survivors could arrive to finish him off, he vanished in the sea, presumably drowning.\n\nBy now, it was the Eighth Year of Scourge, the Scourge was gone, but not it's cause. The ancient texts of Necromancy were burned, not a single word of the seductive language would ever find itself read by a curious scholar by mistake. And as a result, the cleaning and destroying of these texts helped pave the way for the current Scourge Alliance...\n\nIt has been hundreds of years since the Years of Scourge, civilization has returned, and even improved. Sure, war plagued countries every once and awhile, and mother nature wasn't a very generous person. But ask anyone, and they'll tell you that life now is hundreds of times better than it was during the Years of Scourge. \n\nOf course... life wouldn't remain this way for long. For on a long forgotten island, where a small tribe of humans resided, something has awoken from their ancient slumber. The last surviving Necromancer, who had rested under their tomb infused with all sorts of magic to heal then and restore their looks. They have awoken, and soon, all of Titus will hear of this. For now, this Necromancer must decide their course of action. For if they were to repeat history, surely, they would be doomed to fall...\n\nThe question was, how could this being do things differently with the tools given to them?\n\n(If you have any questions, concerns, or generally are curious to play this, send me a pm! I'll be happy to clarify this awfully open ended prompt for you.)",

            "selftext": "Greetings all!\n\nI'm a bit new here and looking for role-play partners or groups. However, I've been dismayed by the amount of rps that require a Discord account to join, especially when that requirement is not explicitly stated. Three rps within the past few days I have expressed interest in but been unable to join because of my lack of a Discord account. Does Reddit have some sort of unofficial sponsorship with Discord or something?\n\nMini-rant over. Down to business. \n\nI'm open to most fantasy or sci-fi topics, as long as they don't take place in modern times. For existing fandoms, I can do Star Wars, Harry Potter, or Game of Thrones. \n\nFor more detail, see my profile on r/RoleplayGateway: https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/84xotf/aryaskywalker/\n\nIf you're interested, comment below or PM me. Looking forward to role-playing with you!\n\nEdit: fixed a word",

Opening it's doors soon but has a information discord page and chat for pre-regerstration!\n\nThe world as all knew was dark, floating in the universe with no promises till the three were made by a solitary being. The Chronicler, The Sculptor, and the Maker. Three siblings who forged the world modeled after old legends. As time went on, things evolved and came to reason. Races of many were made thanks to The Maker, the Sculptor helped build the thriving world the life of plants and culture, while the Chronicler made the legends into the vast knowledge all within Valinta knew. This world soon lost sight of their past and chaos began to fold out Ward showing a darker truth. War was common between races but soon the wars faded. Only the scars remain.\n\n\nNow through the ages beings walk along eggshells of faith in hopes to not topple over with the fragile world of shrouded realms. Alliances clash with their beliefs. People fake their peace amongst each other with hiding who they really are to not cause any more trouble. Lands push for more power over the other to make sure they have their spot to be the strongest. Which side will the people decide to be on when they're pulled on the stage of choice when the scars finally wrip back open?\n\nNOW YOU \nNow it's your turn to be on that stage towards righteousness, float down the path of sloth, or fall into the cracks of corruption. It's your life. Use it wisely and to it's fullest. May the chancellor not throw you off the game and into the never ending Neather.\n\nYou may be wondering, why is the storyline a bit bleak and not in perfect detail? Why doesn't give specifics on who is exactly fighting who? We have more information with alliances on are forum website and the chat; though; most of are storylines will be built through admin or member events to create are ever changing world of Shrouded Realms. This allows it to be long term and everyone can chip in.\n\n\n\n",

I can usually only handle one rp at a time so once I have one that is promising I stop responding to requests! \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m a pretty literate role player and I\u2019ve worked primarily on google docs but I\u2019m willing to try other mediums. All my posts are usually between 2-7 pages and I can totally provide samples! When our characters are in conversation posts may be only one page but I never want anything below that. I get especially type crazy when there is some drama going on. \n\nI\u2019ve always preferred writing the male character and I\u2019ve used the same character almost my entire writing career. I have a couple loose plots in mind but they\u2019re very character driven so I really depend on you having a fleshed out character as well. I prefer realistic plots but you can always try and convince me otherwise! I do like historical plots though! \n\nPlease let me know if you think we might be a match! I\u2019d love to get writing. ",

            "selftext": "I posted this exact ad maybe a month or so ago. Found someone but it didn\u2019t work out, so here\u2019s another attempt...\n\nHi all.\n\nSo I've realized I'm craving a Fallout RP. I have something of a plot in mind, so I'll write a bit about it and then a bit about myself and my writing preferences. You'll have to forgive me - I really rather hate RP ads so this will definitely not be exciting. \n\nI'm thinking of playing a Vault-dweller. Someone who, because of certain circumstances, has recently found herself without a home. I'm not solid yet on the specific reasons behind the Vault's failure, but she's on a mission of revenge. However, being a Vault-dweller certainly doesn't lend itself to traveling in the Wastes very effectively at all. That is where you come in. \n\nI'm flexible on your character because, of course, it's *your* character. My thought was that perhaps soon after my character sets out from her Vault, she happens upon yours. Maybe yours intends to rob or assault mine - that is, until my character realizes yours is quite ill. See, she was a doctor prior to the collapse of her Vault, and *oh*, how you've been suffering. Any sort of relief from the pain at this point is lucrative in your characters' eyes.\n\nFrom there, they can travel together, develop a bond and very eventually perhaps a romance. Of course, this is all just my passive thoughts on it. I'm definitely interested in hearing others' ideas. \n\nAs for me, I write through email and I write a lot. I need a partner who writes their replies in a multi-paragraph format. I need someone who replies fairly regularly, and someone who is open to chatting about plot. I'm not looking for smut and the like, but am not opposed to it necessarily. However, I require my partners be *at least* 21. I like a writing sample, and can provide one. \n\nAnyway, please PM me if you're interested. I'd love to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Introduction:\n\nHello and welcome to my RP ad, I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful day! Thank you so much for taking the time to stop by and read this, I greatly appreciate it! I know this a wall-o-text but I wanted to try and provide as much information as possible about myself and what I\u2019m looking for. Anyways... Let\u2019s a Go!\n\nPersonal Info:\n\nI am fairly new to Reddit so please keep that in mind. A little about me, I\u2019m in my early 20\u2019s, a full-time student, and am currently living in the PST. I have about 2-3 years of RP experience and I\u2019m still learning a lot! I do my best to use spell check and read over my posts, but I am human and do make mistakes. I do have many other hobbies and activities that I actively participate in, so please do take that into consideration.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSchool is currently -IN- session for me, which means I will only have specific days available to arrange RP sessions or find time to play by post. As of right now Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday are the days I have available for play. However, I am also an athlete and have a two hour practice every day with matches played on Tuesdays and Fridays. I already have the season schedule, and am a very organized person, so I should have no problem scheduling sessions and letting you know my availability on a week to week basis.\n\nMy RP style:\n\nI prefer to RP in the third person format, posting anywhere between two to six paragraphs depending on the situation. If you can match that awesome, if not, that\u2019s fine too. What I do ask is that you be comfortable with posts of that length from me and that your posts are at least one to two paragraphs with enough content to keep the scene and/or story progressing. I love to use a lot of detail in my descriptions, bios, and posts and would ideally like to find a partner who feels the same. I like to take my time in creating characters and setting up stories and scenes, so please don\u2019t expect to jump into the RP right away. Most of the time I prefer to create and play original characters, however recently there has been one cannon character I have been really dying to play who I\u2019ll mention a little later in the ad. As the title says, I\u2019m only looking for FxF pairing, your RL gender doesn\u2019t matter to me, only your characters. I enjoy slow burning stories that allow our characters to grow, change, and develop together over time. I do not mind sexual elements being incorporated into RP, just in the appropriate time and if it doesn\u2019t overshadow other elements of the RP. Everything in moderation, right? As I want to leave this post SFW, any further discussion about this topic can be taken to PM. My preferred method of RP is Discord, though I am new to it as I was accustomed to using AIM. I am open to discussing other methods if Discord isn\u2019t for you.\n\nPreferred Themes &amp; Settings:\n\nAs my wall-o-text is already getting seriously steep, I\u2019m going to list my themes and settings in order of preference with little side notes where needed. When messaging me, please tell me what specific themes and settings you\u2019re interested in. I don\u2019t want to list specific ideas or scenarios here as this ad is already lengthy, and I prefer to talk those topics through with any potential partner. These are not all the settings I am interested in or open to, just the ones that came to mind and happen to be some of my favorites.\n\nThemes:\n\nRomance: I absolutely adore this theme and am just going to put it down as mandatory. Sorry if this isn\u2019t your cup of tea! I absolutely adore opposites attract/unlikely couple angle, but this is not necessary. (Mandatory theme)\n\nAdventure: Yes please! Let\u2019s not have our characters be sitting around all day, let\u2019s go out there discover the world, live out dreams, and broaden our horizons. (Favorite)\n\nAction: This goes hand in hand with a lot of the settings I\u2019ll be listing below. Sometimes conflict is necessary! (Favorite)\n\nSexual/NSFW: Adding this in because of the number of questions I\u2019m receiving about it. As I stated earlier in the post, yes, I am open to having these themes present in an RP, only if they do not overshadow the other elements of the story. I prefer a balance of themes in a story or it tends to get stale fast.\n\nSurvival: This admittedly is a theme that I have no experience with but intrigues me. I\u2019m willing to listen to any ideas that may involve this theme. (Like/Curious)\n\nSettings:\n\nMarvel Runaways (Hulu Series): It has been sometime since I have read the comics, but my love for this setting was recently rekindled by Hulu\u2019s take on the superhuman teens. This is where my cannon character itch comes in, as I would LOVE to play Karolina Dean ideally with my partner playing Nico Minoru. This is preferred but not required, you can play whoever you\u2019d like to, including an OC. (Preferred/Favorite!)\n\nX-men/ X-Mansion: I am nowhere near current on the comics as that hobby is a bit too pricey for a lowly college student.. sad face! In any case, there is a small possibility I may want to try my hand at playing either Paige Guthrie aka Husk or Illyana Rasputin aka Magik though I will most likely play an OC. (Favorite!)\n\nKingdom Hearts: The possibilities for this setting are literally limitless which is why I love it! A fantastic opportunity to make some creative OC\u2019s while taking advantage of the vast number of worlds to explore and discover! Warning, I have not played ALL the games, I have played Kingdom Hearts I &amp; II and am planning to start the others soon. (Like)\n\nOriginal Worlds: I am totally open to working with potential partners to create our own world for our characters to play in. This does take a lot of time, work, and collaboration but can be a very rewarding process. If this is something you\u2019re interested in, please let me know and we can talk about it. (Like)\n\nOther settings I may be open to: Harry Potter, World of Warcraft, Marvel Cinematic Universe, Various Teen Dramas (The O.C., Gilmore Girls, Veronica Mars, Pretty Little Liars, Gossip Girl, The 100, etc.), other TV Dramas (Westworld, Game of Thrones, Carnivale, House, etc)\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\nOk, almost done, I promise! I think the most important thing to me in a potential part is the ability and willingness to communicate. I\u2019m not talking about OOC chit chat, but being able to openly talk about ideas, stories, and characters in a creative and constructive way. This is a collaboration after all, I value my partner\u2019s thoughts and inputs into the story that we are creating together, so please if you\u2019re looking for one person alone to take the reins, please look elsewhere. I\u2019m also looking for someone who is passionate about these themes and settings I have posted. I know this seems like a given, but it really does make a difference, especially in the writing if you really love or care about these elements. Lastly, I\u2019m looking for someone who is understanding, as I mentioned above I am back in school now and I may not have as much time as I'd like to RP. I need someone that is understanding of the pressures of life, and that I may not be available all the time to post or play.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOk, whew.. if you made it through it all, congratulations! Thank you sooooo much for taking the time to read all this. I know a lot of my settings are pretty niche, but I\u2019m really hoping to find someone that loves them as much as I do. If you\u2019re interested, or just have questions or comments feel free to leave me a message. I hope you all have a wonderful day!\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "The title says it all really. I'm driven largely on adventure-driven stories revolved around a singular character that acts as the proto-protagonist as they muck about in another person's Medieval Fantasy world whose story encompasses violence, exploration of the unique cultures, races, nations, forgotten places left in mountains and holes in the ground, as well as discovering new monsters, magics, etc. In a way, I sort of enjoy being able to describe it as a universe similar to the Witcher. A bitter, unpleasant world that's coming to a new age as fantasy and the harshness of reality bleed together to create a profoundly dark world that drafts real concepts from reality like economics, geopolitics, causes for conflicts amongst rulers where they use casus belis to flimsily give themselves cause to push for their real ambitions...so on and so on. If it's a world that can manage to make me uncomfortable, then you're probably doing something right with it.\n\nI don't care about the gender of my partner or any other circumstances related to them. It's not my business unless you care to make it; that being said, I've been at this long enough that if you're someone who self-describes themselves as a 'detailed writer,' then ninety-percent of the time ti doesn't actually mean anything. If you know how to structure a paragraph and can convey the feelings you want to get across, then that's more than enough for me. I'll provide a writing sample further down. Obligation has me say that I have no trouble with smut whatsoever, though the character I had in mind was a female with a favortism shown towards the same sex, which may very well come into conflict with the societal norms of the world, or be something entirely ignored. Either works for me, and, indeed, having sexuality be a point of tension can be quite fun if designed and plotted out well.\n\nI use Discord, Skype, as well as GMail/GDocs; message me for contact details for that.\n\nThanks to Kevin for giving the chance for this piece.\n\n&gt; His attire was the usual of his imperious self, a simple pair of pressed trousers above polished leather boots. Over his shoulders was draped a collared shirt, and a light leather jacket above it; an odd choice in the hellish waste which was the Prestor's hold. Still, the man wasn't even sweating as he stepped forward, his limp obvious, while his hazel eyes gazed down at the girl with a thousand emotions flowing through, making a single indiscernible amalgamation. Her gaze met his, and she felt just as many, the strangest among them, among the fear, the anger, the respect, was the love. Not of a woman to her man, but of a daughter to her father. The man, for his part, did not look older than thirty, making it rather strange in the looks, but she had spent centuries with him... And while she felt nothing so strong as for the princess of her dreams, it was still enough to stop her strangling him until he inevitably forced her away. Instead, she just keeps a grim, determined look, causing him to sigh, and set the cane against the table, before pulling the chair on his side out, to sit down, with some struggle, due to the weak leg.\n\n&gt; When he has situated himself in the chair, Saria's eyes following him coldly as he does, he pulls it in, resting his arms on the table as the weak leg splays out for better comfort, before his eyes finally rest on her once more. The man seems unwilling, or at least unable, to say anything, wordlessly watching her in a mutual contest of whom could maintain poise longer. And Saria wasn't willing to play, yawning fakely to break the manufactured tension in the room, before leaning forward in turn; keeping her back straight and hands held perfectly, as she finally says, her first words since she'd talked to Raven's graving into the bedside, \u201cWell. You look good. Is that a new hair style you have?\u201d Daas, despite having not cut his hair in weeks, instinctively put a hand on his head to see what she was talking about, before casting an annoyed gaze at her and sighing. \u201cCan you take nothing seriously?\u201d He asks that, after a moment, his tone matching the gaze as his hand returns to the table, which causes her to shrug her shoulders, indifferent.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhen it's worth taking seriously, yes. But unfortunately for you, you aren't worth taking seriously.\u201d His gaze hardens again, his jaw set in a manner to indicate her words had bitten as harshly at she'd expected. There was a primal pleasure in tearing down those you hated; at least to her, and there was no one she hated more. Part of her disliked that pleasure she received, but she didn't care to listen to that; not here, not now. Her mental tangent is broken by Daas' words causing her to jolt; breaking her from the trance she'd already fallen into. \u201cSaria. Are you ever going to stop acting like a child, or am I going to have to treat you like one?\u201d Her gaze casts over him for a moment, coming up with a response which he immediately understands will be sarcastic, causing him to just cradle his head in a hand as she replies with, \u201cWell, I don't know. Children don't have to think, and they get to (Whoops, censored!) until they're nice and happy. Being treated like a child sounds like a dream.\u201d\n\n&gt; Daas' eyes glare her down, indicating she had gone a step too far in the wrong direction. She felt no remorse for the man's annoyance, however, shaking her head as she cuts in, before the man has a chance to criticize, \u201cYou're the one who forced me into this god-forsaken tower. Don't you fucking dare tell me to treat you with dignity or respect; you traded yours a long time ago.\u201d Rather than further annoyance, Daas' expression turns to that of a bemused smile, somewhat forced, as he chose to simply come to her side of thought, for now, if only to warm her up for the questions he had planned. \u201cYou did, too, you know. So I suppose that makes two of us, just pigs, rolling in the mud.\u201d Saria's eyes glance at the man, finding some anger at what he'd said, at the mention of her having given in her dignity. \u201cI didn't really have a choice in the matter,\u201d her tone is far more pressed, now, and her eyes slant. \u201cYou took my dignity... Though, if we're pigs, then I suppose that one of us is magical and the other's a murderer. Sounds like an excellent story for the ages. Maybe one of these days you can say that story to the next woman you kidnap and hold here.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI'll keep that in mind,\u201d He says, softly, before leaning forward, thinking on her remark on dignity. \u201cBut you say that as if you didn't enjoy it. You enjoyed every moment, every kill, every hunt. The difference between you and I is that I don't enjoy my atrocities; and you do, Saria.\u201d The man has barely finished speaking before Saria's chair is thrown into the wall behind her, chipping away the stones behind her as she stands, glaring down at Daas, who shows no chance in composure as he watches her staring down at him with barely-contained fury from his words. \u201cYou...\u201d She says, voice shaking in the same manner as her quivering arms, \u201cYou...\u201d Nothing more came. It was true; what he said, at least about her. But the fact he'd said it, and the way he'd done it, made her want to burn the man down. But she didn't. And slowly, his arm raised, as she saw the familiar deathly black energy running along it, powered from it, as he gestures to the thrown chair. \u201cPick it up,\u201d he says, calmly, \u201cAnd sit down.\u201d",

            "selftext": "There was a time, many years ago, when Titus was ruled by Warlords wielding vile Necromancy, ruled the lands with sadistic intentions. They were unstoppable, for their soldiers were imbued with rituals performed by their masters. These rituals allowed them to last much longer without decomposing and made them incredibly hardy. In exchange, the Warlords themselves lost parts of themselves with each ritual. Sight, hearing, basic motor functions... by the time of the 7th Year of Scourge  (7 YoS), they were barely human, pieces of bloated meat that held the last scraps of their humanity within ruined minds. Despite the effects... it was, in most cases, worth it in order to consolidate their powers, for resistance was everywhere, and no one would allow themselves to die cowering on corners.\n\nJust as the last remaining forces, survivors of atrocity after atrocity, made their final stand, a miracle occurred. The twelve Warlords looked upon the pathetic beings, and turned on eachother. Each had greed on their minds, none would share the power, and the hasty alliance of these twelve soon broke apart as they fought, dead against dead... by the time it was over, there was one left... and before the survivors could arrive to finish him off, he vanished in the sea, presumably drowning.\n\nBy now, it was the Eighth Year of Scourge, the Scourge was gone, but not it's cause. The ancient texts of Necromancy were burned, not a single word of the seductive language would ever find itself read by a curious scholar by mistake. And as a result, the cleaning and destroying of these texts helped pave the way for the current Scourge Alliance...\n\nIt has been hundreds of years since the Years of Scourge, civilization has returned, and even improved. Sure, war plagued countries every once and awhile, and mother nature wasn't a very generous person. But ask anyone, and they'll tell you that life now is hundreds of times better than it was during the Years of Scourge. \n\nOf course... life wouldn't remain this way for long. For on a long forgotten island, where a small tribe of humans resided, something has awoken from their ancient slumber. The last surviving Necromancer, who had rested under their tomb infused with all sorts of magic to heal then and restore their looks. They have awoken, and soon, all of Titus will hear of this. For now, this Necromancer must decide their course of action. For if they were to repeat history, surely, they would be doomed to fall...\n\nThe question was, how could this being do things differently with the tools given to them?\n\n(If you have any questions, concerns, or generally a are curious to play this, send me a pm! I'll be happy to clarify this awfully open ended prompt for you.)",

            "selftext": "Hi there, I'd like to find one or two writing partners for some one on one games. I don't find I have enough time for group roleplays but I don't want to stop altogether. So I'm looking for some stories to keep me going. A bit about myself, I'm 28 and male. I've been roleplaying for about 15 years or so on and off and consider myself to be literate/advanced, I expect my partner to be likewise. I live in Scotland so I'm GMT time zone. I prefer to roleplay over email so if you're interested in writing with me please PM me and we can exchange emails. I ask that all partners be at least 18+ as I prefer adult stories with violence and sexual encounters, though I\u2019m not looking for pure smut.\n\nI would be interested in writing something in Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian universe or something similar in an original world, I've always been a big fan of this setting. The ancient history fantasy setting with its strange cultures, ancient empires and nameless horrors is very interesting to me. I feel that it stands out from generic historical fantasy which is typically in a medieval setting. I have a few ideas in terms of setting and characters but I\u2019m happy to discuss things further.",

We currently have four members, and are looking for more!\n\nHere is the full plot (some details are missing here, but all is listed on the server!):\n\nThe Chevdian Empire has been invading your homeland for years in violation of the Ayrith Accord - set in place for other empire to recooperate after the war, but due to the constant struggle for power and weaker military forces could never be enforced. Many villages are without crop, and villagers are without coin. This is why you now stand at the border that divides your homeland and Chevda - whether you're a noble hoping to strike a peace treaty with the empire or a humble merchant seeking new beginnings, you are all drawn to cross the border and walk on Chevdian Soil.\nHowever, even the nobles have little to no coin, and the only way to make money is through sheer might. You all find yourself in the capital of Chevda, Archidran. So how very lucky it is that a young travelling merchant named Dolce is looking for heroes - heroes to join a monster hunting guild, a profitable venture in an empire interested in only the finest of material. She offers boarding, food, weapons, and transportation; however, the quests are risky and chances are making it out alive are slim.\nDue to sheer luck, the guild wins quite a few battles, and has attracted the attention of the empire. Due to illegally crossing the Chevdian border, the guild's members are hunted by the Emperor's finest men. The guild is formed into a rebellion group, seeking the Goddess Hestia for her aid in forming a new empire to overthrow Chevda. The journey follows the guild as they take on jobs, look for a new land in which to form their empire, as well as making treaties with other countries on the continent to expand the empire's influence.\n\nSend me a message for the group link :))",

            "selftext": "Hi there! Some details: 1. Must be 18+! I'm in my twenties and would prefer to RP with someone who is a similar age or older. 2. I don't do fanfic RPs! This is due to the fact that I find pre-constructed worlds and characters extremely limiting. I like to be creative and building my own worlds and characters is way more fun to me. 3. I love me some romance and am looking for that in my RPs. That being said there still needs to be a story! RPs tend to get boring if the romance is the only focus. I love when romances develop naturally in the story. 4. I'm up for most genres except I tend to stay away from Scifi. Aliens and spaceships aren't really my thing. If you have story ideas please, let me know! 5. I always play female characters cause it's what I'm most comfortable with and prefer straight relationships. 6. I want details! I'm a quality over quantity type of person and really want someone who will match that. I love story details and beautiful descriptions. I try to stay away from one line replies and write in \"novel\" fashion, which means I write like I'm writing a book. 7. I work full time which means I'm usually around in the evenings and on my weekends. I will try to reply as much as I can every day. I will always let you know if things are about to get busy and if I'll be m.i.a. at any time. 8. I'm don't have a preferred app or anything that I use so if you have suggestions let me know. Something that I can access both on my desktop and mobile would be ideal for me.\n\nIf you're interested, please PM me! We can chat and go over any questions you may have.",

I would really love to have a fun story about two ladies traveling the road; Specially if its something to accomplish an adventure of something goofy. Maybe they're both trying to try all the brews in the world? &lt;3 I'd really love to play a physically fit lady opposite of another one, hopefully I can play a Monk and you can play some sort of warrior lady.~ (If you watch Critical Role, yes I am so super inspired by Beau/Yasha!)

            "selftext": "*...some days are better than others...* The man turned the volume up and smirked humourlessly. \"You can say that again, Bono.\" Zooropa wasn't a terrible album. Still, he'd expect the soundtrack to the apocalypse to be metal. Because apocalypse was the best way to describe the events around him. The sky had darkened. Every now and again, a fireball crashed loudly into a building. People were screaming, running, horns were honking. It was all a bloody mess. And then there was the weird, amorphous purple rift in reality, with large, almost stereotypically demonic creatures pouring from it. \n\nBut it was just another shit day in a series of shit days in a series of shit weeks, months... if this was to be the end of the world, why even bother running. He still had half a can of his energy drink and a few bites of the sandwich he'd picked up on the way. No grand feast, but it'd do. \"Might as well sit it out,\" he said to himself. \n\nShe came out of the smoke, walking down the line of empty cars. Some were half turned, stuck on the sidewalk, some rammed into others, as people attempted to drive away before giving up and simply running. She walked slowly, but confidently. Her gaze shifted and her expression seemed to be both curious and slightly... lost... at the same time. He leaned back in his seat, tilting his head as he watched those jet black hooves stride towards his vehicle. \n\nHooves. Horns. A tail. Plate, black as the night. The design wasn't as revealing as one would expect, but exposed enough skin for his eyes to feast on. And then... her gaze locked with his. She turned slowly and made her way to the car, a long, black fingernail (or was it a claw?) tapping on the glass. He lowered the window, turned his head to face her. \"Good evening.\" She responded in a language of her own. He expected something guttural, perhaps snarls, growls... but it was pleasant. Almost... sensual. As was her voice. Of course, he didn't understand a word of it, but it seemed to end in a question, the slight sideways tilt of her head confirming the notion. \"Oh... I don't know,\" he responded in his low, slightly hoarse voice, \"...a shit day, I guess. Lost my job again. Some other crap.\" He shrugged a little. \n\nShe studied him for a while, then ran a long finger over the pale scar on his arm. \"This? Long time ago. I was a stupid kid. I bought into that crap about the military making a man out of you.\" He chuckled dryly. She responded with a brief laugh of her own... it was... cute. They did not understand each other's words, but something, on another level, simply clicked.\n\n\"Hey, wanna join me?\" he asked, pointing to the co-driver's seat, then reaching over to open the door on that side. \"I mean... if you're not busy with the whole thing... bringing the fires of hell down on Earth, wiping out humanity and whatnot.\" She gave him a puzzled look, then, after a moment's pause, nodded, hooves clicking against concrete as she made her way around the car and sat next to him. He closed the window. She closed the door. It kept the noise out, the music was audible again, a soft, melancholy soundtrack.\n\nThey sat there as the world burned. From time to time she'd point at something, say a few words, perhaps laugh a little. She'd take the can he'd been drinking from, sniff it, take a sip, then cringe and shake her head comically. She loved the sandwich though. It was gone in the blink of an eye. He studied her armour, her weapons. Her. At some point, he slowly reached out, wrapping his fingers lightly around a short chain that hung from the neck guard of her armour... was it a decoration? The last link was distorted, it seemed as if something had been pulled from it, violently. She turned to look at him, alarmed at first, then... sad. With a sigh, she reached into the pouch on her belt, holding up a strange amulet with runes and a few cracked gems. The ringlet that would attach it to the chain was snapped. \"Broke it in a fight?\" he asked, tentatively. She just... stared at him for a while. Then at the amulet. Before opening the door of the car, tossing it out into the street, and spitting after it. \"Oh... I guess it's a commitment thing, then. Well, I know that doesn't make it any better, but my ex wife's a cunt too.\" She shut the door, turned to him with a frustrated expression, as if about to snap at him, then after a brief pause... laughed. She laughed... then tears began pouring down her cheeks and within moments, her head was in his lap as she cried inconsolably. He put a hand on her head, awkwardly stroking the hair between those curved horns. The world did not end that day. It changed. And a strange companionship began...",

            "selftext": "Hi there, I'd like to find one or two writing partners for some one on one games. I don't find I have enough time for group roleplays but I don't want to stop altogether. So I'm looking for some stories to keep me going. A bit about myself, I'm 28 and male. I've been roleplaying for about 15 years or so on and off and consider myself to be literate/advanced, I expect my partner to be likewise. I live in Scotland so I'm GMT time zone. I prefer to roleplay over email so if you're interested in writing with me please PM me and we can exchange emails. I ask that all partners be at least 18+ as I prefer adult stories with violence and sexual encounters, though I\u2019m not looking for pure smut.\n\nI would be interested in writing something in Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian universe or something similar in an original world, I've always been a big fan of this setting. The ancient history fantasy setting with its strange cultures, ancient empires and nameless horrors is very interesting to me. I feel that it stands out from generic historical fantasy which is typically in a medieval setting. I have a few ideas in terms of setting and characters but I\u2019m happy to discuss things further.",

I'm looking to set up a dystopian world set in a post apocalyptic world! It doesn't even have to be postapoc-Earth, it could be another planet entirely. The possibilities are endless!\n\nWhat I'm looking for: \n1. 18+. I'm looking to cover mature themes such as war, death, etc etc. Other NSFW themes may be a part of it but I'd rather that smut not be the focus of this RP.\n2. Doubling/tripling. Please be able to play more than two characters! It's just more fun for both of us. \n3. Multiple paragraphs. I would prefer at least two to five paragraphs per post. \n4. Two to three replies a week. Not really a dealbreaker, as I do understand life comes first, but I am still looking for someone who is able to post multiple times a week. \n\nA bit about myself!\n\n1. 24 years old\n2. East Coast \n3. Female\n4. 11 years RP experience\n5. I can handle up to 6 characters at any time. \n6. I give a minimum of three paragraphs per post. \n\nMy preferred roleplaying platforms are as follows: Email, Google Docs, Discord, Kik, (other messengers). I absolutely will not RP on forums. \n\nHope this caught your attention and I hope to see those little orange envelopes!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! We're delighted that we're able to tell you about our game, over at /r/sevenkingdoms!\nSevenKingdoms is a new game on Reddit merging between more mechanical Powers games and complete RP centric games. It encourages story-telling and advancement of characters while still having strategic game play as an element. Our game balances both roleplay and strategy elements in a way that appeals to a broad range of players. You control your House in 7K and can take them in many different directions, whether advancing their place in Westeros or challenging the status quo.\n\nAt the moment, we are eleven years into our story after the 188 AC start. Though in canon, Daemon Blackfyre rose up in rebellion in 196, in our little world it has yet to happen. That is not to say our world has not been interesting; Westeros has been embroiled in several wars and conflicts. In the most year, tensions arise between House Meadows and House Strickland, whilst a house from the Iron Isles sailed forth into the North during the midst of winter, and massacred the inhabitants of Bear Island. Yet, only a chapter of our story has been written. \nWill Aegor Bittersteel rise up in rebellion? Will Baelor Targaryen inherit?\n\n____\n\n[The North](https://cantuse.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/madnessmarch-copy-e1410816743237.png?w=624)\n\nMany years ago, Lord Umber was arrested for the alleged murder of Lord Barthogan Stark. He was tried, found guilty, and hung by Lord Regent Brandon Stark, despite the lack of concrete evidence. In retribution, Lady Umber marshalled an army and marched on Winterfell. The Unber army defeated the Winterfell garrison, and forced the abdication of Brandon Stark. \nSince then, Winterfell has been ruled by a Council of Five Northern Lords, who jockey for influence over the kingdom and the young Lord Rickon Stark. \n\nEmboldened by these recent events, the Skagosi have rebelled against Winterfell and declared their own Kingdom, raiding the mainland and forcing a costly naval invasion. The North has also been harried by Ironborn raiders, one of which has brutally sacked Bear Island. These threats from within and without have made the North a dangerous, exciting, and dynamic region.\n\n____\n\n[The Riverlands](https://orig00.deviantart.net/45c0/f/2013/057/b/6/b66c70f6f2630941f9c56735a17a36d5-d5wbubz.jpg)\n\nThe Riverlands sit in the heart of the Realm, with a multitude of alliances and conflicts both internal and external. A man of House Tully once held the coveted position of Master of Laws, but was forced to resign by King Daeron after clashing with the Hand of the King. Since then, the numerous powerful houses of the Riverlands have jockeyed for influence and alliances. \n\nHouses Frey and Mallister eye each other with suspicion over accusations of attempted poisoning, while the ancient Bracken/Blackwood grudge continues to simmer. The Riverlands are a fluid region full of intrigue, plots, and feuds. \n\n\n____\n\n[The Vale of Arryn](https://orig00.deviantart.net/b518/f/2013/076/6/b/the_eyrie_by_feliche-d5ye71i.jpg)\n\nThe Vale exists as it always has. Quiet and reclusive, despite a marriage to the Royal Family. Behind the mountains however, things are not quite as they appear. First, the heir to House Arryn was killed in a jousting accident in the Riverlands. Then Lord Arryn himself was slain fighting an uprising by the Mountain Clans - though the war allowed many noble Valemen to build a name as capable battle commanders. Their Eyrie is now nominally ruled by 6 year-old Robin Arryn, under the watchful eyes of his remaining family members.\n\nThe Vale is currently stable, with few immediately visible conflicts. However, the powerful Hunters and Redforts resent their overlords\u2019 neglect and high-handedness. Some Lords prefer to consolidate their power within the region, while others build relationships in the North, Riverlands, and in King\u2019s Landing. Meanwhile a handful of noble families like the Lynderlys, Hardyngs, and Hunters have taken up worship of a mysterious cult, sometimes carrying out human sacrifices. In a region of devout Seven-worshippers, religious conflict is a distinct possibility.\n\n\n____\n\n[The Iron Isles](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/0/04/Lino_Drieghe_Pyke.JPG)\n\nThe marks of The Red Kraken's reavings upon the West have only begun to fade. In the Iron Islands, Lord Loron Greyjoy strives to rule differently from his ancestor. He has actively sought to build trust with the Riverlands, severely punishing those vassals who raid the Greenlands and fostering a marriage alliance to Lord Tully\u2019s son and heir. The Greyjoys have unlanded House Tawney for raiding the coasts of House Mallister, and are currently investigating House Blacktyde\u2019s possible sacking of Bear Island. Lord Greyjoy has proven more cautious and loyal than his ancestors, though his vassals occasionally balk at the embrace of Greenlander ways, and remain suspicious of the Westerlands. \n\nThe Iron Islands remain an outsider region, torn between their historic desire for independence and their desire to wield greater influence in the Realm.\n\n____\n\n[The Crownlands](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/94/da/d0/94dad0ddacb87cb0f8633a5c096b12d7.jpg)\n\nThe Seven Kingdoms are ruled from the Crownlands by King Daeron the Good, who united Dorne with the Seven Kingdoms after centuries of bloodshed. His bastard brother Daemon Blackfyre broods in King\u2019s Landing, gradually making connections and increasing his standing among the lords of the Realm. Brynden Rivers has already risen to the position of Master of Whispers, while his half-sister Shiera Seastar was slain by the very Kingsguard knight she seduced, in an attempt to coerce him to assassinate the Queen.\n\nThe lords of the Crownlands are more closely tied to the politics of King\u2019s Landing than any other region, and many flock to the city in search of stature and power. Lord Darklyn of Duskendale serves as the current Hand of the King, while House Velaryon pursues marriages to King Daeron\u2019s grandsons. Other noble houses are always welcome at Court, and many a career can be made and broken at the Red Keep.\n\n\n____\n\n[The Westerlands](http://orig08.deviantart.net/dd14/f/2013/052/b/5/casterly_rock_by_feliche-d5vrdgj.jpg)\n\nSince time immemorial the West have been ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock. Their leadership have created a strong realm, closely knit by marriages and alliances, but cracks have begun to appear. A feud between two northern Houses have recently flared, and a civil war within House Farman stole the lives of three young Lords to be, among them Lord Damon Lannisters firstborn and heir. At the same time the scars of the Red Kraken can still be seen in the heart of the West, and new conflict is spilling out of the Reach into the West. Will Lord Damon be able to keep his realm in check, or is the days of the lion at an end?\n\n____\n\n[The Reach](http://vignette99.wikia.nocookie.net/gotascent/images/7/7e/World_Highgarden.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140130065517)\n\nThe Reach has been more turbulent in the past 10 years than any other region in the Seven Kingdoms, save perhaps for the North. Old resentments towards the Dornish still linger, but some more diplomatically-minded lords have begun extending olive branches beyond the Red Mountains. Lord Leo Tyrell had ruled with unpredictability, questionable judgment, and occasional brutality. Discontent grows, but the powerful Lords of the Reach mistrust each other nearly as much as they dislike Lord Tyrell\u2019s rule. After a short-lived rebellion by House Tarly was quashed by Highgarden, many are fearful of defying Highgarden without alliances. \n\nA long-standing feud between Houses Meadows and Strickland has recently boiled over, and each family has called on its web of alliances. After House Dondarrion stormed the Strickland castle in support of House Meadows, the Reach and Stormlands stand on the brink of war.\n\n____\n\n[The Stormlands](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/8/8f/Storm_s_end_by_feliche.jpg)\n\nThough there are those in the Stormlands who oppose the Dornishmen being integrated into the Seven Kingdoms, the possibility of the heir to Dorne, Prince Olyvar Martell wedding the daughter of Lord Osmund Baratheon grows more certain on a daily basis. Lord Osmund Baratheon grows old and sickly, and soon, Lord Lyonel \u2018The Laughing Storm\u2019 Baratheon will inherit his father\u2019s position as the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. Will he strive towards the peace his father spent his life working to build, or will his reign be one of his own nature, quicker to steel than ever to words? Lord Gawen Swann and Lord Nymor Wyl found themselves at the opposite ends of a trial by combat, Nymor Wyl admitted to hanging the Dragon Knight in a cage above a pit of vipers and forcing King Baelor the 1st to cross the them to save his uncle, yet Lord Swann cut him down where he stood, and was arrested by knights of the Kingsguard\u2026 and won a trial by combat for his freedom. Some work towards peace between the Stormlands and Dorne, but some harbor bad blood to the men who had once been their foe.\n\n____\n\n[Dorne](http://oi60.tinypic.com/ay5c9s.jpg)\n\nDorne is the most recent region to enter the Realm, and it is by far the most influential in the Royal Court. Queen Mariah Martell is the mother of the growing crop of Targaryen Princes, while her brother Prince Maron Martell is married to King Daeron\u2019s sister Daenerys. Dornish lords are very active and enjoy a favorable position in King\u2019s Landing - a dramatic reversal from the previous centuries of conflict that still anger many in the Reach, and especially in the Stormlands.\n\nSince joining the Seven Kingdoms, Dorne has had several border skirmishes with the Reach and Stormlands. House Blackmont fought with House Tarly, while House Wyl fought with House Swann. Despite the conflict seen in recent years, the Martells have sought to mend broken ties between her neigbhours, with the heir and prince of Dorne, Olyvar Martell being betrothed to the daughter of Lord Osmund Baratheon whilst the boy's uncle, Mors Martell set out into the reach, with the intention of sealing a marriage between the House Martell and Hightower.\n\n____\n\n[The Wall &amp; Beyond](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/6/6b/The_wall_and_Castle_Black_by_Feliche.jpg)\n\nBeyond the Wall is a place of constant conflict, Tribes fluctuate in power, but the snow will always fall. In the bone-freezing chill of the True North, The Thenn had aligned themselves with the Haunted Forest for dominance over the lands beyond the Wall after Magnar Styr grew a weirwood tree through Rolf, a chief of the Frozen Shores . They were, however, beaten back by a coalition of tribes consisting of the Cave Dwellers, Frozen Shores, and Nightrunners, and a handful of other clans. This left the Thenn and Haunted Forest in shambles, but after a proud man from Storold's Point was killed attempting to assert his dominance over those born in bronze, they may be back yet to rise against their enemies so that their Magnar might claim himself as King Beyond the Wall. However, with so many candidates to this title, who knows the state the True North might find themselves in?\n\n____\n\n**How do I get started?**\n\nFor a taste of what is available, our [claims](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14O2L4cnd7LLAhMl9t-bPykH_QaiLyDztVvGVUZzQqzY/edit#gid=0) list is a great place to start!

I am just going to have a list of my requirements, rules, and things I don't like to roleplay instead of making a paragraph because it just makes it easier to read and probably more likely for people to message me. Haha. Also, I roleplay as male or female characters and roleplay straight or gay/yaoi roleplays. I'm in Eastern time so it would be easier if you were in something close to that. I'm fine with there being a few hours difference but it would just be difficult to do a roleplay on opposite times. Haha. I'm eighteen, if you can't trust me on that, I'd prefer if you didn't message me. Nothing personal, it's just a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\n\n* Tell me the gender you want to play.\n\n\n* Tell me the sexuality you want it to be. (Straight or Gay.

I don't work that way. I have to know what you like and you need to come up with things toward the roleplay. \n\n\n* DETAIL. \n\n\n\n\nI WILL NOT ROLEPLAY:\n\n\n* Any kind of roleplay that is complete fantasy.\n\n\n* Sci-fi \n\n\n* Monster Hunter.\n\n\n* Fandoms.\n\n\n* Large age gap (Beyond 10 years) \n\n\n* Cheating \n\n\n* Co-workers \n\n\n* Apocalypse \n\n\n* Neighbors \n\n\n* Roommates \n\n\n* First time meeting like at a coffee shop or\nbar. \n\n* War \n\n\n* Playing a female that is in charge (A Boss, An Owner, DMLB...) \n\n\n* (There are other things and I will say them if they are brought up.

While I'm waiting for my girlfriend to get around to starting this with me, I figured I'd flesh them out a little bit. For the time being, I don't really have a plan for the time or what's gonna happen or anything, just the characters. I can fill you in on them when you ask but for now I'm just lazy. If the plan is making a team of just our people, then I need two characters. So I'm sure you can imagine that his one will require doubling.

I am just going to have a list of my requirements, rules, and things I don't like to roleplay instead of making a paragraph because it just makes it easier to read and probably more likely for people to message me. Haha. Also, I roleplay as male or female characters and roleplay straight or gay/yaoi roleplays. I'm in Eastern time so it would be easier if you were in something close to that. I'm fine with there being a few hours difference but it would just be difficult to do a roleplay on opposite times. Haha. I'm eighteen, if you can't trust me on that, I'd prefer if you didn't message me. Nothing personal, it's just a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\n\n* Tell me the gender you want to play.\n\n\n* Tell me the sexuality you want it to be. (Straight or Gay. I don't do lesbian roleplays.) \n\n\n* Must be detailed \n\n\n* Must do third person \n\n\n* Must be experienced and literate \n\n\n* Let me know what you do and don't like to roleplay. BE SPECIFIC \n\n\n* Our roleplay MUST have a story. I don't 'wing' roleplays. \n\n\n* Let me know pairings you like. (Example: Prince X Commoner, Bully X Victim....) \n\n\n\n\nRULES:\n\n\n* Do not suggest a plot based on sex. \n\n\n* Do not ask me to RP first person \n\n\n* Do not tell me to just come up with the plot and you'll do it. I don't work that way. I have to know what you like and you need to come up with things toward the roleplay. \n\n\n* DETAIL. \n\n\n\n\nI WILL NOT ROLEPLAY:\n\n\n* Any kind of roleplay that is complete fantasy.\n\n\n* Sci-fi \n\n\n* Monster Hunter.\n\n\n* Fandoms.\n\n\n* Large age gap (Beyond 10 years) \n\n\n* Cheating \n\n\n* Co-workers \n\n\n* Apocalypse \n\n\n* Neighbors \n\n\n* Roommates \n\n\n* First time meeting like at a coffee shop or\nbar. \n\n* War \n\n\n* Playing a female that is in charge (A Boss, An Owner, DMLB...) \n\n\n* (There are other things and I will say them if they are brought up. These are just the ones that pop up most often.) \n\n\n\n\nIf you have gotten this far, welcome! Give me an introduction in a PM and we can get started! :) Talk to you soon!",

I'm looking only for *female partners* you'd be surprise how many guys don't seem to read that part.\n\nAnyways, since I\u2019ve been watching rebels recently,  I'd love to play on that time period! Maybe we can be a Jedi and her padawan hiding out from the inquisitors and lord Vader. Or we could help the rebellion in its early stages! I'm very open to interacting with cannon characters although I'd prefer if we both use OC's unless you want to play Sabine because I just couldn't say no to that &lt;3\n\nThis is not the only idea I'm willing to play tho, I love all the time periods from the clone wars to the new force awakens-era!

I write in third person, usually unnecessarily verbose. I expect at least a paragraph or two response. \n\nI've been wanting to do a canon fandom rp in these universes: Overwatch, Rick and Morty, Star Wars, Harry Potter. I'm also very knowledgeable in the Batman comics and the Marvel universe, among other things. just ask. \n\nI'd like some sort of ship, I'm feeling that old school livejournal vibe recently. I can play a wide variety of characters, but I won't play an oc. I'd really rather not use ocs at all, honestly. Please know the lore of the universe you request. \n\nplease be over 18, well-written, and prepared for a nice slow burn romance/horror rp. I have some scenarios but I prefer to come up with them together. \n",

            "selftext": "Hello all.\n\nI'm looking for someone who would be interested in a Yokai Watch RP. I would hope you have played the second game (one of them) but if you've only played the first, that's okay too. If you've only seen the anime, I suggest you play the 3DS games but that's also okay with me. Ideally we'd both play our own characters who each get their own watch and spend time befriending and battling yokai while doing random favors for people and such.\n\nI do want there to be romance but more on the side of things. This would be a action based, slice of life story. And I'd hope that our characters are over 18 for said reasons. I want this to be pretty fun and relaxing so if you want to just aim for 2-3 paragraphs, that's cool with me.\n\nIf you might be interested and want to talk more, shoot me a PM. :)",

I'm going based on what I've read about the rules and what I've seen from other posts the past few days I've checked in on this subreddit. \n\nI'm experienced in a wide variety of roleplays. From slice of life. To demons and ghosts. I do not do apocalypse roleplay sadly due to just never getting a decent partner that will finish off the roleplay. Or will ghost after awhile. My favorites would have to be modern fantasy. Like modern day with fantasy elements added into them. Those are always fun. But I am not limited to them. So if you have something else in mind. I'm open to hear you out. To be honest this is all I can think of right now. I hope this is enough for you guys to go off of. Also I won't be leaving my username in my post. Pm me if you want to roleplay. I've tried the r/roleplaykik subreddit and That's a normal thing there and now my Kik isn't even fun to be on. Lol. So yeah. I hope to see you soon. ",

I love all of them, so the pick is yours! \n\n\nWe don\u2019t have to stick to just the show, we could also do AU\u2019s!\n\n(Soulmate AU, Mafia AU, Villain AU, A/B/O AU, God AU, ect.) \n\n\nNow about things like grammar and literacy. \n\nI understand that mistakes happen, they happen to me too, but if you\u2019re doing it constantly it\u2019s going to be hard for me to focus on the roleplay. \n\nLength wise, I want someone who\u2019s able to match up to me in length, which is usually 2-4 paragraphs. \n",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'll try to make this short and sweet so that things are simple for both of us. I'm seeking a male, or anybody who plays men, to write with. Typically I write 2+ paragraphs a response, in 3rd person, and in past-tense form. My experience stems from one on one writing, group roleplay, and tabletop games like DnD. I also like partners who are the DM of the storyline/NPCs, though it's not really required.\n\n**The fun stuff:** As you possibly gathered from my title, I'm seeking a dashing plot filled with pirates and misadventure. This is something I would want to take place in the worlds nautical prime during the 1700s, but I wouldn't mind adding in paranormal or magical elements here and there to spice things up. After all, most good pirate stories are at least a little mystical. \n\nAlong with massive amounts of thrilling escapades, I would like to include a little slow burning romance along with it. I love the idea of a previously high-society woman being lead down a rabbit hole of crime because she's being strung along by love, whether or not your character feels it too. It's a tired trope but I know I can make it fun. \n\nThat's the most detail I have currently, but please send me a PM with any questions or ideas on it! Hope to hear from you soon. :)\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am doing a research on subculture of roleplaying\n\nFeel free to answer this 10 minute survey on it. \n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/H5855BF\n\nI first wanted to say thank you to everyone who participated in my survey and answered my questionnaire. As a result of this I, of course, have new questions as a result of my new observations. \n\n1. Many of you mentioned  character development or conflict is what  excites you and a lack thereof is what bores you or exhausts you in a roleplay. Can people clarify what they mean by character development, what they mean by conflict, how does one get those or fail to get them?\n\n2. many of you mentioned an inability to find a good partner. Why is this?  From what I observed a lot of it had to do with motivation and inspiration.\n\nIs it your responsibiltiy to keep the other person inspired? and Your partner's responsibilty to keep you inspired/ engaged? Or should one fuel their own inspiration and motivation themselves?\n\nOr should inspiration or lack there of even be a factor?\n\nHow does one find a partner they like as a fellow roleplayer as well as one that they like as a person/ get a long with? what is the vetting process?\n\n\n3. I have noticed that within textual roleplays one's experience or lack there of or talent is generally measured relative to of course the quality of their responses but also to the length of their responses. \n\nI am curious why this is?\n\nas a story can be well told using just dialogue (plays) or just dialogue and action (screenplays) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello~ I'm looking for a long term romantic roleplay set in the Walking Dead universe, preferably sometime before Rick's group met the people of the junkyard. Call them what you will- heapsters, scavengers, \"garbage people\". I'm interested in most partners, welcoming both women and men who are okay with playing a female. Please note that this will be mostly PG-13, though.\n\nI'm looking, in specific, for my Lieutenant, Tamiel or an original female character. I know not a lot of people like the Scavengers as a group/concept, however I think this roleplay comes with a lot of freedom, as there is very little background for the junkyard and it's people. This could go in many different directions, and I am eager to explore all of them.\n\nI don't want to rush things; I'm very much into playing through lazy days snuggling on the helipad or splitting cans of applesauce as we look down at our domain. I'm kind of picky about taking things too far- I want this kept natural and would prefer not to have it devolve into something mindlessly explicit for the sake of it. I just love the idea of slowly falling in love and coming to know each other better, then making that friendship and camaraderie into romance. If you feel the same and would like to talk about getting a roleplay started, message me- I don't bite!",

This takes place during the age of when the villages were first founded. None of the characters you once knew exist here, only the ones you make. This world is new and fresh, the possibilities of such a world are endless. However with such a world comes new threats, new challenges, but most importantly new rivals and friendships. Will you protect your village and become a hero, will you attempt to send the world into chaos as a villian, or do you just want to wonder, learning new jutsu. The choice is yours.\n\nBasically we are a new Naruto Roleplay server on Discord and if this seems to interest you, join us https://discord.gg/PNeWjq7 ",

            "selftext": "**Introduction**\nDynasty Rebirth is set after the events of Warriors Orochi 3 which is a video game franchise made by Koei. Please do not worry if you aren't familiar with the series as a plot along with explanations of the story is readily available. The community focuses heavily on storytelling with all members involved in contributing both with ideas and roleplay.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Plot**\nThe Serpent King returns from the dead, resurrected by none other than the infamous concubine Da Ji and her beloved husband King Zhou of Shang. Upon resurrection, Orochi reveals his demonic ability to corrupt the souls of others through his malicious will. With this new power humanity faces a new crisis as the cleanliness of a soul is the only thing separating salvation from annihilation. Now bolstered with this ability and motivated through the discontent of previous failures, the Serpent Lord now seeks to wage a final war against humanity. Orochi once more weaves the fabrics of space and time distorting the universe as we know in aid of his own pleasures, summoning forth the greatest heroes not only from the Three Kingdoms Era and Sengoku Jidai but throughout history and beyond to test their mortal might against a God. Now, humanity stands on the brink of extinction as the serpentine war-machine churns with revenge. The war drums pound in the distance, flags of every colour flail in the cruel raptures of this realm and every warrior is clad in armour from head to toe. This will be the end.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Community**\nWe are a welcoming, growing community from a variety of different backgrounds, timezones and of different levels of writing skill. The site is a non-competitive storytelling platform where we work together to produce interesting and compelling roleplay scenarios.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can find our forum at: https://dynastyrebirth.jcink.net \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nand our Discord: https://discord.gg/rgrdh4 \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease come and say hello!\n",

I'm Fine with either of us playing an OC of your own or the characters that already exist in the world!\n\n2) Star wars the clone wars! I want to do a roleplay of this series, though I prefer rex and cad bane, I like all the characters and I am willing to play as them.\n\n3) Adventure time! I have seen most episodes and am familiar with most character arcs, there for I'm fine and willing to play any male character, or other if you really prefer, that you desire!\n\n4) The Loud House! I've seen most episodes and I absolutely love the show, I would like to try Role Playing this if possible! (Personal Favorite of mine due to the small amount of people that actually want to do it)\n\n5) Any Cartoon/Animated movie/fandom I know of, i'm open for!\n\nRules:\nNo irl pics\nAvoid text talk, like, hw r u?\nIf I make a mistake, please don't get to mad, everyone makes mistakes.\n\nI'm looking for a Roleplay over the app Kik or through Reddit PM\u2019s, either is fine for me and both are fully welcome!

I am free most of this week (Spring Break) so message any time!! As for roleplays go I would rather it be a \"Build your own world\" Fantasy or have it set in one of the following worlds(Still completely OC and Original Plot). Obviously this is not all of them just naming a couple feel free to ask!!\n\nHarry Potter: I love the Harry Potter Series and I LOVE doing rolplays based around it. It's up to you the time line and if we want to to set it during the Dealthy Hallows or Before that even! We could also do after that to create a new threat to the wizarding world as well.\n\nStar Wars: (Sadely I'm still dark on the latest movie I haven't had the time to go... &gt;.&lt;) I have three things with Star Wars, Jedi, Sith., or none. I love the idea of currupting Jedi but I also like it vise versa. If anything we don't even have to play as force users maybe you, or I, help along the Jedi or Sith by being a mechanic, hired gun, or maybe even a younger/older sibling.\n\nMy Hero Academia: I love this Anime and there really isn't much to say besides: don't make your Quirk too over powered. Also we don't have to follow the Story plot with it we can go \"off course\" and focus on a completely different villian if we please.\n\nNaruto: Naruto is one of my favorites to do, but can become quite complicated. We can create our own clans, Kekkei Genkei, and Jutsu. It is really just based on how you want to play/where you want to play (Which village). Also timelines can be chosen. If not completely altered if we just want to scrap Naruto and Sasuke and then we become them. In a way.\n\nEtc: I have tons of other roleplays I would love to do, but I ask NONE of them be smut related. I promised my girlfriend (Yes, I am bisexual female) that I wouldn't do any romantic stuff in my roleplays, unless it is like to get past a guard or something but even then I have my limits. That is basically my only requirement!! Other than that feel free to share your own prompts with me and we can discuss it on kik! Other than that PM me your kik or a prompt and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!!",

            "selftext": "*It's been a month since the first....symptoms started. I'm not sure symptoms is even the right word. I'm not sure there are any words in any language to describe this affliction. The creeping, burning feeling as my body is slowly giving way. The aching, the deep and dull aching that keeps me from sleeping sometimes. and the itching. Holy fuck, it itches. Worse than any bug bite or accidental tumble into the poisonous underbrush you've experienced, and any you can imagine. It's...awful.*\n\n*Coming up to the small hutch in the woods, I knock on the old wooden door. From what I hear, he's the best around. He studied under the most knowledgeable of healers, the most powerful mages. They say his curative powers are unmatched by none. Personally, I've always been a doubter of the healers and the mages (they say magic's been dead 108 years, after all) but I'll do anything, A N Y T H I N G to get rid of....whatever this is. I knock several more times, and after waiting for at least a half hour, my legs finally give out, and I lean against a nearby rock to keep from totally collapsing. This blight has taken my legs, too, and they weren't as strong as they used to be. Just when I was turning to hobble off, thoroughly put off by this healer's absence, the door slowly creaked open...*\n\n\n\nHey there! I'm an 18 year old female who loves to write, read and world build, and I'm looking for another creative soul to help me make this roleplay come to life. This can be set either as modern or traditional fantasy, based on what we come to decide will be the best course of action. Furthermore, the story premise is that my character (a human) is turning into some other creature (haven't decided yet what it should be) and lists the help of a cryptic yet rumored to be powerful healer (your character.) I want this to be adventurey, with dark tones and slow building romance along the way.\n\nRules:\n\n1.\u00a0 Males between 17-25. There won't be any smut, I'm just asking for that age range for maturity sake. This roleplay is gonna get a bit gritty, with darker themes, and I want someone who can handle that well and not be a dork about it.\n\n2.\u00a0 PLEASE have good grammar. Improper grammar irks me so much as a literature nerd and as a perfectionist. It doesn't have to be perfect, just good.\n\n3.\u00a0 Some people write in paragraphs. If you're one of those people, great! That's awesome, I love reading the creative responses people can come up with. It's not required though, and I don't expect that much from anyone because I, myself, don't write like that. One worders/liners aren't allowed though, because you can't advance a story that much with just one sentence. 2+ sentences are alright.\n\n4.\u00a0 Again, this is a non smut roleplay. I hate smut, it makes me uncomfortable. But I do like romance, so it likely will turn into a romance down the road.\n\n5.\u00a0 This is on kik. Pm me to get my kik and we'll discuss details over on there. Again, thanks for taking time to read this and I hope you consider yourself up for the challenge! I look forward to hearing from you!!",

            "selftext": "**About me:** I can post every 2-3 days but I can plot/chat every day. I feel a need to give a post ASAP nor do I like being hassled to do so. I have other things to do (I'm in my late 20s) but I do still like to talk to my partner in between posts, even if it's just superficial stuff (though I'd prefer it be plot related too). I can give my partner several paragraphs (4+) and I'd like the same in return. Other than that basic information, I'm pretty flexible and easy to talk to. My partner's interest and comfort is very important to me so I hope we can make an awesome story we're both invested in developing.\n\n**About the RP:** I write as canons and I am seeking someone who also writes as canons. I'm not interested in OCs unless they're minor or a future antagonist. One last thing about roles, I may be female but I can still write as males so I want to help write for other side characters as needed. Below are some Marvel stuff I'd be interested in doing. Some of these I have plots for, others I don't. I am chained to the films/shows so I do not have strict comic knowledge. I use PMs mainly. \n\n**Pairs:**\n\nTony or Steve x Pepper (I prefer something in the first phase)\n\nMatt x Karen or Jessica or Colleen or Trish\n\nKilgrave x Jessica or Trish\n\nDanny x Colleen\n\nFoggy x Trish or Colleen\n\nLogan x Raven\n\nCharles or Erik x Raven\n\nLogan x Jessica Jones or Pepper Potts",

            "selftext": "**The short:** I am looking for a long-term, plot-driven \"gods\" roleplay.\n\n**The long:** Have you read American Gods? NK Jemisin's Inheritance Trilogy? I've been fascinated by the ways the idea of \"gods\" can be played with, and I'd like to flesh out this intrigue into a full-blown RP.\n\nI don't have a concrete plot in mind, but I do like general themes of mystery, action, horror, and fantasy. I'm happy to play in 100% fictional places or within the existing universe. I'm flexible with time periods, although I admit that I prefer modernity. Medieval isn't really my thing. \n\nI enjoy subverting/playing with tropes, as well. (Example: my femme fatale is *literally* a man-eater.)\n\nI also have an idea of how I'd like gods to function, but this is flexible and I'm more interested in building a world together than Getting My Way. \n\nI expect this roleplay to require that we each play more than one character, with one character serving as our main.\n\nThis RP is likely NSFW, in that it may deal with mature themes such as violence. I'm fine with roleplaying sexual scenarios as part of the plot.\n\n**The roleplayer:** I am in my late 20s, and I have a decade of roleplaying experience. My first entry is typically long, typically to establish character and setting, but I tend to settle on 3 or so paragraphs per post. I'll write more or less depending on context and pacing. I also write in past tense, third person, but I can be flexible here, as well.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I am really invested in world-building. It also typically takes me a bit to really create a character before I start. I'm happy to plot/world-build during that time, but I prefer to play with full-fledged characters. I'm really not a \"wing it\" kind of roleplayer when it comes to these two things (character, world), but I am happy to wing most of the plot as long as we have a vague direction.\n\nIn any case, if any of this sounds interesting, please feel free to reach out. Hell, even if you aren't interested in this idea, but maybe you like my style and have an idea of your own that fits into the themes I like? Reach out, still.\n\nI'm happy to share a sample of my writing if need be. ",

I would like a long term roleplay partner. Someone I can come up with roles with. And actually low those roles out and not disappear after an hour without a sign. So like I said before. I like slice of life roleplay. Fantasy roleplay. Medieval. I have yet to do an apocalypse roleplay that people stayed. So I tend to not do them. I'm not against NSFW roleplay but it's mehhhh when it's the focal point of rp. If you have any original roleplay ideas well you are definitely at the top of the list. If you have roleplays ideas but they are not so original. You're at least on top of the ones with nothing to bring to the table! I also don't respond to comments. So you will need to PM me. ",

The premise of the world, the audience doesn't know if the setting is on Earth or not, and it is never made clear if that's the case. The world is as it is, and the history isn't really discussed. There are governments, just corporations that make laws in their districts. Corporate sabotage, corporate spying, etc. more resembles actual warfare and espionage. All things Open Source is seen as terrorism by all corporations. There's only one thing that's shown as super high tech and sci fi and it's this: a select few people are vaccinated with a nannite (microscopic robot) that then makes a permanent nannite manufacturing warehouse in the body, it then makes a communication hub in the brain where they can communicate to you directly in the brain. You can connect to the internet, and you're able to create your brain's virus protection software with your own thoughts, the nannites do the rest, this way, no one can \"ghost in the shell\" you and control your actions remotely, unless you give permission. You can consume an entire tub of ice cream and tell the nannites not to consume a single calorie. And suppose you need enhanced strength, or want to consume energy from the sun, or maybe you want your face to shape shift, or maybe you want your body to be like \"Odo\" from Star Trek DS9, with the help of a strange diet and the nannites, you can augment your body. \n\nI need help writing this so that characters feel real. Decisions make sense and such.\n\nI've never done roll playing before. So, I'll need help with the process. This story is none-sexual. \n\nI'm hoping we can meet up on Discord. ",

            "selftext": "Firstly thank you for taking the time to check out my post . I have been role playing for roughly fifteen years so I like to think I have some \" skill ' when it comes to descriptive play :P. I para as a minimal and mainly multi-para , I like descriptive and imaginative posts. So please don't message me if you intend on one lining, one lining in my opinion is pointless .\n\nI'd like my partner to be involved in adding to the story it's much more fun if it isn't just one person leading :). And please be descriptive! Role play is all about imagination after all right?.\n\nI have indulged as many of you would probably guess in every aspect , eras and styles of role play; from fantasy/ action to adventure/sci-fi to slice of life. Nothing is of limits with me as long as it's enjoyable/fun and interesting :). I do tend to stick to mainly the modern era as i feel more comfortable with it but I'm happy to dive into other settings with the right Story line :).\n\nCharacter development and long term is preferred I like to build a good story :). Romance is something that tends to be included in all my role plays and honestly I Like it that way. Romance I find adds a real good element to any role play :) there for NSFW content will more then likely be apart of it hence the 18+.\n\nI'm really into action/romance at the moment so happy to hear any ideas you might have :). \n\nPlease message me if your interested in starting something up with me, we can discuss and brain storm an idea together :). I typically role play on email/ google docs/ discord, Look forward to hearing from you soon :)\n",

            "selftext": "About me: 30 year old Livejournal veteran, tried Tumblr a few times and it wasn\u2019t my scene. In a stressful period where I\u2019m looking for some comfortable fandom settings to write in, places I don\u2019t really have to think about world building, or about a plot, and can build on already establish canon. \n\nDisclaimer: I am looking for literate, adult writers who are comfortable with Game of Thrones-level mature, adult themes. Please do not contact me if you don\u2019t fit this category. Please do not lie about your age, as I will *probably* still be RPing when you turn 21 in a few years time. Regardless, I will probably ask for a written statement asking you your age before we begin, as well as your limits.\n\nDouble Disclaimer: Roleplay, for me, is ultimately a fun pasttime. If at any point either you or I do not feel like we are clicking, we are both free to abandon the writing. Just have the courtesy of letting me know; I will do the same.\n\nTimezone: I bounce between EST (GMT -4) and PST (GMT -7); currently EST. \n\nHow often I reply: Somedays I can reply multiple times in the day. Sometimes, I\u2019ll go days between tags. I just promise I won\u2019t ghost.\n\nPreferred contact: While I am good with either email or Discord, I prefer Discord for keeping every thing all together in one place.\n\nLength: I prefer 1-3 paragraphs, but I\u2019m also okay with shorter or longer responses, depending on how things are going. I\u2019m easy like that.\n\nWriting Style:  Third person, past tense (although I slip into present tense sometimes) paragraph form. \n\nAbout the Writing: I write both male and female characters, mostly male nowadays. Chemistry matters more than canon knowledge. I do not fade to black. This is about having fun for me in worlds that I love and are dear to me. I\u2019m good with superhero violence and fast paced action, I love plotting intricate plots, and mostly, I just love writing.\n\nFandoms:  **Characters I am looking to write with are in parentheses, fandoms desired are listed with most desired at top of the list, and I\u2019m open to a lot more characters than the ones I\u2019ve listed.\n\n\u2014&gt; The Last of Us (Joel)\n\u2014&gt; DC Comics (Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent)\n\u2014&gt; MCU (Tony Stark, Bruce Banner)\n\u2014&gt; The Pretender (Jarod)\n\u2014&gt; Daredevil (Foggy)\n\u2014&gt; Final Fantasy VII (Turks, really want a Rude for my Reno but I know that\u2019s a fool\u2019s dream) \n\u2014&gt; Luke Cage (Luke)\n\u2014&gt; Punisher (Frank Castle, Karen Page, Micro)\n\u2014&gt; Star Trek Discovery, Reboot/Abrams-verse (Michael Brown, James T. Kirk)\n\u2014&gt; Game of Thrones (Jon Snow)\n\u2014&gt; Sherlock BBC/RDJ ( John Watson, Sherlock Holmes)\n\u2014&gt; Hannibal (Will Graham)\n\u2014&gt; Silence of the Lambs (Hannibal Lecter)\n\u2014&gt; Animorphs (any of them, why the hell not)\n\u2014&gt; Suggest a fandom (I\u2019m not opposed to you reading this list and suggesting a fandom, as long as you are okay with me not knowing it or declining.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, thanks for reading. If you want to talk, send me a PM through Reddit. \n\nCheers!",

            "selftext": "Initio Village. 2018. Canada. A seemingly normal city somewhat remote from the larger ones. For the longest time, it was a place of beautiful scenery and a home to mountain ranges, only occasionally calling forth visitors who come to the town as a resting point.\nThat is until very recently, when many characters from other worlds suddenly appear, not in their homes, but Earth - all strangely attracted to Initio. Some find the change easy, some try to find a way out. But in the end, nothing truly stops the strange visitors from finding their new place and discovering others.\n\nThat was the low quality blurb. Freeform, you can bring in mostly any OC... apart from those listed in our rules, essentially meaning not a war-machine who's intent is to battle 24/7 (you CAN battle in some places, though). There is no real plot yet, though I'm slowly figuring out a plan for one, pertaining to the mystery of others being teleported to Earth. Your character doesn't have to be some fantasy person, as they can too be from Earth. Almost anything works as long as they are in the confines of the rules, and you don't need a sheet. That being said, though, since the server is pretty general, don't expect all members to be typing paragraphs or going so much in depth. Lots of dialogue are back-and-forth one-liners, but don't let that stop you from writing large details if you wish. No sheets needed, though checking up things like powers would be nice. Just ask your questions in the actual server. Hope to see you there and suggest ways on improving it. We hope it becomes tight-knit, yet welcoming to all.\nBefore someone asks, absolutely no NSFW.\nhttps://discord.gg/DcAr94V",
