            "selftext": "This idea is very much like the game ['Microscope'](http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/), although I've been thinking about this idea long before I heard of this game.\n\nWhat I hope this subreddit would be is a 'world-building community' where people come together to add their ideas and storylines to the world. A story would start by an OP posting what they want the history/story to be about (e.g. 'Humans spreading across the stars', 'People building nations inside a giant's house' etc.), and would include a list of things they would want the story to focus on, and what they definitely *don't* want to be included.\n\nAt this point if other people are interested in the story's concept then they can come in and add what they would like to see included in this world - for instance, if the concept is 'Civilisations building on different planets in the same solar system', then one person could claim that these two civilisations built cultures around talking to each other through large mirrors that reflect light. Another could suggest that another, more hateful species exists in this solar system as well, and a third could propose that a space shuttle containing a species known as 'humans' has joined the fray...\n\nThis idea is very much like /r/writingprompts, but instead of one person responding to a specific storyline with large narratives, is a community of people adding their small ideas to a large, open project. I've personally always found it more exciting when I do something like this but other people are involved, because it allows for completely unpredictable and exciting events occurring and, as they always say, two minds is better than one. In this way there's no GM and no-one controlling the narrative (too much), but instead everyone works together towards a very exciting conclusion.\n\nI would love to start a subreddit about this idea, and I'd like to see if there would be support for this, or if there's anything you think would make the idea better. Thanks for reading through my suggestion thread, and I'd love to see what you think.",

Your character can be literally anyone, doesn\u2019t have to be a legionnaire. But someone who ventured off from the city, and had a decent amount of combat or war experience under his belt! \n\nI am hoping this could lead to them having a romance aspect, but I\u2019m also very open just to see where in general it will lead.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm looking someone for a detailed RP in the Forgotten Realms setting. We can cover a myriad of themes, I'm open to go anywhere with it, but I really like the world of Faerun since it is so open.\n\nForgotten realms is pretty classic fantasy, lots of different races including some more monsterish ones being in civilization at times.\n\n**Classic Adventuring Party** - We can be two members of a classic adventuring party, with a small cast of other members around, after they have dealt with a major crisis. Maybe some have been wounded or cursed. The party will be resting for a while in a city or a small town or even a camp in the wilderness. It would be mostly about inter-party relationships, it can go anywhere really.\n\n**Retired Adventurers** - This idea is a bit odd, basically the party would have a few members of long living races ( Elves ), and some of the short living ones ( Everyone else pretty much ) once they have been through years of adventuring. The more \"Mortal\" members of the party have grown old and the elves are sticking around to keep company to their companions. We can RP either side, although a relationship between a elf and a human could be interesting.\n\n**Criminals in Waterdeep** - Waterdeep is a sort of medieval London vibe of a city ( Think Laketown in The Hobbit ), with lots of seedy alleys, slums, inns and the infamous city port. We could be a pair of budding criminals, trying to keep our head above the water, either tied by blood, misadventure or anything along that spectrum.\n\n**Horrors in Gloomwrought** - The Shadowfel is a mirror plane of the material dimension where it is always dark and everything is corrupt, it is hard to leave the Shadowfel once you reach it. It is Lovecraftian in ways, otherworldy monsters, cursed ones and undead. In the Shadowfel there is a large city called Gloomwrought, that shifts and changes every night, it is populated with all sorts of horrors and lowlifes, think of an almost Victorian Gothic city, smokey and dark. We could be a couple that has been trapped in the Shadowfel, maybe a Cleric and a Paladin trying to not fall to corruption, while trying to escape. Or even be a pair of Vampire Thralls or Lycanthropes trying to survive in the city. Although I don't enjoy Vampires and Lycanthropes too much.\n\n**Pirates of Chult** - Chult is a jungle region, south of the Shining Sea, a group of Pirates has found a secret cave in one of the rivers that go through the jungle, they have established a base there and have been using it to raid merchant and transport ships that travel the nearby sea. Maybe in one of their raids they find a dangerous and mysterious artifact, there is betrayal and mutiny, there is plenty of ways we can go.\n\n**Mysteries of the Sand in Calimport** - Calimport is a large city at the southernmost point of mainland Faerun, it is surrounded by desert on all sides except the south, were it faces the sea. The city is extremely segregated, divided in walled districts, some of the citizens of the poorer districts never leaved the walls were they were born. Think Aladin and Arabian Nights lots of mystique and magic, extreme punishments and such. We can be anyone, from lowly thieves to Pashas. Something cool would be that one of us is a Djinn, maybe a weakened one, then you literally have Aladin in the Forgotten Realms.\n\nIf you have some other themes in mind I can find a locale that fits them and we can work something out together.\n\nI especially like the idea of pirates or anything in Calimport.",

            "selftext": "The clouds overhead were dark and ominous as they roiled and slid across the sky above. There was a distant boom of promised thunder and the air was humid with the small of coming rain if one was observant enough to notice. Far below, upon a lonely one lane road, a vehicle moved quickly across the barren landscape, the smell of smoke and carbon left behind in its wake as the steam engine running it clacked and clanked away.\n\n\u201cNot much further now.\u201d A tall man with thin blonde hair said as he looked around anxiously. His eyes moved quickly between all of the rearview mirrors available and then to the one other occupant of the car, tied up on the backseat as she struggled with the ropes she was bound with. Her eyes were wild with fright or anger or something else the tall man couldn\u2019t read as he pressed his foot harder upon the gas pedal, sending just a tad bit more acceleration to the wheels. His eyes stopped on the side mirror suddenly, focusing on something coming up behind them as they raced through the middle of nowhere. A large, dark cloud was rising up over the horizon, threatening to rain death down upon them if it caught them, so it had been for decades, since the cities had fallen and the population had ben severed by the spread of a disease that was immune to all attempts to kill it. Only those that were immune survived into the new age.\n\nThe car sputtered as the engine whined loudly, and the tall, thin man growled as he stepped harder on the gas pedal, watching as the dark cloud rose higher into the sky. \n\n\u201cNo, no no.\u201d He mumbled softly, his eyes returning to his unwilling passenger as she struggled upon the backseat without any real hope of breaking free, but finding the need to at least try. \u201cIt\u2019s you, you, you are the cause of this. You are cursed woman, a taint upon the world. You are a demon given physical form, and I should have left you there in that alley where I had found you!\u201d His voice rose into a scream by the end of the last sentence, and his foot came down hard on the brake. He fought for control of the car as it slowed unnaturally quickly, tires skidding upon the road as the backend began to swing out to the side, no longer content to simply follow the front now that it was all coming to a stop so suddenly.\n\nThe car finally came to a halt and the mumbling man stepped from the vehicle, walking to the abck and opening the door.\n\n\u201cWitchy woman, you can die in the storm. Yes, the storm will eat you and be happy for it.\u201d His voice cracked a bit in his madness as he grabbed onto the ropes which bound her and dragged her headfirst out the door, plopping her to the ground unceremoniously. Then he slammed the door shut, climbed back in and floored it, the steam engine taking a few moments to build up power before the car stuttered and took off, missing the woman\u2019s foot by only an inch as it soared away into the distance. The click-clacking hiss of the motor could be heard for a full minute before it finally faded and the woman realized she was left in the middle of nowhere, on the road and that an acid storm was approaching, preparing to leave her last few moments of life ones of pain and suffering, even as she struggled with no hope of getting loose.\n\nThe dark cloud was moving closer, her fate all but sealed as she attempted in vain to break free or cry for help. There was no one, and there was no hope of breaking her bonds. This was the moment that she would perish, after surviving everything else, after watching society crumble around her, some mad man finding her sleeping and tying her up for whatever dark plans he had had for her and then leaving her in the middle of nowhere to die to the acid rains. All she could do was lie there and watch the dark, ominous cloud come closer.\n\nA few moments later, she froze as she heard a voice form behind her, never having heard even the faintest of footsteps or any other sound at all.\n\n\u201cI take it that you are having a rather bad day?\u201d The deep, gruff voice said, and she flipped herself over to stare at the tall man standing there, his broad shoulders straining the fabric of his shirt which was stained and worn. He had on a large backpack with many small gadgets attached at various points, although all were secured as to not make any noise as he moved. His eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses but his long black hair was tied up into a pony tail behind his head as he squatted before her, arms on his knees as he seemed to asses her and the situation. He lifted his nose a bit to sniff the air and then looked up in the direction of the acid cloud and then turned his attention back to her.\n\n\u201cWell, now, see, I\u2019m thinking that perhaps I might have come along at an opportune moment.\u201d His smiled lightly as one hand moved to his waist and came away with one of the many gadgets. He hit a button and it began to whir, a small mechanical chain whirring along the edge as he moved a little closer, whether to kill her or help her she could not know until it was too late, as she couldn\u2019t get away anyway.\n\nBut a moment later the ropes went slack around her arms and legs and he pulled the small device back, turning it off as he smiled once again.\n\n\u201cThere you go. Best you find some cover before that rain gets here. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes tops I gather by the humidity and sulfur in the air.\u201d And with that he stood, and to her astonishment he held out a long, white cane with a red mark near the bottom. A blind man\u2019s cane. He tapped it on the pavement once or twice and then turned as if uncaring and started down the road away from her. A moment later a pole lifted from his pack and from it unfurled a brass umbrella, opening slowly until it had deployed a three foot radius umbrella above him.\n\n\u201cGood luck.\u201d He called behind him as he smiled and continued on. He liked the small of her perfume. He wondered what type it was. She smelled nice.\n\n...................\n\nSo thanks for reading all of that. I am in the mood to play something a little different and am wondering if there are any partners up for it. It is a post apocalypse scenario, but this one is in a steampunk world. The tale of two people whose paths cross rather strangely, relying on each other to get by and grow closer as they try to find something human to relate to after everything had ended.\n\nWill they ever make it to the city that floats or the flying city in the clouds? Is anyone still in those cities? I don't know, but it would be fun to find out.\n\nThis will be largely a social RP, as two people get to know one another and find romance over time. I hope to find someone interested in the idea, who doesn't mind long replies over Reddit PM's and can reply once a week or more.\n\nPlease also enjoy writing. Please enjoy helping a story move forward and developing the complicated feelings of a person stuck in these difficult circumstances. I do not mind moving a story forward as long as my partner is reactive and enjoys taking the reins from time to time. I do require that my partner be over 18, as I do not mind smut in my story as long as the story is first.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read all of this.",

            "selftext": "The night sky is crystal clear for once, free from its usual looming clouds as stars gleam in the distance. Security personal patrol the walls surrounding Compound OLYMPUS. The year is 2152, and LV_211 is the first planet to be successfully colonized since humans started expanding their reach from earth. The planet's conditions are harsher than that of earth's with an unpredictable weather system and largely hostile animal population, but at the end of the day its nothing that strong walls and guns can't solve. The colony started with a population of 62, in present day it flourishes at 368. Men, women and children makeup the colony with the majority of them residing within OLYMPUS.\n\nTwo additional outposts were established throughout the years, one for housing prisoners and the other for supplies. Compound Bravo, the supply outpost, is two miles outside the walls of OLYMPUS and houses a staff of 10 security personnel and 5 workers. The prison, Compound Charlie, is 10 miles from OLYMPUS. The greater distance was set in place in order to ensure that any escaped prisoners wouldn't be able to make it to OLYMPUS before capture. It has a population of 12 prisoners and 20 guards. The remaining population remains safe within OLYMPUS, living life as normal.\n\nAt the moment most of them are asleep, being watched over by a lethargic night shift. One guard lets out a loud yawn as another fiddles with his rifle, bored from years of taking potshots at roaming carnivores.\n\nSuddenly the light erupts in blinding light, hands move to shield eyes as others look for the source. Something is falling from the sky, something big.\n\n....\n\nThe ship crashed directly into the prison, severing its communications system and killing 9 guards and 3 prisoners. The remaining guards and their captain were ordered by the warden to relocate the prisoners to a storage room and attempt to secure the ship under the belief that its origin was human. \n\nAs they approached [something emerged](http://imgur.com/4HQnWcC) from the ship, leaving the guards frozen in fear as it eyed them. There wasn't enough time for them to react, the predalien lunged forward and cut through the guards, forcing a retreat as it killed 2 of them. 6 managed to escape as the remaining 3 were pinned down by its tail and claws. One of the guards watched in horror as it mounted his friend's torso, forcing her face to the upwards. It opened its jaws wide and forced its toothed inner mouth down her throat, pumping what would later be found to be eggs into her body. It repeated the process with the remaining guards, then began eating one of the dead. At this the surviving guards left completely, locking themselves in storage with the prisoners as they tried to come up with a plan.\n\n___\n\n**This is a SFW prompt, if you're not interested in NSFW material, do not look at my post history.**\n\nLooking to see where this goes, could be done in a one on one roleplay or with a group either here or on discord.

            "selftext": "In the beginning there was only light and darkness. It was a balance for you could not have one without the other. The creatures and races of the sun frolicked in the sun and the warmth it offered. The creatures and races of the moon bathed in its eerie light and how it would illuminate the darkened dwellings. Nothing can last forever.\nFor centuries there was peace and happiness. Little by little a darkened evil started to rear its ugly head in the far reaches of the realm. Except it was not a product of darkness but rather of light that slowly gave way to an evil nature. Wanting reign over all the Kingdoms that washed over the realm. Control over all the races to manipulate in their own gain. An army was quickly rising filled with those whom were called by the darkness as well. The many Kingdom know that a threat looms but have hope the light will be strong enough to not let the sway pull enough to the wrong side. The war has yet to come but make no mistake it is coming. Whose side will you be on?\nThis is a medieval fantasy group rp. We are looking for the best of the best! After having been in many groups as a member and moderate I decided to create one along with my co-creator. A world of light and dark. Good and evil. Hero and villains.\n\nAre you looking for an adventure of the most epic proportions? If you are then feel free to shoot me a PM and we can talk all about it. As this rp is just getting off the ground there is a lot your character can delve into. Be one of the first members to join the rp!\n\nThis rp will be played over DISCORD. As will many other rps 1x1 or group we do have guidelines that we would like met by each member looking to join. Listed below you will find them. If you are interested and can check every one of them off then this group might just be for you. We want enthusiastic members who are eager to play in a medieval fantasy realm!\n\n\nGuidelines\nMust be 18 years of age or older. If you are not please do not respond. Please do not lie and say you are 18+ just to be part of the group. If it comes to light that you are under that age that will be an automatic boot.\nMust be capable of writing multiple paragraphs per post. This does not mean you have to write a novel but a 2 well written paragraph minimum is required.\n\nMust be capable of sustaining multiple characters. You do not have to start off with more than one but as the rp progresses there will be other cities/regions in the realm that will need characters catered to it. Of course all characters can move around to different places and are not mandated to stay in the same place they entered in at.\nPlease be capable of writing in the third person for this is how the rp will be done. It is more fluid that way especially given there will be many characters moving within this realm.\n\nThis is an 18+ group, we are all adults, don\u2019t be a dick. If you are having a clash with another member please message either the creator or the mod. We will address the situation and try to find a solution to it. Give us time though because we are busy people and have things going on outside the group. Do not take it upon yourself however to be rude, mean or hurtful because you will be kicked from the group if doing such.\n\nAlong with this being an 18+ group know that there could be some gorey scenes. If you do not want to read them if they do not pertain to your character that is to your discretion. Scroll past it and get a brief summary from another member. All NSFW scenes such as sex between two characters should be moved to a private 1x1 chat. While I understand romances will spark between characters it is courteous to move those scene out of the public eye. Implying they did the deed in scene in a room is fine, just keep all the juicy details private.\n\nJust to emphasize and make it clear so there can be no misconstrue of words. This is NOT a RAPID FIRE group. While, yes, some members will be on more often so at times there will be rapid fire responses that will NOT be ALL the time. Please do not get bent out of shape over this matter. We have no expectations that our members be capable of going back and forth at all times of the day. Many will have jobs, families, IRL situations that crop up and can only manage a couple if not one post per day. So if you are looking for a rapid fire rp then THIS group will not be one you want to join. Please be patient and understanding of this matter.\n\nTRIAL PERIOD There will be a mandatory two week trial period for all new members. This is not to deter you from the rp in the slightest. This trial period is only to ensure the members with interest in the group are serious about wanting to be here. Two weeks is enough time to come up with a character concept, establish a backstory for them, enter them into a room and mingle with the members. This will give the administration time to see how you not only participate in the rp but how you interact with the current members. We do not want anyone in the rp that does not want to be here or is only going to give 10% effort to it. If you are more than thrilled and have a deep love of the idea of the rp and meet all expectations listed above then you will no doubt make it through the trial with flying colors. This is only to insure our group is thriving with fantastic and excited members.\nThank you for reading and we hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "I have not roleplayed in quite a while. Well, that's not entirely true. I haven't *really* roleplayed in a while. If you're not interested in some backstory about myself, feel free to skip ahead! I've taken a break from general one-on-one RP because I've spent a lot of my free time playing world of warcraft with some friends. Conveniently, or so I thought, they played on a roleplay server. It's as you can imagine, a large section of the community actively roleplaying within the main cities and whatnot. Yet, I was always a little underwhelmed by the roleplay. This is not an attempt to belittle their way of writing, I actually enjoyed a lot of my time there. But I write as a passion and it gets a little boring to receive one-liner after one-liner with no real progression of story or character. In short, it seemed to me like a large portion of the population only roleplayed as a proxy for a social life or romantic interaction. *Which is fine*. But I need someone who's not going to get angry at me if I type a bunch of a paragraphs!\n\nWhew, sorry. Had to rant. Anyways, hi, I'm a twenty year-old from California, US. When I'm not working, exercising, or screaming at my television courtesy of a frustrating soccer game, I'm probably writing. As I said above, it's been a while (Probably six months or so) since I've had a real, genuinely enjoyable and memorable roleplay experience. That is, hopefully, where you come in! To start off, here's what I'm looking for:\n\n* Someone who is passionate about writing and is decently creative. Not strictly looking for your typical, dull love story that uses a major conflict as it's setting.\n* Someone who can get me more than two responses a day. I get it, we all work and do things outside of our computers. I'm not asking you to write me a book. Just, please, help me get some progression in. If you can't, all I need is a text to know ahead of time!\n* Someone who is fine with me DM'ing and having their character fulfill a protagonist/antagonist role in a story that I'll make tailored to them.\n\nI know that's not much to go off of but there 'ya go. I prefer to DM because I like to think of myself more as a storyteller than someone who wants to be immersed in a world. I've been told I do very good at building a world for my partners, I'm sure you'll think so too! That being said, I will strictly only do original characters. **However**, I strictly prefer to use pre-existing universes/settings (however that one can be discussed). With that in mind, here's a few universes/settings I wouldn't mind going off of:\n\n* Mass Effect (PLEASE)\n* Star Wars: The Old Republic\n* Pacific Rim\n* Halo\n* Half-Life (Shout out to any GMod RP'ers~)\n* Runescape\n* WWII\n* Custom Post-Modern Era Sci-fi World\n* And... *sigh*... Fallout.\n\nThose are just a few ideas that I could think of off of the top of my head. As you can see, I've sort of got an itch for sci-fi at the moment but I can always be persuaded! I write third person, past tense. I would *strongly* prefer that you do as well, but if you're a good writer I won't complain :) If you're interested, send me a PM and we can discuss!\n\nAlso, I usually prefer to use google hangouts or skype to roleplay, but I realize how popular discord is. I *may* reply a bit slower if we use discord but I am available for it (as much as I don't want to)!",

            "selftext": "NAME: Lord Mirror Formerly Prince Nicolas Griffin\n\nAGE: 40\n\nHAIR COLOR/STYLE: Long blonde hair tied back in a braid\n\nEYECOLOR: Blue-gray\n\nSPECIES: Corrupted Human ( A strong human who finds themselves in grave danger may sometimes be corrupted by the Gods. They gain incredible POWER in exchange for their SOUL, but they may not have control over the choice to allow the corruption or die. The final decision lies with the God who oversaw their downfall.)\n\nOUTWARD PERSONALITY:\u00a0 Very short and sometimes unknowingly rude with people he finds no favor with. This is not always a negative thing, as being unknown to him means he has yet to despise you. A fiercely loyal man to all who call him 'friend', a title he himself gives to very few. He has a supreme hatred of the Gods and will share that feeling without much regard for Other's opinions on the matter.\n\nINWARD PERSONALITY: Reserved and is fearful of allowing the Corruption to spread to other humans. This is a quality that isn't readily seen on the outside, or to strangers.\n\nSPOUSES/FAMILY: Wife - Mina Pembrook, Deceased\nDaughter - Kita Griffin, Deceased\nChild - Unknown Name/Unborn, Deceased\n\nBIOGRAPHY: The day that Nicolas Griffin was born, he died. A full hour passed by as his chest refused to breathe and his heart refused to beat. The midwives were sent from the house as his father went into a fit of rage over his dead child, holding the child and screaming for his son to live, to fight. More minutes passed as he held fast to his infant son, yelling at the Gods for their cruelty.\n\u00a0 When his father saw that nothing could be done, he let out a final cry to the heavens, a strong yell that would put the loudest thunder to shame. Just then, his son started to cry, reaching out to his father, seemingly to stop his yelling. His small lungs filled with air and his heart began to beat stronger than any other child's could. More striking than his heart were his eyes. An icy-cold blue stared back at his father, perceptive in every way.\n\nNicolas Griffin grew to be a very strong man under the care of his Father, a Lord. Something he never shared with his father, nor anyone else, was the fact that his hearing was abysmal. He was trained to become a strong warrior King, but could not hear well enough to counter a sneak attack.\n\nHe quickly took to wearing very... shiny equipment. His father wasn't terribly quick to judge, as he himself wore Gold Armor in battle. Nicolas used this armor as a mirror, to always be aware of his surroundings, since he could not hear them. This eventually gained him the nickname, \"Mirror Mirror\" in battle. He took this and ran with it, using not only his mirror armor as extra eyes, but he began toying with his Sparring partners by copying their movements. He used this both defensively and offensively in battle.\n\nWhen he found a wife, he became missing from the kingdom for quite a while. He often visited her in town before running away to elope. Upon his arrival about a year later, he was chided by his father, but when the King set eyes on the beautiful prize his son had landed, he wasn't too terribly upset anymore.\n\nNicolas and his wife, Mina had a lovely Daughter who they named Kita after a type of Flower in their region. They had another on the way when the Kingdom was attacked.\n\nA not-so-neighborly neighboring country had declared war on Nicolas' kingdom out of greed and ransacked the castle. As Nicolas slept in his bed with the fair Mina, he was attacked. He woke to the movement on the bed and a high-pitched sound in his ear. Nicolas had never heard his wife or child speak, but he could hear their screams. He fought valiantly, but without his armor, he was overtaken by the men.\n\nAs he lie dying on the ground beside his cold, un-moving family, he cried out, barely hearing himself over the feeling of his heart slowing. A light erupted from the sky.\n\nWhen Nicolas woke from the blinding light, surrounded by the bloodied and maimed bodies of the soldiers who had tried to overtake their home. How he had survived was beyond him, but he did not feel victory in his heart. His wife, his unborn child and his daughter were gone, and he was alone.\n\n\nOPTIONAL INFORMATION: Nicolas Griffin cannot hear very well. He reads lips to understand people words, and uses his armor or other reflective surfaces to 'hear' the world around him.\n\nBringing up his deceased family can easily send him into a rage if he is not comfortable with the situation.\n\nWhen his Blue eyes fade into white, he is no longer in control and cannot be reasoned with.\n\nThough Nicolas often uses a sword, he will use his gauntlets as weapons, as each of his armor pieces are sharp to the touch and devastating if struck with.\n\nHas a weakness for women and children, and will protect them if put into danger.",

Minor sci-fi or even fantasy themes are welcomed. \n Please be prepared to deal with some extremely dark issues.\n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in the third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required (but welcome), but please be decently detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes. \n\nThank you for reading!",

D&amp;D type You were taken captive by orcs while working as caravan guards heading to ---, a town probably no more that 20 miles from where you currently are. You know you must escape soon as several others of your party are already dead/being eaten etc...\n\n2.)  Our muses find themselves in the same dream together! Not only can the communicate to each other as they wished, they also had all of their senses ( Touch, hearing, feeling, ect ). Everything starts all fine and dandy at first, but what happens when the dream takes a turn for the worse and is slowly filled with both of their worst fears?\n\n3.) i want a plot where a guy goes on a roadtrip just wandering around the state trying to find meaning of life with his big ass doggo and one day he comes to diner where this shy young woman works and like her boss is always yelling at her and she has abusive boyfriend and her father used to be abusive as well and this guy he is the first man who ever treated her nicely and he just asks her completely out of the blue if she doesn\u2019t want to leave \n\n4.) has to keep an eye on muse a, but muse a is teasing little shit and does things like walking around in her underwear and stuff so muse b can get pissed off and he ends up \u201cpunishing\u201d muse a probably with handcuffs and they hookup/rough sex and shit. in the end they both like it (too much) and muse b has to go because his shift is over but muse a asks muse b to stay the night while muse b is buttoning his uniform shirt on her and they have fluff and smut when muse a comes back with his change of clothes and dinner.  \n\n5.) kids who got in an accident together and both ended up with super powers they have to keep hidden, a hero/sidekick dynamic, hero/villain dynamic, people who meet at a specific school for people with superpowers\n\n6.) Muse A summons a demon/spirit and Muse B is that demon/spirit\n\n7.) Something anime-ish i think nekos are cute so maybe something like that\n\n8.) Serial killer plots, zombie plots, alien plots, saw plots, &amp; other scary stuff\n\n9.) maybe like the walking dead but the video game (tell tale) not the tv show \n\nAnything else that you'd like to suggest would be cool too.

But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nI'd like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. I would also love a Dragon Age Inquisition plot. I'm no expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed the game.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",

            "selftext": "So lemme explain. I've had this \"monster under the bed\" character for a while now; he's just an old, grumpy, harmless, awkward and not-so-scary big furry monster, living under people's beds (and if you were on shamchat a few months ago, you've probably met him!). For some reason I've fallen in love with him and I absolutely adore seeing other people interact with him. He's always there, listening to you telling him about your day, his glowing yellow eyes carefully looking after you every night. Sometimes he comes out, but most of the time he just stays hidden under the bed, occasionally trying to playfully scare you when you're sleeping.\n\nSo yeah, who wouldn't want to be friends with the monster under their bed? Just think of coming home from a long and boring day at work/school and the monster being there to cheer you up. Or we can do something more \"story-like\". Also a good thing about the monster is that he is completely adaptable to almost any story; he can be goofy and funny, or dark and mysterious if you want to do something more serious.\n\nConflicts can be really fun, too. You don't have to always be nice with the monster; in fact, he can be a pretty annoying roommate sometimes. And you also don't necessarily have to be friends with him; you can be mad at him for not paying rent. Or you can try to shove him out of your room because you don't want a monster living under your bed. All of these things can make the relationship between you (or your character) and the monster even funnier. \n\nGonna say it just to make sure, I'm really looking for something SFW. Which, of course, doesn't mean that there can't be jokes and awkward conversations about the fact that the monster is living, well, under your bed (wink wink).\n\nMy literacy level isn't very high, also English is not my first language, and I'm from France so y'know, time zones.\n\nSo um, that's all I guess. I'm of course open to ideas. I'm only available on kik (and reddit chat maybe?) for now, but over time I'm probably gonna be on other chat platforms. Thanks for reading!",

So you head to your local boxing gym, simply to give it a look. This is where you meet my character. A 23-year-old man who some say is on his way to becoming middleweight champion in boxing. He is currently ranked number 5 in the world and is working towards the middleweight championship of the world. You see him box using a punching bag and are amazing. After he's done you go and talk to him, asking if he could teach you. He agrees after some convincing and you join the gym. The rest is for the rp!

            "selftext": "Hey there! \nLori here, I'm 20 years old and a student in the US. I love to write, and I've been a fairy dedicated RPer since I was 14. (I sure as hell hope I've improved since then, though.)\n\nAnyways, I've been really looking for someone to write with, as all of my usual partners have either vanished or are understandably busy with life. \n\nMoving forward a bit---I've had a plot in mind for a while! \n\nThe plot is based on a prompt I saw a while back, where a demon is trying to help a down and out person get their life back together. A rather unconventional sort of guardian angel, given that he's not an angel at all. Although I was looking to play as the demon, I'm willing to switch it up and play the other person. Furthermore, if you had anything you wanted to switch up, feel free to suggest! This is just kind of a loose premise to build off of. \n\nSo a few things to make clear:\n1.) I AM A FEMALE IN REAL LIFE, BUT I ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY PREFER PLAYING MALE CHARACTERS. WHY? WHY NOT---BUT SOME PAST PARTNERS HAVE THROWN A FIT AND ACCUSED ME OF TRYING TO CATFISH THEM. I AM NOT TRYING TO CATFISH ANYONE. \n\nFURTHERMORE, I DO NOT CARE WHAT GENDER YOU ARE. \n\n2.) I am 20, and as such, do not feel comfortable rping with someone younger than 18. Sorry!\n\n3.) I TYPICALLY ROLEPLAY MALE/MALE RELATIONSHIPS, OR FEMALE/FEMALE. \nIf you've read everything, send your message and include the word \"bubblegum\" somewhere!\n\nAnyways, hit me up if you're interested!",

I'm looking for a long term partner to develop a world with me off of a starter or two I've created, if you happen to like them. If not we can work off something you've made of have been thinking of, I'm open to new ideas! All I really ask for is that you're literate, more so grammatically then matching length. (Cause lets be real here are some scenes with dialogue where there's no way for us to write 2-3 paragraphs.) \n\nAll I ask is that you're patient with me considering I'm mainly awake nights due to my job, and at said job I've been working 10-12 hour shifts recently. Note I will also not budge on Discord, it's the easiest thing for me to use when I switch from computer to phone for messages. (Also prefer if you're actually female but if not it's no big deal.) Also please please be 18+ if you're wanting to do smut whatsoever. (And I'd like it to only be in the roleplay if it's co-aligns with what we both want to do.)\n\nPM if you're interested, if it takes me a moment to respond I apologise. :)\n\nEdit: Adding on the 18+ thing for smut and a spelling error.",

I have around ten+ years of experience writing with groups and one on one. I write only in past tense third person and would like my partner to match that. Since I\u2019m looking for a romance plot I\u2019d really like my partner to be 21+ as I am in my late twenties and I tend to get along better with those closer to my age and I do like a bit of smut with my plot. That being said, if you\u2019re not okay with adult language when it comes to those NSFW scenes, we probably won\u2019t get along and I\u2019ll lose interest and I don\u2019t want that to happen. I\u2019m an adult and I\u2019m not scared to use adult words. I can write anywhere from a few sentences to multiple paragraphs but I like to keep things going and usually post a good length paragraph each time. I am in EST timezone and I do keep night hours so if you\u2019re looking for someone up during the day, I am not your person. \n\n\nNow, if you\u2019ve made it this far I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering what type of role plays I\u2019m looking for. Like the title says, I love romance plots. But I don\u2019t want to get bored and I don\u2019t want the entire thing to be sex scenes. So long as things progress organically, that\u2019s totally fine. I like to have drama and unknown in my plots. I love, love, love urban fantasy but I can do the medieval stuff as well. I don\u2019t normally play darker plots but I may be open to them so long as we agree on things. I like original plots, I want to chat with you and come up with something we both love. Let\u2019s hash out finer details for drama, cheating, etc. \n\nNow for roles, I love the human/non-human pairing. Want to play a werewolf? Maybe a shape shifter? Perhaps a demon or maybe a vampire? Whatever we want we can do. I am sorry to say I don\u2019t like playing with furries, literally nothing against them, it\u2019s just not my thing. I rather like humanoid creatures paired with a human. I\u2019m really craving some queer pairings are well, f/f or m/m, but I\u2019m open to doing the straightforward m/f as well. \n\nI hope to hear from some of you wonderful people. ",

            "selftext": "Hello everybody! Here I am again, on the hunt for a roleplay. I've had a drop off in roleplay partners recently so I'm looking to fill the gaps! Please read the entire post, I'll try not to make it to long, but I'm a bit of a stickler for the things I list so I'd like anyone who messages me to understand that's what I'm looking for. Anyways, below I'll list some of those things!!\n\n- Be 18+!! My roleplays sometimes roam into the NSFW realm and I'd like to roleplay with someone of legal age. \n- 3rd person, past tense. I won't budge on this one.\n- Be partially literate. Basic spelling, grammar, know how to make a sentence. Mistakes happen so I'm a little more flexible with this one. I'll let you know if I can't understand something you've typed.\n- No fandoms\n\n\nI think that's the most important bits. We can talk more in depth specifics if any of you have questions later. As for what I'm looking for I'm open to that. I like fantasy a lot, whether that be modern, medieval, scifi. I'm down for it. I'm also open to pretty much any gender pairings though I havent done a few of them so you might have to bear with me. So, if you've got an idea then pitch it my way. If not we can totally come up with something together! I'm always up for a good world building session. With that said, shoot me a PM if you're interested. \n\nP.S. to make sure people have read my entire post please include the word Butterfly at some point in your Pm!!! =)",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I am a moderator for an RP sub called Fallout New Vegas Roleplay (FalloutNVRP for short), and invite you all to come check us out, whether it\u2019s \u2018cause you like Fallout or writing or maybe a bit of both, we welcome all!\n\nHere\u2019s a little more info about us for those interested: It is set a year after the events of the game Fallout New Vegas and the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the NCR barely managed to repel the Legion attack once more, but at a great cost. Now both nations are struggling with the many domestic issues that sprang up in the aftermath: The NCR needs to put down the Fiends and Khans down quickly, especially since the BoS have gathered the courage to lift their lockdown now that their enemy is weakened, and the Legion has collapsed after the death of Caesar, who succumbed to his brain tumor, and has been embroiled in a brutal civil war.\n\nOur roleplay is heavily story driven and your choices and actions will affect and impact the story and how it progresses over time, no matter how small a role you play in the grand scheme of things. So be sure to join and check it out if you're interested in Fallout roleplay! Here is a link to the Discord https://discord.gg/SKVraq7, and to the sub https://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutNVRP/ and never be afraid to ask questions, the modteam will gladly help anyone out who needs it! I hope to see you all soon!",

            "selftext": "This is Universe 377. It is similar in many ways to us, with its history only diverging from our own nine years ago, as the ball dropped, signalling the beginning of a new year and a fresh start for many, and wishes had been shared, and moonlight kisses were had.\n\n10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\n0.\n\nThe power had gone out everywhere in the world, for seemingly no reason. Asides from that, nothing seemed wrong. Except for the metas. The first metas believed themselves to be gods, with unlimited power over mortals. The first was Anarchy. A vile woman who sought to take over all inferier \"mortals\", declaring herself the Queen of Boston. No one dared to stop her, many following her example and seeking out to destroy governments. That is, until Beacon arrived. The meta with control over light had dared to stop her.\n\nThe Anarchists and Beacon's allies confronted each other, nearly levelling Boston while doing so. Beacon may have succeeded in the fight, but both sides lost. Anarchy and Beacon had both died.However, that terrible event had passed, with Boston reforming itself, now renamed Beacon City in his honor. The FMSA are a government group that were formed to ensure that another Anarchy won't arise. Metas may be registered and employed as officers to enforce metahuman laws, becoming superheroes, in a sense. However, not all is well in Beacon City. A new group, known as the Pantheon have made their presence known, the members holding unimaginable powers and named after the gods and titans of old. They challenged civilians to face them in duels, granting those who manage to win mysterious artifacts. No one knows their purpose, but all nonetheless fear them.\n\nUniverse 377 is a small yet growing Discord roleplay group, featuring an active and friendly admin team and loads of creative freedom among the playerbase. We often hold small events that anyone can join into. Will you be a government FMSA agent set to protect the people? A villian? Somewhere in the middle, or even one of the radical purists that wish for all the metahumans to be purged? Join and find out!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/AZ7ft6n",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! I'm back at trying to find another compatible longterm rp partner! Here's something from my last text post! Hope you enjoy! I have been doing roleplay since I was about 13, so probably a little over seven years. The point I am getting at is over the years of virtually roleplaying, I have found most role plays have three major factors. 1) A Horrible Story line. 2) NSFW is always a goal for ametaurs 3) No One Likes to Take Their Time. Therefore, I am here to say the simply say, \"f*ck that stuff, let's make something worth it.\" I am in search for a long term roleplay that concludes romance, fantasy, horror, all of the above when it comes to the genre. I want to be able to live inside this world with my roleplay partner. I want both of us to be equally satisfied and content with the story we are making. Just like you, sometime I want something to pull me away from my real life for a moment or two. And we all know that we cannot achieve that if the other person's heart isn't in the same place as ours. We crave real roleplay with real characters, real emotion, and the real aspects of life. While I do prefer stories the have the element of sort of fantasy, I am also open to other ideas. This meaning if you have an idea of a story and want to discuss it, please do. But if you are just interested in roleplay and don't have a story, still shoot me a message and we can work out a story together. As Far as the NSFW, roleplaying should be more than Smut. While I do love good Smut, I don't particularly enjoy the story to be mainly that. I want build, I want love, I want passion between our characters. Do note, violence also is considered a NSFW topic, so yes. I do expect death and mangled body parts. A story cannot be a story if it does not consist of desperation, tragedy, and bravery. Especially a long term storyline. That being said, I am also looking for someone who can play multiple characters if need be.\nIf you are interested, shoot my a PM! Looking forward to your message! If not, happy roleplaying!",

I tend to write 1-3 paragraphs, usually on the longer side towards the beginning of the roleplay. To be honest, I struggle to keep up with partners that write pages and pages of text. \nI'd love to brainstorm a plot together! I prefer starting off before our characters have met. I also like stories centered around characters in their 20s, but I can absolutely make exceptions if we come up with an awesome story :) smut can be involved, but I'd rather it not be the main focus. Also, drama is a must - always good to keep things interesting! \nSend me a PM if interested! Hope to hear from you :) ",

            "selftext": "**About me:** 30 year old Livejournal veteran, tried Tumblr a few times and it wasn\u2019t my scene. In a stressful period where I\u2019m looking for some comfortable fandom settings to write in, places I don\u2019t really have to think about world building, or about a plot, and can build on already establish canon. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I am looking for literate, adult writers who are comfortable with Game of Thrones-level mature/adult themes. Please do not lie about your age, as I will *probably* still be RPing when you turn 21 in a few years time, and it\u2019s generally a dick thing to do. Regardless, I will probably ask for a written statement asking you your age before we begin, as well as your limits.\n\n**Double Disclaimer:** Roleplay, for me, is ultimately a fun pasttime. If at any point either you or I do not feel like we are clicking, we are both free to abandon the writing. Just have the courtesy of letting me know; I will do the same.\n\n**Timezone:** I bounce between EST (GMT -4) and PST (GMT -7); currently EST. \n\n**How often I reply:** Somedays I can reply multiple times in the day. Sometimes, I\u2019ll go days between tags. I just promise I won\u2019t ghost.\n\n**Preferred contact:** While I am good with either email or Discord, I prefer Discord for keeping every thing all together in one place.\n\n**Length:** I prefer 1-3 paragraphs, but I\u2019m also okay with shorter or longer responses, depending on how things are going. I\u2019m easy like that.\n\n**Writing Style: ** Third person, past tense (although I slip into present tense sometimes) paragraph form. \n\n**About the Writing:** I write both male and female characters, but have my foundations in M/M slash pairings. Chemistry matters more than canon knowledge. I do not fade to black. This is about having fun for me in worlds that I love and are dear to me. I\u2019m good with superhero violence and fast paced action, I love plotting intricate plots, and mostly, I just love writing.\n\n**Fandoms:**  **Characters I am looking to write with are in parentheses, fandoms desired are listed with most desired at top of the list, and I\u2019m open to a lot more characters than the ones I\u2019ve listed.\n\n\u2014&gt; The Last of Us (Joel) (would absolutely kill for a good Joel to my Ellie)\n\u2014&gt; DC Comics (Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent)\n\u2014&gt; MCU (Tony Stark, Bruce Banner)\n\u2014&gt; The Pretender (Jarod)\n\u2014&gt; Daredevil (Foggy)\n\u2014&gt; Final Fantasy VII (Turks, really want a Rude for my Reno but I know that\u2019s a fool\u2019s dream) \n\u2014&gt; Luke Cage (Luke)\n\u2014&gt; Punisher (Frank Castle, Karen Page, Micro)\n\u2014&gt; Star Trek Discovery, Reboot/Abrams-verse (Michael Brown, James T. Kirk)\n\u2014&gt; Game of Thrones (Jon Snow)\n\u2014&gt; Sherlock BBC/RDJ (John Watson, Sherlock Holmes)\n\u2014&gt; Hannibal (Will Graham)\n\u2014&gt; Silence of the Lambs (Hannibal Lecter)\n\u2014&gt; Animorphs (any of them, why the hell not)\n\u2014&gt; Suggest a fandom (I\u2019m not opposed to you reading this list and suggesting a fandom, as long as you are okay with me not knowing it or declining.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, thanks for reading. If you want to talk, send me a PM through Reddit. \n\nCheers!",

            "selftext": "This is my first post on this subreddit so I hope I will make it exhaustive enough.\n\nHello, I'm maruzze and I like to roleplay. I've done so from the age of 14 more or less (I'm 20 now) and I mostly wrote in fandoms. I have a liking for worldbuilding and writing, so I created my own personal world to put characters in. The bad thing is that I don't have someone to rp with so here I am.\n\nTo preface everything, I'm Italian. That means my first language isn't English so I may do some errors here and there (and you're encouraged to point them out and correct me!). That also means I'm in a different timezone that may conflict with yours if you like in America. Adding to that, I'm in university so I may not have time during the week, but my weekends are pretty free. You can understand this means I may be low activity most of the time and won't be able to do more than one reply a day (or even a reply every few days at times), both because of time and wanting to write something with a sense.\n\nIf you want to roleplay in Italian as an exercise to learn the language, I'd be happy to do that too. I just ask you know the basics of grammar because I can't teach you.\n\nAs for themes I will play and general rules:\n\n* I mostly roleplayed slice of life, introspection and light adventure/gore. I'm willing to explore many more themes if you want to do them.\n\n* I never played smut before and, while I'm willing, you should know I have no experience in the matter and will probably be bad. \n\n* If you will force me or pressure me to reply quickly when I told you I can't, please don't even contact me as I'm pretty busy with real life. \n\n* I will rp on Discord exclusively and I won't budge on this.\n\n* If you have your own worlds you created and wanted to explore, feel free to tell me and we can do it together. I always like new ideas.\n\n\n\nIf you'd like samples of my writing, I can provide some examples. You may see my style vary a bit because I try to change it depending on the character I'm writing. ",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm Amy, I'm 23 years old and pretty new to this subreddit. However, I have been roleplaying for around 10 years now, and I'm really itching to write.\n\nI just watched The Shape of Water and I would lovelovelove to do something with this pair, or even create original characters, so long as we keep it somewhat similar to the Elisa/Amphibian dynamic. I'd like to explore them getting to know one another, her rescuing him from a facility or some similar scenario, them getting to know one another, etc...\n\nI have several different ideas I can pitch for this pairing, and for clarity, I would strongly prefer to play Elisa or the female if we decide to make original characters. I enjoy NSFW material but it is not necessary, nor will I write with anyone under 18.\n\nI do love a lot of description but, depending on your preferences, I can write long or short responses--I love both! As the title says, I am willing to RP over email or Discord, with a slight preference towards email for longer RPs and Discord for shorter RPs. I also really enjoy plotting and world-building and other sorts of OOC chat. I should note that I will only write in 3rd person and would rather my partner do the same.\n\nPlease feel free to reply or PM me if you are interested or would like to discuss anything further! Thank you and look forward to hearing from you. \u2665",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am writing this to seek out one new writing partner. I have embarked on the long and arduous journey towards a PhD, which will limit my availability considerably. But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nI'd like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. I would also love a Dragon Age Inquisition plot. I'm no expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed the game.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",

            "selftext": "&gt;In the land of Westeros, the rules of power are simple: you win, or you die. There is no middle ground. \n\n&gt;The year is 407 AC, over a century since Aegon VI and Daenerys Stormborn completed the [Second War of Conquest](http://awoiaf-rp.wikia.com/wiki/The_Second_War_of_Conquest). \n[The Red Comet](http://awoiaf-rp.wikia.com/wiki/The_Red_Comet) has returned to the skies above Westeros for the first time since the War of the Five Kings - a harbinger of fire and blood to follow. \n\n&gt;The Crown has been steadfast in their portrayal of the comet as an auspicious portent, a sign of favor from the gods, going so far as to declare a Grand Tournament at Harrenhal, honoring the noble House of Targaryen in its wake. However, with the recent death of King [Aenar I Targaryen](http://awoiaf-rp.wikia.com/wiki/Aenar_I_Targaryen) - who ruled from the Iron Throne for over sixty years, outliving all of his children as well as his designated heir, his grandson Prince Aemon Targaryen - tensions built throughout the realm as the rest of the old king\u2019s grandchildren and great-grandchildren garnered support for their claim upon his throne have reached a breaking point. \n\n&gt;The coronation of a Targaryen queen is imminent. Will the dragons pair off for yet another dance? \n\n[AWOIAFRP](/r/awoiafrp) is a community-driven roleplaying game set in the same fictional world as the popular literary series, *A Song of Ice and Fire*, by George R. R. Martin, and the HBO show, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The roleplay, while technically utilizing the same setting, is meant to be considered an alternate universe as the lore, timeline, and events in our story will diverge from those outlined in canon.\n\nWe are a long-standing community of writers and roleplayers currently in the midst of writing the third chapter of our story. Our goal is to create an intriguing, player-driven story with no set end-point, but rather a dynamic living scenario woven together over time by the threads of the community members\u2019 stories. With a strong community, exciting lore, and a ready story just waiting for you to put your mark on it, our roleplay is wanting for one thing, and one thing alone: you. Together we can craft a tale worth remembering and have some fun doing it.\n\nSo be sure to [check out our subreddit](/r/awoiafrp), and then come and join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5hFWEcf) where we will be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Hope to see you around!",

One moment you were there and now you're here- wherever that is, anyways.\n\nThe room you find yourself in is almost featureless. The walls are a plain cream, without a door or a window. It's bright, though the light comes from no discernable source.\n\nThe only thing in there with you is a table and two chairs. They're beautiful, all gold and pearl and a sense of elegant class that's both out of place and very at home. On top is a selection of biscuits and cakes, teapots of varying size and beauty, plates and cutlery and a single, tall candle who's flame gives off no light or smoke.\n\nAs you try to process it, you hear a thud behind you, and lay your eyes on the strangest person you've ever seen.\n\n**FINISHED!**\n\nHello there!\n\nWhether this is a short term roleplay or we somehow manage to turn it into a longer one, I'm excited to write with you!\n\nThis roleplay is where your character, be it a pre-existing one or one you've made for this, is dragged out of their world and plopped into an in between reality. It's basically a cute writing exercise.\n\nThere are two options here:\n\n* Your character meets one of my many, many pre-existing characters and they will enjoy the very surreal experience of having tea and cakes with someone from an entirely different universe.\n\n* Your character meets Gwen, a journalist who travels between realities, and she is VERY excited to interview them.\n\nSo, shoot me a PM! You can just start writing if that's your preference.",

No voice, so don't worry about that, but Discord is an amazing tool for organizing roleplay scenarios and info and such.\n\nMy ideal partner would be in it for the long term, of course, as I want to create so much with this world. I also don't care about post length, as long as what you type helps nudge things along. Third person is also a must, as I often play multiple characters and background entities which makes first person weird and clunky.\n\nI know its not a lot of info, but I am just trying to garner interest.

I expect my partner to be well past the beginning stages of writing, but certainly don't need novel-length replies.\n* I prefer writing past-tense 3rd person. \n* Open to any genre that I feel I can do justice to, but I have a soft spot for modern, modern fantasy, paranormal romance, romance in general, crime, and (post) apocalypse. Open to sci-fi, high fantasy, or anything I haven't mentioned if we can work up an interesting plot.\n* I'm going to have a little more time in the next week or two, so even better if you're in PST time - we can fire off multiple replies a day.\n* I pretty much always like romance to have a presence, so sorry if that's not really your cup of tea.\n* Speaking of which, I'm on board with smut, but it should be organic.\n* If we start RPing and I'm not really feeling it, I'll be sure to let you know. And if you don't feel like it's your cup of tea, my feelings won't be hurt. Better to be honest than just ghosting each other, yes?\n* Would be cool if you were at least 21+, anything younger feels a bit too young to be writing potential romantic themes.\n\n\nA few prompts I've been craving - **also open to your ideas or plots!**\n\n\n&gt; *Prompt 1: [Modern] [Romance] [The Bodyguard]*\n\nMy character is a a well-known celebrity and personality, having shot to fame after her breakout role in an indie thriller film. Having come from a wealthy family, the lifestyle has been quite complimentary to her fame, including her new circle of friends, lavish parties, and flashy clothing and cars. Her previously more demure demeanor has given way to a more vivacious one, one that ended up attracting her own group of overly enamored and zealous fans that her parents have now deemed a possible danger to their young daughter. They have hired a bodyguard to tail her throughout her days and she is not thrilled about it. Is she going to try to lose him one day and get into her own spot of trouble? Does she have an admiring, obsessive fan who tries to kidnap her? Does he have his own agenda or ulterior motive for working for her family? We can work through the extra parts of this plot. I do think this is one that will work best if we craft a solid beginning, middle, and end to the plot so that it doesn't drag.\n\n\n&gt;*Prompt 2: [Futuristic] [Mild sci-fi] [Mystery]*\n\nFeeling something in the realm of Ex Machina and Westworld. My character is a top of the line android, one of the most expensive prototypes to have existed, and one of the most humanoid in both physical makeup and AI. However, any known androids had been decommissioned in the last two years, and any leftover machine parts had been broken apart and liquidated by the sole company and producer of said androids, after an untimely attack on a civilian by one of their most lauded products. Someone took her and hid her amongst a pile of rubble in what is now known as a wasteland of thieves, smugglers, rouges in the vast desert lands of the Nevada. It could be because she was known to have real consciousness and the accomplishments of this particular android was too valuable to give up. Maybe her makers wanted to keep her to further production at some point. Maybe she was kept as a potential weapon to be developed. Your character (scavenger? bounty hunter? government official?) comes across her, reanimates her, and maybe word gets out she's still in tact. Cue hunters, shadowy organizations, and plenty of violence. \n\n\n&gt; *Prompt 3: [Noir] [Assassins] [Crime]*\n\nSet in modern days, both of our characters are hired assassins employed by rival crimelords of a large city that has seen better days. I\u2019d imagine the setting to be a lot like Sin City, rampant with drug use, criminals, and violence. Citizens are at the mercy of the corrupt major and his underlings, who all have been equally influenced by the two crimelords who up until now have had equal footing in terms of playing the major\u2019s right hand man. Both of them find an opportunity when it is discovered who their each most valuable assets are: their hired hands. My character\u2019s employer sends her on a mission to find and dispose of your character, who is tasked with the same assignment of finding her before she does him. They both have files and information on the other but we won\u2019t know how everything will play out until they meet. Of course, your character\u2019s motives and backgrounds are up to you. For this one realistically, our characters should really be no younger than mid-twenties.\n\n&gt; *Prompt 4: [Time travel] [Open-ended] [Fantasy]*\n\nThis one is more open-ended in terms of direction. We could chat endlessly about the possibilities, but the only starting point I got so far is that my character is from modern day, purchases an antique artifact from a dingy thrift store, and one night gets transported back in time to whatever era it is we want to play in. I think it'd be fun if there was also a presence of fantasy in said era. Feudal Japan, filled with demons and magic? The Middle Ages, with dragons and waged wars? During the Trojan war, in the midst of Greek gods and goddesses? Whenever and wherever it is, I'm sure we can come up with something fun. \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\n ",

            "selftext": "Good evening, all. Thanks for the click. Hopefully, it'll be worth your time.\n\nObviously, I'm craving a good, strong Voyager RP. It was one of the first things I ever did RP for, and it's been the love of my life since I was seven years old (take my word for it - that's a long time), and oh, I want to write for it again.\n\nI'm only interested in Voyager; I have no desire to explore any other Treks, even in crossover fashion. We can either set this during their time meandering around the Delta Quadrant, or we could explore the happenings directly after they get home - or we could even do something twenty or so years later. I'm completely down for anything, so long as I get to play with the world and characters of the show that's been one of my favorites since I was in second grade. \n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I'm not into those blue NSFW things. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories don't have gratuitous \"mature\" content, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think.\n\n* For anything set in the Delta Quadrant or directly following \"End Game,\" I will be playing Kathryn Janeway. I would very much like you to at least double as Chakotay for me (I do not support the C/7 pairing and will only accept J/C). In return, I can and will double as any canon of your choice. OCs are all right with me. Conversely, as mentioned above, I'm open to something about twenty years later - in that case, I'll be playing my own OC, J/C's spitfire, contrary rebel of a daughter.\n\nI think that's everything? -eyes list- I hope that's everything, anyway. \n\nSo! If you're interested, I very much encourage you to PM me, so we can see if we mesh! Please note that I DO NOT respond to comment replies left here under any circumstances, so please use the PM function. \n\nThank you!\n\n~Kisa",

            "selftext": "I'm new to this sub, so tell me if I'm doing something wrong!\n\nSo lemme explain. I've had this \"monster under the bed\" character for a while now; he's just an old, grumpy, harmless, awkward and not-so-scary big furry monster, living under people's beds (and if you were on shamchat a few months ago, you've probably met him!). For some reason I've fallen in love with him and I absolutely *adore* seeing other people interact with him. He's always there, listening to you telling him about your day, his glowing yellow eyes carefully looking after you every night. Sometimes he comes out, but most of the time he just stays hidden under the bed, occasionally trying to playfully scare you when you're sleeping.\n\nSo yeah, who wouldn't want to be friends with the monster under their bed? Just think of coming home from a long and boring day at work/school and the monster being there to cheer you up. However, keep in mind that I live in western europe, so y'know, time zones may get in the way.\n\nConflicts can be really fun, too. You don't have to always be nice with the monster; in fact, he can be a pretty annoying roommate sometimes. And you also don't necessarily have to be friends with him; you can be mad at him for not paying rent. Or you can try to shove him out of your room because you don't want a monster living under your bed. All of these things can make the relationship between you and the monster even funnier.\n\nGonna say it just to make sure, I'm really looking for something SFW. Which doesn't mean that there can't be jokes and awkward conversations about the fact that the monster is living, well, under your bed.\n\nMy literacy level isn't very high, also English is not my first language, so keep that in mind! I'm probably gonna be in-character as often as possible, but I can also get ((out of character)) if you want to talk or have a scene idea or something.\n\nSo um, that's all I guess. I'm of course open to ideas. I'm only available on kik (and reddit chat maybe?) for now, but over time I'm probably gonna be on other chat platforms. Thanks for reading!\n",

I work 40+ hours a week in a field I absolutely love, but I also enjoy coming home and role playing my stress away! I do have a lot of domestic duties as well, but I always make time for a good role play! \n\nFirst off, I role play through email, Discord, or gDocs. I can plot over Skype, Hangouts, or Discord. I don\u2019t really have any preference of medium, but do keep in mind that I am mainly mobile. \n\nI want a role play partner who can drive the plot with me and bring something to the table. I want someone who can read and write English correctly - someone who is creative, friendly, and has a good grasp of whatever character they are playing (be it canon or an OC). \nI ask that you do not control my characters or even edit my own posts to suit your liking (that\u2019s just an odd concept to me). Please respect my boundaries and wishes, and I will do the same to you. \n\nI have very little limitations. I can also play male or female without qualms.\nI can also play heterosexual or homosexual pairings. \n\nI would love to do the following:\nMy Hero Academia \nSailor Moon\nCardcaptor Sakura (high school or college)\nSpirited Away\nSuperman\nBatman \n(I\u2019ll play Batman to your character, if you play Superman to mine)\nHarry Potter\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy\nGlee\nX-Men \nThe Flash \nBlack Bird (manga) \n\nBeauty and the Beast \nLady and the Tramp - human\nThe Lion King - human\nFrozen\nBrave\nMoana\nDisney\n\nModern fantasy \nMagical girls\nSuperheroes\nShape shifters\nVampires\nSupernatural \nSoul mates \n\nMessage me with any ideas you have and little about yourself. \n\nI am REALLY CRAVING Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc. Especially someone who can play Superman for me. \n",

            "selftext": "Hello, everyone! As many others, I was struck by a moment of inspiration after I watched the second Infinity War trailer (if you haven\u2019t seen it, please, I beg of you, go watch it). Now, I\u2019m looking for writers that are interested to dive into the Marvel Cinematic Universe to satiate the cravings as we count down to the film release! \n\nFirst, a few requirements. I ask that you: \n\u2022 Are 21+ in case of adult content \n\u2022 Can write in multi-paragraph form, but understands that quality is always above quantity \n\u2022 Willing to chat and plot! (Life is a little lonely in the adult world)\n\nAnd in case you were curious about me: I am well above the legal age limit (let\u2019s leave it at that) and I have been role playing on and off for about fourteen years. I write in third person, past tense, and consider myself a literate writer. On good days, I can fire replies back and forth, but alas, I work an extremely demanding job and cannot promise a reply every day. But as I continue on my vain \u201cAbout Me\u201d spew, it\u2019d be helpful to know that I am a HUGE Marvel fan, having read the comics when I was little and continuing to keep up with every Marvel release since that. \n\nNow, for the FUN part. As suggested in the title, I am specifically looking for a *Wanda Maximoff x The Vision* story, specifically someone to write our lovely Android-turned-Avenger. Of course, as always, I am open to any additional suggestions to inspire a vision (hehe, get it?). So if you have something else you want to do, please head to my inbox and send me a little note! \n\nOn the plot of Wanda Maximoff x The Vision, here is a little snippet of my idea: \n\nThe plot begins following Civil War. The two groups - formerly the Avengers - work on their separate missions, never crossing paths, until the world needs them once more. And when it does\u2026 They would first need to survive each other. Stark\u2019s idea is simple: Thanos wants one of the so-named \u201cInfinity Gems\u201d; they have one, so why not use it? The only problem is, the Mind Gem is powering the Vision, and Wanda is not about to let him be used as bait. \n\nThat is where our story will begin. Will the Vision insist on sacrificing himself to serve as bait for Thanos? How far will Wanda go to keep him safe? Can the Avengers survive each other before they survive this war?",

This same concept would apply for the other fandoms as I think building our own story with OCs is more fun.\n\nSo if this is something that appeals to you just send me a message and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as. I\u2019m not that fussy about your post length, just be semi-literate.",

Born of humans, they have distinctive powers and are recognizable by a set of wings and horns of some kind. As tensions in the land rise, the gods take in human youth, as they are considered to be the least corruptable, and train them, eventually granting them god-like bodies and subset abilities of their own; graduating them from humans to what are known as pseudogods. There will be main quests, as well as plently of side information and things to discover, slowly ridding the land of the evil entities that now inhabit it.\nThis roleplay is SFW, however there likely will be blood and doing stupid things can get your character killed!\nIt is an original story/plotline, and reading the important information is needed to understand what's going on! Maps of the land are provided, and most things take place in the god's castle or the nearby town.\nLooking for anyone who wants to come!",

            "selftext": "welcome, everyone! so after a while of snooping through the artist 'picolo's instagram \u2014 well, i've fallen hopelessly in love with\nteen titans all over again! while i'm not completely versed in justice league lore, i've watched every episode of the cartoon network animation teen titans andi would absolutely love you 5ever if you would indulge me in some crime fighting and relationship building.[both platonic and romantic] &lt;3\n\n**What I'm Looking for in a Partner**\n\n\u2727 more than anything, I must say that detailed posts are a huge must-have for me. i mean, i totally won't be expecting a monstrous post that'll take me a good twenty minutes to read [but if that's what you wanna do then aye, you do you boo]. a good couple of paragraphs filled with juicy detail - a medley of thoughts, scents, sights, and actions and - well...I'd be one happy camper :\"&gt;\n\n\u2726 Another big thing that I look for in a partner is their willingness and enthusiasm to participate. Personally, one of my favorite things about roleplaying is the beginning stages of planning. The sharing of concept art, getting all excited and sharing music, and freely sharing ideas. If you're not getting excited let me know, and we'll try fix things c;\n\n\u2727 please be understanding \u2014 unfortunately, i have issues with my mental health which can cause me to rise into days and weeks of bursting motivation and creativity, and then dip into bouts of disinterest in just about everything. so while i'm trying to fix this, i would love if you'd be patient and relaxed as we go through this lovely roleplaying process!!\n\n\n**What I'm Digging**\n\nso since the absolute beginning of my love for teen titans, starfire and robin have been my otp. maybe my first otp of all time? who knows. anywho, one of the main focus points that i would love to have in this roleplay is the progression of their relationship from platonic to romantic \u2014 which, hey, could take place in the teen titans universe...or a crossover! harry potter, percy jackson, game of thrones, star wars, avatar the last airbender, etc etc etc. with all that being said, i'd also be super down to double with the pairing of beast boy and raven!! equally adorable and have an interesting dynamic, i think it'd be super fun to mesh that into the equation as well. my preference being roleplaying beast boy and starfire, you, raven and robin! if not, hey, that's cool too ;&gt; but while i am interested in the romantic aspects, a certain level of action/adventure would be lovely \u2014 something that keeps your heart pounding as you wait to read what happens next. will they catch the infamous couture connoisseur? why is cyborg short-circuiting? beast boy was badly wounded, they're now 5 to 3 and the opposing side is just not letting up. so yeah...i have lots of ideas and super down to brainstorm, but i don't necessarily have a major backbone to work off of \u2014 so that's where you come in the picture! let's brainstorm! let's have some fun! let's go wild!! &lt;3",

Orginal universe or using a canon universe I'm open to all. \n\nA few I would be comfortable with. \nStar Wars,\n40k,\nX-Com, \nRed Rising.\n\nI'm open to others as well and I'm sure im forgetting a lot. \n\nI prefer to play non-canon characters but don't mind playing with a canon character if that what you prefer. Or we could create our own world. \n\nIf your interested shoot me a PM and we can work something out, I'm flexible. \n",

            "selftext": "Ragnar Stormblade.\n\nThat name, along with the Nord who owns it, have become almost as well known and respected as Ysgramor himself. Considered by many to be the hero of Skyrim, and it's best warrior for many years, both the name and the man have achieved near mythical status.\n\nHe began his climb to the top as a simple mercenary from a traveling band that cared little for anything but gold. But he came home to Skyrim and became a Stormcloak when he heard of the revolution, and he helped win Skyrim her freedom. After the wars ended, he discovered that he was the next dragonborn, and started another quest to defeat the World Eater himself. This he did, and many more deeds since then have lead many in Skyrim to believe he is the avatar of Talos himself.\n\nBut, like all good things, his life must come to an end some day. The gods have blessed him with long life, and he is very nearly a hundred years old. Still a strong and capable warrior that could (and has on a few occasions) killed a bear with nothing but his bare hands, but his strength is starting to leave him. \n\nOne day on the anniversary of the Stormcloaks winning the civil war, he gave a speech before all who would come and listen. \"Just a good mentor and old friend of mind one said, I grow old, and my thoughts turn to the horizon, to Sovngarde.\" He said. \"I am glad to be a man worthy of such honor as this great land has given me, and I will be that man for as long as fate allows it, but who will be the great hero once I have joined my ancestors?\"\n\nHe said that any who wished could come to his home near High Hrothgar and prove their strength to him, and, if they are worthy, be taken in as his student and taught to be a great warrior like himself. Many have climbed the northern side of the mountain to prove themselves, and all so far have been sent back down with the news that they were unfit to be trained by him. But he hasn't given up hope that there is still one warrior in the making that will be his student and fill his shoes when his days are done, are you willing to take the climb and find out if that person is you?\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nHello everyone! I just finished a Stormcloak warrior playthrough of Skyrim, and this is my idea about what happens to the character after the story in the game. You don't necessarily have to be a Nord, but I'd kinda prefer it if you were. If you'd like to start or ask me any questions, then shoot me a PM here and we can sort that out, then I'll give you my Kik/Discord and we can get rolling. Hope you like it!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

            "selftext": "Hello r/roleplay. As the title suggests I'm looking for interesting, experience and literate new roleplaying partners. I\u2019m 29, reside within the Eastern Standard time zone and have been roleplaying for well over a decade. I love utilizing my imagination and creative spirit into a story we can both enjoy. I\u2019m flexible in the types and genders of the characters I play as well as the themes of roleplay I enjoy but I usually roleplay as a female unless otherwise inspired. \n\nWhile I enjoy playing a multitude of different roles I\u2019m primarily looking for a roleplay based within the universe of Westeros/Game of Thrones. I\u2019m not looking to play any canon characters and my preference of timeline for roleplays is wide open. I\u2019m well versed in the additional lure within the series so I\u2019d feel comfortable playing any scene that was based within the age of heroes all the way to post war of the five kings. While I would enjoy some kind of romance within the roleplay all the other details are completely up for negotiation. I have a few house ideas in mind for my character already but I\u2019m always up for a creative curveball\n\nDue to the adult nature of some of the roleplay ideas I have I\u2019d prefer to only play with mature, creative, literate and interesting adults over 18. Absolutely no exceptions. In terms of availability I\u2019m around most afternoons and early evenings for chat and prefer to play via discord, google hangouts or e-mail. I keep my responses somewhere between 4 to 9 paragraphs depending on the scene and tend to be detailed in my writings. Someone who feels capable of matching that would probably be the best match for me. I also have a regular life and relationships outside of roleplaying so there will be times periodically that I won\u2019t be able to play however I\u2019ll always let you know before I go no contact. \nAnywho if this ad interests you feel free to message or reddit chat me to speak further or exchange contact details. If this ad is still up regardless of it\u2019s age I\u2019m still seeking new partners.\n\nValar Morghulis\n",

            "selftext": "**Hey /roleplay!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\n&gt; I am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\n&gt; I don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n&gt; When it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\n&gt; Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n&gt; This is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n&gt; I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nI've been very interested in setting up a roleplay within the Star Wars universe lately, so I thought I'd see if there were any takers. I'm a college student with free time to burn and a large love for the series. \n\nMy interests are varied, but I'm really interested in something within the Clone Wars period. I also enjoy the GCW, including the years before and after the original trilogy. I would prefer to use original characters for this. When it comes to the Clone Wars, I lean towards the Republic for a factional allegiance and independent / the Alliance for anything beyond. Beyond that, though, I'm pretty flexible. I'm a large fan of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Mandalorians. I definitely lean to Legends over the current canon.\n\nI have a couple of ideas in mind for a character, but one is a clone. I think there's a lot of potential there and very interesting themes. This is something I anticipate to discuss with my partner though, along with a potential direction and things we'd like to include. \n\nI'm more than happy to chat and possibly make friends as well. As for potential themes, the sky is the limit, but definitely a healthy dose of action, the dramatic, and anything else we'd like to throw in. I'm more than willing to add romance as well in a MxF setting if it's done right / fits the characters. I play males. Actual gender is of no consequence to me. \n\nI use third person writing and I'd like to do so on Discord. NSFW content is optional and up to your choice, but violence is probably a given. My post length varies on what is going on and what I have to work with. Anywhere from a couple of lines for the more short dialogue type replies to multiple paragraphs for setting a scene or something else important is the range you can expect, but I prefer things to be around a paragraph or so. I like to do rapid-fire style posting when we're both available, but I understand people have busy lives and it's not a requirement by any means.\n\nThanks for the interest! Feel free to send any questions my way if you're potentially interested and don't hesitate to contact me if you are. I'm easy-going and flexible.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm looking someone for a detailed RP in the Forgotten Realms setting. We can cover a myriad of themes, I'm open to go anywhere with it, but I really like the world of Faerun since it is so open. Romance is always fun if it's natural.\n\nForgotten realms is pretty classic fantasy, lots of different races including some more monsterish ones being in civilization at times.\n\n**Classic Adventuring Party** - We can be two members of a classic adventuring party, with a small cast of other members around, after they have dealt with a major crisis. Maybe some have been wounded or cursed. The party will be resting for a while in a city or a small town or even a camp in the wilderness. It would be mostly about inter-party relationships, it can go anywhere really.\n\n**Retired Adventurers** - This idea is a bit odd, basically the party would have a few members of long living races ( Elves ), and some of the short living ones ( Everyone else pretty much ) once they have been through years of adventuring. The more \"Mortal\" members of the party have grown old and the elves are sticking around to keep company to their companions. We can RP either side, although a relationship between a elf and a human could be interesting.\n\n*Horrors in Gloomwrought* - The Shadowfel is a mirror plane of the material dimension where it is always dark and everything is corrupt, it is hard to leave the Shadowfel once you reach it. It is Lovecraftian in ways, otherworldy monsters, cursed ones and undead. In the Shadowfel there is a large city called Gloomwrought, that shifts and changes every night, it is populated with all sorts of horrors and lowlifes, think of an almost Victorian Gothic city, smokey and dark. We could be a couple that has been trapped in the Shadowfel, maybe a Cleric and a Paladin trying to not fall to corruption, while trying to escape. Or even be a pair of Vampire Thralls or Lycanthropes trying to survive in the city. Although I don't enjoy Vampires and Lycanthropes too much.\n\n*Pirates of Chult* - Chult is a jungle region, south of the Shining Sea, a group of Pirates has found a secret cave in one of the rivers that go through the jungle, they have established a base there and have been using it to raid merchant and transport ships that travel the nearby sea. Maybe in one of their raids they find a dangerous and mysterious artifact, there is betrayal and mutiny, there is plenty of ways we can go.\n\n*Mysteries of the Sand in Calimport* - Calimport is a large city at the southernmost point of mainland Faerun, it is surrounded by desert on all sides except the south, were it faces the sea. The city is extremely segregated, divided in walled districts, some of the citizens of the poorer districts never leaved the walls were they were born. Think Aladin and Arabian Nights lots of mystique and magic, extreme punishments and such. We can be anyone, from lowly thieves to Pashas. Something cool would be that one of us is a Djinn, maybe a weakened one, then you literally have Aladin in the Forgotten Realms.\n\nIf you have some other themes in mind I can find a locale that fits them and we can work something out together.\n\nI especially like the idea of pirates or anything in Calimport.",

            "selftext": "**About Me:** I am seeking someone who can give about 3-4 paragraphs and who feels capable of playing Shikamaru Nara against Sakura Haruno. I am open to doubling as Naruto again Ino or Hinata if you want. I would love a post every couple of days, I don't need rapid fire responses by any means but someone who can still keep up a conversation outside of the RP would be nice. Below are some beginning plots, maybe they can combined if you'd like. Thank you for checking this out. I am also capable of playing Ino and Naruto as side roles if need be. Most of these take place in Naruto, as opposed to Shippuden but we would age characters up accordingly.\n\n**Plots:**\n\n**Prompt One:** Sakura and Shikamaru have been friends since they were five though it was a friendship they had agreed to keep secret due to their different groups of friends. As they progressed through the academy, their secret friendship became strained as Shikamaru began hanging out with the boys and Sakura with the girls. Before long, their friendship dissolves and it's been years since they hung out together. Nearing the end of graduation, Shikamaru and Sakura are paired off together for a class project which requires them to make exact clones of one another. Shikamaru and Sakura begin to realize their lost friendship can still be salvaged but now that they're older and have different expectations from their peers, the question is should it be salvaged?\n\n**Prompt Two:** Upon graduating the academy, Team Seven under Kakashi-Sensei consists of Naruto, Sakura and Shikamaru. The trio get along rather well. Shikamaru makes sure Sakura doesn't pick on Naruto too much, while Shikamaru and Naruto are kept in line by Sakura who doesn't let them slack off too much. Meanwhile Sasuke, Ino and Choji make up another team which soon clashes with Team Seven. Still, Team Seven is filled with underdogs and has a lot to prove. Naruto and Shikamaru bond as friends and the more Shikamaru notices Naruto fawning over Sakura, the more he becomes intrigued with the prospect of romance, something he's seldom considered.\n\n**Prompt Three:** Taking place during the two to three year gap when Naruto is gone. Shikamaru confesses to Sakura his feelings for his teammate, Ino. Shikamaru and Sakura decide to start dating in order to make Ino see Shikamaru as serious boyfriend material. Both Sakura and Shikamaru begin pretending to date and it quickly catches the eye of Ino. Shikamaru is visiting the hospital where she and Sakura train under Tsunade, seemingly happy to take Sakura out for lunch. Ino soon confronts Sakura about the sudden romance and Sakura insists it's genuine attraction but Ino isn't so sure. Either Shikamaru or Sakura will soon develop real feelings for the other as feelings become mangled, even more so when Tsunade sends Shikamaru, Ino and Sakura out on a mission together.\n\n**Prompt Four:** Taking place during the two to three year gap when Naruto is gone. Sakura is doing her best to get to the rank of Chunin. She approaches Shikamaru for help and the two begin to train together. Soon Sakura begins bringing Shikamaru lunches in order to repay him for his time spent with her. And eventually she reveals she's play shogi and the two begin to spend more time together but not just on the training grounds. As the next Chunin exam approaches, Sakura is allowed to participate without a team and when she becomes Chunin finally, she and Shiakamaru begin taking missions together.\n\n**Prompt Five:** A different direction is taken as Zabuza has killed Sasuke, leaving Naruto and Sakura to mourn. Naruto turns to Sakura for comfort but instead of finding comfort in him as well, Shikamaru steps forward to help bring Sakua out of her depression. Naruto and Sakura continue to train under Kakashi-Sensei but it is clear this loss has shaken the team to their very foundation. Sakura feels like someone who has lost their identity and she gives up being a ninja. When Shikamaru makes it through to the finals against Temari during the Chunin exams, Sakura goes to cheer for him and by seeing him fight, her fire is lit. She decides to get back to training and Shikamaru elects to be her guiding light.\n\n**Prompt Six:** Everyone knew Shikamaru's home life wasn't perfect. His mother could often be heard yelling at her husband and son endlessly for the smallest of things. No one guessed that the woman could get violent however. Shikamaru never told anyone about the abuse until one day at the park after another confrontation, Sakura spots Shikamaru quite shaken and bruised. The two are nearing the end of their academy days and she offers him some comfort. When Sakura tells her parents of the abuse, they allow Shikamaru to seek refuge at their house for a while. Shiakamru's grades begin to improve as he and Sakura confide in one another and see that appearances can be deceiving.",

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nI've been very interested in setting up a roleplay within the Star Wars universe lately, so I thought I'd see if there were any takers. I'm a college student with free time to burn and a large love for the series. \n\nMy interests are varied, but I'm really interested in something within in the original trilogy / GCW period and also the years beyond it, but other eras may be a possibility such as the Clone Wars. I would prefer to use original characters for this. In terms of the GCW / beyond I am leaning towards the Rebel Alliance / New Republic for a factional allegiance but independents are also an option. Beyond that, though, I'm pretty flexible. I definitely lean to Legends over the current canon.\n\nI have a couple of ideas in mind for a character, but this is something I anticipate to discuss with my partner though, along with a potential direction and things we'd like to include. \n\nI'm more than happy to chat and possibly make friends as well. As for potential themes, the sky is the limit, but definitely a healthy dose of action, the dramatic, and anything else we'd like to throw in. I'm more than willing to add romance as well in a MxF setting if it's done right / fits the characters. I play males. Actual gender is of no consequence to me. \n\nI use third person writing and I'd like to do so on Discord. NSFW content is optional and up to your choice, but violence is probably a given. My post length varies on what is going on and what I have to work with. Anywhere from a couple of lines for the more short dialogue type replies to multiple paragraphs for setting a scene or something else important is the range you can expect, but I prefer things to be around a paragraph or so. I like to do rapid-fire style posting when we're both available, but I understand people have busy lives and it's not a requirement by any means.\n\nThanks for the interest! Feel free to send any questions my way if you're potentially interested and don't hesitate to contact me if you are. I'm easy-going and flexible.",
