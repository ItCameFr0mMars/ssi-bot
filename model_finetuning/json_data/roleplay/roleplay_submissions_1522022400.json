            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have been watching JoJo's Bizzare adventure and thought it would be fun to do one with somebody! With the beauty that are Stands and the powers of Hamon, I feel like there are many possibilities for us!\n\nAs for characters, I always go with making OC characters that have some importance in the overall story. Maybe one of us is a Hamon user that trained with an unknown Hamon Master before the events of Stardust Crusaders or a newly discovered Stand user at the same time.\n\nIf I were to have a stand, it would be called Steel Panther and would produce a stand from similar to Black Panther in humanoid shape. It would have the speed and lethal power of a panther with steel claws. (I know it's pretty shitty but I love steel panther)\n\nThis would be a romance / action story between our two characters. What their goal ends up being is up in the air at the moment but I am sure we can figure it out! \n\nI hope to get some orange envelopes from some of you and then we can have some fun and discuss the bizzare adventure of our two characters!\n\n-Chris",

I've been looking for a good RP partner for a while now and hopefully, I'll find a pretty good one here!\n\nMy RP experience in years is 4, and I thats not all that much, but it should be enough! Right?\n\nI've usually done freeform RP with at times Dice thrown into the mix to determine things. Though I've never done full on DnD.\n\nAt the moment, I'm quite a big fan of a freeform style RP with my character trying to survive in the world with a goal usually developing along the way and said world is determined by the GM! Admittedly though, I'd always be willing to be taught on how to better myself in the GM department.\n\nBut for now, these are the genres I'm interested in, categorized for your handy usage!\n\n\n\n**What I love:** Low Fantasy, Dark, Horror, Medieval, Post Apocalypse.\n\n\n**What I'm interested in trying:** Sci-fi\n\n\n**Not interested in:** Steampunk\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, that narrows it down somewhat. \n\n\nIn RP and as a player, I have no limits on what should happen in it, so you can go all out. Good place to add the mention that NSFW is always fine.\n\n\nHopefully this will interest some of you, but if you have questions or want to talk about setting something up, do feel free to message me on Reddit.

I'll do the usual list business and we can go from there.\n\n**The Me**\n- \n\n* Posts anywhere between 400-2,000 words. Maybe more.\n* LGBTQ friendly and welcoming.\n* Mostly prefer to play Male characters. \n* CST, available often through several mediums.\n* From fantasy to futuristic, I dig it all.\n\n\nI've got a thing for character development, I want diverse characters with different upbringings, alternate points of view and history. All the usual RP rules still apply.\n\n**The You** \n-\n\n* 21+\n* Like that there ' World Building.' And 'Collaboration'. \n*  Hopefully available often, but chill enough to know life happens.\n* Not quite jaded enough to be apathetic about setting up new plots.\n\nMy tastes in storytelling are pretty varied. The only genre that tends to dissuade me is Post Apocalyptic. I'm all zombied and nuked out at this point. I like bumpy relationships, headbutting partnerships and a sense of progression in writing. I like seeing what makes characters tick and I don't mind at all if things burn slowly, but brightly. Bring me the ugly ducklings and oddballs, I'll be into them all the same. \n\nI anticipate a few things from those who contact me. Not that there's an application or something.\n\nFor those who'd like to have me reply with possible ideas, plots, or other various breadcrumbs to start up stories. I ask that you provide some idea of the sort of media / books / what have you that have captured your interest in the past. When you just say Western, I've got Wild Wild West or The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Worlds apart, right ? \n\nI dig way out there themes. Mythical creatures come to life, the handmaidens of deities, the big picture stuff that questions how this big blue ball works. I like off the wall ideas, and odd characters ( even if they're not 'human' or even close. Particularly if they aren't, actually. ) \n\nAnyway. We've drug this on long enough, haven't we ?

            "selftext": "**Hey /roleplay!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\n&gt; I am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\n&gt; I don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n&gt; When it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\n&gt; Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n&gt; This is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n&gt; I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

I lived all my years in that ancient rumor shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury, and yet I began to tire of... conventional extravagance. Singular unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long-buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workmen and... sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt-soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness. In the end, I alone fled, laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity. Until consciousness failed me.\n\nYou remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you, return home, claim your birthright and deliver our family from the ravenous clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon.\"\n\nThank you for reading. This roleplay is a different take on the video game \"Darkest Dungeon\" and gives it a more roleplay feel to it. You are returning home to the town of Haven you once called your own. But years after you left to achieve even greater things, something dark befell your once beloved playground. Driven to raving madness and bloodshed, dark things began to appear, corrupting all but the most sanctimonious of prefectures. The letter you received from your uncle declared you owner of the household, along with two others who have yet to be identified.

            "selftext": "Hi, hello!  Thank you for coming by and checking out my ad.  First things first, a little bit about myself: my name is Edain, but I usually go by rat, Ratmanners, or SleepyDeity.  I'm twenty four years old, happily married, and currently between jobs.  I have a great deal of free time lately because of that, so I'm really interested in making a couple of new friends to RP with!\n\nI've been writing for half my life, although granted I didn't start out all that great.  Now I'm at a place where I feel confident in my writing abilities.  I've been a storyteller for several years, so if you would like me to lead the story I'd be happy to, but sharing or having you lead is fine too!\n\nFor settings I'm a fan of most fantasy and science fiction worlds.  I really enjoy working together to brainstorm original worlds, but pre-established settings like Star Wars, Elder Scrolls, World of Darkness, Forgotten Realms, Firefly, and several more are all near and dear to my heart.\n\nI usually play female characters, but I'm fine with playing males.  Romance is just fine in my book, but I never like to plan for it or force things.  Smut I'd like to keep to a bare minimum, as I don't want it to become the focus of the RP, but it works out great as character development if it comes out naturally and makes sense for the characters.\n\nI think that about covers everything.  If you're interested, hit me up here on Reddit and tell me a little bit about yourself and whay you're interested in.  Add your Discord information and I'll add you so we can discuss things!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am seeking partners for long-term rp covering a variety of genres.\n\n\n**A little about me:** I've been roleplaying in forum/text-based formats for well over a decade now and enjoy actively plotting with people and a variety of character interactions. I'm available evenings (Pacific time) and most weekends.\n\nI like exploring character development and growth and am not afraid of darker or more mature themes, but I like to mix it up and include lighthearted things in my RP as well.\n\nI can play both male and female characters, though lately I have been leaning toward women. I play both straight and m/m or f/f things. And I can play multiple characters within a setting, depending on the needs of the scene(s). \n\n**What I'm looking for:** Someone who enjoys writing and is interested in plotting and developing characters for various ideas. (Also a few fandoms, I'll list those below.)  I'm flexible in terms of length of replies, as sometimes a few lines work better for the situation at hand, but I'd like someone who puts effort into their writing.\n\nedit: Also, please be over 21 - I'm well over that and don't feel comfortable roleplaying with people under 21.\n\n**Ideas:** I've got a few ideas I'd like to explore but I am also happy to explore other ideas and twist these things into something bigger. Having people to collaborate tends to help generate better ideas, I've found. \n\n- Psychological thriller/light horror: two characters wake up in a house with no memory of their past, or of anything, really. They're stuck in the house, as none of the doors seem to open or if they do get outside, they turn and end up right back in the bedroom. As time goes on, they develop an intense dependency on each other and are struggling to escape. \n\n- Through various universe mishaps, multiple characters end up planet-hopping through time while trying to get back home. Think of it as the Odyssey is space. \n\nOther ideas/themes: I love sci-fi settings and general fantasy settings; I'm currently big on Warcraft lore so something set in that would be awesome. Not so into modern/urban fantasy but I am honestly open to the possibility. \n\n**Fandoms**: While I'm currently feeling OCs more than fandom characters, I have rp'd Spock from Star Trek (both TOS and the new movies), Diana Prince from Wonder Woman/BvS/JL, a few Star Wars characters, and probably others that I'm forgetting. Would be happy to discuss storylines with them. \n(And a Star Trek-set thing would be awesome, too. Especially with OCs.)\n\nDiscord, hangouts, and/or email would be my preferred format but google docs works well. \n\n",

            "selftext": "Hiya. I'm looking for a few RP partners to write with over on Discord. I'm quite flexible in terms of genres, although I do have mild preferences. What I am in the mood for is an engaging, twisty plot and depending on what it is I'm okay with it being short-term or long-term. \n\n* I write anywhere from 1-5 paragraphs, my starters usually being the most lengthy and shorter replies more common during a more quick-paced scenario. I expect my partner to be well past the beginning stages of writing, but certainly don't need novel-length replies.\n* I prefer writing past-tense 3rd person. \n* Open to any genre that I feel I can do justice to, but I have a soft spot for modern, modern fantasy, paranormal romance, romance in general, crime, and (post) apocalypse. Open to sci-fi, high fantasy, or anything I haven't mentioned if we can work up an interesting plot.\n* I'm going to have a little more time in the next week or two, so even better if you're in PST time - we can fire off multiple replies a day.\n* I pretty much always like romance to have a presence, so sorry if that's not really your cup of tea.\n* Speaking of which, I'm on board with smut, but it should be organic.\n* If we start RPing and I'm not really feeling it, I'll be sure to let you know. And if you don't feel like it's your cup of tea, my feelings won't be hurt. Better to be honest than just ghosting each other, yes?\n* Would be cool if you were at least 21+, anything younger feels a bit too young to be writing potential romantic themes.\n\n\nA few prompts I've been craving - * **also open to your ideas or plots!** *\n\n&gt;*Prompt 1: [Futuristic] [Mild sci-fi] [Mystery]*\n\nFeeling something in the realm of Ex Machina and Westworld. My character is a top of the line android, one of the most expensive prototypes to have existed, and one of the most humanoid in both physical makeup and AI. However, any known androids had been decommissioned in the last two years, and any leftover machine parts had been broken apart and liquidated by the sole company and producer of said androids, after an untimely attack on a civilian by one of their most lauded products. Someone took her and hid her amongst a pile of rubble in what is now known as a wasteland of thieves, smugglers, rouges in the vast desert lands of the Nevada. It could be because she was known to have real consciousness and the accomplishments of this particular android was too valuable to give up. Maybe her makers wanted to keep her to further production at some point. Maybe she was kept as a potential weapon to be developed. Your character (scavenger? bounty hunter? government official?) comes across her, reanimates her, and maybe word gets out she's still in tact. Cue hunters, shadowy organizations, and plenty of violence. \n\n\n&gt; *Prompt 2: [Noir] [Assassins] [Crime]*\n\nSet in modern days, both of our characters are hired assassins employed by rival crimelords of a large city that has seen better days. I\u2019d imagine the setting to be a lot like Sin City, rampant with drug use, criminals, and violence. Citizens are at the mercy of the corrupt major and his underlings, who all have been equally influenced by the two crimelords who up until now have had equal footing in terms of playing the major\u2019s right hand man. Both of them find an opportunity when it is discovered who their each most valuable assets are: their hired hands. My character\u2019s employer sends her on a mission to find and dispose of your character, who is tasked with the same assignment of finding her before she does him. They both have files and information on the other but we won\u2019t know how everything will play out until they meet. Of course, your character\u2019s motives and backgrounds are up to you. For this one realistically, our characters should really be no younger than mid-twenties.\n\n&gt; *Prompt 3: [Time travel] [Open-ended] [Fantasy]*\n\nThis one is more open-ended in terms of direction. We could chat endlessly about the possibilities, but the only starting point I got so far is that my character is from modern day, purchases an antique artifact from a dingy thrift store, and one night gets transported back in time to whatever era it is we want to play in. I think it'd be fun if there was also a presence of fantasy in said era. Feudal Japan, filled with demons and magic? The Middle Ages, with dragons and waged wars? During the Trojan war, in the midst of Greek gods and goddesses? Whenever and wherever it is, I'm sure we can come up with something fun. \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\n ",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am writing this to seek out one new writing partner. I have embarked on the long and arduous journey towards a PhD, which will limit my availability considerably. But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nI'd like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. I would also love a Dragon Age Inquisition plot. I'm no expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed the game.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started",

            "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019m looking for a Skyrim roleplay, and I\u2019m hoping you are too! Or it appeals to you, once you\u2019ve read through my ideas. But first, a bit about me:\n\n* I\u2019m 16\n* I write 3 paragraphs and above, longer in descriptive scenes and often shorter in dialogue. I like to be descriptive and give you a lot to play off, but I don\u2019t like writing filler for the sake of it.\n* I write story style and 3rd person, but I can do 1st if you prefer.\n* I\u2019m absolutely happy to talk outside of the roleplay, and I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a friendly person! But if you\u2019re one for roleplay and no OOC, that\u2019s fine!\n* I don\u2019t write self inserts, but I\u2019m fine playing with yours! I do often play as women, just because I enjoy it.\n* I would prefer to write either over Reddit PMs or on a subreddit we make.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for:\n\n* Someone who writes 2 paragraphs and above for general replies.\n* Someone who writes \u2018story style\u2019, so no italics.\n* Someone who can help keep a story going.\n\n**My Skyrim Ideas**\n\nTHE DRAGONBORN\u2019S SHADOW\n\nThe Dragonborn wakes to four people on that cart. And one of them is a Dunmer. I want to play the Dunmer, a mute young woman who latches onto the Dragonborn and tries to follow them everywhere. Whether your character accepts her easily or tries to lose her at every corner is up to you, but I\u2019d be excited to try and explore how they\u2019d communicate.\n\nMURDERER IN THE MAKING\n\nRiften is a less than reputable place at the best of times, but there\u2019s not much murder at least. You assume the skinny, tired looking girl behind you is planning to pickpocket you, too na\u00efve to realise you\u2019ve already spotted her.\n\t\nThat is until she pulls out the knife.\n\n\u201cScream, or I\u2019ll gut you.\u201d\n\n*Or?*\n\nA MODERN MIND\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t mind who I play, but this idea is all about wish fulfilment. Who hasn\u2019t wanted to fall into their favourite game? This is pretty much that. A modern person falls into Skyrim and has to deal with all the problems that come with that.\n\nYOUR AVERAGE SKYRIM RP\n\nOur characters meet at a tavern, something goes from there!\n\n**DONE**\n\nOkay, that\u2019s it!\n\nIf you have any ideas too, I\u2019d be excited to hear them.

No canon, not for mwa.\n\nSo I am a hopeless romantic. I know, ugh, it is truly awful, but I am and love to involve romance in my roleplays. I want the relationship to be like something from The Mindy Project! Where my character would be like Mindy and yours like Danny. They have a teasing relationship - poking at one another constantly, joking around, and later on admitting they have grown feelings for one another. Basically just like friends that eventually fall for one another but don't want to ruin the friendship so they try and deny it. -3- They will also work in the same place! In the series, they are all Obstetrician/Gynecologists (OB/GYN) but ours don't have to work there! It just is a little fun idea. :)\n\n**Heads Up** I roleplay mostly in third person, so if I do first person with you, you must be special. I also only roleplay with literates. :) Thanks hun!!\n\nI am open to other roleplays, clean or mixed, but mainly wanting something story driven. That does not mean we have to keep the smutty bits out! I enjoy those too. :) I roleplay on a variety of platforms. Kik, discord, hangouts, etc. Just message me with what you want to roleplay on and what your character is like so I can see if we click. Toodles! \ud83d\udc96\n\nEdit : you don't have to know what the Mindy Project is. It was just an example!",

            "selftext": "[Finite Incantatem](http://incantatem.jcink.net/)\n\nFinite Incantatem is an AU, non-canon (OC's only) roleplay based around the magical world presented in Harry Potter books and movies.  Set in near-present day, the foundation of our plot stems from real-life world events and political happenings, all of which have affected the wizarding and Muggle worlds, alike.\n\nThe current year is 2022.  Following an attack on the city of Paris, France, non-magic folk are on high alert, under the guise that the perpetrators behind the violence are terrorists.  The true masterminds behind the plot, however, are a group of up-and-coming blood purists calling themselves the \"Death Eaters.\"  As the underground group is currently infiltrating the French Ministry of Magic and local media, blaming the chaotic, politically-divided Muggle world has never been easier, and pushing their anti non-wizarding agenda on the rest of the wizarding world to gain sympathizers is child's play.\n\nIn hopes of retaining some semblance of unity, the International Confederation of Wizards has announced the Inter Scholastic Competition (ISC) for the school year.  Students in their fourth years and up at Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, and Ilvermorny may travel to the host school, Hogwarts, and compete in various competitions to earn their schools points and earn the glory of being named the champion school.  In addition to that, the ISC has developed the Scholastic Program for Excellence, Long Lasting Cooperation, and Radical Achievement for the Future Tournament (or SPELLCRAFT, for short), a prestigious competition in which a male and female champion over the age of 16 is selected to represent and compete for their school.\n\nWill the ISC be enough to mend the wounds of the tragedy that occurred the summer prior to the start of the school year?  Will the generations of students in attendance be influenced and moved enough by the camaraderie and integration to become examples to the scores of divided, torn, and warring adults - including their own parents? Is it merely serving as a distraction from a trick up someone's sleeve?  Only time will tell...\n\nJoin us in our most exciting year yet, and find out for yourselves!\n\nWho we are &amp; what we offer:\n\n\u2726 Now on Jcink Premium!\n\n\u2726 All-inclusive: age, gender identity, LGBTQ+ friendly - RPers and characters alike!\n\n\u2726 Two active, friendly admins with years of admin/mod experience across a variety of platforms (Avidgamers, Acornrack, Spleafnet, Invisionfree, Proboards, Jcink)\n\n\u2726 Open and active since August 2016, and still going strong with no plan on slowing down!\n\n\u2726 A sandbox plot - we've provided the foundation, and now we want OUR MEMBERS to determine what happens next, thanks to their characters and plots!\n\n\u2726 Original characters only - no canons allowed.  We do, however, have a long list of fun and exciting member-created adoptables up for grabs!  Jumpstart yourself with an instant plot with another character's family member, friend, romantic interest, classmate, etc.!\n\n\u2726 A load of popular FC's and coveted roles and positions of power up for grabs!\n\n\u2726 For the students: four schools to choose from and play at, with a long list of sports, clubs, and activities to choose from.  And if we don't have it?  Create it!  We love suggestions!\n\n\u2726 For the adults: all of the wizarding communities around Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, and Ilvermorny...and then some!

I am up for it though, if we have a good plot. Speaking of plots, I have some ideas but would love to hear your ideas as well. I am okay with using either Reddit PM or kik.

            "selftext": "Hello Redditors;\n\nMarshmallowmancer here. I've scoured this great, wide internet looking for the best of the best roleplaying partners, and while I have some great ones, I'm always looking to add more variety to my little cabal, so I've come here, to the Front Page of the Internet (tm) to see what I can find. **I am looking for something very specific,** so please make sure you read my post in its entirety before messaging me. \n\n**A little about me:**\nI'm a mature RPer - both in terms of age and content. I've been at this for over 25 years in various forms - from tabletop to chatrooms to instant messenger, and I like to think that I have an aptitude for it. I've also been, at various points of my adult life, a professional writer and English teacher, so you can expect a level of quality that ranges from decent to exceptional depending on the day (and my mood, which flip flops more than I care to admit).\n\n**What I Expect:**\nWhile I am forgiving of all styles, levels, and quality of RP and am not judgmental of anyone who does not write/roleplay the same way I do, I am at the point in my RPing career that I am looking for someone who can, more or less, match my quality of writing. I know this is going to sound haughty and arrogant, but I would like only **highly literate** roleplayers who are confident in their ability to share in descriptive and storytelling duties. I would also like someone who understands that a post\u2019s length is not indicative of its quality. I don't expect a novel for every post - I don't even expect a dissertation or even a five-paragraph essay. I appreciate the power of a short, punchy post every now and then, as long as it's done with care and in appropriate places. I also understand that life is a thing that happens, and life is more important than RP, and I would rather have shorter posts than no posts at all. So in terms of length, I prefer quality over frequency over length...if that makes any sense.\n\nThat being said, I am not perfect and I do not expect you to be. I am forgiving of mistakes, typos, etc., as long as they are the exception and not the rule. I want to set the bar high, but don\u2019t be afraid of me beating you to death with it.\n\n**What I'm Looking For:**\nAs I said before, I am looking for something very specific in terms of RP. Please *only* reply if you are interested in one or more of the following, or if you have in mind something similar.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am looking for romance - two characters interacting, building a relationship, and falling in love. I want something tender and sweet. Secondly, I am looking for someone who isn't doesn\u2019t shy away from mature content. I don't like to fade to black for sex. That being said, it doesn't need to be - nor should it be - all sex all the time. I would like some form of arc to the story, character development, conflict, resolution, all that good stuff. I don\u2019t want to blow through everything to get to the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d The joy is in the journey! \n\nThe running theme here is an element of TG (transgender), either in terms of my playing a transgender woman or a man transformed into a woman, or somewhere in the middle (with speedier/less complex methods of medical transitioning). Please only reply if you are willing to play a straight male character. I have my fill of playing opposite female characters for the time being. Please include the word \u201cmarshmallow\u201d in your reply so I know you\u2019ve read this far.\n\nA few example ideas/prompts that I've had to get the creative juices flowing:\n* Two characters, friends as kids, are separated when one of them moves away. They reconnect in college after years of sparse interaction on the internet, but one of the friends (my character) had begun their transition and is presenting as female. The cis/straight male (your character) has to come to terms with the idea that they may be falling for their old friend. Variations on this could be the two characters having fallen out of touch so your character wouldn\u2019t know that the woman they just met is their old friend.\n* Your character is a doctor or a doctor\u2019s aide/nurse/grad student/intern/janitor working on a revolutionary new hormone treatment that helps trans patients transition over weeks/months instead of years. My character applies and the two begin to fall for each other as your character helps mine adapt.\n* (for a bit more of a fantastical flavor): Your character discovers a genie bottle. Knowing their childhood friend has always wished they were a woman, but was unable to transition, they use one of their wishes to grant their desire. A variation would be that my character discovers the bottle and through magical shenanigans *becomes* the genie, beholden to your character.\n\nIf you can think of something along these lines that you\u2019re interested in that you think would interest me, by all means, feel free to run them past me. As long as I can play a transgender woman, I am fairly likely to acquiesce. \n\nTo contact me, please send me a message on Reddit. We can discuss the finer details here.\n\nSo that\u2019s it! You made it! Thank you for reading my request and I look forward to meeting some very interesting people! ",

            "selftext": "Hello night owls and people that possibly see this during the day time! I'm looking for a long term partner to develop a world with me off of a starter or two I've created, if you happen to like them. If not we can work off something you've made or have been thinking of, I'm open to new ideas! All I really ask for is that you're literate, more so grammatically then matching length. (Cause lets be real here there are some scenes where it's dialogue heavy and there's no way for us to write 2-3 paragraphs.)\n\nAll I ask is that you're patient with me considering I'm mainly awake nights due to my job, and at said job I've been working 10-12 hour shifts recently. Note I will also not budge on Discord, it's the easiest thing for me to use when I switch from computer to phone for messages. (Also prefer if you're actually female but if not it's no big deal.) Also please please be 18+ if you're wanting to do smut whatsoever. (And I'd like it to only be in the roleplay if it's co-aligns with what we both want to do.)\n\nI'll basically do anything as long as it has some kind of fantasy element, and I won't do horror. Sorry I'm just really bad at writing for that genre. \n\nPM if you're interested, if it takes me a moment to respond I apologise. :)",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone and welcome to my little corner. As stated above, I am looking for some partners.\n\nSo, a little about myself. I'm well into my twenties and have a rather busy life. So, to be straight forward, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to reply numerous times, or even every, day. But I will do my best. I'm returning from a rather large break in my role play life, which started in the early 2000's. I haven't kept it strictly online, though, as I have also participated in table tops AND LARP. However, the last time I have done anything of the kind was a little over a year ago, and I have had an even longer break from writing. Needless to say, I am quite rusty. Don't worry though. With some help, I can clean it off and we'll get some good things going.\n\nI'm looking for someone who is open to many things and doesn't shy away from the darker aspects. I believe the darker the better, the more it can allow for plot to thicken, for our characters to grow. With how morbid, twisted, violent and bloody things can get, I would definitely say that the gore-aspect alone is NSFW. Which, in turn, leads us the sexual themes. I want someone who will not make this the focus of our role play. I don't want someone who will force it. However, if it fits with plot, or our characters, I do not want such tender moments to be faded out. Every aspect is important for development. I want long term partners. But I understand that is a little more difficult to find. If you get bored, don't ghost me, talk to me, and we can either do something to change it with our current role play, or even start something new! If my writing style does not fit with you, just let me know. I won't be hurt. I would rather know why you no longer wish to role play with me. \n\nAll of this being said, I don't have anything specific in mind. There are a few plot ideas, but nothing major. So don't be shy. If you have something, let me know. If you don't, and I sound like a match for you, message me and we can brainstorm something - or I could spill what I have. Either way, we can give this a shot. I am open to playing just about any type of character, male, female, something in between. I am open to you GMing, however, I have little experience in this and am not quite ready to do it myself. So, again, message me. But if you do, and to make sure you read this all, please tell me your favorite desert, so I know. One last thing here, please, nobody under eighteen.\n\nThank you for reading.

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nSo what is Voodoopunk? Well it's exactly what it sounds like, if you're a fan of \"The Dolls of New Albion\" and the other installations of the New Albion saga by Paul Shapera you'll know that it's a subculture religion, based primarily around worshiping the dead; singing songs that the dolls transmit and partying. \n\nIf you're not familiar with New Albion, let me set the scene. New Albion is a city unlike any other. It's a fantastical place where the science is iffy, magic is real, and the dead can be summoned up and placed inside dolls made of gears, screens and powered by electricity. Throughout the New Albion saga we follow the adventures of various citizens, though different eras (Steampunk, Dieselpunk and Atompunk) and throughout each the Voodoopunks are always there.\n\nBUT we don't need to play strictly canon, we can make this our own story, let's have fun with this! I have a few different ideas we can fool around with and work something out!\n\nAs far as what I'm looking for, I can usually post a lot in a day, if I know I won't be able to post I usually make an effort to post two or three long and detailed posts. I'm usually able to post multiple times a day; I do function on the East Coast timezone, so if there's a delay or if we're in different places let's just make that a known fact and we can figure it out as we go along!\n\nSo nitty gritty, I'm okay with violence, drugs, dark themes (we're dealing with voodoo, dead things and haunted automatons) as far as romance goes I'll only play MxM pairings, but nothing forced. I'm all up for playing with anyone so please feel free to message me on here, I also have Discord!",

We have virtual dice, rolling 1d20, and plenty of monsters.\n \nA main story that we want to last as long as possible.\n \nJoin as a fellow GM to monitor battles, and influence events. Edit mechanics, and authorize the creative desires of players.\n \nI\u2019ve got mechanics set up, and have been playing privately with some close friends, but they\u2019re not dedicated and would rather play some FPS. Lame -\n \nI\u2019m getting into this, because I\u2019m tired of my games ending, or getting too repetitive. With a story crafted by words - - it can be endlessly expanded upon at our desire.\n \nWe can always use magic to warp reality to change mechanics, or balance out a clearly OP character.\n \nLooking for bar tenders, town guards, vendors - - GMs, and heroes! Villains too : )\n \n_______________________________________\nA bit of backstory: Right now, in the world of Rej\u2019Aran, the flesh god has finally made his move after decades. He only appears once every ten years, but only chooses a location that certain types of people can reach - - disabling cultists or common folk from discovering truths.\n \nThis year, he chose an easily accessible location, and cultists swarmed at the chance to fell the flesh god. These vile cultists worship a much more prominent god known as \u201cBalithet\u201d. He is omnipotent, and ever controlling - - with most of the world worshiping him. Balithet is also a god of change, and metamorphic ability. Causing some of his most devoted followers to become disfigured beasts of torment.\n \nBalithet may be largely omnipotent, but this is not technically true, as the only being he does not know about entirely is the only other known god to exist. The flesh deity. The god among man - - and this lack of knowledge drives him mad.\n  \nThat is why he willed his followers to the flesh god\u2019s next location. Only to find that it was a ploy by a skin-man, a follower of the flesh. As soon as this skin-man appeared posing as the man-god himself.. he was stabbed, and this action proved to him, and witnesses that Balithet was afraid of the Flesh God, and that in of itself, *proved* that the Flesh God was real.\n \nEnraged, Balithet converted his cultists into monsters who began murdering anyone who witnessed the event; in order to avoid word escaping, and most importantly - - to snuff out danger before it became too imposing, he also has beasts guarding the perimeter of the town.\n _______________________________\n \nThis is a fantasy RP game, complete with stats, skill trees, and crafting - - but I need help refining the game!\n\nhttps://t.me/RejAranRP",

So I've decided to re-do this advertisement, as I probably didn't make clear what was intended with this community.\n\nFirst of all, I have a table-top group playing Kingmaker. Kingmaker is a Pathfinder Adventure Path where the players build a nation. If you are in Atlanta, or will soon be, and want to join the TBT game, feel free to respond.\n\nHowever, this ad is aimed at people who are online who might want to participate in a different kind of way.\n\nOnline players will join the Citizens Group on our discord, after a small application process. They will have character levels, classes, and assets/holdings within the game world. Using an economy bot, they will be able to work within the game world, or they can use their money to invest and start businesses.\n\nThe proceeds from all this work can be used to influence the player characters, or even, to actively plot against them. If a Democratic Society is established, you guys will be able to form political parties and put forward candidates. However the major leadership roles must be maintained by TBT PCs.\n\nSo, yeah, its a bit interesting and new. However, soon we will be providing session by session reports about the state of the Kingdom and on-going happenings.\n\nIt should be tons of fun! PM me today!\n",

            "selftext": "Hiya. This is gonna be long...so I apologize. Feel free to skip to the bottom if it's too much. \n\n**About Me**\n\nI've been RPing for several years, back in the old Yahoo chat RP Room days. Lately, I've been lurking in r/Roleplay looking for partners. I have a few RP partners but I would really like someone that can be consistent. I understand life gets in the way, it happens with me, but I would like to have that communication so I know you're just busy, and not ghosting. \n\n**Who and What I RP**\n\nI'm female, but I RP both males and females. I have no issues when it comes to sexuality so I can do FxF, MxM, MxF, I can even do OT3's depending on the context and if the relationship is appropriate for the storyline. Even though I play males and females, lately I've been stuck RPing as a male so I would really like a chance to play a female. I have premade characters that fit in storylines or settings but I also love making new characters. Also when it comes to characters, I love playing multiple characters. I don't want our characters to feel as if they are in a fishbowl, with just the two of them interacting. I like a very immersive world. I also play very diverse characters so if you have issues with characters being certain races, then I probably won't be a good partner for you. \n\nI RP all settings. Lately I've been in modern and modern fantasy settings. The only settings I'm not good at is high fantasy (Elves, LoTR type stuff), intense science fiction, and steampunk. Nothing against those settings but I don't know anything about them. If you're more knowledgeable and can give me some explanations, or can be patient with my mess ups I'm more than willing to be a part of them. \n\nI'm fine with smut, mature, NSFW, or other things that might be upsetting. I do have my limits on certain subjects and I do have my definite NO's. I prefer smut after a storyline, or smut with a purpose. But if I get to know you and I am comfortable with you and our RP relationship then I'm a little more flexible. \n\nI rp in 3rd person, past tense. I would feel more comfortable if my partner RPs in third person too. \n\n**My Plot Ideas**\n\nI'd like to preface this by saying I'm not \"actively\" looking for these settings. I would prefer we plan something together so you don't feel like you have to fit in my settings and I want you to have some input and feel comfortable. These are just some universes that I have made, that I've done with other people and they really like them! So if you would like to RP in these universe settings. I say setting because it's not an active \"plot\" but rather something that is going on around our characters. I have several \"premade\" characters that are in these settings that might show up but I can always make new characters to fit to your interests/desires. \n\n\n&gt; The Fall [modern fantasy] [any genre] [has NSFW themes]\n\nHeaven and Hell finally had the battle from their prophecy. Heaven lost. Heaven collapsed and now angels live along with humans and the increase in Hell's power has allowed 'vents' or openings into the human world. Demons walk among humans, manipulating the people around them for more power. Some humans want to harness that power for their own gain. Angels known as the Convergence pride themselves in their pure angelic blood and want to stay out of human affairs and focus on rebuilding Heaven while fighting over who can be the new God. Angels that survived might have been plagued by demonic energy, which have corrupted them with dark powers while also eating away at them like a parasite. Guardian angels hope to still protect their human charges. Despite all this turmoil in Heaven and Hell, human life continues as normal, at least to those who don't seem to notice...\n\n\n&gt; A Voyage [dystopian] [any genre]\n\nIn a large world, regions seem to never interact with each other. The age of exploration cannot exist because regions have many different climates and environments that inhabitants of others cannot overcome. The only ones brave to explore the environments are mercenaries, warriors, or explorers with the right technology. Many regions have precious resources that could be used in other places and there are many nations that will pay a high price for someone to go on that near-death mission to get them. Despite the rough terrain and hostile landscape, abandoned machines have achieved sentience and interact in the most hostile of the areas. They serve as the flora and fauna of desolated tundras or sweltering deserts. Besides them, the only other surviving race is a small group of nomads, who read the stars and can navigate and survive anywhere. Their biology is a mystery, and they seem to get along with all nations with little to no hostile interactions. Their skin is rumored to possess a map, which if you look underneath, will tell you the secrets of the world. There are people willing to pay a big price for their skin, but there are also many who wish to protect them. \n\n\n&gt; The World Above [dystopian] [any genre]\n\nThe government has spoken. The city is too dangerous. Too much crime, too many violent acts being committed. The government's solution: build the city on stilts. Those who are wealthy enough, affluent enough, and important enough are allowed residence in the Raised City. The weak, the poor, the undesirable, are left underneath--without sunlight, with limited access to resources, and without any policing. The city underneath is at the mercy of any bandits, although many good Samaritans have started a small militia, recruiting from as early as high school. Pollution, failed science experiments, and inhumane medical treatment has led to mutations in the population. Some want an uprising, others just want to make their city a better place, others want power. \n\n\n\nAnyway, this was probably long. Thank you if you read this far, but if you just opened this and closed it immediately...I can't blame you. If you're interested in RPing with me, send me a PM! ",

I've been into collaborative writing for about just as long and find it rewarding and fun.\n\nI'm seeking someone who enjoys chatting and plotting OOC and who likes to write anything ranging from sci-fi to horror and anything in between. I'm a fan of romance, but I don't like it being the forefront of my stories, but rather the icing on the cake, so I'd love it to be a part of what we create but it doesn't always have to happen. If it does occur, please let it be organic.\n\nI'd love to bounce ideas back and forth with you, and to note: I dig historical settings, but will do any setting. I don\u2019t do much canon work, but will easily attempt to, especially anything Game of Thrones related. I also write as Poison Ivy and Catwoman. I love drama, and anything with lots of angst and feelings. \n\nI typically play females seeing as to how I'm just better at it, though I'm not opposed to trying new things. I only write F+M romance and F+F romance. Also, I love screaming about our characters and creating things for us to enjoy such as playlists and graphics.\n\nI write third person, para/novella form and tend to reply quickly! I'd also like to write through email, but can do discord. I'm looking for partners who enjoy writing and won't do one liners, unless we are both feeling it that day. I'm on EST time zone, as well, and want my partner to at least be over 18 seeing as to how I'm a millennial.\n\nI'd love to hear from you! PM me here if you\u2019re interested or ha e questions.\n\nInterest: post apocalyptic, medieval, modern, sci fi, horror, forbidden romance, wrong side of the tracks, Batman.",

Characters and the exact setting can be decided once we're actually in communication. I have a few ideas. When it comes to characters, I prefer original ones, but if you want to play someone canonical, and so long as it makes sense within our story, I won't disapprove.\n\nDetail wise, my standards fluctuate. If we're on a dialogue-heavy scene, then short replies make sense, whereas if there's action and/or drama, posts should be much more detailed. Also, I can adapt easily to 1st or 3rd person, even though I prefer 3rd more. It's up to you which one we go with.\n\nWhen it comes to your gender (or your character's gender, rather) - anything is fine: male, female, or transgender, I'm equally open to all of them. Personally, I'm male, I play male, not much else to it. So, with all that out of the way...I invite anyone to PM me. I can't wait to, hopefully, get something started.",

            "selftext": "Hello Redditors;\n\nMarshmallowmancer here. I've scoured this great, wide internet looking for the best of the best roleplaying partners, and while I have some great ones, I'm always looking to add more variety to my little cabal, so I've come here, to the Front Page of the Internet (tm) to see what I can find. **I am looking for something very specific,** so please make sure you read my post in its entirety before messaging me. \n\n**A little about me:**\n\nI'm a mature RPer - both in terms of age and content. I've been at this for over 25 years in various forms - from tabletop to chatrooms to instant messenger, and I like to think that I have an aptitude for it. I've also been, at various points of my adult life, a professional writer and English teacher, so you can expect a level of quality that ranges from decent to exceptional depending on the day (and my mood, which flip flops more than I care to admit).\n\n**What I Expect:**\n\nWhile I am forgiving of all styles, levels, and quality of RP and am not judgmental of anyone who does not write/roleplay the same way I do, I am at the point in my RPing career that I am looking for someone who can, more or less, match my quality of writing. I know this is going to sound haughty and arrogant, but I would like only **highly literate** roleplayers who are confident in their ability to share in descriptive and storytelling duties. I would also like someone who understands that a post\u2019s length is not indicative of its quality. I don't expect a novel for every post - I don't even expect a dissertation or even a five-paragraph essay. I appreciate the power of a short, punchy post every now and then, as long as it's done with care and in appropriate places. I also understand that life is a thing that happens, and life is more important than RP, and I would rather have shorter posts than no posts at all. So in terms of length, I prefer quality over frequency over length...if that makes any sense.\n\nThat being said, I am not perfect and I do not expect you to be. I am forgiving of mistakes, typos, etc., as long as they are the exception and not the rule. I want to set the bar high, but don\u2019t be afraid of me beating you to death with it.\n\n**What I'm Looking For:**\n\nAs I said before, I am looking for something very specific in terms of RP. Please *only* reply if you are interested in one or more of the following, or if you have in mind something similar.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am looking for romance - two characters interacting, building a relationship, and falling in love. I want something tender and sweet. Secondly, I am looking for someone who isn't doesn\u2019t shy away from mature content. I don't like to fade to black for sex. That being said, it doesn't need to be - nor should it be - all sex all the time. I would like some form of arc to the story, character development, conflict, resolution, all that good stuff. I don\u2019t want to blow through everything to get to the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d The joy is in the journey! \n\nThe running theme here is an element of TG (transgender), either in terms of my playing a transgender woman or a man transformed into a woman, or somewhere in the middle (with speedier/less complex methods of medical transitioning). Please only reply if you are willing to play a straight male character. I have my fill of playing opposite female characters for the time being. Please include the word \u201cmarshmallow\u201d in your reply so I know you\u2019ve read this far.\n\nA few example ideas/prompts that I've had to get the creative juices flowing:\n\n* Two characters, friends as kids, are separated when one of them moves away. They reconnect in college after years of sparse interaction on the internet, but one of the friends (my character) had begun their transition and is presenting as female. The cis/straight male (your character) has to come to terms with the idea that they may be falling for their old friend. Variations on this could be the two characters having fallen out of touch so your character wouldn\u2019t know that the woman they just met is their old friend.\n\n* Your character is a doctor or a doctor\u2019s aide/nurse/grad student/intern/janitor working on a revolutionary new hormone treatment that helps trans patients transition over weeks/months instead of years. My character applies and the two begin to fall for each other as your character helps mine adapt.\n\n* (for a bit more of a fantastical flavor): Your character discovers a genie bottle. Knowing their childhood friend has always wished they were a woman, but was unable to transition, they use one of their wishes to grant their desire. A variation would be that my character discovers the bottle and through magical shenanigans *becomes* the genie, beholden to your character.\n\nIf you can think of something along these lines that you\u2019re interested in that you think would interest me, by all means, feel free to run them past me. As long as I can play a transgender woman, I am fairly likely to acquiesce. \n\nTo contact me, please send me a message on Reddit. We can discuss the finer details here.\n\nSo that\u2019s it! You made it! Thank you for reading my request and I look forward to meeting some very interesting people! \n\n",

            "selftext": "*Hey there, looking for a long term, story driven adventure in an OC universe. The RP is PM-only for the time being. This is admittedly inspired by various mecha anime, but I've been working on it for a while to make it as original as I could. Come explore with me!*\n\nHuman controlled universe has been divided between various factions, ranging from Teracorporations to self styled empires. Factions mean conflict and without at least a semblance of control, conflict would end in annihilation of planets, deaths of billions and perhaps the extinction of the human race, either by its own hand, or by a xenos culture.\n\nThe United Galctic Peace Corps, while thinly spread and permanently overworked, manage to maintain enough of a control to enforce the conventions such as bans on planetary destruction weapons. The one advantage that lets them do this - technology. The pinnacle of this technology which even the most developed of factions are unable to replicate are special battle suits and mecha.\n\nTwo UGPC suit / mecha specialists (perhaps an idealistic rookie and a bitter veteran?) are sent on a variety of missions based on a recent discovery that could doom humanity forever.\n\n*NSFW for potential adult themes of all kinds, my writing style can be quite gritty. Then again, you wouldn't want to be caught writing silly stories about robots in space at work either, would you? :P*",

            "selftext": "**[I have received a number of replies and am working on my responses. If you already wrote me, I will be responding. But I'm not looking for more people at this time. Thank you to everyone who read and thought about my little adventure write up. Lots of love. Now to get busy responding to the four people who already wrote me.]**\n\nI may suck as a story teller; if so I'm sorry in advance, but let me describe or at least hint at what I'm looking for.\n\nIn this role play, I intend to act in the role of Story Teller and take you on an epic adventure in a fantasy world of my own creation. While I have strong ideas for this world, I expect you will help me flesh it out as we play. It\u2019s be a combination of fully fleshed out, literate multiple-paragraph scenes combined with more direction oriented CYOA scenes that aren\u2019t as fleshed out.\n\nThe story is intended to be epic in scope with your character growing from powerful to very powerful and slowly gaining control of the world around him or her. The power level will be cinematic rather than realistic, but below \u201csuper hero\u201d power levels. While I\u2019ll be incorporating a few \u201cgame like\u201d elements to help in the creation of your character, I won\u2019t be rolling dice and we won\u2019t be following a \u201cgame system.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019ll be literary story telling with the character creation game elements helping me to gain a sense of where you might like your character to go. There will be adult content, but not graphic content. In other words, I\u2019ll summarize or fade to black intimate scenes. I won\u2019t be writing out long, detailed sex scenes for instance. But it will be a world with good and evil and twisted characters where all sorts of things can happen, so I welcome input on things you specifically want to avoid. I\u2019ll respect your limits.\n\nIn the beginning, it may be that your character or non-player characters may be in their teens. In that case, characters are all pure and magically protected from any inappropriate content until they turn eighteen. There doesn\u2019t have to be sexual content. It\u2019s just I hope to create an open world where all sorts of things can happen in a non-graphic sense.\n\nIf interested, distribute 25 points in the following categories (just take a guess, but you can think of most normal people being in the 1 to 2 range, while you\u2019ll average 3).\n\n*Status 0 through 5*\n\n\n*Body 0 through 5*\n\n*Mental 0 through 5*\n\n*Presence 0 through 5*\n\n*Appearance 0 through 5*\n\n*Skills 0 through 5*\n\n*Wealth 0 through 5*\n\n*Retainers 0 through 5*\n\n\nIf you want a hint about the setting, think \u201csilk road\u201d, trade, families, Chinese dramas, a heavy Asian influence, trade cities, empires, wuxia, martial arts, swords, assassins, intrigue, striving for power, treachery.\n\nI\u2019m probably going to just try this with one or two people. I\u2019ll be doing it mainly through Reddit PMs, but we might think about email or some other non-IM based system like Google Docs, once we both know that we\u2019re enjoying this.\n\nYou\u2019ll help influence your character based on your stat choices, gender choice (open to any gender, not FUTA, and any sexual orientation), and tell me like three to five words descriptive words about where you\u2019d kind of like to see your character heading. You\u2019ll also pick your name once we get going and you know the initial setting. But you\u2019re not going to detail every element, your character will be in a world that I create and control and then she or he will begin to interact.",

This *thing* is a monster!\" *As he says that, a Mech branded by the same army as the soldier, gets kicked into a building, and then disintegrated by an energy beam.*\n\"Fuck! We can do shit against him! Our bullets... Bombs... Nukes... They bounce off of him!\" *He shakes his head as he continues to cry.* \"If you can... Stay away from this monster, god speed.\" *He drops his tablet, it's now facing the sky. He cocks his shotgun, and peaks out of the cover he's in and fires 2 times into the 'monster', doing nothing. The 'monster' flies over to the soldier and stabs a hole in his heart. The Soldier drops his shotgun.\nThat feed was streamed to all of the other tablets owned by other citizens and soldiers.*\n\n\n[If you enjoyed that short story, join the server [Here.](https://discord.gg/WDZcyn9) to RP with all of us.]",

            "selftext": "Hail the Omnissiah\n\nI have been fishing around trying to find a partner or partners for some good old gritty 40k RP. I'm a huge Imperium fan and really love the 'low fantasy' settings that surround the hive cities, imperial ships, trenches and the likes. \n\nWhile I'm happy to play out most aspects of the 40k universe, I've always prefered seeing the setting through the eyes of a lowly guardsman or overworked Arbites officer, rather than some superhuman chaos entity or all knowing all seeing Eldar.\n\nI won't ramble about a particular setting for RP here, though if your interested in this side of the 40k universe then please feel free to drop me a message and we can work something out.\n\nAs for me. I'm in the UK but honestly, I'm awake at all sorts of times. I have a good few years of RP experience on various platforms and look for quality over quantity. If the RP's flowing quite quickly, a few lines beats paragraphs of aimless rambling.\n\nIf by some miracle this gets the interest of a few people, I'm more than happy to play with the idea of creating a small bit of group RP as well, something on the lines of a small squad or unit with a particular goal in mind.\n\nSo, thats that! I look forward to hearing from you!\n",

I\u2019m posting on here to search some partners about a roleplay taking place in the world of FFXV! I would play my OC, who\u2019s a Kingsglaive member, and my partner would be able to pick any of the main characters in the story. \n\nI\u2019m looking for both male and female partners, so anyone like Noctis or Aranea, Cor or Iris, even Nyx from the movie (we can just say he lived somehow) or Cindy, so on and so forth. This could take place at any time during the game, maybe before or after as well if you convince me good enough.\n\nKeep in mind that I want this rp to be action/plot focused, with bits of romance added in to keep things interesting. I don\u2019t want a one-and-done type deal with smut and all that.  Also if you\u2019re looking for a short term story as well then I won\u2019t be interested. However, if everything I said that I want interests yoy, then please PM with a little bit about yourself, a writing sample (1st or 3rd) I don\u2019t mind, and your Kik/Discord. \n\nThere\u2019s no real limit to how many people I want to rp with, so if you see this please HMU! :)",

However, I have no problem going into other fandoms, as long as i know enough about it. I prefer the plot for the roleplay to be action oriented. with a romance subplot (that one's optional, depends on how you feel about it.) This will be fairly long term, though i'm fine with changing fandoms should you get bored. I prefer replies to be a few lines long, but obviously short posts are okay if there's really nothing happening in the scene. Pm me for my info, and I hope to hear from anyone interested soon.",

            "selftext": "Whether it's an assassination, a foreboding prophecy, or a kidnapping, there is always a hero there to stop it. Sometimes they're a paladin, raised for the role. Sometimes they're a dashing rogue, a thief with a great heart. Usually, they have no idea how they ended up in the situation and just want to get out of it alive. Maybe along the way they learned how to do the right thing. \n\nI'm interested in creating a *long-term* roleplay based on two unintentional adventurers, your character and mine. Think of dragons, elves, evil liches, and dwarves. If you're familiar with the Forgotten Realms, that's what I'd want the world to be. In fact, I wouldn't mind using exactly that to set up characters and plot together. \n\nSpeaking of plot: I clearly want an adventure, but I also appreciate a good romance. The great part about a long-term roleplay is that whatever love story exists will be slow-burning, and our characters will grow to like each other as they grow in personality themselves. That's just about my only stipulation in terms of storyline. Everything else can follow your lead! \n\nThe reason I stated I'm seeking a DM is because I love roleplaying with storytellers. I don't mind creating the plot together one bit, so you don't have to be alone in coming up with ideas, but I would prefer for NPCs and the like to be under your control. \n\nJust so you know a little about me, I am a college student *severely* missing playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends back home. Typically I write 2+ paragraphs a response, in 3rd person, and in past-tense form. My experience includes one on one writing, group roleplay, and obviously DnD. \n\nI think that's about it. If you have a super compelling idea that doesn't follow this kind of arc, then pitch it to me anyways! Maybe I'll be intrigued. Thanks for reading all of this and hope to hear from you soon! ",

I was hoping to find a partner who\u2019d be willing to write up a horror-themed plot with me!\n\nThe story itself would focus on suspense, drama, action, horror with bits of romance to ease the tension at certain points. I\u2019m looking for both male and female partners so please don\u2019t be discouraged.\n\nAs for the plot itself, I\u2019m open to either coming up with something original, or base it off an existing story. Some of the pieces of horror media that really interest me include:\n\nThe Thing\nCall of Cthulhu\nAt the Mountains of Madness\nResident Evil\nSilent Hill\nF.E.A.R.\nAliens\nThe Mist\nLeft 4 Dead\nThe Shining\nThe Evil Within\nUntil Dawn\nHalloween\nFriday the 13th\n\nThose are just a few, so please don\u2019t think I\u2019m only limited to those. Like I said before, I\u2019m open to an original story, maybe even combine a few to make it interesting! There might be horror fiction that I didn\u2019t list that I\u2019m into as well.\n\nAnyways if you guys are interested please PM me with a little bit about yourself, a writing sample, and your Kik/Discord! :3\n\niTcHy TaStY",

            "selftext": "Hail and well met, r/roleplay! I hope you're all doing well today. Thank you for popping by to take a look at my ad. I hope something here strikes your fancy and we can become good friends through some excellent roleplay!\n\nA little bit about myself: I'm twenty four, between jobs with a great deal of free time, I have two cats, three snakes, and four lizards, and I love writing with others. I usually play female characters, but I'm happy making males as well. I'm ace, but I'm a sucker for romantic themes, too.\n\nNow for ideas! I have a couple of settings swimming around in my head, but we are by no means locked into just these. I adore working together and brainstorming original worlds and plots and ideas, so if that's your thing we'll get along wonderfully!\n\n\u2022 [Elder Scrolls] I grew up on TES:IV Oblivion, so the Elder Scrolls series is near and dear to my heart. I've been itching to play something, anything really, within this universe, be it in Cyrodiil before the Oblivion Crisis, or in Skyrim during the height of the war, or somewhere else, far removed from those events. I'm a sucker for Khajiit and Argonians, but if that's not your cup of tea I can always play something else. If you're down to clown, a Khajiit thief or an Argonian mage would do me just fine, in just about any sort of plot, so long as there's plenty of adventure!\n\n\u2022 [Star Wars] Who doesn't love a good ol' fasioned Space Opera? Star Wars is the other setting that's at the top of my list. I've always loved it, and there's no shortage of things to do within it. Jedi Master and Padawan? Awesome! Smuggler rivals against the Empire/Republic/First Order? Sweet! Ruthless Sith trying to dominate the Galaxy? I'm game! So long as at least ONE droid is involved in the story I'm happy.\n\n\u2022 [Dungeons and Dragons] Now I know what you're thinking. D&amp;D means dice and character sheets and math. It's okay, I'm not interested in statting things out and getting a dice bot for Discord. I just really like the kind of idea behind D&amp;D. Don't get me wrong, I DM a group every Wednesday and soon to be every Friday, so here I'd like to just rely on literary skill instead of the roll of the dice. Any sort of adventure will do, preferably with one of us taking the reins as the storyteller and the other focusing just on one to two characters.\n\nAnd those are just the tip of the iceberg. I'd say those three are my main itches, but I'm certainly interested in other things! Modern with a twist of Fantasy, Dragon Age, Firefly, Super Heroes (original, My Hero Academia, Marvel, DC [in that order]), and so much more!\n\nIf anything here stood out to you and caught your eye, please send me a PM here on Reddit! Tell me a small bit about yourself and what you're interested in, then leave me your Discord username or email and I'll add you and we'll be on our way! I look forward to hearing from you soon!",

            "selftext": "(This is my first time making a Reddit post so I do apologize if I've done anything incorrectly.)\n\n\nThe Land Of Elements roleplay is a fantasy group on Discord. \n\nIn this world, almost everyone is born with an element--basically a super power-- and they are generally split up into a few groups. Shapeshifting, controlling fire, water, earth, lightning and the weather, ice, venom poisons and acid, nature, and magnetism. Along with those are the equally common holy magic, illusions, and necromancy. \n\nEach element has it's own nation, each nation having it's own culture and behavior. For example, the Tribal Reserve, for the shapeshifters, is a nation comprising of several tribes, most hostile, some more friendly. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Dark, for the illusionists. The capital of the New Council (more on that later in the post), a unified nation, vastly superior in technology.\n\nOn the subject of tech, there are two extremes and hardly any in-betweens. The people who have anything advanced are almost always the ones that made their devices. The common man would only be able to have very old fashioned weapons; muskets, flintlocks, swords, hammers, etc. Those that possess the more advanced stuff, however... Well, the only real limit is imagination. The reason this is possible, is relatively simple as well. To put it simply, a vast network of resources and the means to get them delivered, if they are a part of the New Council.\n\n\nNow, a short overview of the plot itself. \n\nFirst, is war. Part of the reason why I included the NSFW tag, as in general, genocide is not family friendly. There are two opposing factions. The Empire, and the New Council. The Empire stands for freedom and separation. It wants every nation to remain their own, and is only really still around due to it's position. In the middle of the continent this takes place on, surrounded by mountains with only a few routes through, not including the heavily guarded tunnels. Outside of the mountains, the largest nation of the island, Steel, the land of outcasts, is anything but friendly towards the New Council. \nThe New Council stands for unification. It wants every nation to be under one banner, to have a single culture among all of them. Safety at the price of freedom and individuality.\n\nAn elite group known as Revelation is led by a man thought long dead, and they, at least at the beginning, will be attempting to destroy the New Council, slowly but surely killing it's members. \n\nAnd then the main event. The proxy of Nekron, the god of death, is out to conquer the entire continent once again. The main goal of the roleplay will be to kill her once and for all.\n\n\nLink to the server: https://discord.gg/7HdMVDx\n\n(I apologize again if this disobeys any rules of the subreddit, I am a new user to this site.)",

A bunch of players pre-order a VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game) called \u2018The New Frontier\u2019. The New Frontier takes place within a Sci-Fi styled world mixed with modern and even a bit of Fantasy. The whole objective of the game is to travel from world to world and defeat that world\u2019s dungeon. These worlds are called \u2018dimensions\u2019 within the game. Each dimension would be unique and different from the previous with very few reused assets. On the first day of launch, the players quickly find themselves unable to log out from the game. In good old Sword Art Online fashion, it is revealed by the developer that it isn\u2019t a bug, but a feature purposely placed within the game. The developer also reveals that if a player\u2019s HP reaches zero, that player will receive a deadly shock from their VR headset that will fry their brains in the real world. The players within the game have two basic adjectives. Survive and beat the game. If all ten dimensions can be cleared, than the players will be able to exit the game safely. However, it won\u2019t be easy with worlds crawling with monsters, aliens, and even other players looking to kill the players of the game.\n\nIf this is a one on one roleplay, I do want to include romance. A straight pairing where I roleplay as the male character, and you are the female character. If this becomes a group, no romance required but I would definitely love to see it. Also, I mainly roleplay on Discord, but I\u2019m open to Skype, Kik, Chatzy, or anything else if needed. However, if you want to create a group, it must be on Discord.\n\n\nI do have some requirements, however. First off, be literate, at least a paragraph (4-5 sentences) average, although there will be many exceptions to this (specific scenes and what not). Being literate also includes having good grammar, it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect but use proper punctuation, capitalization, know the differences between your and you\u2019re, and so on. Occasional typos or mistakes are fine, but if these mistakes are often, then we\u2019ll have a problem. Write as if it were a book, as in no symbols for character actions, and use quotes for character speech. Example: \u201cHey guys!\u201d The man said as he entered the room. Also, roleplay in third person, definitely if I decide to create a group for this. Also, be okay with NSFW roleplay in one on one roleplays. Of course, I don\u2019t want smut and sex scenes to be a focus of the story. I\u2019m fine with roleplaying them often, but I don\u2019t want them to be the absolute main focus of the story. For groups, all NSFW material will be kept in private, unless the entire group is okay with NSFW content. NSFW material includes roleplaying smut, 18+ images, etc. For groups, no OOC drama, racism, etc. First violation will be a warning, second will be a removal from the group.\n\nAdditional information about me. I live on the West Coast, I currently have the next couple of weeks off before I go back to my somewhat busy life. I will be able to roleplay still, but maybe not as often, depends on what is going on. I stay up late rather often, however, if I'm roleplaying while in bed I will be on my phone and odds are my posts might become a bit smaller. I have an average of two to three paragraphs per post, however, my post lengths will definitely vary depending on what is happening and how much the other person is posting. Small posts from you typically mean small posts from me, and vice versa.\n\nThe following is for those who play Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet. I\u2019m also looking for anyone that would be willing to roleplay as Zeliska from the game. I do have a couple ideas for this. I won\u2019t explain them here though, if you\u2019re interested just let me know when you PM me.\n\n\nAnyways, if you have any questions, feel free to ask when you PM me. Let me know as well if you\u2019d be okay with creating a group for this roleplay, or if you\u2019d prefer a one on one roleplay. If we\u2019re to create a group, I\u2019m setting the max for five roleplayers total in the group. I hope to hear from some of you! Also if you\u2019re still reading this, I applaud you.",

I am trying this instead of tabletops because I am looking to build narrative cinematic experiences instead of a combat oriented game like most tabletops are.

Most of my roleplay partners have sort of dropped off in reply frequency because of life things so I'd like to get a few more people to add to my list of roleplay partners to fill in the gaps!! I'll list below some things I like and dont like. \n\n- third person, past tense only. \n- please be at least semi literate. Know how to roleplay and type out sentences. Mistakes happen, and you dont need to be absolutely perfect but some effort would be great! \n- No Fandom\n- At least a reply a day would be great. I certainly know life can happen though! \n- Please be 18+ my roleplays can contain some NSFW elements. \n\nI think that's about! I roleplay pretty much everything and anything if we can come up with an idea and world that intrigues me. I generally drift toward fantasy elements but it doesn't have to contain that. =) when you message me send me something intriguing. A bit about yourself or something. Dont just say hi, I wont response to those. \n\nHope to hear from some of you soon!!",

            "selftext": "Hello, r/roleplay! As always, I am currently looking for a partner or two to write stories taking place within MCU with me. If you, dear reader, find something of interest in the post, please PM me with your thoughts!\n\nFor the exciting part, below are a list of characters I am looking forward to playing:\n\nMarvel: Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) ll Jean Grey (Phoenix) ll Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat) ll Sharon Carter (Agent 13) ll Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow)\n\nAnd if you are still on the fence and would like some ideas, below are a few scenarios/pairings that come to mind:\n\n*Sharon Carter x Steve Rogers*: Let's bring it back to when she was just a \"nurse\" and he was just her \"neighbor\". She was assigned to watch him - keep trouble off his back. He was clueless. How long can she keep it up before her \"secret\" is revealed? And can he keep away from her even then?\n\n*Wanda Maximoff x The Vision*: She was his distraction. Wanda Maximoff met the Vision before he existed as the Vision; she was the first thing he knew in his dreams. He never did agree with her methods - especially when she sent him a mile into the ground - but when Thanos put a target on his back, there\u2019s nothing that she wouldn\u2019t do to save his life.\n\n*Jean Grey x Scott Summers*: The iconic couple that survived through the test of time (but apparently not X3). Let\u2019s start at the beginning when they first met as the Original X-Men. Or perhaps we\u2019ll start at the end, as Scott is spiraling down a dangerous path of his own making. Who but his supposedly dead (never for more than 10 minutes) wife to bring him back on the right track?\n\n*Natasha Romanoff x Matt Murdock*: My OTP from the comics. Hell\u2019s kitchen was bound to land on the radar of the Avengers, and with Nat off the grid for the time being, maybe it\u2019s time that she did a sweep of all the rumors that are arising from Hell\u2019s Kitchen of a new group of heroes/vigilantes.\n\nAs always, these are not the only pairings/ideas that I am willing to work with. But let's first dive into a few actual requirements. I require you to be 18+ (preferably 20+) in case of any adult content; I am far beyond that age requirement. I also ask that you can write multi-paragraph form (like I have done). Quality is always above quantity, and I will never ask you to match me if I decide to go off on a literary spew. However, I ask that you put effort into your replies, and I promise you nothing less than quality replies back.\n\nA note that I have no qualms about researching new heroes/villains/scenarios and am more than happy to do so! So if you have any ideas involving characters not mentioned here, I would love to hear them! Choose between Reddit PMs, e-mail, Google Docs, or Skype. Looking forward to hearing from all of you :) So long as this post is up, I am still looking.\n\nP.S.: If you are going to PM me, please give me some details as to what you expect. Please do not just send a \"hi\". Thank you!",

Hell, if enough people message me I may make a private group for the rp to take place in)\n\nWe were once gamers, playing a simple VR MMO. Known as Guilded Age. We ran the most powerful guild and had our own kingdom. We ruled it and were known as the Ten Commandments! However, on the day the servers were closing we all decided to be there when it happened. However, something strange happened when servers closed. We were still in the game. No hud, almost real. It seems we are stuck in the world of guilded age and the NPC's....come to life in a sense as if they were sentient beings.\n\nThis is based off the anime overlord but I feel if we had more then one PC it would have been a bit better!

Any kind from subtlety to dragons blasting fireballs left and right. I do enjoy me some sci-fi from time to time so don't hesitate to inquire about that too!\n\nI also love a huge collection of Anime, so let me know if that interests you too! I do warn you that I usually avoid playing canon characters in any of the anime settings.\n\nI'm currently sticking to email as my medium for play due to my work schedule and how easy it is to read and respond on my phone if needed. Anyway send me a PM and we can discuss interests and see what we can get going! Hope to hear from you soon!\n\n~Kael",

            "selftext": "I would like to do a roleplay where I can play a vampiric character that is not a normal blood-drinking vampire. Rather, he is a dream-mote, a dream given flesh and to prevent himself from evaporating into nothingness, he must feed on the dreams of others. He prefers women and the process is usually ecstatic for both parties. I'm not looking to turn him into a wishy-washy, weepy, sparkly boyfriend kind of vampire. While I am looking to avoid cheesiness and humanizing him too much, there are some classic elements I would like to visit. He holds a very powerful charm and mental domination over those that are not prepared or weak of will. He isn't human, or a dream, he is something in between and though he acts and appears human, he is a monster and a predator. That doesn't mean I'm going to play him strictly as a villain.\n\nAfter feeding enough to satiate his hunger, the victim will be in a light stupor for a day, as if they did not sleep well enough. Repeated feedings will eventually lead to death, appearing as if they quietly died in their sleep, medically appearing as if they slipped into a coma and did not awaken until their vitals gradually ceased. If he chooses, he can enslave his victims, live or dead, to do as he wishes, though his hold on those still alive is tenuous and temporary. Those he has killed through feeding can become enslaved to him as fragments of dreams he can summon up. Generally, as I picture him, he does not relish killing people as it causes him to succumb to his more primal and bestial nature. He has a number of strange powers that are at their zenith at night, especially under the moon. In the day, his powers are diminished, but not gone. His powers include being able to summon up dreams from people and making them at least quasi-real, not fully real (no lifesigns, heat signatures, ect.), but real enough to effect people.\n\nThe plot and setting are all flexible, including my character and yours. I can do medieval fantasy, modern fantasy, sci-fi, historical, though generally the more exotic and more fantastic, the better. I have a few ideas for something to grow a roleplay out of, but they're just seeds for a beginning. I'm look for something emotional and with great feeling. More importantly, I'm interested in hearing your ideas. Stuff that is new and exciting. Message me with what you have and we'll see if we can make this work. Please understand I will roleplay by PMs only, and that means Reddit PMs only, please.",

As busy as I usually am, I recently have become *very* available. \n\nYou see, Sunday afternoon, I shattered my ankle. 2 incisions, 1 plate, and 8 screws later, I have found myself with a **lot** of time on my hands. So, I decided, I am going to get back into roleplaying. \n\nI do a lot of plots. I enjoy writing most things. Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Post-apocalypse, Slice of Life, Horror. The one thing I don't usually do is fandom. I'm not saying I won't, I just usually don't. \n\nI have a prompt apocalypse promt that I'd be happy to share with you, but other than that, I am eager to hear what you guys have for me. I usually use Discord or Kik, but I'm open to pretty much anything. Message me! Tell me a bit about yourself, and maybe give me a prompt idea!",

I can play either, but might prefer to play the deputy. Hudson is Love and I really want to do something with her! The RP will probably be 18+, but I still want it to have all of the action packed fun that comes with a Far Cry game. \n\nThe RP could take place just after the crash and they are captured together, could pick up when John has both the rookie and Hudson before the rookie escapes, or we can pick it off after Hudson has been saved and something romantic develops between them. \n\nDescriptive / fun and creative partners, please! Message me if interested.\n\nThanks! ",

I'd like to befriend the other person to a degree, as that can make the roleplay way more fun.\n\nThe person I'd like to find should have good communication skills, so instead of just randomly dropping the RP, they should instead be able to say: \"Hey, I'm not really feeling X, maybe we could try Y or Z?\" I enjoy discussing things, so it'd be fun to find someone who also enjoys talking about things. \n\nI don't want someone who's obsessed with dark stuff, as that can get pretty boring. (There's already an insane amount of it to be found in TV shows and movies.) I'd prefer something lighter where you can grow attached to the environment and the characters who exist in the world. But the occasional darker events are fine. (Murder mysteries, or whatever.)\n\nI'd like to do world building together, so both parties should be able to influence the world and surprise the other with new content. Though, discussing things ahead of time's great. (\"Hey, imagine if X happen and then Y.\", \"Maybe there could be a town which has X theme going on?\")\n\nBeing creative's a big plus. Someone who just enjoys talking about new stuff that could exist and designing it. Someone who has fun with that kind of stuff.\n\nAs for the kind of RP, I'd like it to be set in a fantasy world! Possibly adventure, action and romance could be involved. We can chat about the details over PM's or on Discord!\n\nI know there's a bunch of criteria here, but there's always a chance someone wonderful's out there, so I hope to maybe encounter them!\n\nThanks for giving the post a read. Hope you have a good day.",

            "selftext": "Looking for a Naruto RP community on reddit? Then look no farther than /r/TheNarutoWorld!\n\n---\n\nIt\u2019s a period of uncertainty and wariness among the ninja villages. For a time it appeared the villages might enter a period of relative peace, especially after they came together at a Kage Summit to discuss the formation of a coalition and the reappearance of the tailed beasts in the world. But when the village forces met in a united coalition in the Sound, two of the villages initiated a shocking double cross against a third, Kiri. And what\u2019s more, Kiri had been expecting this and dealt a crushing defeat against the attackers. \n\nWhile the tensions between those three villages simmers and results in covert missions, sabotage, and behind the scenes plays, Kumo continues its attempts to govern, reform, and rebuild the Land of Sound. Yet within that country elements are rising up in rebellion and threatening to destabilize the country. And in all of this, the reappearance of the tailed beasts appears to be overlooked, as more pressing matters plague each village. \n\nMany new leaders are trying their hand at resolving these conflicts, and the next generation of ninja will influence the constantly evolving state of the world. What will happen next, now that war has been declared? Responses of each village are constantly evolving and plans are being hatched all the time... how will *you* choose to affect these events? Will you join others in Konoha under the Will of Fire and fight for your village? Or maybe the way of the sword in Kiri speaks to you? Or if the role of peacekeeper and rebuilder speaks to you, maybe you will join Kumo in restoring the Land of Sound. \n\n\n---\n\nCreate your own character to set out to fulfill their goals and dreams along side other players! We've got a customized and open system with plenty of room for creativity and fun. Our system is well balanced and designed with lots of influence from pen and paper RPG games, but enough flexibility to let you have fun RPing without constantly worrying about numbers. RP is similarly flexible and occurs both forum-style and in real-time and at several levels, both public and within your village to maximize the cloak-and-dagger vibe of being a ninja. \n\nFor more information on getting started, and the basics of our RP group, come on over and check out [our sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNarutoWorld/). With a friendly group of players, helpful mods, and an OOC Discord community there is plenty for everyone and people more than willing to welcome you and get you set up and kicking some ninja butt in no time! \n\nHead on over to /r/TheNarutoWorld and start down your ninja path!\n",

I enjoy more of a storyline plot and I\u2019m looking for someone who has little in terms of limits. \n\nI write in third person, past tense. My replies vary from 1 paragraph to 5. Age gaps are something I\u2019d like to explore and things that are more taboo so to speak. I do t have an exact story to go by but that\u2019s where our partnership would come in :). \n\nI prefer to Roleplay over Email, as it\u2019s easy to access and I can reply from work if needed.
