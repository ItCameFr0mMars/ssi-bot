            "selftext": "\"Your freedom will be the wars you wage. Your family? Already dead, the last of the losses you have suffered. Now *kneel.*\"\n\nThe breath is forced out of you as a gloved fist makes itself acquainted with your stomach, prompting you to crumple to the dimly lit tiles on your hands and knees. That was quite enough questions from a serf. The night air wraps its icy fingers around the trio, a pair of fluttering cloaks stood looming over a shivering body. A smug aristocrat gives a nod to the guardsman beside you and you are dragged to an upright position, your arms hanging limply in a vice-like grip. It wasn't quite as awe-inspiring a move as an invisible force to make you bend the knee or a strong wind blowing you on your back but hey, one works with the tools at one's disposal. \n\nIf any other member of the Empress's Court had been at hand to judge your crime you would be swinging from the gallows by now- or worse. Incinerated. Cleaved on the spot. Entombed alive. Your mind broken as every thought, feeling and emotion you ever had was ripped from your soul. The elite of society could be so cruelly inventive with the supernatural abilities that signified their right to rule. Life is as it always had been; the strongest of society constitute the aristocracy, the weakest being the commoners who were born without 'Talents' or wealth. The mightiest of all nobility make up the Empress's Court, forever engaged in their games of court intrigue and war.  \n\nIt is rare for a lowborn to possess a Talent, especially the kind wielded by yourself in your flagrant display. Fortunately for you, Ausar of House Renault, twelfth in line to the ivory throne, was not inclined to waste such a *valuable* individual. Even at the tender age of 22, the Talent to bend the flames to his will commanded a somewhat fearful respect from lesser nobility, let alone the common folk. \n\nThe aristocrat peers down at you with a parochial expression, a small smile offsetting a glint in his eye that conveyed far more than mere interest. \"You can either be put down like some common cur, or take your place by my side. Come now, let's not be rash. There is nothing but death left for you here. Ah, I see that look in your eye; your white knuckles and stony expression. I dare say you might even be contemplating murdering me. But you won't. Everything you are, everything you will become, is by my hand. You will never betray me.\"  He pauses to extend a regal hand, a faint whiff of burnt wood lingering under your nose as he gently grasps your bruised jaw. \"And in time, I suspect, you may not even want to.\" \n\n\"Go on, take my hand. I do not like to be kept waiting.\" \n\n\n_____________\n\nCongrats on making it thus far! I'm looking to write a tale of court intrigue with a possible smattering of smut for good measure. A wee bit of worldbuilding will be required as well, so for those who enjoy such things don't hesitate to send off that orange envelope. I do have a considerable amount of background notes which are available on request. The RP takes place in a steampunkish kind of world (think a similar setting to Dishonoured) where the ruling elite of society are born with  unique abilities colloquially referred to as 'Talents.' As a lowborn of exceptional power, your character is an exceedingly rare individual. In your response, please include the backstory of your character, including their Talent and the nature of their crime which has placed them squarely at the mercy of Ausar. The one restriction I ask for is that your character is not absurdly overpowered! \n\n\n\nThe prompt is open-ended, meaning that your character is of course in no way obliged to embrace whatever plans Ausar might have for them. For instance, they might choose to make a successful break for it, only to have the entire city's militia scouring the streets for them? If, however, you like the thought of playing as another character (such as another aristocrat) then feel free to pitch your suggestion. In this instance, do mention the kind of relationship dynamic you expect the two to have: a political alliance of temporary convenience, for instance?\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "The Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme.\nEvery character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\nhttp://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction",

Do you long to leave your life behind and become someone or something other than your day to day human? Join us! We're always happy to escape reality.\n\nThe Broken is an urban fantasy group that takes place in and around Boston. We're a group of writers in various stages of skill and intent, harboring people from various platforms (AOL and others). We RP at leisure, fast paced, and just goof around but at the end of the day, story is our purpose. We do monthly events, group wide plot, and try to offer our players an even playing field with lots of twists and turns.\n\nDark, humor, violent, plot, story, missions, active community, extra random things, and whatever else suits us at that moment. We hope to see you soon!\n\nCurrent Plot Line: Boston is slowly crumbling to crime. Terrorist attacks, murder, missing people, drugs, a declining environment, a sudden rise in cross-racial diseases \u2014 and to top it all off, a supernatural community that is still working to pick up the pieces after they teetered on the edge of exposure two years prior. Yet for every step forward, three more are taken backwards. Villains, heroes, anti-heroes, and people caught in the crossfire \u2014 Anything can happen in a city that's on the verge of being broken.\n\nSite address: http://www.the-broken.com\n\nDiscord Server address: https://discord.gg/8hSxdnc",

If you're after a platonic or familial relationship, let me know!\n\n- For fandoms I prefer we go with canons but I could be swayed to include OCs if we double and they're not copies of canon characters. But be aware, I am leery of them so try to be fair with your OC and not be extravagant. Also, crossovers can totally be a thing. \n\n**Originals:** Below are some original concepts.

A role-play community where near anything is possible!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am Tadg but most people know me as Thist. I am the founder of Paradigm and all of the work surrounding it. We are currently a discord based Roleplay community based around an original universe. Paradigm is a universe where you can roleplay to your heart's content. Near anything is possible in this world; from clan warfare, to disease control, to even small talk. Paradigm has its own unique self-run turn based combat system that players can use for combat as well as simple general chat areas where roleplayers can chat, share memes, and have fun.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe lore of this world is deep and extensive and if you wish to read in to it, we have an extensive codex on the server to tell you just about everything you could ever want to know about the universe. This codex covers everything including the governmental systems of factions, how magic works, and even how fuel works in this universe.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe moderators hold podcasts live on the audio channels regularly that they use to chat about anything and everything. One of our moderators writes screenplays and film pitches set in the universe that he reads on his podcast titled 'film crew'. While our other show 'deeper questions' has us tackling some of the more finicky and ridiculous questions the members of the server can come up with. As well as that there is another in the making that is intended to be fun and lighthearted so look out for that. While our other shows 'Jam Sesh' and 'Production Ramble' Look at how we would make video games and talks about the intricacies with making Paradigm and all the other material projected to come out around it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBooks, stories, Radio plays, In depth character designs, Youtube content, and so much more is projected to come out surrounding paradigm so why not join up now and catch it while it is fresh:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://discord.gg/VTmgzsF\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you would like to look into the lore of the community we have documentation on the whole universe it takes place in. Take a read here:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/14l_-GbeZD1TPC2usS4ZD7MlC44F7ZPcuRjigZETUi5o/edit?usp=sharing\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll the appropriate links are also found in the server itself too. what are you waiting for? Join up now!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe are now also launching a youtube channel where you can listen to our old shows incase you missed any so if you want you can also subscribe to that!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaLnh8RMHWungmCCTDvWWNA",

We run what is basically a science fantasy slice of life adventure group. Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.\n\nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence.\n\nThe world is alive with tons of lore and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature.\n\nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.",

I am looking for someone who is literate and can write multiple paragraphs per response. This is meant to be a story that we create together, so input and ideas from both parties are necessary to make this enjoyable for both of us.\n\nA little forewarning, I only play original characters and would like your character to be an original character too. Straight off the bat, I'll let you know now that I don't do roleplays that are based on the generes of fandom, supernatural, fantasy, medieval... etc. so if that's what you're looking for, then this is the wrong post for you.\n\nAnyway, a bit about my roleplay history... I've been doing text based roleplay for about 4 years now, with a main preference for romance and slice of life roleplays. I have been told that I am a literate and detailed roleplayer, and I put a great emphasis on using correct spelling and grammar in my responses. In terms of response length, I usually write a few paragraphs, dependant on the situation. As a general rule of thumb, the more I get, the more I give back, but it's never less than a paragraph. \n\nI am looking to create a roleplay where our characters already begin in an established relationship together, and can explore that relationship throughout the course of the roleplay, as different events and situations arise in their lives. I know this may sounds strange and a little boring, but I have a few ideas in mind that you can read over if you choose to PM me.\n\nAs for NSFW, I am comfortable with NSFW elements in a roleplay, but am happy to exclude them too. If NSFW elements are incorporated, I personally prefer my roleplay's to revolve around the plot and storyline, rather than the NSFW elements themselves.\n\nI'm hoping that I have expressed enough detail for you to be interested, without writing an entire essay. If you would like to roleplay with me or hear more about my ideas, feel free to send me a PM. If you have any ideas then I'm more than happy to hear those too, if you feel that they align with what I'm looking for.",

            "selftext": "\n\nHello. My name is Brie, I\u2019m 27 years old living in the US and looking for some writing partners. I currently run a few Discord servers, but a lot of the members have some real life obligations which have them on hiatus for a bit. \n\nI\u2019m looking for hopefully a 1x1 or even something where later on they\u2019d be able to join the group if they\u2019re comfortable. I moved in January and started a new job so I\u2019m sort of just getting on my feet. It\u2019s been awhile since I posted here, but I\u2019m hopeful. \n\nTHE BASICS:\n\n*PLEASE// Communication is key for me. I am not a mind reader, and I\u2019d rather you come talk to me if something is going wrong rather than let it stew. \n\n*I primarily work on Discord as it is easier for me, however I\u2019m open to other options (excluding Skype/Kik) \n\n*I labeled [NSFW] mostly cause some of the subjects I write with have either adult themes or gore. This is also why I\u2019d prefer my partner be 18+. \n\n*I play both Male and Female characters, though if I\u2019m honest, I prefer Female just because it is easier for me to relate to them. \n\n*I can write anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs but will always try to match my partners speed and length. If I\u2019m having an off day, or a block, I left you know. My frequency can be at least a post daily, or more. \n\n*I work 4:30pm-1:00am EST Sat-Weds, so I\u2019m not always available between those hours. My discord is always up and running, but if I don\u2019t respond, I\u2019m probably just busy at work. I\u2019ll grab you as soon as I can. I\u2019m usually most active between 1:30am-4:00am EST after work. \n\nGENRES:\n\n*I tend to play in existing settings and bend lore or make an AU as needed. I love a lot of the worlds these games/shows/movies take place in. That said, I\u2019m open to making a custom world, just might take a little while for me to get comfortable in it. \n\n-Bloodborne\n-The Witcher\n-Game of Thrones\n-Fallout\n-Dragon Age (primarily Inquisition, said to say I haven\u2019t played the others yet) \n-Bioshock\n\nFeel free to ask about others. I\u2019m open to most things, but I\u2019ll give you a hard stop if I\u2019m uncomfortable about anything. Again; communication is key. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please send me a PM. We can exchange information and talk a bit more there. \n\n\nCheers!\n\n-Brie",

But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nCurrent craving: Victorian/ Edwardian or 1950s Europe, or Modern!\n\nThanks for reading all this!

            "selftext": "Hello all, I have a bit of a weird idea. It's not 100% thought-up since I'd rather leave room for cooperative development than have this overly linear 'thing' to throw at ya'll. It's depressing, but the point can be to try and fix that fact, or we can go the opposite way and make it all ten times worse. The idea goes like this...\n\nThere's a character, likely a young adult, who's suffered an unsavory childhood and teen years. Their life is even scarier now that they're out on their own, and stress is piling up, anxiety hovering inside them at peak levels, constantly. One night, this person breaks down in their bedroom, and as they're sat crying, they feel a presense - it's a person, around their age, who's never been seen before and whose only intent is to calm the distressed person down. This stranger introduces themself simply as an 'imaginary friend', and they actually back up this claim with the ability to disappear and reappear in the blink of an eye, and not to mention, they know a lot about the other person -- things that no one else could possibly know. As the story persists, it becomes more evident that this 'imaginary' friend is not imaginary at all.\n\nWhen it comes to \"who plays who\", I'm open to either position, even though I slightly lean towards playing the imaginary friend. As for gender, I play male exclusively, but whether you're male, female, or trans - it's all fine with me. There can be romance as well, but that would have to be later on when the 'imaginary' friend is revealed to be a physicial being instead.\n\nIf you're interested, don't hesitate to send me a PM.",

I want it to take place in a post-apocalyptic scene that we can either steal from a universe or make up on our own.

I want the whole mysterious past, hard to relate to characters that eventually warm up to each other and pair up to slay monsters together. I would like our characters to eventually fall in love, however long that will take. I want to build up a good relationship and reasons why they are special rather than them just falling for each other right away. I also want our characters to struggle, a lot. I'm not looking for someone that wants to play a god-like character. \n\nWould be using Discord, will go on as long as we both feel like it. I am busy so I can't promise a post everyday. But as long as the action is good and compelling I can promise you my participation as long as I'm hooked. I have about a year experience in text rp, not a fantastic writer but not bad either.

The worst I\u2019ll say is that I don\u2019t really want to do that.\n\nGenre wise I\u2019m particularly fond of fantasy settings and I\u2019m happy to have romance as long as it doesn\u2019t just become smut.  However, as far as fandoms go I\u2019m a lot more comfortable using my own characters and in my own worlds but if there\u2019s a particular fandom you\u2019d like to try then I\u2019ll give it a go as long as I can make my own character.

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm an experienced roleplayer looking to do some anime rp. If I haven't seen it, I can watch it within a decent timeframe. Some of my favorites are Soul Eater, Sword Art Online, and My Hero Academia. Of course, I'm up for anything you might suggest as well, I'm very flexible and able to play either gender and a multitude of character types. For the genre of RP I am once again flexible, although I enjoy a healthy mix of Slice of life, Combat, and romance, if at all possible in the situation (Although I understand not every RP needs or can include combat). I like my partners to be somewhat available, I understand that daily might not be possible, but more than a couple posts a week is preferred. My posts vary depending on yours, but on my own, I always attempt at least 1-2 paragraphs, if not more. I'm not super picky about everything being prim and proper grammatically, we all make mistakes! I'm looking forward to speaking with you, Pm me if you are interested!",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI'm currently searching for a one on one roleplay partner, as stated in the title.  I've been writing on forums for over a decade, and although I've always enjoyed it immensely, that medium no longer suits my lifestyle well.  I no longer have the amount of free time  that's needed keep multiple threads with multiple characters and multiple partners going all at once, and I hate being the person who takes ages to reply. What I'd much rather do is find one person I mesh well with that I can dedicate my attention to!\n\nI'm hoping to find someone who is really into character-driven writing.  I love world building and I'm fine with throwing in some action, but what I adore most is just digging into characters, figuring them out, letting them change and grow as they interact with each other, and building something truly special between two characters (I'm not talking strictly about romance, either - even characters driven by hate and anger can be something amazing to write when the writers have the right chemistry!).  Because of this, I am only willing to write, and write *with*, original characters.\n\nIn terms of orientation, I can/will write any gender with any gender.  I will go ahead and say that I currently have a strong preference for mxm, but at the end of the day, it really depends on the characters we end up creating and where it goes from there.  I'd much rather prefer to try something we're both happy with and be surprised than attempt to force an idea that doesn't feel like quite the right fit.\n\nIn terms of universes/genres, I'm willing to write something loosely based on a fandom, but at the very least I'd like to be able to give things our own twist and not be bound by someone else's rules.  I am, of course, open to unique and original worlds as well!  Slice of life, whimsical fantasy, urban fantasy, post-apocalyptic, steampunk, and so many other genres are all on the table.  \n\nI have a host of pre-existing characters in mind I'd love to be able to play again, and am willing to tweak them to new genres/worlds/partners, or come up with someone completely new if that works better.  I would be happy to go into detail about a few (or many) in private messaging, but I don't want list a dozen or so here and turn this into even more of a wall of text.\n\nIf you're interested after having read so far, please, by all means send me a PM!  I'd love to discuss more.  Writing samples, character ideas, and plots are all available if you hit me up.  I do ask that you tell me at least briefly what sort of plots/characters/genres you'd be interested in as well, so I know what you're looking for.  Any other questions for me are of course also welcome.\n\nThanks so much for taking the time, and good luck in your own searches as well!\n\nCheers.  ",

This fissure is spreading quickly.. they estimate that in less than a month, our planet will crack open and deep volcanic magma will flood the surface, destroying everything.

            "selftext": "Good morning, all. Thanks for the click. Hopefully, it'll be worth your time.\n\nObviously, I'm craving a good, strong Voyager RP. It was one of the first things I ever did RP for, and it's been the love of my life since I was seven years old (take my word for it - that's a long time), and oh, I want to write for it again.\n\nI'm only interested in Voyager; I have no desire to explore any other Treks, even in crossover fashion. We can either set this during their time meandering around the Delta Quadrant, or we could explore the happenings directly after they get home - or we could even do something twenty or so years later. I'm completely down for anything, so long as I get to play with the world and characters of the show that's been one of my favorites since I was in second grade. \n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I'm not into those blue NSFW things. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories don't have gratuitous \"mature\" content, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think.\n\n* For anything set in the Delta Quadrant or directly following \"End Game,\" I will be playing Kathryn Janeway. I would very much like you to at least double as Chakotay for me (I do not support the C/7 pairing and will only accept J/C). In return, I can and will double as any canon of your choice. OCs are all right with me. Conversely, as mentioned above, I'm open to something about twenty years later - in that case, I'll be playing my own OC, J/C's spitfire, contrary rebel of a daughter.\n\nI think that's everything? -eyes list- I hope that's everything, anyway. \n\nSo! If you're interested, I very much encourage you to PM me, so we can see if we mesh! Please note that I DO NOT respond to comment replies left here under any circumstances, so please use the PM function. \n\nThank you!\n\n~Kisa",

It is similair in many ways, with its history only diverging from our nine years ago. As the ball dropped, signalling the beggining of a new year and a fresh start to many, and wishes had been shared, and moonlight kisses were had.\n10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n0.\nThe power went out everywhere in the world, for seemingly no reason. Asides from that nothing seemed wrong. Except for the metas. The first metas believed themselves to be Gods, with unlimited power over mortals. \nThe first was Anarchy. A vile woman who sought to take over all inferior 'mortals', declaring herself Queen of Boston. No one dared to stop her, many following her example and seeking to destroy governments. That is until Beacon arrived. The meta with control over light dared to stop her. The Anarchist's and Beacon's allies confronted each other, nearly levelling Boston. Beacon may have succeeded in tbe fight but both sides lost. Anarchy and Beacon had both died. However that terrible event had passed. With Boston reforming as Beacon City.\nThe FMSA. A government group in desperate need of newnrecruits after an influx of villains and other scourges\n\nThanks for reading. Really in U 3-7-7 you can be anything, vigilante, hero or villain. It just happens that right now we're short on agents and they'll be needed for upcoming events\n",

            "selftext": "Hello people! I am just a novice. I used to be into roleplay around 7 years before when they were only on forums and similar stuff. That was fun but cheap, everything was moderated by moderators who were deciding the fate of players. It was impossibly hard to kill anyone which limited the actual possibilities of the game a lot! \n___\nHow about a website? I am not yet ready to create an idea of what it should or could look like. But I want to propose some ideas if there is one in development or to start in future if there are people that would like them. \n___\nRoleplay games need moderators to watch over everyone, the game must be fair to everyone. What if a website had all the needed basic structures like shops, trading, chats, the creation of new worlds/locations, leveling up and so on? Now we don't need any moderators to watch that, the website simply won't let anyone cheat here. \n___\nBut we still need someone to overlook some not-static or blurred rules as for example the fairness of fight between 2 players or even more than 2. The fighting system based on hero level and his creativity should become handy here. \n___\n**[FS]** So how should fighting system work? We have some magic/keywords like Fire, Water, Dark Essence !? idk.. grass? We also have some action words, like shield, protect, attack, prepare and so on. Now a player can combine them in order to cast a spell, as for example to connect Fire + Water and attack with steam. Sounds cool to me. We might have some magicians that are focused on discovering new spells and stuff. Or maybe every player can test that out on their own. And this way we make it possible that real knowledge, memory and wisdom make you better in actual fights. \n___\nStill, we need people to create new worlds, we need people to entertain and initiate stuff in the game. We need a master who is the abstract entity and can do literally everything, causing the events, creating new worlds and etc. Or we can have simply a vagabond from the streets instead. \n___\n**[M]** So instead of a master the game could let people work for it. Overseers in every location or region can make events happen, they look if everything is fair while they are working and they are rewarded for a good work with XP or money. You can't be hired more than one time in a row or so. \n___\nNow it looks like the game is self-supporting. We don't really need moderators, only if there is a need to actually ban someone forever or to help players understand the game. \n___\nNow last part. Worlds or locations. People should be able to broaden their world, to conquer new worlds, to see new people. What if the whole game is the mix of thousands of different worlds? Sometimes events may create portals between them and player may travel through them saving his past, XP, abilities and so on in his own profile. If you don't like the world you can earn some money and get a scroll of teleportation or something. \n___\n**[L]** People can vote to create 1 new location every month, they together can add and write to the description and vote for one they like the most. Worlds now are self-growing. \n___\nSo far it seems possible to create, it looks like it is possible to create self-maintained roleplay world! Like some kind of Reddit with subreddits in a unique form. People can become someone else in there and travel across all the different settings. Sounds cool but still, there are few problems: \n1) Are there any websites like that already? (I can help with it or just help with ideas)\n2) Does that sound fun? \n3) It will be hard to create on my own. \n___\nEven tho this might sound like I want to start creating I am not sure yet. I love to generate ideas(half of each are useless junk so it is risky in any way) and I want to know what you guys think about that. In my opinion, it sounds wicked awesome. \n___\nI can answer ALL your questions in comments to describe how I see that either if you are a developer or just wondering what it might be. \nAlso, sorry for all the mistakes in this post, still studying English...

            "selftext": "At this point I prefer Discord due to actual logs/able to make servers specifically for an RP but I can do Steam too if one would prefer it.\n\nI'm looking for a high fantasy adventure RP of either fandom or original origin. Think action anime-level stuff like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on. The roleplays wouldn't be taking the storylines directly from those, but would rather draw inspiration from such titles. Characters facing long odds and dire situations with strong enemies with moments of explosive action and displays of power and at some point or another pulling out against the odds and getting that win. Not to say there can't be any temporary setbacking failures though. Since I have a bit of a thing for causing my characters certain problems from time to time. While I'm looking for over the top adventure scenes I prefer the focus to be on exploration and interaction with just plot driving conflicts littered in there but not being a total constant as I tend to have more of a character driven bias. Romance can happen too but I'm typically exclusive to F/F pairings and it'd take an overwhelmingly compelling partner for me to maybe bend my female character into being a male one or taking an interest in a male character. Either OOC gender is fine, what someone is IRL doesn't bug me as far as IC stuff goes. NSFW stuff at most for me is mostly gore/violence. Smut is only an option if the two characters are all lovey dovey/the plot justifies it. It's not even remotely my main interest. I also can easily post many, many times a day ranging from semi-para to multi-para depending on the situation in the scene rather easily. While I'd prefer someone who can do the same, those who at least give a few a day are fine too I suppose.\n\nFor those asking what I'm specifically/epecially after right now: Right now I'm back onto my original stuff but the principles remain the same.  High fantasy, shounen level adventure stories.  As usual I'd prefer not being approached by those with the intent of using a male character.  I've gotten nothing but bad experiences working with them.  As for ideas themselves there's either my setting, which has no typical races on it and only the 3 I've made or a sci-fi character of mine being in one of your making.  Some otherworldly cyborg girl with a rather complex history and current situation with an unclear origin and future.  Premise simply being she's looking for answers.  Her motivations other than that being able to be formed based on who she's placed with.  I only play female characters, and if you're not all too into fantastical, anime-esque occurrences we might not mesh.\n\nI prefer the characters to heavily contrast both in personality and/or in their lives/lifestyles. My characters are usually on the low energy/deadpan end of the spectrum but without most of the negative tropes associated with that like anti-social edge. So in turn I prefer more energetic, ambitious, maybe even bubbly partner characters, as long as it doesn't come off as utterly obnoxious anyway.

I'm not a writer, so my writing stamina isn't fit for daily replying like the others. Tried to tell myself I could be like them but that was a mistake so I've recently asked for a break.\n\nThing is, I feel guilty that I'd be leaving some plots unfinished by just leaving right away, some people might get mad. I decided to say that I'll stay a bit to finish them (easy since they're already nearly finished).\n\nSo that's where I'm at right now. However... is this just me justifying keeping those rp partners to myself before leaving? They have other characters who are open, so I assume that they don't mind me doing this, but I've done some tactless, power hungry things in ooc before so I'm reluctant to trust my judgement.",

            "selftext": "Nestled in a large alcove at the bottom of Mount Black Oak, thrived a large wolf pack, unknown and untouched by humankind.  The pack was left to carve the land to cater to their wants, needs, and desires. Years of sculpting the land brought forth effortlessly found paths to their hunting grounds, due north of the mountain and to a large river that flowed northeast of the hunting grounds. The pack flourished for years until a forest fire set in motion a famine that wiped out most of their numbers, and killed both Alphas. The famine would rage on for two full years before its deathly vice grip on the land loosened, and soon elk, deer, and other such animals came back in small then large herds. Giving the pack a much needed feast to feed all. Yes, things were coming back full swing for the weakened pack, spring was here and new life was breathing a lung full of air for the first time. Predators and prey formed an unspoken peace treaty at the river, neither side would attack the other. It wasn't long before new Alphas took the roles of their deceased Alphas, making sure to properly provide for the remaining few pack members. Months had past since the ending of the famine, things were stable, and the pack was slowly gaining back its numbers.\n---------------------------------------------------\nPosting the first real advertisement for a Discord, feral wolf roleplay.

I also only do gay romance.\n\nI personally prefer Action-Adventure, Fantasy (usually) and super hero based as far as what I can do with genres. However, I can usually adapt to more, even if they aren't always my forte. Been on a Harry Potter kick lately and I wanna have some fun with that, but not a dealbreaker.\n\nHope to hear from you guys soon! I look forward to seeing what it is we can come up with!",

            "selftext": "### Realm of Angarak\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What is Angarak?\n---\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What makes it unique?\n---\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What are the 'requirements'?\n---\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### Tl;Dr\n----\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nSearching for an exceptional partner or two with whom to spin fantastical tales. Really hoping to find someone that intends to stick around. I\u2019ve attempted to keep it short and sweet below, but feel free to ask questions if you\u2019re curious.\n\n3rd person\n\nLong-term only. This means months, my pals, four days doesn\u2019t count. If you tend to dip out, let\u2019s just not get started. \n\nMulti-para posts via email or GoogleDocs only. Seriously. I don\u2019t Discord or Kik. Minimum 4 paragraphs, more preferred. Descriptive, illustrative, well crafted writing. I want to dive into a story through the description. \n\nPost minimum 1x a day, more would be great. Really. More would be awesome. (I totally get that sometimes a day or two is busy and you need to focus on something else, I\u2019m not a dictator, but if you\u2019re not up for frequent posting, I\u2019m not your ideal partner).\n\nBe 21+. For all of the reasons. All of them. I like every bit of it.\n\nRomance is non-negotiable. Everything else revolves around the love story. There should be a whole host of action and adventure unfolding along the way, but I like what I like. \n\nYou must be willing to play the straight, male, lead. I have a very specific type. Big, broad, muscular, alpha personality type. Beards and tattoos are optional, but welcome. Open beyond that for the most part, and happy to repay certain favors. As the writer, you do you, it's only the character I'm concerned with. \n\nHave ideas! This is a collaboration. I write some stuff, you write some stuff. We occasionally brainstorm a particular arc and go from there. Surprises are good. I\u2019m not looking to drag dead weight. Therefore you must be willing to communicate about the story.\n\nRecently, I've been interested in both realistic and sort of a twist on fantasy, both historical and modern. This is by no means an exhaustive list, feel free to bring something else to the table:\n\n - Historical time travel. Modern damsel lands in the past. \n - Supernatural. Werewolves, vampires, and hunters, oh my. Think in terms of Anne Rice, Supernatural, maybe a little Anita Blake. Original is nice too. Nothing should sparkle, ever. Would really, really, REALLY love a werewolf these days. \n - Arranged marriage. The medieval sort, not modern. Betrothed from birth or to draw peace between warring kingdoms.\n - Guardian. Another historical piece, involving a bounty, the end of a bloodline, and an assassin who won't take an innocent life. \n - Anything with a military male lead, be it modern or all the way back to Rome. \n - Bad Blood. A criminal empire on the brink of war, an innocent bystander thrown into the mix. \n\nResearch is not required, creative license and close approximation are fine. \n\nI prefer reality(ish) and to keep my fantastical themes in the character type realm (werewolves, vampires, fairy tale creatures, etc). Occasional light magics and supernatural influences, deities, etc work fine.\n\nThe story is everything. One of those epic, wrenching, exciting tales a la Pearl Harbor, Titanic, Braveheart, King Arthur, (and even a few with happier endings). Original content preferred.\n\nSo, come along then, let\u2019s have a chat. What has inspired you lately? What story are you aching to write? Bring an idea and let\u2019s discuss.\n",

Khadgar being such a large continent there exceptions to its terrain. But mostly consists of harsh cold climates, scorching hot deserts or the barren flatlands known as the Deadlands.\n\nThe Church of Kadgarth  forbids magic, however with some exceptions being the mage academy in the capital city of Ethilium named after her highness Ethilia. This mage academy is only tolerated because her grace deems magic necessary to suppress any rebellions among the common folk of Khadgar. All mages are conscripted into the army where they cannot marry, nor have children. Mages who escaped their shackles are hunted down by the church as apostates. Mythological creatures are prevalent and abundant in Khadgar. Sprites, Werebeasts, Wyverns, Chimeras, Goblins and Orcs to name just a few.\n\nKnown neutral (playable) races are elves , dwarves, nords , and humans.",

            "selftext": "A couple of years ago I stopped roleplaying, I had grown tired of it, everyone seemed to want over-the-top roleplays with drama behind every corner, planned relationships, permanent thrill, dramatic backstories... seeing an explosion might be cool the first 2 or three times, but when you see one every few minutes it just becomes dull and boring. That's how I felt about the roleplay. And sadly I could never find a partner who was willing to do it different.\n\n\nI love characters who act with reason and realistic emotion, who don't meet another character and never ask any questiond about them but just proceed to a romantic relationship. Characters who don't just seem like puppets played by their creator, but feel as if they had their own head. \n\n\n\nBut enough of that talk, let's get to the *juicy* part...!\n\nWeissburg is a large island far east of the mainland. Human civilization didn't know of it's existence up until 200 years ago when an expedition crew discovered the humid island in search for farmland.\n\nNot long after setting foot on the island the humans now called \"Weissburg\" due to the almost white, oddly shaped mountains, they encountered the island's inhabitants, a humanoid race called Val'Drith.\n\nUnfortunately a combination of misunderstandings and fear led to the death of several humans and Val'Drith in a single day, forcing the expedition crew to retreat after just a few days.\n\n200 years forward,Val'Drith and humans still haven't forgotten the incident and try to point fault to the opposing faction.\nDue to this conflict there is a strong racial tension among both sides, export and import is limited to the very minimum and Val'Drith are only allowed on the mainland with temporary permits, also forbidding them to leave the capital city.\n\n\nWhile merchants and nobles from both sides demand less limitation on the trade with Weissburg, citizens fear the unknown  and strange people from far away, rumours are born and spread land-wide dread. \n\nThe king is no longer safe on his throne, being shaken by the masses of his own people who demand his support and power to ensure their safety.\n\n\nOf course many see their opportunity in this situation, the church had been displeased with their king since he was put on the throne, King Zathkis had proven himself to not be the most competent of his kind, resembling more of  a lazy and naive young man instead of a man willing to help his land and people thrive.\n\nThus the church tries to be in favour of the people, responding to their cries for help and safety, while spreading the word of Val'Drith being demonic offspring, destroying written information about the race all the while watching the citizen's support for their king crumble, leaving Zathkis stuck inbetween two sides, both demanding different things.\n\n\n**Here you come into play!**\n\n\nFollowing the advice of his closest advisors, Zathkis assembled an expedition crew to send to Weissburg for a year. \n*You* are a well educated individual from a noble family, you are given the task to document and record your journey, get to know about Val'Drith and their culture, write everything down and deliver your findings back home.\n\nWhat the king and his advisors hope to achieve this way, is to eradicate the spread rumours about their neighbours and put an end to the racial tensions, at the same time stripping the church of it's new-found power and find out of how much value Weissburg actually is.\n\n\nBut you won't go alone of course! \n\nThe church has its own horse in the race: \n\n[Belial](https://i.imgur.com/qoqjkYk.jpg) is an around 60 year old priest who had been banished from the church years ago, but was accepted back in right before the announcement of the expedition, not much is known about him except for general data, even to the king who you can of course ask for further information.\n\n\nWhile most of the crew consists of experienced sailors, there are also two Val'Drith coming with you.\n[Dwareeletep](https://i.imgur.com/EtomoLu.jpg) and [Aeskulaph](https://i.imgur.com/AWvIM7v.jpg) are overseas merchants who have volunteered to guide you and the crew on your journey and introduce you to their people.\n\nWhile Dwa mainly does it for the reward and to join his friend, Aeskulaph has a high interest in the mainland and their inhabitants, he is one of just a handful of Val'Drith who know how to speak your language, even fluently.\n\n\nWho exactly your characters is is up to you, as long as it makes sense. \n\nI kept character descriptions very vague on purpose, characters should get to know each other gradually.\n\nNow to a few points:\n\n\n-You and everyone has full freedom of choice, just keep in mind that everything you do can and will have consequences, so if you go on a killing spree, expect to die aswell.\n\n-Freedom of choice can include sexual and bloody content, depending on your choices and what happens.\n\n-Of course the same goes for relationships, just keep in mind that my characters have their own head and decide themselves how they want to interact with your OC.\n\n-I actually prefer male characters, no matter if relationships stay platonic or become romantic.\n\n-Please no anime or real pictures.\n\n\n-We can write wherever you feel most comfortable (but please no Reddit PM...) \n\n\n-I would like to write in a semi literate style, but beware! English is not my first language so I might be lacking here and there.\n\n\nAny more questions? Ask away!\n\n\nWant to delve right in? Shoot me a message!",

            "selftext": "**Introduction**    \nHail, and well met!  I am a writer of twelve years, give or take.  I love creating new and original worlds, and more than that I love designing diverse and flawed characters, and even *more* than that I cannot get enough when it comes to character development.  Putting my characters through the ringer and having them grow as I write them is one of the most satisfying things for me, so as such, I really do prefer long-term RPs, and partners who are interested in sticking around for the long haul!  I'm looking to make friends, not just roleplay partners.  If all of this sounds fun to you, continue reading!\n\n**Settings**    \nThe types of settings I enjoy are pretty wide.  I love me some good ol' fashioned fantasy, as well as sci-fi full of techobabble.  Modern elements with a twist, like magic or super powers, are also great fun.  Below are some settings I enjoy in no particular order, but of course I'm more than happy to design original ones as well.\n\n* Elder Scrolls\n* Star Wars\n* Mass Effect\n* Dragon Age\n* Dungeons and Dragons\n* Lord of the Rings\n* Marvel (Cinematic Universe preferred)\n* Western\n* The Last of Us\n\n**Plots**    \nI've got some neat ideas bubbling in my brain, and we are by no means restricted to just these.  If they sound fun, let me know!  I'm happy to do them as is or adjust them to fit other scenarios.\n\n&gt;**Skyrim** - *Thief In Over Her Head*\n&gt;&gt;I would play a Khajiit thief, just looking to survive in Tamriel.  We could play in Cyrodiil, Skyrim, or really any other location as well (though those two are the ones I know the best).  Maybe she gets into trouble with the local Thieves' Guild by unwittingly stealing from one of its members.  Perhaps she angers an official and they perform the Black Sacrament and seek to have her killed by Dark Brotherhood assassins.  Or maybe she was in the wrong place at the wrong time and disrupted a cult from summoning some Daedra.  You may be one of these factions out to get her, or a newfound ally working to protect her.  The sky's the limit!\n\n&gt;**Skyrim** - *World Weary Wanderer*\n&gt;&gt;My character is an aspiring spellcasting Argonian named Drinks-the-World.  She wants to see all the sights.  All of them.  Hear there's talk of a massive statue to Azura?  Already bolting out the door.  Some say there's a mudcrab over a hundred miles away the size of a barn door?  Packing her bags as we speak.  This one is a lot more loose, but I'm really enamored with the character.\n\n&gt;**Star Wars** - *Good Guys, Bad Guys, Made-Up Words*\n&gt;&gt;This could take place in virtually any era, but I enjoy dealing with bucketheads too much to avoid the Empire or First Order eras.  Mine is a smuggler/pirate making a living for herself by doing whatever suits her best.  Yours is a rival or a crew member?  Many adventures ensue!\n\nThose are what I've got at the moment, but I'm sure to have more ideas by the time you folks contact me.  I'll either edit them in, or share what I've got for the settings you suggest!\n\n**Contact Me**    \nIf you've made it this far and you'd like to hit me up, please send me a PM or a chat request here on Reddit!  One liners will be ignored.  *Please* give me something to work with, a little bit about yourself or a little bit about the ideas you may have.  Simply saying you have ideas and giving me your Discord won't cut it, sorry!",

Action, adventure, love, lust, dungeon diving, saving kingdoms from dragons, whatever. I want to do it all.\n\nJust to be clear...\n\n- I will not be DMing, I am bad at it but I am a great player!\n\n- Discord only!\n\n- Creative, descriptive partners only!\n\n- NSFW themes (sexual, adult, etc.)\n\n- I'm bisexual and don't care about your gender or orientation\n\n- Not interested in flirting OOC, so keep that away from me, but I'm always up for making new friends!\n\nAnyway, I hate dtagging these threads out so if you're interested just message me and we can chat on Discord and work from there. \n",

            "selftext": "Gale ran his longsword through the demon's chest before pushing it off his blade and letting it fall to the ground. He stood over the being and delivered a final blow through its head, ensuring it wouldn't be getting back up anytime soon. The battle was over, and the last of the hellish invaders were dealt with. But the town had been massacred, half of it lay in waste, while the other half burned from unending hellfire. Gale prepared to gather to his sword and leave before a sound caught his attention. He grabbed his blade and moved towards the source, expecting an ambush laying in wait. Instead, he finds a teenager. Barely conscious and hurt badly. \n\nAnd that's where our story begins, Gale finding a child that's lost their entire world, and taking them in as he journeys to put a stop to this war with Hell. \n\nSo! A few details I know you're curious about, what race are we both? Well Gale will be Human, as for your character. Feel free to choose whatever fantasy race tickles your fancy most. Gale is an honorable man, and all children need a protector.\n\nDo you need to be a teen? Preferably yes, a young child would be a bit too much of a burden for this story and a teen would fit perfectly. \n\nWhat I'd like out of the rp? I would love for a father/teen relationship to develop over time. Whether it's father/son or father/daughter is up to you. \n\nI'd also love if over the course of the story, for your character to become interested in joining Gale's brotherhood and becoming a knight. (This isn't necessary, but I would like it.)\n\nA bit about the world. Typical medieval fantasy era but with your standard low end steam tech thrown in. Your typical tropes, Dwarves are most advanced technologically. Elves love nature. (Most at least, Drow are learning to favor tech.) Humans are the middle ground. Other races are here or there in their respective normal tropes. \n\nThe world itself is Ospade. A grand world of magic and fantasy, we reside in the Alahan Empire. One of the larger kingdoms, currently besieged by forces of the realm of fire and suffering. \n\nAdditional details, the typically fantasy racism tropes are boring as fuck so I'm gunna avoid them. I typically try to write 1-3 paragraphs depending on what is currently happening. I try to go for more paragraphs when I'm describing scenes or situations. I go for less when the two of us are interacting. Just so conversation can flow more naturally. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to pm me. If this sounds like an rp you'd love to participate in, I'd love to hear from you! \n\nGood day and have a great time!",

I very much enjoy exploring darker themes and situations however this doesn't mean it's an exclusive focus on these things. \n\nI do expect a decent amount of content back and forth, 3-5 paragraphs minimum. Introductory posts are of course longer. \n\nI'm specifically looking for partners who has the ability to not just describe their characters feelings and characteristics but also the characteristics of the world around them. \n\nI am looking for someone who tends to take on characters that are clever, dominate, intense, manipulative and patient. \n\nI have a few settings in mind but am incredibly flexible as far as that is concerned.\n\nI would love to try out something sort of Black Mirror style. Technology gone wrong. \n\nDM me with details, I'm always on.",

            "selftext": "As the title says, I am seeking an rp partner. Ideally, it would be for long-term, character driven RP, but I am not opposed to one-off lines. \n\nMore information:\n\n**The player:** \n\n- Well over 21, 15+ years of experience with text-based RP with a love of character development, exploration, and the written word.\n\n- Prefer to write in 3rd person, with posts ~500 words or thereabouts. Quantity isn't quality, however, and sometimes quick, snappy replies are necessary. I like realistic dialogue, no holding two different conversations at the same time. My posts tend to be a mix of introspection and moving the scene forward, depending on what is called for in the scene. \n\n- Most active on the weekends and sometimes during the week depending on work schedules and real life. I live in Pacific time. \n\n- Can play female or male characters, currently inclined toward playing women. Prefer f/f or m/m storylines first, m/f second, but character dynamics trumps everything for me.\n\n- Open to a variety of genres and thematic elements, including NSFW stuff and darker storylines. I do like to balance things - even in the midst of dark storylines, having some light-hearted fun is possible. \n\n- Can write via Discord, hangouts, or email. \n\n\n**Looking for:**\n\n- Someone over 21. I don't care how much experience you have as long as you are capable of writing coherently. \n\n- Open to OOC communication, especially on days where we can't post, even if it's just for plotting purposes or to check in.\n\n- Someone who enjoys character development. I tend to focus on character growth as plotting isn't necessarily a strong suit for me, so having someone who likes that would be a great help.\n\n- Willing to world-build and/or brainstorm ideas.\n\n- Understanding that life comes first. Sometimes we get busy and sometimes creativity dries up. I'll do my best to check in regularly if I'm not responding; I'd appreciate the same.\n\n\n**Ideas:**\n\nI'm happy to brainstorm new, original ideas with people or work on taking existing ideas (from either of us) and making them unique. As I said above, I'm big on character development and growth; some of my favorite themes involves two characters getting to know each other and eventually developing intense bonds, exploring new worlds together, or outsiders trying to figure out a way in which they exist in their world with each other. Mind games are also fun (only in character). \n\nSetting-wise, fantasy and sci-fi worlds are my favorite. Not big on urban fantasy focused on traditional urban fantasy creatures (vampires and werewolves primarily) or strictly historical stuff without a fantastical element. I prefer original characters over fandom characters but I'm willing to work with fictional worlds (e.g., Hogwarts, Warcraft, the Kushiel books, etc) even if I am not super familiar with the fandom. Superheroes is my one other exception to modern worlds - masked superheroes are always fun. \n\nIf any of this sparks your interest, PM me and we can talk. \n\n(edit: ignore my edits and formatting mishaps. first time posting on reddit.)",

I'm Casey, a 23-year-old female who loves to roleplay, specifically in the world of Harry Potter, or in a high fantasy world (Skyrim, LoTR, Inheritance Cycle, etc.) As you may have guessed from the post, I'm looking for a long-term roleplay partner.\n\nHere's some things you need to know before contacting me:\n\n**Age:**\nI'm 23, so it is a must that you are 18+, and preferably 20+\n\n**Timezone:**\nI'm in EST, but I'm up at all kinds of crazy hours, so don't worry about me not replying because of time zones. Note: I do still sleep. Sometimes.\n\n**How often I reply:** \nI literally have nothing to do all day, so I'll reply as often as you do, without hesitation.\n\n**Preferred contact:** \nI'm good with either email or Discord. PM me here for that information.\n\n**Length:** \nI match my partner. I prefer 1-3 paragraph posts, but can go up to about 5 paragraphs.\n\n**Writing Style:** \n3rd person, past tense paragraph or multi-paragraph. At least semi-lit please.  \n\n**About the Writing:**\nI really love romance and plot building, but I'm not opposed to smut that makes sense. I prefer M/F pairings, but I play both male and female. You may be able to talk me into a M/M or F/F if I really like the characters. That leads me to my next point...\n\n**Character Preferences:** \n* *Harry Potter*\nI really *really* love Draco, Hermione (Dramione usually), Sirius, Remus, and just the general Marauders Era. I prefer Marauders or post-Hogwarts in the main timeline. I have written some Next Gen, and I prefer Scorpius Malfoy in that cast of characters. Let me know if you have any others you'd like to explore or play with, I'm open to suggestion.\n* *Other Fandoms*\nI'm open to writing OCs in the Skyrim, LoTR, or Inheritance Cycle (Eragon) universes. \n* *Original Plots*\nHave an original plot? If it's fantasy, I'm probably down to at least give it a shot! Message me and pitch me your idea!\n\nI think I've rambled on enough, so let me know if you'd like to know more!",

            "selftext": "So lemme explain. I've had this \"monster under the bed\" character for a while now; he's just an old, grumpy, harmless, awkward, goofy and not-so-scary big furry monster, living under people's beds (and if you were on shamchat a few months ago, you've probably met him!). For some reason I've fallen in love with him and I absolutely adore seeing other people interact with him. He's always there, listening to you telling him about your day, his glowing yellow eyes carefully looking after you every night. Sometimes he comes out, but most of the time he just stays hidden under the bed, occasionally trying to playfully scare you when you're sleeping.\n\nSo yeah, who wouldn't want to be friends with the monster under their bed? Just think of coming home from a long and boring day at work/school and the monster being there to cheer you up. Or we can do something more \"story-like\". Also a good thing about the monster is that he is completely adaptable to almost any story; he can be goofy and funny, or dark and mysterious if you want to do something more serious.\n\nConflicts can be really fun, too. You don't have to always be nice with the monster; in fact, he can be a pretty annoying roommate sometimes. And you also don't necessarily have to be friends with him; you can be mad at him for not paying rent. Or you can try to shove him out of your room because you don't want a monster living under your bed. All of these things can make the relationship between you (or your character) and the monster even funnier. \n\nGonna say it just to make sure, I'm really looking for something SFW. Which, of course, doesn't mean that there can't be jokes and awkward conversations about the fact that the monster is living, well, under your bed (wink wink).\n\nMy literacy level isn't very high, also English is not my first language, and I'm from France so y'know, time zones.\n\nSo um, that's all I guess. I'm of course open to ideas. I'm only available on kik (and reddit chat maybe?) for now, but over time I'm probably gonna be on other chat platforms. Thanks for reading!",

I'm willing to guide you along if you have very minimal knowledge,  but I'll say right now that you're going to be *very* confused if you are not experienced in the SCP Wiki.\n\nMy post length and number of replies per day will vary, but I have an average of three to four paragraphs and at least twice a day. Speaking of days, my schedule is off the charts. I'm not always available, and sometimes I'm available in the dead of night when you're supposed to be asleep. It's wierd.\n\nI have a few ideas on how this roleplay could go, which range from something as simple as a therapist assigned to one of the many Mobile Task Force's or something as outlandish as an 05 commissioning the use of SCP-212 on a 'voluntary' bodyguard. That's something that happens believe it or not, I shit you not. There's a lot to play in this, and I couldn't be more excited to play it with a partner that is interested.\n\nIf you are that partner, hit me up! I'd love to talk to you and bang out some ideas.",

Sorry, there's no implications there towards your skill level but as an adult privately messaging a kid on the internet is a little weird.\n\nFandoms: Fullmetal Alchemist Darker Than Black, Black Butler, DC Comics/Animated Universe (specifically batman), Marvel, Pokemon, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and probably more! \n\nWe can rp wherever you want, as long as I can access said platform from my computer.

I'm an 18 year-old male and I'm in search of a new roleplay partner. \nI have a couple years of experience in roleplaying and can play both 3rd and 1st person perspective. \nAs I stated in the title, I hope for you to be at least 18 years of age, anything above that is fine with me. \nI have no preference towards any specific timezones, all I ask of you is to reply somewhat regularly. We all have lives and I am well aware of that. \nI don't mind OOC chatting and getting to know the people I roleplay with. But it is not a must if you aren't looking for that.\n\nI already have some idea's based on story driven roleplays in my head but I'd love to hear what things you come up with. Let me know in the comments if you're interested or hit me up in the DM's so we can see if we get along, decide on which platform to use, and work a roleplay out.\n\nHope to hear from you soon.\nCheers folks!",

My main hobbies are music, videogames, anime, overworking myself, and bumming around in my spare time.\n\n\nI've rated my prompts and fandoms with a 1-5 star rating based on how interested I am in doing an RP pertaining to this right now.\n\n\n**FANDOMS**\n\n\nSoul Eater \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBoku no Hero Academia \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nShin Megami Tensei / Persona \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nOverwatch \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nHunter x Hunter \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nHarry Potter \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nStar Wars \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nPokemon \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nElder Scrolls \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nFallout \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nWarhammer 40K \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nShadowrun \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nWorld of Darkness / Vampire: The Masquerade \u2605\u2605\n\n\n**NON FANDOM RP IDEAS**\n\n\nSuperheroes \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nZombies/Apocalypse \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nOriginal High Fantasy World \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nOriginal Sci-Fi /Cyberpunk World \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nNoir / Neo-Noir \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nYandere \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nSlice of Life \u2605\u2605",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI'm currently searching for a one on one roleplay partner, as stated in the title.  I've been writing on forums for over a decade, and although I've always enjoyed it immensely, that medium no longer suits my lifestyle well.  I no longer have the amount of free time  that's needed keep multiple threads with multiple characters and multiple partners going all at once, and I hate being the person who takes ages to reply. What I'd much rather do is find one person I mesh well with that I can dedicate my attention to!\n\nI'm hoping to find someone who is really into character-driven writing.  I love world building and I'm fine with throwing in some action, but what I adore most is just digging into characters, figuring them out, letting them change and grow as they interact with each other, and building something truly special between two characters (I'm not talking strictly about romance, either - even characters driven by hate and anger can be something amazing to write when the writers have the right chemistry!).  Because of this, I am only willing to write, and write *with*, original characters.\n\nIn terms of orientation, I can/will write any gender with any gender.  I will go ahead and say that I currently have a strong preference for mxm, but at the end of the day, it really depends on the characters we end up creating and where it goes from there.  I'd much rather prefer to try something we're both happy with and be surprised than attempt to force an idea that doesn't feel like quite the right fit.\n\nIn terms of universes/genres, I'm willing to write something loosely based on a fandom, but at the very least I'd like to be able to give things our own twist and not be bound by someone else's rules.  I am, of course, open to unique and original worlds as well!  Slice of life, whimsical fantasy, urban fantasy, post-apocalyptic, steampunk, and so many other genres are all on the table.  \n\nI have a host of pre-existing characters in mind I'd love to be able to play again, and am willing to tweak them to new genres/worlds/partners, or come up with someone completely new if that works better.  I would be happy to go into detail about a few (or many) in private messaging, but I don't want list a dozen or so here and turn this into even more of a wall of text.\n\nIf you're interested after having read so far, please, by all means send me a PM!  I'd love to discuss more.  Writing samples, character ideas, and plots are all available if you hit me up.  I do ask that you tell me at least briefly what sort of plots/characters/genres you'd be interested in as well, so I know what you're looking for.  Any other questions for me are of course also welcome.\n\nThanks so much for taking the time, and good luck in your own searches as well!\n\nCheers.  ",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to DM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have. Firstly, a few important notes about me and what I'm looking for.\n\nI roleplay in first-person. Your choice in point-of-view doesn't matter to me at all, I'm fine with whatever you pick!\n\n**I want you to be the DM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\n---\n\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, **please send a PM to /u/LordDurand and we can discuss further. I will not reply to PMs sent to this account.**\n\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\n\nThat all said, DMing can be a big responsibility and is definitely a large role to play. That's why, if you want me to, I'll DM an RP for you if you do the same for me! The RP I DM for you does not have to be one of the fandoms listed below, it doesn't even have to be a fandom at all. Just tell me what kind of RP you want me to DM for you and I'll see if we can work something out. Of course, you'll need to be willing to hold up your side of the deal too!\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\n\n**KonoSuba**\n\nMy character would be a member of the Adventurer Guild in the world of KonoSuba, though he could either be a native there or end up there like Kazuma. The RP could be entirely OCs or have canon characters, though I'd prefer canon characters to be in it, whether on their own or with OCs sprinkled in (especially since I'm absolutely in love with Megumin).\n\nI do have one idea for the story that's pretty far detached from the story and structure of the show. My character would be a native to the world, or at least someone who's been there a long time. He'd be a monster hunter who runs a restaurant. He goes out and hunts monsters solely to supply meat for the restaurant. It'd be a mix of a restaurant management type of thing, as well as having a lot of monster hunting. He could also take on quests for people, in exchange for getting to hire them as employees (either working as party members or in the restaurant). There could even be sections where he travels to other places to set up more restaurants or to hunt exotic monsters.\n\nOf course, if you aren't a fan of that, we could have the more standard fare of an adventurer and his party taking on quests and exploring the world. In that case, it might be more interesting to give the entire RP a road trip vibe, instead of having it take place around a central hub.\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**\n\nThis would work best in a completely alternate Universe from any of the Parts, but versions of the canon characters could still appear. However, if you'd rather have it set in a canon Universe, or even during one of the Parts, that'd be fine too. For setting, I think either a school setting or some kind of grand adventure (like Parts 3 and 7) would work best.\n\nFor the school setting, my idea is that there's a boarding school for people with supernatural powers (Hamon Users, vampires, Stand Users, Spin Users, etc.). However, all the students are competing with each other, for the person who graduates at the top of their class will receive the prized possession of the school: the Requiem Arrow. In order to reach the top, many students have taken to trying to eliminate any competition they face. The school itself could have a secretive history and purpose that can be revealed over time.\n\nAs for the grand adventure setting, I was thinking maybe a pirate-esque thing, where the world is flooded and my character and his party are sailing the world in search of something. This one would need a lot more work though, since the idea I have is pretty rough.\n\n**Dragon Ball**\n\nThe idea I had for this one is actually heavily inspired by one of the Parts of JoJo. My idea is that, in the far-future of the main series (or in an alternate universe), the dragon balls become closely guarded to prevent anyone unworthy from making wishes. Each of the dragon balls is held by a Keeper. Every year, the Keepers set up a world-spanning event, where everyone is invited to participate. All participants gather at one place, at which point the locations of all seven Keepers is revealed to them. From then on, it's a race to not only reach the various Keepers, but to pass their tests in order to obtain their dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are taken from their Keepers, the location of a hidden shrine is revealed to everyone who has at least one of the dragon balls. The dragon balls only work when gathered together at this shrine, drawing all the holders to one spot for a final battle.\n\nI think this idea would be great in terms of character development. All characters would be working towards the goal of having their one wish granted while on a long journey, giving them plenty of time to develop. I'm thinking that before the race begins, some time can be spent showing the main characters training for it. Maybe they're training together, or maybe they're miles apart and only meet for the first time at the starting point of the race.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\n\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.",

Ya know, i find some of the people i encounter really chill on here, though they get bored of it and they never talk again. I rather not have that, i just don't want an RP, i also want someone to just chat with in general.\n\nI am within the pacific timezone, it is currently 8:50 PM, keep that within mind when PM'ing me and i don't respond, i may just be asleep.\n\nHere's some more info about me, i started to Roleplay when i was eleven(I'm 16 Currently) with a few friends, on Roblox of all places. So i have plenty of experience behind me. I've RP'ed various scenarios and events, I've also had plenty of the NSFW/ERP's within my time(Though i'm not looking for them at the moment).\n\nReally, i don't really know what I'm looking for really roleplay wise, I'm just looking for someone to chill with and roleplay with.

            "selftext": "Hey! So, for a while I used to only do 1x1 roleplays, but after I doing just one roleplay with a GM guiding things, I've become pretty hooked on that way of running things. It helps to have one person controlling the world and cast of characters, while the other person focuses on reacting to the world and exploring the story that's being written. I've played as both the player and the GM, and I've loved them both, but right now I'm really looking for a GM. If you're interested, but want me to GM, well...alright, you could probably convince me if you have a good enough idea! I just really want a well written roleplay with a diverse cast of characters and tons of fun things to do.\n\nOf course, GMing is a lot of work, so I'd certainly be willing to help you in any way I can. There's no point in a roleplay if both people aren't having fun, so I really want to make sure we both enjoy it!\n\nWith that out of the way, here's some ideas I had in mind.\n\nSuperheroes\u00a0It was two decades ago when the first superhumans appeared. People with extraordinary powers that defied all logic and physics. Now, there were thousands of them. It was still rare to develop super powers, but every major city in the world had them now. I'd play as the latest person to develop powers. A normal guy who one day was bestowed with incredible abilites! In a world full of heroes and villains, there's hundreds of possible stories to be told!\n\nMagic School\u00a0This is pretty clearly Harry Potter inspired, but I don't want to lean on that too much. Ideally, I'd like for us to build something new and novel here, even as we adapt Harry Potter tropes. For one, I envision the students being older, more like college aged. In this story, I'd be a student who recently got accepted to a Magical Academy depsite the fact that, until that moment, I had no idea magic was real!\n\nSlice Of Life\u00a0This one is a little harder to write a whole paragraph explaining, but it's also the one that needs it the least. It'd be fun just to roleplay through a normal, modern, slice-of-life roleplay. A world that was just a little bit more fantastic and fun than ours.\n\nWonderland/Narnia\u00a0In this roleplay, I'd be an adult visiting my old childhood home. While visiting, I end up finding that the fantasy world I used to play in when I was a child, which I thought was just my overactive imagination, is actually real! I return to it as an adult, but things have changed and now I have to do what I can to save it!\n\nAnyway, those are my ideas. I'm open to others, of course! Also, while I am male, I'm equally comfortable playing male or female characters, so that's something we can work out once we're talking.\n\nFinally, most of these roleplays have some potential for adult situations. I enjoy a fair bit of smut in my roleplays, and there's certainly a chance that violence or other dark themes could come up. With that in mind, I'm only interested in partners who are over 18.\n\nAnyway, that's it! Please PM me if you're interested in talking about a roleplay! If not, thanks for reading, and have a great day!",

            "selftext": "Hello there peoples!\n\nI am currently grinding through the two sets of .Hack Playstation games (Infection, Mutation, Outbreak, Quarantine, Rebirth, Reminiscence, Redemption, Recode) and would love someone to write with. I am happy with either R:1 or R:2 and I am happy to use canons or OCs. Should we go with OCs, I do want the characters to be created fairly and not to become some overpowered player. I also want to play with their offline lives as well as their online ones. So while I am open to us using OCs, my comfort is with canons.\n\nIn general I give around 3-4 paragraphs every day or every other day. I don't really like writing NSFW content but I am capable of doing so if an opportunity presents itself. Overall though, I love development and don't care much for constant drama and NSFW themes. That's not to say I'm not open to darker plots but I RP to escape and for me, if things are tense or awkward, it makes it tough to really get in the mood to write. It can kill my interest if a plot is super dark and intense.\n\nAnd lastly, I play both genders and if we double, that would be swell.\n\nSo if anyone is interested in adventuring in The World, hit me up!",

            "selftext": "**Gotham:**\n\nI'm looking solely to play *Oswald Cobblepot* opposite an *Edward Nygma*. I'm open to AUs so long as we remain in Gotham, and I'm current on the show (I'd prefer if you were as well, but it's not mandatory). I'm not really looking to double, but I would be open to the idea if playing a lady!OC opposite either a fleshed-out!Isabella or Sofia Falcone. Please also note I will not assign 'roles' to Ed or Os - neither will be strictly 'top' or 'bottom'. \n\n**Telltale Batman:**\n\nI'm looking for someone who has played all of both seasons (or at least the first few episodes of the second season). Mostly I'm wanting to play *Bruce* opposite a *John Doe/Joker* :c I'm open to polyamory (because, to be honest, I ship Bruce with everyone from Selina to Oswald to Harvey). I'm also tentatively open to the possibility of playing John Doe, though you might have to talk me into it. I'd very much prefer to go AU here, see if there isn't some middle ground to be found for what happens to John by the last episode :c \n\nI'm also a major proponent of not killing off Riddler so early; again, I'm not looking to double per se, but I'd want to write a lady!OC opposite a Riddler :c\n\n* You *might* be able to talk me into an MCU RP, but only if you're willing to play Loki for me. Again, though, I'll be super picky since my muse has moved on. Ask if you're curious; open to doubling, but picky on characters.\n\n**Boring Shit**\n\nEmail only. 18+ partners only. I do have a discord for OOC purposes, but I prefer we talk over email before switching to discord. I would like a partner who can reply at least three times a week; more is always encouraged but not necessary. If you're going to be away for an extended period of time, please let me know ahead of time.\n\nI write in third person past tense and I like longer posts. I have a three paragraph minimum per character per post but again, more is encouraged, especially since I'm sure I'll be writing more than that. I would like to have a sample of your writing as well - a sample post, so I can see how well our styles would mesh. Please don't be offended if I turn you down based on this.\n\nWhen you contact me, please tell me your limits! I don't fade to black and prefer not to. On the whole, I'm not looking for smut-centric RPs, though I'm open to the idea if you are. Talk to me!\n\nI'm not necessarily looking to double, but given the right circumstances, you could talk me into it with minimal difficulty. I'm open to all pairs here (m/f, f//, m//, et al). Canon/canon for the most part, unless you're willing to include my OC in a doubling capacity. I am open to the idea of polyamory, so if that's something you want to play, feel free to mention it.\n\nDisclaimer: Please don't contact me if you're going to disappear. It's exhausting tracking down people and I refuse to do it anymore; it just sucks because I'm getting my hopes up ;v; If you're gone for more than a week with no notice and no contact, I'll assume you're gone.\n\nPlease do not contact me asking me to play something that isn't mentioned in this ad, or that gives me no information. I want to know **up-front** what you want to play, who you want to play/play against, your limits, if you want to use discord, your writing sample, and anything else that you think I ought to know. I shouldn't have to pull the information out of you! This is cooperative writing, not me playing your DM and forcing the interaction. If you send me a message in such a way that it's obvious you've skipped over everything, it will be deleted. :c Sorry not sorry.\n\nThat said, please don't hesitate to contact me if I've piqued your interest!",

They'll be teenagers, maybe a tad younger if you want. This can evolve into darker themes like the two breaking the law or running off together. Who knows? Crazy kids. ;3\n\nMy other idea was based off Stranger Things. Never heard of it? I can explain it rather well but keeping things a secret is always fun so it isn't hard for you to act clueless in roleplay and the twists! :) But it'd either have our characters be young and still 'innocent' like (depends on what your character is like), but this will possibly also turn into something darker.\n\nOverall, this will involve young love. (I accept fxf, or fxm.)\n\nIf you are curious of either or want to hit me up with your own, I'm available. X3 My requirements are keeping the roleplay focused on the story AND be literate. I don't want a novel but I want 7+ lines per response. That isn't a lot to ask. :&lt; I roleplay on discord, kik, even reddit. I may try out hangouts but who knows?

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! \n\nLike everyone else, I\u2019m looking for literate roleplay partners. I\u2019m a big fan of Marvel\u2019s list of superhero movies(Hulk aside) and I\u2019ve been having a Pepper/Tony itch that can\u2019t seem to be satisfied. I know it\u2019s difficult to play a convincing genius but god, I\u2019d do /anything/ if you wouldn\u2019t mind trying. I can play Tony myself, although I do best when it\u2019s a Rule63!Version and I\u2019m pitting him(her) against someone else. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\n\nCharacters I play:   \n* Pepper Potts  \n* Rule63!Toni Stark  \n* Lady Loki  \n* Bucky Barnes  \n* Steve Rogers  \n* Rule63! Steve Rogers  \n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nPairings I enjoy:  \n* Pepper/Tony  \n* Pepper/Steve  \n* Toni/Loki  \n* Toni/Steve  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI\u2019d like to stress that wit/banter and writing a **believable** character is very important to me, much more than the smut or whatever else that comes later down the line. I also know that it\u2019s difficult to write with someone whose style doesn\u2019t quite match so I prefer to exchange writing samples at the start of everything just so we won\u2019t waste each other\u2019s time. Plot wise, I\u2019m sure we can come up with something after some discussion~  \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you and good luck in your search as well. \u2665  \nPS: No matter how old this ad gets, feel free to send me a PM if you're interested!\n",

            "selftext": "Hello Redditors,\n\nI'm male, of age, long time roleplayer and writer. I'm seeking a partner for general play, one on one in Discord. My priority is writing quality and depth of plot, and prefer a partner who is interested in the same. Here are some of the high points of what I'm after:\n\n\n**Advanced Novela Style**- I write in full paragraph, novela style and in third person. This does not mean unnecessary fluff, but quality and quantity are ideal. I'd also like good grammar, spelling, and a story that has a novel-like feel and follows a specific plot. For me, roleplay is writing and I want to enjoy it with the same depth of a proper story. I average a word count about 500-1000 in a typical post, but it can be much more or less situation depending. \n\n\n**Story &amp; Genre** - I will play a big variety of original characters and settings. Sci-fi, realism, fantasy, various time periods are encouraged. Please no medieval fantasy or canon. I have a few preset characters with pages and many more characters and stories in my mind, but I am also happy to collaborate on something wholy original with a partner. Maybe if we throw around plot ideas we can merge.\n\n**Sample characters**:\n\n[James](https://memorysundoing.tumblr.com/) - [Jackson](http://whatclevergame.wixsite.com/whatclevergame) - [Lee](https://nobodygetsjustice.tumblr.com/) - [Will](http://drinkofhemlock.wixsite.com/will)\n\n**Seeking** - A long term, committed partner with some skills. We all get busy, myself included. However my preference is \"live\" play where we can write in solid sessions at least a couple of times a week with more sporadic posting in between. I would also like decent communication skills. Flaking is not okay. What I love are out of the box original characters and writers who push me to be better. \n\n**Content** - I play heterosexual males and prefer to play with the opposite sex. My stories will contain mature themes, language, violence, and adult situations broadly. This by no means needs to include graphic depictions of the sex itself, but will be what I'd call at least R-rated. I am not easy to offend and prefer a partner who can handle a dark and complex story.\n\n**I Reserve the Right** - To do what I want, with whom I want, when I want. I'll try to always be polite and honest about what I'm after, and just ask the same in return. \n\nMessage me if interested and we can exchange Discord IDs to discuss in more depth.",

So, it was their last year in high school and he had been selected for a military program that would cause him to leave for a while. He probably wouldn't have time to contact family or friends while gone. He talked to (him/her) about it and (he/she) told him to go for it. (Him/Her) didn't really want him to go but who was (he/she) to say he shouldn't? He leaves once it's time and the year slowly passes by... But, not too long before he is supposed to come home, a letter is sent to his parents saying that he is missing in action... It's a few years later now and guess who finally came home? How different do they look? How are their lives? Will (he/she) still have feelings for him after finding out how much he has changed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate message me if you're interested! You must include your Discord tag, which sexuality, and who you'd like to play as depending. I would prefer playing the military man who's just coming back because I have an awesome background for him, but I'd be okay playing the other, depending on how many people ask.

That being said I'm not going to dump an existing plot and expect you to come along for the ride- I'm looking for a discussion on the sort of world we should exist in together. I'm not looking to make everything right away, but some sort of char concerning the sort of themes etc we come across would be cool as we can build and add as we go. \n\nI'm not looking for Furries/Demons/Vampires/OP superheroes- I want the grit and struggle that comes from being human. Apart from that I'm more than happy to discuss any aspect of this to suit what we'd both like to do! \n\nPM me if you're interested, my preferred method of RP is through Kik, Google Docs and potentially Skype, though it's not ideal.",

I am very literate and enjoy writing immensely, one of the positives is that I can write for long periods and great volume, my previous partners have found this gratifying as I am a reliable and productive partner.\n\nI took a hiatus from roleplaying for the last year, but I am looking to get back into it, I am a proactive roleplayer, I enjoy taking the lead, I enjoy dictating where the story goes, creating characters.\n\nThe genres I most like to work in are sci fi or modern day, I am not a fan of high fantasy. I have no limits in regards to tone, I like darker tones, I am fully capable of exploring parts of the human mind people shy away from and I would like a partner who can do the same.\n\nWhat I am looking for is an enthusiastic and reliable partner who is capable of discussing all elements of role-playing, I think I am a good writer and a good fit for someone who is interested in a long term story.\n\nI would like you to be over 18, I would also like to use discord and write in the third person.\n\nThank you for reading",

            "selftext": "The title says it all really. I'm driven largely on adventure-driven stories revolved around a singular character that acts as the proto-protagonist as they muck about in another person's Medieval Fantasy world whose story encompasses violence, exploration of the unique cultures, races, nations, forgotten places left in mountains and holes in the ground, as well as discovering new monsters, magics, etc. In a way, I sort of enjoy being able to describe it as a universe similar to the Witcher. A bitter, unpleasant world that's coming to a new age as fantasy and the harshness of reality bleed together to create a profoundly dark world that drafts real concepts from reality like economics, geopolitics, causes for conflicts amongst rulers where they use casus belis to flimsily give themselves cause to push for their real ambitions...so on and so on. If it's a world that can manage to make me uncomfortable, then you're probably doing something right with it.\n\nI don't care about the gender of my partner or any other circumstances related to them. It's not my business unless you care to make it; that being said, I've been at this long enough that if you're someone who self-describes themselves as a 'detailed writer,' then ninety-percent of the time ti doesn't actually mean anything. If you know how to structure a paragraph and can convey the feelings you want to get across, then that's more than enough for me. I'll provide a writing sample further down. Obligation has me say that I have no trouble with smut whatsoever, though the character I had in mind was a female with a favortism shown towards the same sex, which may very well come into conflict with the societal norms of the world, or be something entirely ignored. Either works for me, and, indeed, having sexuality be a point of tension can be quite fun if designed and plotted out well.\n\nI use Discord, Skype, as well as GMail/GDocs; message me for contact details for that.\n\nThanks to Kevin for giving the chance for this piece.\n\n&gt; His attire was the usual of his imperious self, a simple pair of pressed trousers above polished leather boots. Over his shoulders was draped a collared shirt, and a light leather jacket above it; an odd choice in the hellish waste which was the Prestor's hold. Still, the man wasn't even sweating as he stepped forward, his limp obvious, while his hazel eyes gazed down at the girl with a thousand emotions flowing through, making a single indiscernible amalgamation. Her gaze met his, and she felt just as many, the strangest among them, among the fear, the anger, the respect, was the love. Not of a woman to her man, but of a daughter to her father. The man, for his part, did not look older than thirty, making it rather strange in the looks, but she had spent centuries with him... And while she felt nothing so strong as for the princess of her dreams, it was still enough to stop her strangling him until he inevitably forced her away. Instead, she just keeps a grim, determined look, causing him to sigh, and set the cane against the table, before pulling the chair on his side out, to sit down, with some struggle, due to the weak leg.\n\n&gt; When he has situated himself in the chair, Saria's eyes following him coldly as he does, he pulls it in, resting his arms on the table as the weak leg splays out for better comfort, before his eyes finally rest on her once more. The man seems unwilling, or at least unable, to say anything, wordlessly watching her in a mutual contest of whom could maintain poise longer. And Saria wasn't willing to play, yawning fakely to break the manufactured tension in the room, before leaning forward in turn; keeping her back straight and hands held perfectly, as she finally says, her first words since she'd talked to Raven's graving into the bedside, \u201cWell. You look good. Is that a new hair style you have?\u201d Daas, despite having not cut his hair in weeks, instinctively put a hand on his head to see what she was talking about, before casting an annoyed gaze at her and sighing. \u201cCan you take nothing seriously?\u201d He asks that, after a moment, his tone matching the gaze as his hand returns to the table, which causes her to shrug her shoulders, indifferent.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhen it's worth taking seriously, yes. But unfortunately for you, you aren't worth taking seriously.\u201d His gaze hardens again, his jaw set in a manner to indicate her words had bitten as harshly at she'd expected. There was a primal pleasure in tearing down those you hated; at least to her, and there was no one she hated more. Part of her disliked that pleasure she received, but she didn't care to listen to that; not here, not now. Her mental tangent is broken by Daas' words causing her to jolt; breaking her from the trance she'd already fallen into. \u201cSaria. Are you ever going to stop acting like a child, or am I going to have to treat you like one?\u201d Her gaze casts over him for a moment, coming up with a response which he immediately understands will be sarcastic, causing him to just cradle his head in a hand as she replies with, \u201cWell, I don't know. Children don't have to think, and they get to (Whoops, censored!) until they're nice and happy. Being treated like a child sounds like a dream.\u201d\n\n&gt; Daas' eyes glare her down, indicating she had gone a step too far in the wrong direction. She felt no remorse for the man's annoyance, however, shaking her head as she cuts in, before the man has a chance to criticize, \u201cYou're the one who forced me into this god-forsaken tower. Don't you fucking dare tell me to treat you with dignity or respect; you traded yours a long time ago.\u201d Rather than further annoyance, Daas' expression turns to that of a bemused smile, somewhat forced, as he chose to simply come to her side of thought, for now, if only to warm her up for the questions he had planned. \u201cYou did, too, you know. So I suppose that makes two of us, just pigs, rolling in the mud.\u201d Saria's eyes glance at the man, finding some anger at what he'd said, at the mention of her having given in her dignity. \u201cI didn't really have a choice in the matter,\u201d her tone is far more pressed, now, and her eyes slant. \u201cYou took my dignity... Though, if we're pigs, then I suppose that one of us is magical and the other's a murderer. Sounds like an excellent story for the ages. Maybe one of these days you can say that story to the next woman you kidnap and hold here.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI'll keep that in mind,\u201d He says, softly, before leaning forward, thinking on her remark on dignity. \u201cBut you say that as if you didn't enjoy it. You enjoyed every moment, every kill, every hunt. The difference between you and I is that I don't enjoy my atrocities; and you do, Saria.\u201d The man has barely finished speaking before Saria's chair is thrown into the wall behind her, chipping away the stones behind her as she stands, glaring down at Daas, who shows no chance in composure as he watches her staring down at him with barely-contained fury from his words. \u201cYou...\u201d She says, voice shaking in the same manner as her quivering arms, \u201cYou...\u201d Nothing more came. It was true; what he said, at least about her. But the fact he'd said it, and the way he'd done it, made her want to burn the man down. But she didn't. And slowly, his arm raised, as she saw the familiar deathly black energy running along it, powered from it, as he gestures to the thrown chair. \u201cPick it up,\u201d he says, calmly, \u201cAnd sit down.\u201d",

            "selftext": "here is a bit about the characters I want to use and what I am hoping to pair them against.\n\nFinnagon (Finn for short)- The captain of the crew and a rogue among his race taking much more interest in adventure outside of home and exploring the stars. An intelligent, charismatic, and dominant looking humanoid from a planet of mostly warrior like race. Tall, brooding, and dashing men that have a will to dominate. In his case, he does give a woman better respect if she seems worth the time. He has a love for adventure and a respect for anyone who just wants to get out there and learn. Come along he may get you into trouble but he'll have your back too as long as you don't try to go behind it. ( would like to pair against either male or female)\n\nAmy- The mechanic and weapons expert of the crew. This feisty feline only gives respect when she is shown it in return and sometimes not even then. Bad tempered, sadistic at times, professional (debatable), but with a secret softer and more lonely side. She is not completely feline, with more human like facial features and humanoid way of moving but with cat like features, urges, and behaviors. Hiding that special time under a mask of pissy mood and a snarky comments.. A cat you just gotta love when she learns her place (HIGHLY desiring to pair her with a MALE something. Bear like, gargoyle like, DRAGON like, anything but tentacles for this one) but she is one independent woman that will take someone who respects who she is just as much as wants to see her bend. Can she find that partner in life but rival behind closed doors?\n\nKaitlyn- the technician of the crew, the queen of nerds. A sweetheart in all respects, a girl given to risking her life for her crew even when she is much less prone to fighting. She is incredibly intelligent and enjoys her job but will avoid bringing temptations into her work life as MUCH as possible. She enjoys the company of her crew as well and the friendships established, she desires adventure but at times is too afraid to actually take the leap to head into it, not that she gets a choice in the end with a captain like Finn. Deeper in her dark secrets she finds herself curious about the weird and unnatural. The taboo and forbidden. She anticipates both with fear and excitement to meet the person or thing one day or multiple people she just\u2026can\u2019t stop thinking about (would love to do a fxf pairing for her but honestly it can be a poly experience for her. I want her to find that hidden side of herself.)\n\nCorth- the Android humanoid capable of many things. Mainly assisting in most aspects of life like cooking, cleaning, arranging financial matters, powering a ship, becoming an advanced weapon if needed. Kind of like a swiss army blade of uses. His main programming was once though for completely other purposes, dangerous and on the secret governmental project part of the universe but then it \"seemed\" to be scrapped and re-intended on exploring others resistance\u2026no matter how high. Since he can scan biological traits that also makes it hard to lie when the body is completely honest. Since his past his owners have changed his functioning to be much more casual. A laid back, funny, charmer with a boyishly handsome appearance and clean cut style. His old purpose pretty much non existent except for every now and again whenever he has to do a diagnostics check and clean out his system periodically. The others learned fast that he can not be near anything ALIVE during that time otherwise the old setting kicks up for a moment for some reason. Before returning to his sarcastic and yet still helpful and observant programming. ( would love to pair him with a mechanic or technician that decides to take the risk and try to fix his old programming\u2026or\u2026maybe not?)\n\nadditional notes: if you are interested in writing an ADVENTURE for this crew of oddities you can PM me if this sounds like a gaggle you'd like to rp with.",

It's wierd.\n\nI have a few ideas on how this roleplay could go, which range from something as simple as a therapist assigned to one of the many Mobile Task Force's or something as outlandish as an 05 commissioning the use of SCP-212 on a 'voluntary' bodyguard. That's something that happens believe it or not, I shit you not. There's a lot to play in this, and I couldn't be more excited to play it with a partner that is interested.\n\nIf you are that partner, hit me up! I'd love to talk to you and bang out some ideas.",

            "selftext": "**Introduction**    \nHail, and well met!  I am a writer of twelve years, give or take.  I love creating new and original worlds, and more than that I love designing diverse and flawed characters, and even *more* than that I cannot get enough when it comes to character development.  Putting my characters through the ringer and having them grow as I write them is one of the most satisfying things for me, so as such, I really do prefer long-term RPs, and partners who are interested in sticking around for the long haul!  I'm looking to make friends, not just roleplay partners.  If all of this sounds fun to you, continue reading!\n\n**Settings**    \nThe types of settings I enjoy are pretty wide.  I love me some good ol' fashioned fantasy, as well as sci-fi full of techobabble.  Modern elements with a twist, like magic or super powers, are also great fun.  Below are some settings I enjoy in no particular order, but of course I'm more than happy to design original ones as well.\n\n* Elder Scrolls\n* Star Wars\n* Mass Effect\n* Dragon Age\n* Dungeons and Dragons\n* Lord of the Rings\n* Marvel (Cinematic Universe preferred)\n* Western\n* The Last of Us\n\n**Plots**    \nI've got some neat ideas bubbling in my brain, and we are by no means restricted to just these.  If they sound fun, let me know!  I'm happy to do them as is or adjust them to fit other scenarios.\n\n&gt;**Skyrim** - *Thief In Over Her Head*\n&gt;&gt;I would play a Khajiit thief, just looking to survive in Tamriel.  We could play in Cyrodiil, Skyrim, or really any other location as well (though those two are the ones I know the best).  Maybe she gets into trouble with the local Thieves' Guild by unwittingly stealing from one of its members.  Perhaps she angers an official and they perform the Black Sacrament and seek to have her killed by Dark Brotherhood assassins.  Or maybe she was in the wrong place at the wrong time and disrupted a cult from summoning some Daedra.  You may be one of these factions out to get her, or a newfound ally working to protect her.  The sky's the limit!\n\n&gt;**Skyrim** - *World Weary Wanderer*\n&gt;&gt;My character is an aspiring spellcasting Argonian named Drinks-the-World.  She wants to see all the sights.  All of them.  Hear there's talk of a massive statue to Azura?  Already bolting out the door.  Some say there's a mudcrab over a hundred miles away the size of a barn door?  Packing her bags as we speak.  This one is a lot more loose, but I'm really enamored with the character.\n\n&gt;**Star Wars** - *Good Guys, Bad Guys, Made-Up Words*\n&gt;&gt;This could take place in virtually any era, but I enjoy dealing with bucketheads too much to avoid the Empire or First Order eras.  Mine is a smuggler/pirate making a living for herself by doing whatever suits her best.  Yours is a rival or a crew member?  Many adventures ensue!\n\nThose are what I've got at the moment, but I'm sure to have more ideas by the time you folks contact me.  I'll either edit them in, or share what I've got for the settings you suggest!\n\n**Contact Me**    \nIf you've made it this far and you'd like to hit me up, please send me a PM or a chat request here on Reddit!  One liners will be ignored.  *Please* give me something to work with, a little bit about yourself or a little bit about the ideas you may have.  Simply saying you have ideas and giving me your Discord won't cut it, sorry!",

            "selftext": "Full disclaimer right off the bat, this will NOT be a smut/sexual based rp. This will tackle some darker and possibly morbid themes than most roleplays going on, all of which I think have an immense potential to be crafted into a really interesting story. We can gladly dive into more sexual oriented scenes so long as it has a purpose in the overall narrative. Anyways....\n\nHey all! As you\u2019ve probably gathered from the title, I\u2019m searching for a female who\u2019d be interested in building a world where you would play as some form of a Yandere! \n\nNow I\u2019m sure a good majority of people have at least a basic idea of what your typical yandere is, but I can boil it down even further. Ever felt a special bond between you and another character? That despite the circumstances, you two would be absolutely perfect together? Well crank that feeling all the way to an eleven, add a dash of insanity and manipulation for good measure, and you\u2019ll have your typical yandere! \n\nI\u2019m looking specifically for a partner that doesn\u2019t mind taking the concept and running full force with it, taking any action they deem necessary to convince my character that you are the one for them. And again I feel I must reiterate this; this carries several dark themes, such as blackmail, kidnappings, and potentially even murder, so this probably isn\u2019t best for the faint of heart. \n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with such themes then great! I have a couple prompts in mind, all of which are fairly basic so we can both enjoy expanding and creating our own world together! This may involve playing a couple different characters on the side, but ultimately the relationship will still revolve our main characters. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested or have any questions/comments/concerns, then feel free to private message me here on reddit! I\u2019ll try to respond as soon as I can, as my schedule has been a bit hectic lately. Hope to hear from you soon! \n\n",

            "selftext": "Dim lights and loud music accompanied Gotham in its most prosperous time, the nightlife was building and attracting all sorts of foreigners to bring their money and invest on legal and not so legal business.\n\n\nMost young men of his age were out in the clubs drinking, hooking up and experimenting with drugs but not him, he was the red blur that crossed the city unseen. Most would just feel the breeze on their face as the young speedster tried his new powers. They had been with him for six months now but after trying to hide them for some time, finally Ezra began to embrace them and be open to the opportunities they presented, with them he could do much more work than normal and bring some extra money to his mother, life was hard now that the gap between rich folks and the normal people was starting to grow.\n\n\nTonight Ezra finished up three work shifts at the same time and went home content. \"Hello sweetheart.\" His mother Catherine said from the kitchen as little Danielle sat on the living room with some toys. \"Hey mom.\" As always he passed by and gave each of his girls a kiss on the cheek before heading upstairs. Nights like this is when he got curious, how fast could he run? Did he have any other powers that were still hidden?\n\n\nAfter having a quick dinner downstairs he went back to his room and sneaked trough the window, wearing this new suit that he had built, every time he would try and push the limits he'd have to build a new one since they kept catching on fire, leaning down on his knee he felt a lightning run along his spine, telling him to let go and just run. As soon as his feet pushed him forward everything seemed to slow down around him, within seconds he was out the city and heading towards the bay, running on water was a piece of cake now so he just jumped and thought of checking out metropolis while he was at it. \"Come on, I can do faster than this.\" The voice kept repeating on his head, pushing him to try harder. Ezra had been running into the ocean for a couple of miles now when something new happened, it felt like he was running on air. Red lights clouded his vision as flashes of streets, people, events passed trough. None of them made sense so he began to slow down, quickly coming out the red tunnel and into a random alley in what looked like Gotham. His suit was well on fire so he had to ditch it. \"Great, I forgot to bring spare clothes.\" He said and took a palm to his face. Gotham was still his city but the lights, the music were just... Odd.\n\n\nSo yeah! That's basically a starter for my idea. Basically it will be the tale of a young speedster from the earlier days of gotham city from around the 60\u2019s who inadvertently travels into the future! Being stuck there he has to adapt and relate to the other superheroes! Now who do you play? It can honestly be almost anyone! I really don\u2019t have a preference and In fact I\u2019d love to see some variety of characters instead of the usual Harley Quinn. \n\nI also happen to have other dc/marvel/Star Wars prompts on my post history if anyone is interested in those.\n\n\nThank you for reading my prompt and hopefully we can start a story!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, in short I'm starting a discord RP server. The setting being a hard fantasy. With the main gimmick being magic is genetic, and often a curse. Those affected with magical abilities have little control over their powers. Often many of them die young due to their powers abruptly coming to fruition, causing the unwanted slaughter of themselves or others. As a result a theocratic order of anti-magic zealots have outlawed magic within the province and you will be killed for displaying any form of magic.\n\nHere's what I need for staff applications. If you don't follow this format when posting how can I assume you'll be competent, follow it.\n\nName\n\nWhat you want to do for the server\n\nPrevious experience\n\nI take effort into account for applications. This application is very free form, go for it fella.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/FagjNA8",

            "selftext": "*Aleph blinked slowly, something she was still needing to get used to the action of doing so. Her form still not quite real, but more in a juxtaposition between states of reality and unreality. She sat up as she had been lying prone in the grassy field. She wasn't entirely sure where she was in truth, one moment she had been walking along the seemingly endless beach that was her home realm. The next she was in this field, well that was nothing new to her, she was used to just being ejected from her realm at random anyways. \nShe rested her hands, palms down on the ground, feeling the soft grass bending under her hands, and feeling the dirt and grit digging into the flesh. She moved her legs left and right, like one might do to make a snow angel. Inhaling in the sweet air she closed her eyes, not in a blink, but rather just closing them for the sake of closing them. She noticed a shift in air pressure fore her face and she re-opened her eyes. Indeed, before her swirled a portal, a lime coloured elliptical shape, hanging in the air, like a set dressing in a play. Her brow furrowed with some faint confusion at the sight. \nShe was used to odd, impossible things, but there was always an air of plausibility to them, giving them an uncertain nature about them. This however, just seemed outright impossible and implausible. She couldn't help however, but feel primally dragged towards it, getting a feeling in her gut that she should approach. Which she did, approaching the portal with not hint of caution in her gait. She extended a hand, sticking it within the swirling confines of the portal. It was odd... cold, yet at the same time hot, but also like no temperature at all. It was a bit of a familiar feeling to her, her normal realm was almost always this juxtaposition and lack of temperature. She took a deep breath, feeling her lungs inflating, then she jumped into the portal, to who knows where.*\n\n[If you enjoyed that short story, join the server [here.](https://discord.gg/WDZcyn9)]\n\n\n[Also credit to shiftlessPagan for writing this story.]",

For [the King himself](https://img00.deviantart.net/9577/i/2014/069/f/f/dad_by_hart_worx-d6k2hax.jpg), a golden idol of one of the gods above. For [the beautiful queen](https://pre00.deviantart.net/8ba4/th/pre/i/2017/229/7/7/ginger_queen_by_black_bl00d-dbkda2i.jpg) a dress made of the finest silk in all the land. And for [the darling princess](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/adelaide-kane-reign.jpg),a ring from the far off eastern lands of Alacarin.\n\nAll the smaller gifts like the wine and food were all checked for every known poison. The major gifts too were examined for any curses or spells. However, due to the nature of the curse upon the ring, it went completely unnoticed. But the princess soon discovers the sinister nature of the ring that night when she is unable to remove it from her finger.\n\nNow a dangerous curse upon the princess has caused her to flee the Capital city in search of help with only you to accompany her.\n\nThe curse in reference causes the cursed to slowly grow in size. Simple, right?\n\nSo I had this idea after watching a mix of low budget fantasy movies, shows, and reading a handful of books. It's very simple, but that's the point! Simple stories have the most potential for adjustments and adaptations. There's so much room for action, comedy, mystery, and romance all in one place! Sound pulpy? That's because it is.\n\nThis story fits in the darker mold of the political intrigue or the more light-hearted mold of adventure. Or any genre really, I'm happy to hear your suggestions if you have any. Otherwise, it will be fairly light-hearted.\n\nNow I'm looking for someone to play the Princess's companion on her journey in search of help. Are you my most trusted adviser, utterly loyal to my family and I? Maybe you're my childhood friend, not the most skilled diplomat but just as caring? Or maybe you're a Han Solo-esque scoundrel hired by the king to escort me until help is found? It's totally up to you!\n\nLet me know what you think or if you've got any ideas in mind.\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m Leu, 17, &amp;amp; have been roleplaying on and off for about seven years. I roleplay exclusively in the third person, either present or past, using paragraph/lit form. Depends on the mood. I\u2019ll play as either male or female, and am open to m/m, f/f, &amp;amp; m/f.\n\nI very recently finished reading Uprooted, by Naomi Novik, and would like to play around in this world, either with the canon characters or original characters. I\u2019m open to other fandoms as well: Riordan\u2019s works, The Song of Achilles (&amp;amp; it\u2019s parent texts), other miscellaneous books, along with the Fire Emblem series, Kid Icarus, Radiant Historia for video games.\n\nIf fandoms aren\u2019t your thing, I\u2019m very alright with originals. Fantasy (what a shock, I actually Have prompts for those!), slice of life, light sci-fi, drama, romance, historical, whatever floats your boat! I tend to focus on more platonic bonds and those forged by need, but am also a huge sucker for childhood friends who know one another like the back of their hands.\n\nA mess, I know.\n\nUsing Discord for communication is big, as I believe OOC talk is just as important as the actual roleplay, but if the roleplay would take place on a different medium (email, docs, etc), I won\u2019t complain.
