Most of our world as we know it is uninhabitable, ravaged by horrendous monsters known as the Beasts of GRIMM. These beasts have forced us to stay put in our territories, finding some sort of painful co-existence with them. However, hope is not lost. Hunters, brave men and women trained in the art of war, have made it their mission to combat these beasts of GRIMM through any means necessary. \n\nThis story starts with one particular school for hunters: Beacon Academy. The best hunting school in Vale. It is here that the hopeful youth of our society test their mettle to become the best of the best. What will you do? Who will you become? There is only one way to find out.\n\nWe are a band-new RWBY server where you can chose to either fight as your own OC or one of the many canon characters in this world! Hunter, villain, or anything in between; it's up to you! This rp will mostly follow the plotline of the show while elaborating on the daily life of the characters within it.

Angst. Drama. Darkness. Light. Engaging plot. Multiple main characters. Side characters. All of the elements that make it feel more like a fully fleshed out story, instead of something forced.\nIf any of this sounds like what you\u2019ve been looking for, then keep going!\n\nThe nuts and bolts\u2026\nI write in third person, past-tense para form. Response times can vary, depending on what is going on. At the least, once per week, and at the most, several times per day. I\u2019m laid back when it comes to response times, but generally I find it harder to get into the start of an rp if responses are sparse early on.\n\nPosts range from 150-600+ words, depending on what is happening. Also not too picky about this\u2026All I require is that I\u2019m not receiving one or two-liners, and that we both feel we\u2019re putting in similar levels of effort.\nAll of my main pairings are MxF, but I am willing to write MxM or FxF for your main(s), or any side characters. For anyone looking to write anything other than M for their main, I expect to be doubling here. Love doubling and getting invested in multiple stories!\n\nOriginals/general ideas I favor: Historical/eras\nGang related\n Crime drama \nComplicated relationships \nModern (Without feeling too slice of lifey)\nRunaways\nPirates/Seafaring \nFantasy elements added in\nLight to medium world building\n\n\nList of Fandoms i\u2019m currently feelin\u2019. Disclaimer: I don\u2019t write canonxcanon, only canonxOC or OCxOC. AU-friendly.\n\nFallout\nElder Scrolls (Dragon War era, Dragon crisis, Oblivion crisis, Morrowind, ESO, something Miraak-centric would be amazing!) \nMCU \nHarry Potter (Marauders era only)\nBoardwalk Empire\nSalem (Something dealing with witches, covens, &amp; the supernatural loosely based off the premise)\n GoT/ASOIAF\n\nThanks for hangin' in there!

            "selftext": "I go by Slash. It\u2019s less of a name and more of a description of what I do, and what I do is hunt monsters. Well, I kill monsters, and the hunting is just a means to an end; specifically the end being the finality of their miserable existence. What's wrong? Didn\u2019t know monsters existed? Then you have lived a charmed life. Not like me, whose life has been forever stained by their kind. They killed my parents; murdered them before I was old enough to do anything about it but hide in a tiny crawl space beneath our kitchen. I survived with the memory of the sound of the beasts above me serrating my parents flesh and cracking their bones for the marrow inside. They may have found me eventually, if my former teacher had not shown up to slay the creatures. At the time I was both grateful and angry. I was grateful that my family was avenged but angry that it was not me that got revenge. \n\nI hear they say that ignorance is bliss. Sadly, I have never known what it\u2019s like to be blissfully unaware of the things that go bump in the night. Once my parents were gone I had little to live for. My mentor must have sensed that because that was the day he started training me to be a monster hunter. I didn\u2019t have a happy, innocent childhood. Growing up was hard and brutal while I learned to fight and survive. Not every kill is clean and sometimes we barely scrape our way out of the grave that waits for us as Monster Hunters. Vampires and Werewolves can be bad. Humans are little more than a waiting meal for them, but occasionally you find one that has some sense of morality. Maybe some of them remember what it was once like to be human. Most don\u2019t care. There are more beastly things out there though. Demons and monsters whose motives are completely unfathomable to humans. Some simply want to snuff out anything warm and alive. \n\nIgnorance is bliss. I finally learned that lesson when my mentor taught me how to make a living. When he brought me to a nest of gremlins he meant to teach me how best to make a living as a Monster Hunter. What he did, as he showed me how to lure and bait the creatures to an unsuspecting town as they caused mayhem and strife until the local authorities paid him to exterminate them, was show me the truth. I ran from that truth, like most people do. The truth was more horrendous and ugly than any monster I have ever killed. My flight brought me home almost without thinking and I found myself passing the time by investigating the attack that killed my parents. There was no doubt, my mentor had been the reason why my parents had been killed. When I returned to him, he knew it was for justice. The old man went down fighting but by then, he was no longer a match for me. \n\nWith my own ignorance shattered I live with the grief of killing the surrogate father whose hand had practically directed the murder of my parents. I do whatever I can to dull the agony of that blade. I hunt and slay beasts to satisfy the red hot iron that stabs my heart. I share any warm bed and eat any meal that is offered to me to abate the loneliness that haunts my dreams. In between those activities, I drink until my vision blurs and I can\u2019t feel the misery of my life. The guild says I need an apprentice but to hell with that. Too many painful memories lie down that road and life, especially mine, is too short to waste. \n\n***\n\nHello /Roleplayers. I have unearthed an old prompt of mine and I am currently seeking a partner to write with. What I was trying to accomplish with this is to give you a sense of who it is I am playing (1st or 3rd). What I left vague is:\n\n- **1) Who YOU will be playing.** Your character can be anybody. A client of mine seeking extermination of some unholy beast, a would be apprentice desperately seeking a mentor, or a target that turns out to be woefully misunderstood.\n\n- **2) Time period.** This RP is also open to time period. It can take place in a fantasy world just as easily as it could a modern day urban setting. He can even be a Sci-fi hunter using a mixture of magic and technology to hunt and kill his prey. \n\nSo contact me and let's talk about where we can take this. ",

I\u2019ve seen it all. Chatango, Forum, Tumblr, Twitter (yes, Twitter), etc. Reddit\u2019s new, so let\u2019s see how this goes\u2026 \n\nHow I Write (so.. I guess what I\u2019m looking for?):\n\n3rd person. Tried 1st person, it\u2019s not my thing. Tried 2nd person, it\u2019s\u2026 really weird (especially when it comes to smut. How do people do that?). \n\nSlice of life, Supernatural (think stuff like werewolves, minus all the A/B/O shenanigans), Media inspired (I watch a movie, you bet I\u2019m thinking of a whole AU just for it), whatever\u2026 I\u2019m up for anything as long as it\u2019s interesting. \n\nAngst, Romance, Comedy, Absurd, etc. Again, I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s interesting\u2026 \n\nLiterate. Length varies. I can go from multiple, long ass paragraphs to just one. It depends on what the situation calls for. \n\nSmut\u2019s kinda\u2026 not my priority, at all. If it happens, it happens. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here, though. Shit gets boring. No shame to those who write it all the time, that\u2019s just not my style. \n\nOCs. I\u2019m tired of playing canon characters since I\u2019m coming from places like\u2026 Anime RP, Animation RP, Western RP, KRP. (If you know what this list means, you should totally talk to me.)\n\nPS: Don\u2019t know if this is important, but\u2026 MxF shipping bores me. Maybe it\u2019s \u2018cause I\u2019m gay? I dunno. I\u2019m here for that sweet, sweet FxF and MxM and all the problems, troubles, and plots that go with it. \n\nSo if any of this sounds interesting, shoot me your Discord. Let\u2019s chat. \n",

But even so it had an event that would have affected the course of the world. If it hadn't been for a stranger that had wandered into town and a few of the towns people.\n\nHere's the thing. Cherrywood was built on the gates of the realm of spirits. And doing so, attracted the residence of many other supernatural and strange folk. Even some from beyond the skies. But some recent activity from the gates have caused some concern, and a stranger entering town is almost no consequence.....\n\nHello! I feel like a western dynamic could be fun in this subject. Or at least interesting. The time of the wild west was an interesting one. And had attracted a lot of people of all ages and races so I'd like to think the same for the monsters so for this I'll let you have your choice. But a few that would probably be a rattlesnake variant of lamia, a harpy of sorts, maybe an angel or demon? There's quite a few choices.\n\nI do have a plot in mind. An adventure across the west to gather supplies and things they would need to calm the gate. Along the way outrunning gangs of rough riders, Marshal's that are after us when we're framed, religious cults that want our heads, along with many more people.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.",

I am looking for an enthusiastic and mature partner to help me turn this into a reality.\n\n***So what is the idea?***\n\nThe idea is time travel! I have been working on the basis for a time travel story for some time and would like to couple it with my love of exploring very dark undertones, the idea is your character would be given access to time travel, though not necessarily the ability to control it, that puts him/her into situations you would not otherwise find. Because of this the scope of what we can explore is very large and the length of time we spend in any particular area is dependent on how much fun or fulfilment we can find there.\n\n***You mentioned dark undertones?***\n\nThat I did, I work in the dark, was moulded by it, when I was beginning the basis of this story the idea I initially had was that the lead character, yours, would be in a mental institution, this is not something I am wed to, but it gives you an idea of the types of depths I would like to explore, perception, reality, philosophy, all kinds.\n\n***Sounds like a lot of work, is this a normal 1x1 rp?***\n\nIn parts yes, but I will be creating the area you work in and building the story around you, think of me as a dungeon master who wants to create a world for you to make your own choices.\n\n***Any requirements?***\n\nA few, mature people, I dont need you to be a great writer but I do need to be able to have conversations with you about the roleplay that are mature and balanced, so over 20 at least.\nConsistent roleplayers, I would prefer someone who is committed to longer term roleplays, has experience with them and is looking for a good communicative partner.\n\n\nMessage me for my discord",

            "selftext": "A couple of years ago I stopped roleplaying, I had grown tired of it, everyone seemed to want over-the-top roleplays with drama behind every corner, planned relationships, permanent thrill, dramatic backstories... seeing an explosion might be cool the first 2 or three times, but when you see one every few minutes it just becomes dull and boring. That's how I felt about the roleplay. And sadly I could never find a partner who was willing to do it different.\n\nI love characters who act with reason and realistic emotion, who don't meet another character and never ask any questiond about them but just proceed to a romantic relationship. Characters who don't just seem like puppets played by their creator, but feel as if they had their own head.\n\nBut enough of that talk, let's get to the juicy part...!\n\nWeissburg is a large island far east of the mainland. Human civilization didn't know of it's existence up until 200 years ago when an expedition crew discovered the humid island in search for farmland.\n\nNot long after setting foot on the island the humans now called \"Weissburg\" due to the almost white, oddly shaped mountains, they encountered the island's inhabitants, a humanoid race called Val'Drith.\n\nUnfortunately a combination of misunderstandings and fear led to the death of several humans and Val'Drith in a single day, forcing the expedition crew to retreat after just a few days.\n\n200 years forward,Val'Drith and humans still haven't forgotten the incident and try to point fault to the opposing faction. Due to this conflict there is a strong racial tension among both sides, export and import is limited to the very minimum and Val'Drith are only allowed on the mainland with temporary permits, also forbidding them to leave the capital city.\n\nWhile merchants and nobles from both sides demand less limitation on the trade with Weissburg, citizens fear the unknown and strange people from far away, rumours are born and spread land-wide dread.\n\nThe king is no longer safe on his throne, being shaken by the masses of his own people who demand his support and power to ensure their safety.\n\nOf course many see their opportunity in this situation, the church had been displeased with their king since he was put on the throne, King Zathkis had proven himself to not be the most competent of his kind, resembling more of a lazy and naive young man instead of a man willing to help his land and people thrive.\n\nThus the church tries to be in favour of the people, responding to their cries for help and safety, while spreading the word of Val'Drith being demonic offspring, destroying written information about the race all the while watching the citizen's support for their king crumble, leaving Zathkis stuck inbetween two sides, both demanding different things.\n\nHere you come into play!\n\nFollowing the advice of his closest advisors, Zathkis assembled an expedition crew to send to Weissburg for a year. You are a well educated individual from a noble family, you are given the task to document and record your journey, get to know about Val'Drith and their culture, write everything down and deliver your findings back home.\n\nWhat the king and his advisors hope to achieve this way, is to eradicate the spread rumours about their neighbours and put an end to the racial tensions, at the same time stripping the church of it's new-found power and find out of how much value Weissburg actually is.\n\nBut you won't go alone of course!\n\nThe church has its own horse in the race:\n\nBelial is an around 60 year old priest who had been banished from the church years ago, but was accepted back in right before the announcement of the expedition, not much is known about him except for general data, even to the king who you can of course ask for further information.\n\nWhile most of the crew consists of experienced sailors, there are also two Val'Drith coming with you. Dwareeletep and Aeskulaph are overseas merchants who have volunteered to guide you and the crew on your journey and introduce you to their people.\n\nWhile Dwa mainly does it for the reward and to join his friend, Aeskulaph has a high interest in the mainland and their inhabitants, he is one of just a handful of Val'Drith who know how to speak your language, even fluently.\n\nWho exactly your characters is is up to you, as long as it makes sense.\n\nI kept character descriptions very vague on purpose, characters should get to know each other gradually.\n\nNow to a few points:\n\n-You and everyone has full freedom of choice, just keep in mind that everything you do can and will have consequences, so if you go on a killing spree, expect to die aswell.\n\n-Freedom of choice can include sexual and bloody content, depending on your choices and what happens.\n\n-Of course the same goes for relationships, just keep in mind that my characters have their own head and decide themselves how they want to interact with your OC.\n\n-I actually prefer male characters, no matter if relationships stay platonic or become romantic.\n\n-Please no anime or real pictures.\n\n-We can write wherever you feel most comfortable (but please no Reddit PM...)\n\n-I would like to write in a semi literate style, but beware! English is not my first language so I might be lacking here and there.\n\nAny more questions? Ask away!\n\nWant to delve right in? Shoot me a message!",

            "selftext": "Hello! First off, my name is Forsythe. :) this would be a text based roleplay, probably over discord. Email, PMs, and kik are also an option. I don\u2019t respond everyday because I\u2019m a full time engineering student but I\u2019m happy to chat often even if I don\u2019t have the time to write a response. I\u2019m super casual about the response time. \n\nI mention in the title the show Hawaii Five-0 because I have taken an interest in writing the villain from the show, Wo Fat. ( shocker right? ) he\u2019s super cut and dry and written as your stereotypical, sociopathic villain, and I want to see more for him. His character had a shitload of potential, as did his relationship with Steve, and I want to write more of that. I would love to write with someone who is *also* interested in playing a canon from the show, but that **is not required.**\n\nI\u2019m super happy to write against your OC, or a canon from something else\u2014crossovers and alternate universes are the shit and I want basically all of it. Crime based roleplays could be fitting since Wo Fat is a high ranking criminal and formally one of the heads of the yakuza, so that\u2019s the genre he fits in best. I have ideas for fantasy, horror, and supernatural themed roleplays with him. I\u2019ve been watching Lost Girl. That could be cool to work with. \n\nSo anything is game, I just really enjoy writing this sociopath and I would love to explore more things with him. It helps if you know the show but it isn\u2019t required.\n\nI\u2019m not limited to this character and I\u2019m happy to write others. Other canons I enjoy are Miles Upshur of Outlast, and John Reese of Person Of Interest. I have OCs I can play as well if it comes to it, up to and including an eldritch horror. Just drop me a message, here or in my DMs. Whatever works for you. ",

Think along the lines of a well woven TV show. We'll create a few mains, and figure out how they fit in together and how this all weaves into one knit story.\n\nI'm actually not looking for complex plot, rather having it stick to slice of life with romance and emotions running wild. If you are a fan of building characters and really digging into emotions than I am the gal for you. Please be 18 + as there may contain writing that would evolve themes for a mature audience.\n\nI write third person, several paragraphs, and it's a necessity that we click and can write together well. I like to get to know you, whoever you might be, before we switch over to email. Eventually we will get there and we will create something awesome. So drop me a line and tell me a bit about yourself, your writing, and your dream vacation.\n\n",

            "selftext": "### Realm of Angarak\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What is Angarak?\n---\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What makes it unique?\n---\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What are the 'requirements'?\n---\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### Tl;Dr\n----\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj",

Ocean spanned the horizon for miles to come in all directions from my tiny life boat. This was hopeless... \n\nI still wasn\u2019t completely sure what happened, but it was chaotic to say the least. I had finally saved up enough to afford a trip on a small cruise throughout the Pacific Ocean, and judging from the wreckage I saw out in the distance, it looked like my ticket money was sinking to the reef below... Maybe they sailed too close to a low reef, maybe the engines blew out and ruptured the hull, hell, I was even entertaining the idea of a kraken at this point. Because how it happened didn\u2019t matter... All that mattered was I was lost at sea, not a clue in the word as to where I should go. \n\nWith maybe a weeks worth of provisions, (possibly a week and a half if I ration it right,) it was looking like the only way I was getting out of this alive was some sort of divine intervention by Neptune himself...\n\n\nHey all, thanks for reading! I\u2019ll fully admit that I\u2019m a sucker for romantic roleplays, especially when a dire situation is being played out. Now my idea for the future of this rp mainly revolve around your character, most likely a mermaid or some creature of the sea, intervening and helping me get out of this situation alive. Of course this is as basic as basic can be, and I mainly have it so we can build off it easily together. But if you have you\u2019re own ideas, feel free to add them to the table, I\u2019d love to hear them! Also, please tell me what time zone you\u2019re located in, both so we have a better understanding of how our schedules will work, and that way I know you read all the way through. \n\nAll I ask is that you have a basic understanding on how to write. I\u2019m not much of a stickler on typos, punctuation errors, etc, but if an entire paragraph that\u2019s one massive sentence and looks like it was written by a fourth grader, I probably won\u2019t continue. \n\nWhen it comes to reply lengths, I really don\u2019t care all too much, just so long as it feels like there\u2019s a purpose behind it. Sometimes you need four paragraphs to explain something effectively, and other times a few sentences can be just as powerful! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, or have any comments or concerns, just send me a pm here on reddit! Hope to hear from you soon! \n\n",

            "selftext": "Hiya there! \n\nI'm a 21 year old female, looking for someone to have a long-term roleplay with as the title suggests. By fairly frequent replies, I mean a few responses a day at the least - but I definitely recognize we all have things to do in the outside world, so communication on that count is key! I can't emphasize the communication bit enough, really.\n\nI'm fairly flexible in general I would say. I enjoy world building for certain genres, but I am also down for fandom RPs or an original plot where we put together something basic and build the world more on the go. I'm interested in Sci Fi, fantasy, slice of life, drama, fandom, crime, various time periods, dystopian, etc. and I have a few RP ideas of my own if you're interested. Of course, I would also love to hear ideas you have! I also don't mind the occasional spelling, grammar, punctuation slip up (we're all human) but I can't deal when it's a pervasive issue in writing. Post length will vary over time and based on the situation (ie. 2-3 paragraphs or more when building characterization or introducing something new vs 1-2 sentence responses if characters are engaging in a rapid exchange) though I will generally deliver a 3 to 5 sentence paragraph. Comfortable playing a main character and then a cast of others to fill a story out.\n\nThings I'm significantly less flexible about include: must play a main character in first person (with a strong preference that my partner do so as well for their main character), not playing canon characters as my main in fandom RPs (though I'm open to my partner playing one). I like to incorporate some smut into the plot as it fits, so full disclaimer on the 'you must be 18+ to delve into any adult content' side of things. I also won't go for an RP that's just all smut, no content otherwise. I'm also only looking for a 1v1 RP. I'm like using Discord for RPs, though I am not open to RPing through PM I may be convinced to try out other mediums.\n\nFeel free to drop me a PM if you're interested in writing something we can both enjoy together.\n\nCheers, \n\nJ.",

No questions asked.\n\nWith that out of the way, here goes the plot I'm looking to write with someone:\n\nBasically, I want to try with a character who's a criminal and a 'good girl', and them eventually getting involved to the point where she leaves her entire life behind and follows him. We'd explore the forming of the relationship, some conflict, and their criminal activity. Ending can be happy, sad or anything in between.\n\nThemes I want to explore: romance, boredom with the 'conventional' life, crime, lust at first sight, adjusting to a new life, conflict, loyalty.\n\nIf interested, please PM me!

            "selftext": "Hey there. I've been here for a bit but haven't quite found my match when it comes to specific roleplays. So here I am again! Let me try. X3\n\nThe roleplay I want to do is mainly 'unheard' of due to a lot of people not knowing what it is. Based off a book series known as *Warriors*, it is basically on...cats. What? Yes. This book has multiple series (I have only read the first series but absolutely love the take on it!), a lot of fans.. and is about cats? For those who haven't read it must be confused. I can explain. The author takes a different out look on cats and puts herself in the mindset of one and what happens that humans are oblivious to. It is sort of a 'what if' kind of thing. Cats living in the forest in seperated clans. They can talk (to one another) and have personalities just like people! I can explain much better in pm.\n\nNow, I am up for that and changing it up a bit. Were our characters wouldn't be normal ones and maybe something more feral or...big, and tribal. Just an idea. X3 We can add more fantasy if you wish, all up to you.\n\nI know it seems a bit odd to want to play as an animal but I find enjoyment out of it. I roleplay on Kik, Discord, Hangouts, and Reddit. Just be literate please (not asking for a novel but no one who use ** or can't write a decent paragraph). PM me for more information. Hi's, hey's, rp?'s will be ignored.",

            "selftext": "The great tension was horrible. To a season of political and social upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger; a danger both widespread and all-embracing, such a danger as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night, such a danger only brought forth by war and conquest. It soon became apparent that the United States had indeed felt the disquieting aftermath of Germany\u2019s unconditional triumph over France and Great Britain, and had merely elected to exist in silent denial. That would soon change.\n\n0600 hours, 7th December, 1941; one of the most pivotal events in the history of the world and the day that would undoubtedly decide the outcome of the war. The Empire of Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, robbing the United States of more than 2,000 lives and severely crippling its navy. Forever this day would be burnt into the history books, as it saw the first time the U.S. had been attacked on its own lands. Fear would swipe the nation, and with it a call of duty to every young, able-bodied young American. The very next day, President Roosevelt delivered a speech to congress, embodying the desperate pleading of every man, woman and child to take action upon those that had wronged them.\n\n&gt; With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph. So help us God.\n\nAnd so, the United States of America would pledge to the Allies, thus officially joining the Second World War. Ill-equipped and wounded, the nation chose blatantly to face down a monumental task: three more than formidable adversaries in the form of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan, and through this action it would inspire an entire generation of heroes. Over the year, the once ruined military of the United States would grow strong, becoming the superpower it had always been destined to. Millions of men and women had enlisted by November 1942, of which the finest was the First Infantry Division, admiringly dubbed the *Big Red One.*\n\n&gt; Palmam Qui Meruit Ferat\n\nIt in this fated division that our storyline is set. As an enlistee of the 26th Infantry Regiment; the *Blue Spaders* our characters will start in Basic Combat Training at Fort Benning, GA. From French North Africa, to Sicily, to the glorified coast of Normandy and into the heart of Germany, relive the stories of the men that helped forge the world as it is known today. Uncle Sam wants **you** for the U.S. Army! https://discord.gg/SzNwv6a\n\n**tl;dr** This storyline is a retelling of World War II, where your character is a hopeful enlistee of the 26th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning. We seek for experienced, literate and active writers to join and venture through the struggles of the Second World War with us.

            "selftext": "Dim lights and loud music accompanied Gotham in its most prosperous time, the nightlife was building and attracting all sorts of foreigners to bring their money and invest on legal and not so legal business.\n\nMost young men of his age were out in the clubs drinking, hooking up and experimenting with drugs but not him, he was the red blur that crossed the city unseen. Most would just feel the breeze on their face as the young speedster tried his new powers. They had been with him for six months now but after trying to hide them for some time, finally Ezra began to embrace them and be open to the opportunities they presented, with them he could do much more work than normal and bring some extra money to his mother, life was hard now that the gap between rich folks and the normal people was starting to grow.\n\nTonight Ezra finished up three work shifts at the same time and went home content. \"Hello sweetheart.\" His mother Catherine said from the kitchen as little Danielle sat on the living room with some toys. \"Hey mom.\" As always he passed by and gave each of his girls a kiss on the cheek before heading upstairs. Nights like this is when he got curious, how fast could he run? Did he have any other powers that were still hidden?\n\nAfter having a quick dinner downstairs he went back to his room and sneaked trough the window, wearing this new suit that he had built, every time he would try and push the limits he'd have to build a new one since they kept catching on fire, leaning down on his knee he felt a lightning run along his spine, telling him to let go and just run. As soon as his feet pushed him forward everything seemed to slow down around him, within seconds he was out the city and heading towards the bay, running on water was a piece of cake now so he just jumped and thought of checking out metropolis while he was at it. \"Come on, I can do faster than this.\" The voice kept repeating on his head, pushing him to try harder. Ezra had been running into the ocean for a couple of miles now when something new happened, it felt like he was running on air. Red lights clouded his vision as flashes of streets, people, events passed trough. None of them made sense so he began to slow down, quickly coming out the red tunnel and into a random alley in what looked like Gotham. His suit was well on fire so he had to ditch it. \"Great, I forgot to bring spare clothes.\" He said and took a palm to his face. Gotham was still his city but the lights, the music were just... Odd.\n\nSo yeah! That's basically a starter for my idea. Basically it will be the tale of a young speedster from the earlier days of gotham city from around the 60\u2019s who inadvertently travels into the future! Being stuck there he has to adapt and relate to the other superheroes! Now who do you play? It can honestly be almost anyone! I really don\u2019t have a preference and In fact I\u2019d love to see some variety of characters instead of the usual Harley Quinn.\n\nI also happen to have other dc/marvel/Star Wars prompts on my post history if anyone is interested in those.\n\nThank you for reading my prompt and hopefully we can start a story!",

            "selftext": "The title says it all really. I'm driven largely on adventure-driven stories revolved around a singular character that acts as the proto-protagonist as they muck about in another person's Medieval Fantasy world whose story encompasses violence, exploration of the unique cultures, races, nations, forgotten places left in mountains and holes in the ground, as well as discovering new monsters, magics, etc. In a way, I sort of enjoy being able to describe it as a universe similar to the Witcher. A bitter, unpleasant world that's coming to a new age as fantasy and the harshness of reality bleed together to create a profoundly dark world that drafts real concepts from reality like economics, geopolitics, causes for conflicts amongst rulers where they use casus belis to flimsily give themselves cause to push for their real ambitions...so on and so on. If it's a world that can manage to make me uncomfortable, then you're probably doing something right with it.\n\nI don't care about the gender of my partner or any other circumstances related to them. It's not my business unless you care to make it; that being said, I've been at this long enough that if you're someone who self-describes themselves as a 'detailed writer,' then ninety-percent of the time ti doesn't actually mean anything. If you know how to structure a paragraph and can convey the feelings you want to get across, then that's more than enough for me. I'll provide a writing sample further down. Obligation has me say that I have no trouble with smut whatsoever, though the character I had in mind was a female with a favortism shown towards the same sex, which may very well come into conflict with the societal norms of the world, or be something entirely ignored. Either works for me, and, indeed, having sexuality be a point of tension can be quite fun if designed and plotted out well.\n\nI use Discord, Skype, as well as GMail/GDocs; message me for contact details for that.\n\nThanks to Kevin for giving the chance for this piece.\n\n&gt; His attire was the usual of his imperious self, a simple pair of pressed trousers above polished leather boots. Over his shoulders was draped a collared shirt, and a light leather jacket above it; an odd choice in the hellish waste which was the Prestor's hold. Still, the man wasn't even sweating as he stepped forward, his limp obvious, while his hazel eyes gazed down at the girl with a thousand emotions flowing through, making a single indiscernible amalgamation. Her gaze met his, and she felt just as many, the strangest among them, among the fear, the anger, the respect, was the love. Not of a woman to her man, but of a daughter to her father. The man, for his part, did not look older than thirty, making it rather strange in the looks, but she had spent centuries with him... And while she felt nothing so strong as for the princess of her dreams, it was still enough to stop her strangling him until he inevitably forced her away. Instead, she just keeps a grim, determined look, causing him to sigh, and set the cane against the table, before pulling the chair on his side out, to sit down, with some struggle, due to the weak leg.\n\n&gt; When he has situated himself in the chair, Saria's eyes following him coldly as he does, he pulls it in, resting his arms on the table as the weak leg splays out for better comfort, before his eyes finally rest on her once more. The man seems unwilling, or at least unable, to say anything, wordlessly watching her in a mutual contest of whom could maintain poise longer. And Saria wasn't willing to play, yawning fakely to break the manufactured tension in the room, before leaning forward in turn; keeping her back straight and hands held perfectly, as she finally says, her first words since she'd talked to Raven's graving into the bedside, \u201cWell. You look good. Is that a new hair style you have?\u201d Daas, despite having not cut his hair in weeks, instinctively put a hand on his head to see what she was talking about, before casting an annoyed gaze at her and sighing. \u201cCan you take nothing seriously?\u201d He asks that, after a moment, his tone matching the gaze as his hand returns to the table, which causes her to shrug her shoulders, indifferent.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhen it's worth taking seriously, yes. But unfortunately for you, you aren't worth taking seriously.\u201d His gaze hardens again, his jaw set in a manner to indicate her words had bitten as harshly at she'd expected. There was a primal pleasure in tearing down those you hated; at least to her, and there was no one she hated more. Part of her disliked that pleasure she received, but she didn't care to listen to that; not here, not now. Her mental tangent is broken by Daas' words causing her to jolt; breaking her from the trance she'd already fallen into. \u201cSaria. Are you ever going to stop acting like a child, or am I going to have to treat you like one?\u201d Her gaze casts over him for a moment, coming up with a response which he immediately understands will be sarcastic, causing him to just cradle his head in a hand as she replies with, \u201cWell, I don't know. Children don't have to think, and they get to (Whoops, censored!) until they're nice and happy. Being treated like a child sounds like a dream.\u201d\n\n&gt; Daas' eyes glare her down, indicating she had gone a step too far in the wrong direction. She felt no remorse for the man's annoyance, however, shaking her head as she cuts in, before the man has a chance to criticize, \u201cYou're the one who forced me into this god-forsaken tower. Don't you fucking dare tell me to treat you with dignity or respect; you traded yours a long time ago.\u201d Rather than further annoyance, Daas' expression turns to that of a bemused smile, somewhat forced, as he chose to simply come to her side of thought, for now, if only to warm her up for the questions he had planned. \u201cYou did, too, you know. So I suppose that makes two of us, just pigs, rolling in the mud.\u201d Saria's eyes glance at the man, finding some anger at what he'd said, at the mention of her having given in her dignity. \u201cI didn't really have a choice in the matter,\u201d her tone is far more pressed, now, and her eyes slant. \u201cYou took my dignity... Though, if we're pigs, then I suppose that one of us is magical and the other's a murderer. Sounds like an excellent story for the ages. Maybe one of these days you can say that story to the next woman you kidnap and hold here.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI'll keep that in mind,\u201d He says, softly, before leaning forward, thinking on her remark on dignity. \u201cBut you say that as if you didn't enjoy it. You enjoyed every moment, every kill, every hunt. The difference between you and I is that I don't enjoy my atrocities; and you do, Saria.\u201d The man has barely finished speaking before Saria's chair is thrown into the wall behind her, chipping away the stones behind her as she stands, glaring down at Daas, who shows no chance in composure as he watches her staring down at him with barely-contained fury from his words. \u201cYou...\u201d She says, voice shaking in the same manner as her quivering arms, \u201cYou...\u201d Nothing more came. It was true; what he said, at least about her. But the fact he'd said it, and the way he'd done it, made her want to burn the man down. But she didn't. And slowly, his arm raised, as she saw the familiar deathly black energy running along it, powered from it, as he gestures to the thrown chair. \u201cPick it up,\u201d he says, calmly, \u201cAnd sit do",

But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nCurrent craving: Victorian/ Edwardian or 1950s Europe, or Modern!\n\nThanks for reading all this!

Each life faded on his very eyes. His corpse, as it was not a body anymore. Just a reminder of his former glory and service to his people. Now coated in the dust. His yellow paint now dingy, Old. Just how long had it already been? How long were they drifting through this endless void? Unable to walk he just crawled towards the panel few feet away from him. He was willing to do anything to save his own people. His own kin. Even if it meant taking some if not many lives. \n\n\nLights continued to fade, darkness taking all of them. Was he too late?\n***\n**So I'll end it here since I'd like to explain everything!**\n\n\nI really don't know if I'll interest anyone with this idea but I chose to give it a shot.\n\n\n\nThe roleplay itself would be set in either Science-fiction theme. (Or fantasy but with a bit different approach). Anyways I'm hoping to discuss everything with potential partners. From who your character is, point of the story, yadda yadda. In other words I'd like to discuss **Everything**.\n\n\nAs for partners, males, females. I hope to hear out from you! (For now through Reddit PM's.)",

            "selftext": "There was a time when the lands of Titus were plagued by a pestilence that devastated towns, turned family against family, and tore asunder everything that was once held, dear. This pestilence was Necromancy.\n\nIt is unknown how the art of bringing back the dead was discovered, most documentation before the rise of what came of it has been largely lost, though bits and pieces still scrounge up now and again by pure luck. Whatever caused it, isn't important. What is important, is what came of it.\n\nTwelve men and women saw the power of the vile Necromancy, how it could be used for their own 'nefarious' purposes. You were one of these 'nefarious' people, originally a noble of a kingdom, the child of the King. You remember how your once simple and carefree life was turned upside down as you became a Necromancer. It scared you at first as you realized the power, how you could raise shambling hunks of flesh that could continue walking until you commanded them otherwise. \n\nEventually, you saw the usefulness of it. You trained yourself, and with the newfound power, you crushed a rebellion within your father's lands. It was a massacre. Yet...despite the bloodbath that sickened you to the very core, you found a more pungent feeling within your soul; power. This power, it transcended all that was known. The lust for power took you down a dark path, and in nearly a week, you killed your surviving family, took your father's domain, and decimated your rival kingdoms.\n\nEventually, the now eleven Necromancer Warlords had offered you something far more than what you had. They could give you more. All you had to do, was join them. It didn't take you a moment to decide.\n\nThey welcomed you with open arms, and named you 'The Noble', because of your royal blood. They taught you rituals that would allow your Undead to gain unprecedented strength and ability, at the cost of, in their terms, part of your 'soul'. You lost your sight, your hearing, your mind. By the end, of it, just like the rest of them, you were a bloated mess of skin, bone, and blood.\n\nAll twelve of the Necromancers were insane, which explained why they, including you, began to betray one another. At this time the twelve had already conquered most of Titus, the last of the rebellion against them quickly becoming nothing more than a rumor passed around by the few slaves with enough courage in their quarters. The ensuing betrayals left the entirety of Titus in shock, for Undead fought Undead, and the entire thing fell apart. \n\nYou were the last remaining Necromancer, severely weakened by the fighting, and sensing that the rebellion had just been a rumor was coming for you, you fled with your most loyal servant. With some difficulty, the two of you stopped at a remote island, and that was where you were buried.\n\nUnder a multitude of healing trances that left your loyal servant as good as dead from exhaustion, you were buried, and over the years, you healed. Your mind, your body, every part of you began to rejuvenate as yourself before the rituals.\n\nNow, 200 years later, you have finally been healed enough to escape. The healing trance is broken, and you are free to leave your grave. The question is when you leave, what will you do? Will you begin another crusade for power? Perhaps you will feel remorse for your actions? Whatever happens, you have the free will to do what you want to in this strange new world. Kill, befriend, talk, or, if you're into that, bed whoever you see fir.\n\n(Hello everybody! Thanks for reading this far, I'm happy I was able to be at least a bit interesting in my prompt. I'd like for this to be a world we can build together since I haven't really developed this world much. I'd like to create it as we go together!)\n\n(Obviously, you'd play the Necromancer and I another character, or even more if the situation calls for it.)\n\n(I'm also okay with darker themes, I have no triggers whatsoever and I'm fine with NSFW, as long as it isn't the center focus I'll be happy to play it.)",

            "selftext": "So lemme explain. I've had this \"monster under the bed\" character for a while now; he's just an old, grumpy, harmless, awkward, goofy and not-so-scary big furry monster, living under people's beds (and if you were on shamchat a few months ago, you've probably met him!). For some reason I've fallen in love with him and I absolutely adore seeing other people interact with him. He's always there, listening to you telling him about your day, his glowing yellow eyes carefully looking after you every night. Sometimes he comes out, but most of the time he just stays hidden under the bed, occasionally trying to playfully scare you when you're sleeping.\n\nSo yeah, who wouldn't want to be friends with the monster under their bed? Just think of coming home from a long and boring day at work/school and the monster being there to cheer you up. Or we can do something more \"story-like\". Also a good thing about the monster is that he is completely adaptable to almost any story; he can be goofy and funny, or dark and mysterious if you want to do something more serious.\n\nConflicts can be really fun, too. You don't have to always be nice with the monster; in fact, he can be a pretty annoying roommate sometimes. And you also don't necessarily have to be friends with him; you can be mad at him for not paying rent. Or you can try to shove him out of your room because you don't want a monster living under your bed. All of these things can make the relationship between you (or your character) and the monster even funnier.\n\nGonna say it just to make sure, I'm really looking for something SFW. Which, of course, doesn't mean that there can't be jokes and awkward conversations about the fact that the monster is living, well, under your bed (wink wink).\n\nMy literacy level isn't very high, also English is not my first language, and I'm from France so y'know, time zones.\n\nSo um, that's all I guess. I'm of course open to ideas. I'm only available on kik (and reddit chat maybe?) for now, but over time I'm probably gonna be on other chat platforms. Thanks for reading!",

No matter how many books he read through, it was always the old English translations that were the worst. The flowery prose and ancient cursive made for a pretty, but fairly useless narrative.

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm still looking for some good partners for both original and fandom settings. Here, I'm listing my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts, as they're still applicable.  (I also have the beginnings of a fantasy or sci-fi thing based off Nickelback's \"Lullaby,\" if that interests anyone...)\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* Please, for the love of Cruxis, do not ask me what medium I want to use for RP. I use tags in my titles for a reason, and when people ask me questions that I've *obviously* already answered, it's a pretty big turn-off; it means, or at least looks like, you didn't bother to actually pay attention.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina) \n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM.

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m Danielle, an 18 year old British girl. Recently I have been so desperate to roleplay a fantasy roleplay in a medieval world. I\u2019m looking for a passionate, active, enthusiastic partner to share this with.  First, I want to list some rules and information on how I roleplay: \n\n- I like detailed roleplays. Usually I do about 3 paragraphs a post, but it depends on the situation and where we are in the rp. If we are at a scene where there is significantly less action then it\u2019s acceptable to just post 1 paragraph. Or a couple of sentences. \n\n- I roleplay in 3rd, but can do 1st if you prefer. \n\n- I like NSFW scenes. This includes gore, violence and blood. When it comes to sexual scenes I am totally up for doing them if you are 18+. But I would only want these sexual scenes when it is appropriate. We can discuss this more.\n\n- Please don\u2019t rush my reply, I\u2019m sure we are both busy at times, and I will respect when you don\u2019t reply. But I would like us to have a post out atleast within 2 days of the last reply. Don\u2019t leave it too long.\n\nOkay, that\u2019s it for the rules. I\u2019m not strict at all about most things! \nI want to describe the one idea I have about this roleplay.\n\n- I had an idea for your character to be a prince/princess of a local kingdom, and in this kingdom most creatures are forbidden and hated, especially dragons. Dragons have a long history with the kingdom, and the king and queen despise them, ordering death upon any dragon spotted within the kingdoms territory. My character is a dragon trainer/whisperer, and is loved by the dragons. She hides out within the territory of the kingdom in this large dip, surrounded by overgrown weeds and leaves. (I can describe this place to you) And from there, I would love to hear any ideas you have about them meeting, being hostile at first, and their relationship growing. \n\nMost worlds I like involve mythical creatures, and living amongst them. I love fantasy films, whether they are Disney or real life. I LOVE how to train your dragon, which i used to come up with the idea above. I also love Maleficent . It brings medieval and royal together with fantasy. \nFeel free to enlighten me of any fantasy films that you like and we can base our rp off of.\n\nI am up for ANY ideas on a fantasy roleplay you may have to share, don\u2019t hesitate to bring them up in your PM. \n\nLooking forward to hearing from some of you :)",

This RP does not take place in the DC or Marvel universes, its a completely original universe that I plan on expanding with other rpers if this roleplay goes well.\n\nSince I've been wanting to do this RP for a while I have picked face claims for the charatcers though if you don't like yours, feel free to change it. \n\n[My character](https://media.metrolatam.com/2018/01/22/labordayjoshbrolin-1200x600.jpg)\n\n[His daughter](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CbzwX5_W8AAYaGk.jpg)\n\n\n**Requirements:**\n\nTo be honest I just ask that you be literate and female LOL.\n\n\nInbox me if you're interested, this is a discord RP but, if you absolutely can't do discord then I'm willing to try  other messengers.",

I\u2019m a little rusty but I love writing, and most importantly I love writing Widowmaker. \n\nI\u2019m emo Talon garbage so I\u2019m definitely looking for some WidowReaper, preferably with someone 19 or older, because the new Retribution lore has given my ship new sails. Now that we know Gabriel was good friends with Gerard, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a coincidence that he\u2019s now partners with Widowmaker. Maybe he promised Gerard he\u2019d look after her if anything happened to him? Idk man it just adds a whole other level of angst and depth and I\u2019d really like to explore that with someone! \n\nThat being said I am also weak for Moira so if you\u2019d like to throw her in with WidowReaper (bc for some reason scientist/experiment stuff is also good) I am also willing to side play Sombra and Doomfist, as well as a handful of Overwatch members for the sake of having a solid plot to work with! \n\nOther than that, I\u2019m up for playing Angela for something with Mercy and Moira. I can also play D.VA, or Brigitte, so if you have ideas you\u2019re more than welcome to throw them my way!!! but I\u2019m really looking for WidowReaper &amp; plot within Talon. So! If you\u2019re interested, shoot me a message. I prefer to hash out a little more plot with my partners just so we ensure we both enjoy it, but I\u2019m also pretty flexible so if you have any solid ideas I am probably up for it! \n\nThanks for reading!

Sorry fellow men, but it's not my cup of tea.\n* While I usually do prefer original roleplays, I can be convinced to do some fandom  stuff, provided I'm familiar with it. I'm mostly familiar with anime and videogames, and TV shows and movies are not really my thing. Suggest it, tell me what character you're looking for, and I'll tell you how I feel about it. :)\n\nGenres: I'm looking for something with some fantasy in it. I like slice-of-life, as long as it has some sort of fantastical twist to it, even if it's very low-fantasy. Modern, medieval, post-apocalyptic, alternate history, just hit me with it.\n\nIf you are interested in doing a fandom of sorts, I've got mostly a list of anime/games. Overwatch, Persona 5, Danganronpa, My Hero Academia, Dungeonmeshi, Fate Stay, for some examples. I'm also more than down to use any element of these as an AU!\n\nI think I covered most things for now. If you're interested and like what you see, PM me and let's discuss further!",

Mistakes happen but I want to he able to understand what you're writing. \n- Be able to write at least one paragraph minimum. One liners just dont give me anything to work with\n- Be able to reply at least once a day. Stuff happens and life gets in the way, just try to let me know if you'll be gone for an extended amount of time. \n\nAlright...I think that's it. Now onto the good stuff. I roleplay pretty much anything besides fandom and pure smut roleplays. I like a touch of fantasy in most of my roleplays but it's not a deal breaker if we dont have it. I also play both male and female characters, and all sexualities si theres plenty of openings there. I've got a few ideas rattling around in my head so just ask to hear them when you PM me. Also, if you've got ideas let me know! I'd love to hear some stuff. \n\nPlease tell me a little bit about yourself when you message me! Hope to hear from some of you. =)",

            "selftext": "...I said to myself, for what might be the millionth time now.\n\nEver since I met you, I've had a crush on you. I've done a good job at suppressing it I feel like, but that's what hurts. You've never really been interested in me, well, at least from what I've seen. So many of my friends tell me that we'd be great together. But... I don't want to destroy the friendship we've built together. I mean, I've known you since like first grade. You're literally my best friend. And besides, you probably don\u2019t even like me like that, contrary to what some have told me.\n\nAnd when you walked into that shitty bar on my twenty third birthday, it was so fucking hard to keep all of those emotions bottled up inside of me. Having Stacey around me helped. Though I literally only met her last week, having an actual girlfriend (if you could even call her that) kinda kept me in anchor. But every time I laid my eyes on you that night... Thoughts came flooding to my mind. Thoughts of protecting you, protecting that bright and cheery smile, one to light up a dark room. Those eyes reminding me only of good times together, eyes I'm sure could tell a thousand stories. Silky-smooth hair fit for brushing and playing with. I smile, quickly forgetting about the shitty beer I was sipping on, forgetting about Stacey, and forgetting about my birthday. The only thought in my mind was you at that very moment.\n\n...\n\nGod, I must be pretty buzzed.\n\nI snap out of it, looking back at Stacey and giving her a kiss. She looked like such a snack in that black dress of her\u2019s, highlighting her bleach blonde hair, amplifying her already curvy body. I can't wait to get home an-\n\nI hear the sound of heels running towards the front entrance over the sound of the music and people at the bar dancing and laughing. I look up at you as you leave your gift at your seat, tears forming in those beautiful eyes. What happened? Something with her boyfriend? I thought they broke up a while ago?\n\nI look back at Stacey. \"I'll be right back.\"\n\nI get up and walk to the entrance of the bar, wondering what was up. I get stopped by a drunk dude asking me about Stacey.\n\n\"She's my girlfriend, I guess,\" I tell him.\n\nWe get caught in conversation for about a minute before he goes to grab another drink, my mind only on you. I scoot by him and get to the front entrance, curious to see if you're still here. Probably not, I think to myself. \n\nWhen I open the door, I immediately notice some drunk douchebag trying to rip your beautiful red dress off of your gorgeous body.\n\nAnd just then, all of those protective thoughts, all of those emotions that I kept bottled in me for so long, all came rushing out.\n\nThe bottle popped.\n\nI dash over to you and knock the guy square in the jaw, causing him to fall over on the pavement. \"Piece of shit..\" I spit on the man quietly giggling on the ground. I look back at you, your mascara running down your face, part of your dress now ripped off, tears streaming down your cheeks. \"You alright?\" I ask, standing before you.\n\n******\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone that\u2019s in the mood to write about falling in love with a lifelong friend. My name is Chase, I\u2019m 22 years old, and I\u2019m looking forward to writing with you and getting to know you better. Also, feel no need to match the length of this. Also trans-friendly, so don\u2019t be shy!",

This is a prompt that a friend of mine made and since he no longer roleplays he sent me a few of his ideas so I could use em!I would love to do a roleplay that starts like this.\n\n*I should have listened to my friend... I was testing out a battery me and my friend made, we wanted to see how much electricity it could store and we decided to use I lightning rod. I had everything set up and my friend Amy was standing far away from the battery. I did a double check and started walking to Amy, but the lighting rod fell over as thunder cracked over me. I called out to Amy \"Hold on, I need to set it up again\". She cried out to stop and just leave it but I ignored her. As I placed the rod into the battery all the hair on my body stood up as I saw a blinding light... I was struck by lightning. I fell over and screamed out in pain but my screaming was cut short by a second bolt of lightning striking me, I smelled burned flesh. I twiched in pain as I was struck again and again. I woke up in my house but everything hurt like hell, and when I got up i realized two things. One, I was covered in scars that looked like lighting bolts carved into my skin, an two... I was glowing softly.*\n\nIf this interests you or you have an idea of your own please PM me! I only use Kik, I don't get notifications from Reddit. \n\nAlso, I only play as male and I only use first person so please be willing to put effort into the roleplay. ",

The link to join is [here](https://discord.gg/gKBUqYf), feel free to introduce yourself directly to me or in the sfw chat channel and I'll be sure to get you sorted. The prompt below is the general guideline we're going by, but I can be flexible if need be.\n\n____\n\nThe night sky is crystal clear for once, free from its usual looming clouds as stars gleam in the distance. Security personnel patrol the walls surrounding Compound OLYMPUS. The year is 2152, and LV_211 is the first planet to be successfully colonized since humans started expanding their reach from earth. The planet's conditions are harsher than that of earth's with an unpredictable weather system and largely hostile animal population, but at the end of the day, its nothing that strong walls and guns can't solve. The colony started with a population of 62, in the present day, it flourishes at 368. Men, women and children make up the colony with the majority of them residing within OLYMPUS.\n\nTwo additional outposts were established throughout the years, one for housing prisoners and the other for supplies. Compound Bravo, the supply outpost, is two miles outside the walls of OLYMPUS and houses a staff of 10 security personnel and 5 workers. The prison, Compound Charlie, is 10 miles from OLYMPUS. The greater distance was set in place in order to ensure that any escaped prisoners wouldn't be able to make it to OLYMPUS before capture. It has a population of 12 prisoners and 20 guards. The remaining population remains safe within OLYMPUS, living life as normal.\n\nAt the moment most of them are asleep, being watched over by a lethargic night shift. One guard lets out a loud yawn as another fiddles with his rifle, bored from years of taking potshots at roaming carnivores.\n\nSuddenly the light erupts in blinding light, hands move to shield eyes as others look for the source. Something is falling from the sky, something big.\n\n....\n\nThe ship crashed directly into the prison, severing its communications system and killing 9 guards and 3 prisoners. The remaining guards and their captain were ordered by the warden to relocate the prisoners to a storage room and attempt to secure the ship under the belief that its origin was human.\n\nAs they approached [something emerged](http://imgur.com/4HQnWcC) from the ship, leaving the guards frozen in fear as it eyed them. There wasn't enough time for them to react, the predalien lunged forward and cut through the guards, forcing a retreat as it killed 2 of them. 6 managed to escape as the remaining 3 were pinned down by its tail and claws. One of the guards watched in horror as it mounted his friend's torso, At this point the surviving guards left completely, locking themselves in storage with the prisoners as they tried to come up with a plan.",

Characters as well as back stories dropped into the military brigades and set to pilot a yaegar with one another \nWitcher ( Video Game trilogy )- Org characters playing as Witcher\u2019s and or monster hunters or just normal folk drawn into that work BUT it takes place in present day.\n\nI would love to hear some of your ideas as well and together we could combine what we love doing. Please PM me and then hopefully we can move it too discord. \n\nAlso as far as adult content goes we can play it by ear but I would prefer a plot line not solely focused on sex. \n\n",

I enjoy people playing Canon characters! though OCs are fine, But in all honesty I'd prefer the canons, but don't be afraid to contact me for an OC type thing. I myself am going to be playing an OC ( A male one, just for clarification.), and don't mind giving you a run-down of what I'm looking for plot wise and etc. So please, feel free to contact me at your leisure to ask and learn!~ I'm eager to find more roleplaying partners. \nAs for what I'd prefer people's post length to be? I don't mind at all to have a short post, ones ranging from a paragraph to three to two sentences are my preference, as I don't enjoy multi-paragraph posts due to them being slow.

            "selftext": "Hi! I'm Wizard, 18 and searching for some various, new roleplay partners. I use discord exclusively, everything else is either inconvenient or I can't promise consistent replies due to my own forgetfulness. I've been roleplaying for about 5 years now. \n\nI write in third person present tense, usually I give about a paragraph give or take. Depending on the situation. I won't fluff it up with nonsense to hit a certain limit if I don't have anything to work with. I primarily write female characters, I'm not against romance/smut either, but I don't like that being the primary focus of the roleplay. Lastly I am a bit of a stickler about grammar and spelling, and for the love of all things holy tell me if you're not interested anymore instead of just ghosting.\n\nI'm open to nearly any kind of RP setting, outside of anime (I would be willing to try something Attack on Titan themed *maybe*, I haven't watched the show but I like the premise.) and slice of life unless something is added to spice it up. (Murder, questionmark?)\n\n\nCouple topics I enjoy in particular include (In order):\n\n\n* Post-Apoc. Viral outbreak, zombies, that kind of stuff. I really like to focus on human vs human conflict in these settings however. Zombies just get boring on their own. \n* Titanfall, or something of the likes. \n* Homefront, or something of the sorts. I love the idea of a resistance group fighting for freedom. \n* Alt. History WWII. I like bending the rules a little bit. Not entirely sure what *exactly* it'd entail, however. I'd also enjoy doing something with say freedom fighters in occupied countries. \n* Classic high-fantasy. Some kind of simple adventure between two characters. \n* Sci-Fi. A little burnt out on it, but I can do something involving marines or aliens. \n\nIf any of these interest you, shoot me a PM! ",

If you are unwilling to do either of those, then please leave now.\n\nThey say among the classes of the sophomores in the school for magic, there's a girl there who is a natural prodigy in magic. She has long, wavy black hair and wears thick black glasses. However, legend has it that her hair catches whatever element she's using and turns that color. They say she can use almost any type of magic. However, the one, most well known thing about this girl, is that she's very shy.\n\nThey say among the classes of Sophomores, there's a man who's known as the happiest man around. They say he's a become of hope and morale for those around him. They say he was destined to lead the world's armies. But despite all that, he's always refused any offer for leader positions. Rumors circulate that he has a less than happy past about him.\n\nRumor has it the supposed \"Prodigy girl\" has taken an interest in the \"Happy mage\".\n\nRumor has it that there's trouble brewing with supposed demons of evil...\n\nRumor has it... That someone is hunting down the prodigy girl...\n\n---\n\nThis story will be set in a setting that's a combination of fantasy and modern day. Basically, there are things like monsters and magic among slightly modern buildings. Not to mention melee and magic are much more used than other weapons. However, there are also still things like phones. And while most of technology can be replaced by magic at this point, certain tech does exist\n\nThis will be a romance roleplay based on plot with heavy themes on action. Action/fight scenes will be carried out in one on one fights where one of us plays one of our characters, and the other plays the enemy. Smut can be a feature if you'd like, but it will NOT be the focus. Most of the smut scenes will probably just be monster attacks on your characters though\n\nMy character will be named Will and your character will be named Noemi. There will also be supporting characters within the story. I will be playing them to make it easier for you.\n\nI don't require a lot of detail in your roleplay. In fact, I get a bit intimidated when people write full paragraphs of text for one single response. I write about 2-6 lines per message. I ask that you try to match that for most of your posts.\n\nAlso, at some points, one of us may not feel in the mood for roleplay. That's fine. I just ask that you let me know when, and I'll do the same. Message me with your kik if you're interested",

            "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nI'm an 18+ Male in the GMT timezone looking for a RP partner, mainly for something fantasy or medieval based, but that's just my ideas at the moment. I'd be totally down for any other eccentric, unique worlds in other time periods that we might conjure up, too. I'm cool with the whole NSFW side if the context calls for it, so long as its not based entirely on it, and so long as you're over 18. I love my world building immensely, and before we get started, I'd probably love to have a chat about the kinds of things we would face on whatever journey we decide to take.\n\nI write in 3rd person, but whatever you do, I don't mind in the slightest. I'm not overly fussed about length on your part, either. So long as it gives me enough to work with, I'm good. I usually start strong with 3-4 paragraphs minimum of world building and character establishment, then average out at around 1-2 paragraphs during regular progression.\n\nI like to have a couple of storylines and plot points beforehand, but at the same time, I love when there's an element of mystery too, so I can get brought into the mystery that your characters might be hiding, or get more emotionally invested personally in situations. I'm pretty passionate about it, been Roleplaying for years!\n\nIf none of this intimidates you then by all means drop me a PM with a bit of info (Maybe your genre or a basic plotline you have, but no pressure) and if all's good I'll fling my Discord your way and we can start! (That being said, I could probably do it through other means, but not Email, Skype or Kik)",

Whether you're just a beginner, a hardcore fan like me, or somewhere in between I'll take you, since I'm very interested in creating something SCP related as of late. I'm willing to guide you along if you have very minimal knowledge, but I'll say right now that you're going to be very confused if you are not experienced in the SCP Wiki.\n\nMy post length and number of replies per day will vary, but I have an average of three to four paragraphs and at least twice a day. Speaking of days, my schedule is off the charts. I'm not always available, and sometimes I'm available in the dead of night when you're supposed to be asleep. It's weird.\n\nI have a few ideas on how this roleplay could go, which range from something as simple as a therapist assigned to one of the many Mobile Task Force's or something as outlandish as an 05 commissioning the use of SCP-212 on a 'voluntary' bodyguard. That's something that happens, believe it or not, I shit you not. There's a lot to play in this, and I couldn't be more excited to play it with a partner that is interested.\n\nIf you are that partner, hit me up! I'd love to talk to you and bang out some ideas.",

Individuals all around the world began developing inhuman abilities: leaping over buildings, spitting acid, telekinesis. More and more reports began to flood out of these new Quirks. It was said out of every 10,000, one individual would likely develop a significant ability. That\u2019s when the chaos broke out, criminals, thieves and the lowest scum began to rise with immense powers and turned the streets into mayhem. With the police incapable of standing against these foes, vigilantes began stepping out of the shadows, silencing the chaos and restoring order. Ten unique and gifted persons rose to the spotlight for their bravery and achievements, being known as the Big Ten. This period was the Awakening.\n\n5 years later. The world has begun to rebuild itself and adapt to cities scattered with quirked individuals. Government agencies around the globe came together to create a unified force against this rise of powered crime. This Agency became known as S.H.I.E.L.D. Special Hero Intelligence and Engaging Law Department.(working progress). An organization where powered persons over the age of 17 with top physical performance and significant quirks are recruited to defend cities world wide from natural disasters, powered crime and corruption. \n\n**Intro:** We meet on the first day of recruitment, a long week of tests and examinations analyzing our physical, mental and powered fitness.

            "selftext": "All right, bear with me here. First time posting here, but I've been looking for someone to do this plot with for quite a while. A little about me.\n\n* I go by Shades or Jay.\n* Time zone: GMT -3 (Brazil)\n* Age: 35 (prefer to write with people around my age range, or at least over 21)\n* Work full time, English is my second language.\n* Write in 3rd person, past tense.\n* Post length varies, I give what I get, basically, enjoy details, dislike one-liners.\n\nWith that out of the way, here goes the plot I'm looking to write with someone:\n\nCharacter A (mine, female) and Character B (my partner's, male) got married pretty early on in their relationship (possible reasons, an oops baby, or they were just young and dumb), before they even had the time to actually get to know each other. Character B is a member of the military, so he had to go when called to fight out of the country (either as soon as their kid was born or before, in case they'll have one). War, death, tensions in the country even when war was technically over have kept him away for a long time. When he comes back, things are pretty different, and he'll have to learn how to cope with the things he saw and people he lost, while reconnecting with his wife and navigating being a father. If we want extra drama, he can leave without knowing she's expecting, and hear of it when he's deployed, to make the situation even more stressful.\n\nThemes I want to explore: romance, rushed marriage, trauma, possible PTSD, adjusting to a new life, friendship, rebuilding their relationship slowly.\n\nIf interested, please PM me! I have Discord for plotting, but am more responsive over e-mail.",

They come and go, and I would like some that won\u2019t disappear after a few days. So with that said, here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for:\n\nI have done many genres: romance, crime, war, fiction, slice of life, etc. I will do any genre and role play except for video games or anime, as I am not into those. I would prefer a roleplay that is not centered around smut. I am fine with it, as long as it fits into the story. \n\nRight now I am looking for more of a crime, romance, and/or dark roleplay, as it fits my interests. \n\nI am looking for either male or female partners, but just let it be known; I play female and have never done a lesbian role play. I am up for it though, if we have a good plot. Speaking of plots, I have some ideas but would love to hear your ideas as well. I am okay with using either Reddit PM or kik. I do not have any other platforms but I am willing to get what is needed. If you have read this far and are still interested, shoot me a message. I\u2019ll be waiting! ",

            "selftext": "Hey there, thanks for joining me again. I'm just your average roleplaying schmuck who is interested in something new. I want to go into the taboo areas of life. You know, the things that we all think about doing with, or to, other people that we would never actually do in real life. The things that, if we ever told anyone else that we'd even thought of them, would make other people react with disgust, outrage even. The stuff beyond simple intrusive thoughts. Stuff even beyond the weird crap you read on Reddit. Gritty, gruesome, smutty, weird stuff that will either thrill you as you read and write it, or make you feel like a horrible person, or both.\n\nThe reason I don't go to one of the more smut/edgy centered subs for this is because I'm not just looking for a one off thing. I'm looking for an experience. A story. Something that I build with another person. I want the experience of creating this. It's going to be dark because that's what we both want. But also well written and frighteningly engaging. I am articulate and I expect my partner to be the same, but I don't have any paragraph requirements or anything like that. Write the amount that is appropriate for the situation. I believe in quality over quantity. I am currently a student in my last year at uni and I have a lot of spare time on my hands so I'd like my partner to be able to reply a few times a day at least. Oh, and with the material that we're going to delve into obviously 18+ please be older than 18. I prefer to RP over email and converse OOC on kik or some other app.\n\nAs for the actual content, I'm not going to put any story ideas here because of the nature of what I want. I'm sorry if that's too vague and wishy washy for you, but these aren't things to be discussed publicly. It's going to involve a bit of baring of the soul here, talking about things I'd never discuss with anyone I know at any point. But if there are things that you want to do that are completely socially unacceptable, please message me. I have a few ideas that I would be glad to discuss with you, and I am also open to any of the things that you're into. If we work as partners I'm sure we can figure something mutually satisfying out.",

Of course when I say that, I do want to emphasize I don't mind if a male plays the female character, and I do plan for this to be a romantic Roleplay just as well as a serious Roleplay. I enjoy people playing Canon characters! though OCs are fine, But in all honesty I'd prefer the canons, but don't be afraid to contact me for an OC type thing. I myself am going to be playing an OC ( A male one, just for clarification.), and don't mind giving you a run-down of what I'm looking for plot wise and etc. So please, feel free to contact me at your leisure to ask and learn!~ I'm eager to find more roleplaying partners. As for what I'd prefer people's post length to be? I don't mind at all to have a short post, ones ranging from a paragraph to four to three sentences are my preference, as I don't enjoy multi-paragraph posts due to them being slow.

In our RP the end of Return of the Jedi happened drastically different, leaving Endor destroyed and the majority of the main cast of canon characters being killed as a result. Currently a cold war is brewing between the New Republic and the Imperial Remnant with the insidious Hutt Cartel lurking in the shadows. Will you join the New Republic and keep the peace? Or perhaps join the ranks of the Imperial Remnant to restore order? Perhaps you\u2019d rather ignore the ongoing conflict and have your own adventures in a fresh take on the Star Wars universe? The choice is yours!\n\nSWRF is a premium Xenforo forum with a plethora of skins, customization options and features. We intend to bring you the best rping experience anyone can provide, also offering a Diverse RP section so you can start your own RP\u2019s outside the Star Wars universe as well as having a very active Discord server!

            "selftext": "**About Me:** I am seeking someone who can give about 3-4 paragraphs and who feels capable of playing Shikamaru Nara against Sakura Haruno. I am open to doubling as Naruto against Ino or Hinata if you want. I would love a post every couple of days, I don't need rapid fire responses by any means but someone who can still keep up a conversation outside of the RP would be nice. Below are some beginning plots, maybe they can combined if you'd like. Thank you for checking this out. I am also capable of playing Ino and Naruto as side roles if need be. Most of these take place in Naruto, as opposed to Shippuden but we would age characters up accordingly.\n\nI use Reddit PMs primarily but I am open to discord, google docs or emails. \n\n**Plots:**\n\n**Prompt One:** Sakura and Shikamaru have been friends since they were five though it was a friendship they had agreed to keep secret due to their different groups of friends. As they progressed through the academy, their secret friendship became strained as Shikamaru began hanging out with the boys and Sakura with the girls. Before long, their friendship dissolves and it's been years since they hung out together. Nearing the end of graduation, Shikamaru and Sakura are paired off together for a class project which requires them to make exact clones of one another. Shikamaru and Sakura begin to realize their lost friendship can still be salvaged but now that they're older and have different expectations from their peers, the question is should it be salvaged?\n\n**Prompt Two:** Upon graduating the academy, Team Seven under Kakashi-Sensei consists of Naruto, Sakura and Shikamaru. The trio get along rather well. Shikamaru makes sure Sakura doesn't pick on Naruto too much, while Shikamaru and Naruto are kept in line by Sakura who doesn't let them slack off too much. Meanwhile Sasuke, Ino and Choji make up another team which soon clashes with Team Seven. Still, Team Seven is filled with underdogs and has a lot to prove. Naruto and Shikamaru bond as friends and the more Shikamaru notices Naruto fawning over Sakura, the more he becomes intrigued with the prospect of romance, something he's seldom considered.\n\n**Prompt Three:** Taking place during the two to three year gap when Naruto is gone. Shikamaru confesses to Sakura his feelings for his teammate, Ino. Shikamaru and Sakura decide to start dating in order to make Ino see Shikamaru as serious boyfriend material. Both Sakura and Shikamaru begin pretending to date and it quickly catches the eye of Ino. Shikamaru is visiting the hospital where she and Sakura train under Tsunade, seemingly happy to take Sakura out for lunch. Ino soon confronts Sakura about the sudden romance and Sakura insists it's genuine attraction but Ino isn't so sure. Either Shikamaru or Sakura will soon develop real feelings for the other as feelings become mangled, even more so when Tsunade sends Shikamaru, Ino and Sakura out on a mission together.\n\n**Prompt Four:** Taking place during the two to three year gap when Naruto is gone. Sakura is doing her best to get to the rank of Chunin. She approaches Shikamaru for help and the two begin to train together. Soon Sakura begins bringing Shikamaru lunches in order to repay him for his time spent with her. And eventually she reveals she's play shogi and the two begin to spend more time together but not just on the training grounds. As the next Chunin exam approaches, Sakura is allowed to participate without a team and when she becomes Chunin finally, she and Shiakamaru begin taking missions together.\n\n**Prompt Five:** A different direction is taken as Zabuza has killed Sasuke, leaving Naruto and Sakura to mourn. Naruto turns to Sakura for comfort but instead of finding comfort in him as well, Shikamaru steps forward to help bring Sakua out of her depression. Naruto and Sakura continue to train under Kakashi-Sensei but it is clear this loss has shaken the team to their very foundation. Sakura feels like someone who has lost their identity and she gives up being a ninja. When Shikamaru makes it through to the finals against Temari during the Chunin exams, Sakura goes to cheer for him and by seeing him fight, her fire is lit. She decides to get back to training and Shikamaru elects to be her guiding light.\n\n**Prompt Six:** Everyone knew Shikamaru's home life wasn't perfect. His mother could often be heard yelling at her husband and son endlessly for the smallest of things. No one guessed that the woman could get violent however. Shikamaru never told anyone about the abuse until one day at the park after another confrontation, Sakura spots Shikamaru quite shaken and bruised. The two are nearing the end of their academy days and she offers him some comfort. When Sakura tells her parents of the abuse, they allow Shikamaru to seek refuge at their house for a while. Shiakamru's grades begin to improve as he and Sakura confide in one another and see that appearances can be deceiving.",

So I believe I'm versatile and am open to more platform suggestions. I'm trying to get back to strictly writing and enjoying myself in doing so. I want a partner I can develop depth with. That can discuss theories and ideas. I need someone that is also willing to contribute so we can build something together. \n\nBefore we get much further I must add while I'm not against writing smut by any means I really only write it when there's a reason. For the plot, our characters have developed into that direction or we've previously discussed it in a plot. I do love writing children characters but I will absolutely not be placing them into sexual situations. School yard crushes are all fine and well, as well as aged up things. Communication between writers is a must! Or I do lose interest if we can't discuss ideas and toss head canons back and forth. I do enjoy shipping, platonically, romantically, not all interactions have to be driven to end with sex or a relationship. I've  written m/f, m/m and f/f and have writing experince with each.\n\nI rarely make original characters but I'm not against doing so. I usually focus on canon characters and specific fandoms. I've included a list of fandoms and characters from them that I have written and prefer to write.\n\nA song of ice and fire.\nJon Snow, Rob, Lyanna, Arya\n\nAmerican gods.\nShadow, Laura, Mad Sweeney\n\nMarvel and or dc (movie and comic knowledge of both)\nFrank Castle, Bucky Barnes, Jessica Jones, Steve Rogers, Matt Murdock, Laura Kinney, Claire Temple, Jason Todd, Damian Wayne, Diana Prince, Harley Quinn\n\nStranger things \nEleven, Jonathon Byers, Joyce Byers\n\n\nThe walking dead\nCarl Grimes, Rick Grimes, Michonne, Glenn, Shane\n\nI also love world building and if we ever did want to do a plot and theme I lean hheavily on scifi or dystopian. I absolutely love doing both, so if you've been craving either reach out to me.\n\n\nI don't care how much you write or if you make a few grammatical errors here and there,  we're all human. Quality over quantity for sure, don't feel rushed but know that I am eager to write. Feel free to take breaks, we're all adults and have jobs,  lives, families even. So I by no means would be mad or annoyed if you took days or even a week or so to respond.  Just if possible let me know you're afk for a while, ha. I do prefer rapid fire replies, but by no means is this a requirement. \n\nIf you're interested just shoot me a message and I'll get you my kik or discord so we can start writing.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "So, i am looking for someone to do an RP that has a lotta story, and a lotta chances for some NSFW scenes. Let me get to the expiation.\n\nSo, within this RP, i will be playing an incubus, and you will be playing a princess. I know, sounds sorta generic, but let me get to the juicy stuff. So, my character manages to escape the grasps of hell, with the sole purpose of gaining power. So, he decides to use his unholy charisma to attempt to marry an unmarried princess, once that step is finished, he murders her brothers, her father, anyone that stands in the way of him becoming the king, and heir to the throne. Get the gist of it? I left it open, and a bit unfinished so we could create the story together.\n\nSo, if you are interested message me with any ideas you have, if you prefer it to be NSFW or SFW, or a mix of both. And if you have one, a character you intend on using. Thats about it, once that is done we can exchange Discord's and get this RP Rollin!\n\nThough, one last thing. I'm not the best writer, and i usually RP for fun in the end, don't expect a novel outta me really. I usually do one to two paragraphs as i prefer quick and fast responses, not one response a week. Get what i am sayin?",

An elf about six foot walks through the woods, a sword on his hip, a bow and quiver on his back. He hss red hair in a buzz, slightly taned skin and a stunningly blue eyes. He  hears a snap as you stumble out of the woods. \n(hey I'm Max and I'm interested in starting an rp on Kik. The idea is politics slowly start to unravel with us at the center. Anything from open warfare to more esponage would be great. I would be okay with a relationship starting but if it doesn't that's more than fine.)",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm not sure why reddit messed up my first try earlier, but I'm still looking for some good partners for both original and fandom settings. Here, I'm listing my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts, as they're still applicable.  (I also have the beginnings of a fantasy or sci-fi thing based off Nickelback's \"Lullaby,\" if that interests anyone...)\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* Please, for the love of Cruxis, do not ask me what medium I want to use for RP. I use tags in my titles for a reason, and when people ask me questions that I've *obviously* already answered, it's a pretty big turn-off; it means, or at least looks like, you didn't bother to actually pay attention.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina) \n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! (Please note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.)",

            "selftext": "Welcome in the world of 'A Venturous Voyage'!\nThis is a fantastic world, filled with magic and adventure.\nIt is the second part of another Roleplay and a continuation of the universe, their characters and conflicts. We try to present you our living universe. A place of choice and consequence. A place where life is often harsh and people try to survive. A world with all kinds of conflicts of people.\n\nYour character will join the crew of 'The Hummingbird', a research ship of a neutral nation lead by the questionable Doctor Jazil Emmett Askew. Aboard you will venture to all kinds of places in this world. You will work together with the rest of the crew on all kinds of things on the quest for knowledge. Each place will have its own adventures. Everywhere people might be in need for help and outer conflicts may arise. In between is the crew and you. Each one with their own story and motives.  \n\nYour character is part of this world. But can they survive in this harsh world? Will their past catch up with them? Can they bear the cruelty of the world? What will they do? Why do they act? How will they feel?  \n\nOur rules are complex to ensure the quality of the roleplay and to keep it at a constant pace. We try to help you to find your way in there as much as possible. Thus this roleplay is not suited for everyone.  \n\nWhat we expect from you:  \n- Creativity and Initiative  \n- Activity (this roleplay works in real time [GMT+1], so don't run away and expect everyone to wait for you)  \n- Cooperation with the mods  \n- Willingness to create a deep and original character (That process may take days, but it's worth it!)  \n- Patience  \n- The Ability to deal with fast paced Script/Casual/Few-Liner-Style  \n\nWhat we offer:  \n- A living universe to explore  \n- Authentic characters  \n- A deep ruleset  \n- A new quickstart guide to help you get into our universe with less effort and confusion  \n- Constant progress  \n- Activities to keep you busy  \n- Story lines to follow  \n- A patient and helpful Moderation, who will try to help you with all of your difficulties  \n\nFor more information contact me via PM.  \n\nHave this invite, if you are interested: https://discord.gg/egjssf3",
