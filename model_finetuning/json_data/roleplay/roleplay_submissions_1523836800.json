            "selftext": "We're a group of history nerds, reenactors, theater dorks and tabletoppers that have created a historical roleplay server on Discord!\n\nIt's a realistic setting taking place between 1918 and 1945 and following the lives of characters from all sorts of backgrounds (though most scenes take place in Europe). There are several different channels for different countries and settings within the world which often overlap and affect each other. Most of us have several different characters across these 'factions' but it's OK if you only want to play one.\n\nThink of it as an intricate web of intrigue and drama taking place leading up to and during the second world war. Kind of like in Ken Follett's Century Trilogy. Scenes can take place in any year you choose within the time frame, but generally we try not to skip ahead too far in any given channel in order to avoid inconsistency and confusion. \n\n18+, please.\n\nHere are our server rules:\n\n&lt;1&gt; What happens in RP, stays in RP. It is enforced. \n\n&lt;2&gt; Anyone can start a scene in a channel so long as there's not another scene already going on in that channel. A scene ends when there hasn't been a reply in 48 hours OR when someone involved in the scene writes &lt;&lt;End Scene&gt;&gt;. When starting a scene make sure you write the year and location of the scene so the rest of us know which of our characters could plausibly be there. If you are skipping ahead more than one year from the previous scene, you must obtain permission from the other players involved with or affected by the timeskip. \n\n&lt;3&gt; Please write with the best of your abilities; include details and specify as much as possible when roleplaying to avoid confusion. Be aware of the scene setting and try not to contradict what has already been established (weather, location, etc.). When introducing a character, please fill out a character sheet (found in #character-sheet) and post it within 24 hours. \n\n&lt;4&gt; OC's only, guys!! Try to make your characters somewhat realistic and historically accurate. For example: it's fine if you want to create an OSS agent trying to infiltrate Germany in 1941, but do it in a realistic way (no super-human abilities, etc.). Do your research. If you're not sure if something fits the time period, you can always ask (we're generally not SUPER strict about this. We know not everyone here is a history nerd. Just remember, that instead of TV we have radio, a lot of people still don't own a telephone, and refrigerators are only common in large estates or industrial kitchens).\n\n&lt;5&gt; No Meta-Gaming (don't use information you obtained out-of-character in roleplay, specifically information your character(s) wouldn't otherwise know).\n\n&lt;6&gt; Don't write what other people's characters are doing without permission. Consequences will be given at Admin discretion.\n\n&lt;7&gt; Scenes with excessive violence or graphic content are allowed as long as all parties involved have agreed beforehand. \n\n&lt;8&gt; Do not flood the Roleplay Chats with 'Out-Of-Character-Chatter'. Likewise, do not flood the out-of-character-chat with useless spam and memes. Clean it up. \n\n&lt;9&gt; It\u2019s very important to us that the members of our server are active. Therefore, within the first month of joining the server, it is expected that you have created at least one character and participated in at least one scene. Thereafter, it is expected that members make at least one in-character post per month. Exceptions are made at admin discretion. \n\n&lt;10&gt; If you have any questions, contact a Moderator\n\nIf anyone would be interested in poking their head in and checking out our server, leave a comment or send a PM and I'll get you the link.",

That fast pace isn't for me so someone who understands a slow pace in regards to offline duties is necessary. Real life comes first.\n\n- I don't want us to include the Avatar OC as a character. I want us to focus on the already existing canon roles.\n\n- I can give about 3-5 paragraphs and want the same in return. Third person, past tense should also go without saying.\n\n- I have played all three paths several times but if you have only played a certain one, please let me know so I'm not bringing in outside information (mostly in regards to Valla) unless you don't really care about spoilers.\n\n- Lastly, communication is vital to a story's success so please be prepared to plot with me. Talking to a brick wall gets really worrisome when partners fail to contribute or even get excited about what's going on or what is to come.\n\n**Character Cravings:**\n\n**Characters I can play:** Hinoka, Mozu, Silas, Sakura, Oboro, Kagero, Subaki, Kaden, Laslow, Selena and Leo.\n\n**Characters I'd like someone else to play:** Xander, Ryoma, Subaki, Jakob, Kaze, Rinkah, Kagero, Leo and Silas.\n\n**Some pairs I'd like to explore:** Xander/Hinoka, Xander/Sakura, Leo/Sakura, Subaki/Mozu, Kaze/Kagero, Kaden/Mozu, Ryoma/Selena, Jakob/Sakura, Ryoma/Oboro and Silas/Hinoka.\n\nOf course other options work too, I am open for suggestions. However there are several characters that I do not have any interest in working with, either writing as or against so if a common character isn't listed, it could be due to my personal disinterest in them but it doesn't hurt to ask and if someone as a way to sell me them and maybe give them something interesting, by all means reach out to me. All in all, I'm pretty open and I'd love to do something post-series but we'll see what happens.\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "So lemme explain. I've had this \"monster under the bed\" character for a while now; he's just an old, grumpy, harmless, awkward, goofy and not-so-scary big furry monster, living under people's beds. For some reason I've fallen in love with him and I absolutely adore seeing other people interact with him. He's always there, listening to you telling him about your day, his glowing yellow eyes carefully looking after you every night. Sometimes he comes out, but most of the time he just stays hidden under the bed, occasionally trying to playfully scare you when you're sleeping.\n\nSo yeah, who wouldn't want to be friends with the monster under their bed? Just think of coming home from a long and boring day at work/school and the monster being there to cheer you up. Or we can do something more \"story-like\", with a plot and more characters. Or we could make your character grow up with the monster. Also a good thing about the monster is that he is completely adaptable to almost any story; he can be goofy and funny, or dark and mysterious if you want to do something more serious. Or both.\n\nConflicts can be really fun, too. You don't have to always be nice with the monster; in fact, he can be a pretty annoying roommate sometimes. And you also don't necessarily have to be friends with him; you can be mad at him for not paying rent. Or you can try to shove him out of your room because you don't want a monster living under your bed. All of these things can make the relationship between your character and the monster even funnier.\n\nGonna say it just to make sure, I'm really looking for something **SFW**. Which, of course, doesn't mean that there can't be jokes and awkward conversations about the fact that the monster is living, well, under your bed (wink wink, winkie the wink).\n\nMy literacy level isn't very high, also English is not my first language, and I'm from France so y'know, time zones.\n\nSo um, that's all I guess. I'm of course open to ideas. I'm only available on kik (and reddit chat maybe?) for now, but over time I'm probably gonna be on other chat platforms. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "We recently lost a female member of our group and are looking for someone to replace her so this is a repost of a previous post.\n\nHey there. I\u2019m no stranger to roleplay and have enjoyed it for quite some time, however, coming to reddit for it is new to me. I\u2019m here on behalf of myself and a group of mine who would like to get a little group together for a fantasy/supernatural/super ability type roleplay (hopefully you\u2019ll get an idea by reading the theme). We are looking to have a group of 4-5, so since there are two of us we are looking for 2-3 people. We would prefer if you were decent at writing but neither of us are masters of the written word so don\u2019t feel like you need to be either. We want this to be casual and fun but do want people who can regularly participate. We also would like to have an age limit of 17+, we are all 19-20 and would prefer people around our own age. We are hoping to get a good balance of personality and writing styles. We would like to have girls as well as guys as we have been in groups together and think that a balance of both adds for better stories. If you\u2019ve made it this far than here is our idea: \n\nIt has been several generations since the world went through a great change. At first glance life seems to be as it always has been, as much of society has remained the same, but people have come to develop strange abilities with a unknown source. In the early days of these changes there was chaos and conflict but things have been regulated and the world has entered a stage of acceptance. The governments of the world have set in place a ranking system of every person which tracks them from birth to death. If you show no sign of abilities or fairly harmless ones you are given a low ranking. However, those with possible more destructive powers are given a high ranking. While there are no laws set to segregate these different ranks and many do live together with little to no poor effect, there is higher surveillance of higher ranked individuals and they may be feared by some. But those with abilities are not given a gift without a price. Each individual has a downside or negative effect of their ability. For some it\u2019s a permanent side effect, for others it only comes into effect after the abilities use. While this world has its issues, it has adapted to deal with them. But there is something boiling just under the surface which may have terrifying consequences. Something dark is brewing in the shadows and someone is going to have to stop it. \n\nOoh so suspenseful...haha. So that\u2019s the basic gist, it\u2019s not the most original idea in the world but I think it a fun setting which can be built on. If you are interested, message me or comment below with your idea for your character. Just some bare bones information so I can get an idea along with your ability as well as whatever negative effect comes with it. Also leave your name, age, and however you prefer to be contacted. This roleplay will be done through discord!\n\nThank you for your time and I look forward to meeting you!",

Beyond this I'm open to just about anything idea wise. So feel free to suggest your own. \n\nThis can have some romance in it if you like but nothing too bad ya know? \n\nI can use Reddit but prefer Kik or Whatsapp to chat.

            "selftext": "I've been really in the mood for a Harry Potter themed roleplay lately so here we are! I'd like to note right now that I don't want to play canon characters at all if possible. I love Hogwarts and the Wizarding World as a setting but I don't really love playing canons. As such, I'd like to keep it to post-Marauders/pre-Harry or post-Harry/pre-epilogue, and I'd like to use mostly OCs. Obviously with Hogwarts as a setting then there's the possibility of canon professors and such but I'd like our characters to be our own! I was thinking either playing as students in their fifth or sixth years or even as professors. \n\nNow on to plots! We can really do anything to be quite honest. The rise of a new darkness, a Triwizard Tournament, or even just the lives of Hogwarts residents. Obviously the first two would most likely take more time to plot out, but they seem like they'd be most promising for plots. I've got a few ideas for Triwizard events as well but I'll admit they're all pretty rough. I just really got a hankering for an HP roleplay :D\n\nFair warning, my roleplays tend to get a bit dark and a bit mature. I don't shy away from violence or relations between characters, and I write NSFW content all the time, but I'll obviously keep it within reason depending on your limits. I enjoy the grit though, so please keep that in mind! \n\nI do like a little bit of romance in my roleplays. That being said, I like relationships that grow over time, and prefer F/F but will sometimes do F/M if the characters really jive. Face claims also help me with stuff, so if you have one then that's definitely a bonus! \n\nI tend to roleplay over email for longer messages and over discord or google hangouts for shorter. My responses can range between a paragraph and about four to six paragraphs, but if we're using a chat based messaging system then I'll keep my responses shorter. My intros will usually be pretty long but I'll settle into shorter posts and I'll also tend to match my partner's length. I also roleplay in third person!\n\nLet me know if you're interested and we can hash something out!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm Afy. I've been roleplaying for about 12 years now, but recently I've run dry on reliable partners. As the title says, I am looking for medieval fantasy, though I may be open to other genres too. A few things to note:\n\nI need a plot, or at least someone willing to come up with ideas with me. I have plenty of plot ideas already, but I am also more than happy to try something new\n\nI enjoy playing female characters, though I have plenty of experience playing male characters too. I am also more than happy to double. The more the merrier, right?\n\nI prefer to roleplay through e-mail, though I've also recently gotten into Discord, so I'm flexible with those two. I'm not familiar with anything else, though I might be persuaded to roleplay from Reddit PM.\n\nI don't mind NSFW content, though it has to be appropriate. This includes violence, gore, and smut. Everything must make sense plot wise, though. I'm not a fan of smut for the sake of smut. \n\nI roleplay for fun, so please bear that in mind if I don't reply with four paragraphs. I prefer 1-2 paragraphs, but can give more or less depending on the situation. I'm a firm believer in quality over quantity.\n\nNow, as for genres, obviously I love medieval fantasy. A few other ones that I am willing to do so long as the plot is good:\n\n-futuristic/post apocalyptic\n-modern fantasy (I actually have a couple good plots)\n-odd pairings (though I prefer it with a fantasy element)\n-Gifted\n\nFor any fandoms, and for my plots, please follow the link: http://afyvarra.webs.com/plots.htm",

I have prior experience in text-based tabletop campaigns so I know how to flesh out a character and bring them to life but I want to share that experience with someone else. The settings I am interested in are Supernatural, Firefly, and X-Files just to name a few. These are not the only settings I am interested in though as I am open to role-playing cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, high and low fantasy, medieval, and many more with the exclusion of steampunk as it has never interested me. I prefer role-playing with original characters as I find it leaves more opportunity for story and world-building which is why I am trying to get into this. I am also open to romance in our stories but I would prefer it happen organically and not be expected or forced so in short romance is optional not expected. I work from home so I will be available most of the day so I can post frequently since it doesn't take long to write out text. I am okay with any writing style whether it's shorter posts or longer. First Person or Third person is fine I don't have a preference. I am looking for at least a post a day which I find to be reasonable. If I sound like a match for you please send me a private message with you contact info and I will get back with you as soon as I can. Thank you for your time and hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "Hello! As stated above, I have a Fantasy-themed game world that I designed ages ago and have redesigned over and over, but I can't seem to find players for it. Now, rather than just playing it with people, I'd like RP it with anyone who's interested. The original concept is heavily inspired by Fenoxo's Corruption of Champion's text-based sex game - highly recommend, by the way! - so the base design is furry and heavy in smut, but I've adapted different versions for anyone who doesn't want those, just specify your preference in your PM. The world is already mostly built, fully sandbox, and reactive to the player's actions. Dark Souls-esq in that even if your character is brutally slaughtered, they'll wake up at a designated location perfectly fine, if slightly weaker - and likely a lot less rich. I hadn't originally planned on forming a group to do this with together, but I'm open to the idea. I'm just as equally open to one-on-one RP-ing. LGBT-friendly. Here's the deets:\n\n- You are not a prophesied Champion of the world, born specifically to conquer evil and banish the darkness. You're you, and your decisions are your own, be they benevolent or malicious. In that regard, it's quite like D&amp;D.\n- There are no specific classes to limit the development of your character, you can run around in heavy plate armor shooting a bow and spitting magic fire if you so desire. It's all up to what gear you can find, and how you want to develop.\n- I will not God-mod you! I will not take control of your character out of the blue, and make you do whatever I want. If for whatever reason I need to do this, I will hit you up OOC (out of context) and ask your permission beforehand. Your character, or characters, are yours to control.\n- Heavily Fantasy, inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, Dark Souls, and TES. Monsters, demons, dragons and Dwarves. Political unrest, war brewing on the horizon, mystery abound, magic everywhere. If this isn't your cup of tea, I don't judge.\n- While it's very heavily D&amp;D-inspired, this is still an RP, not a game. I expect you to write for your character or characters, and react to the world as it reacts to you.\n- Multiple characters are perfectly fine, and even encouraged if that's what you like to do. We can discuss a maximum number.\n\nSpecies available for you to use as characters:\n\n- Human\n- Various different Elves\n- Orc\n- Dwarf (preferably not the hyper-buff ones, be realistic)\n- Half-ling\n- Qunari\n- Draenei\n- Tiefling\n\nIf you've made it this far, you must be at least mildly interested. Or you're humoring me. I've tried posting this with content warnings, but this post has gotten taken down twice now, so I'll just tell you when you respond and we can work it out. If you're STILL here, then you must be in for the long run, so I hope to hear from you! If you're interested, PM me, I'll toss you the Discord link, and if you could, kindly answer the following:\n\n- Your selected preference between furry content or non-furry content. This does have an actual affect.\n- Your selected preference between a sexual world, or a non-sexual world. This also has an actual affect.\n- Your desire or lack-there-of to be apart of a group.\n\nThank you! Fair warning, a writing sample will be asked of you upon arrival to the server.",

It is similar in many ways to our own, with its history only diverging frrom our own 9 years ago. As the ball dropped, signalling the beggining of a new year and a fresh start for many. Wishes had been shared and moonlight kisses had, smiles of glee apparent on all faces.\n10\n9 \n8 \n7 \n6 \n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 \n1.\nThe power went out everyhwere in the world for seemingly no reason. Asides from that nothing was wrong. Except for the metas. The first was Anarchy. A vile woman who sought to take over all inferior \"mortals\", declaring herself the Queen of Boston. No one dared to stop her, many following her example and seeking out to destroy governments. That is until Beacon arrived. The meta with control over the lights of the world dared to stop her.\n\nThe Anarchists and Beacon allies confronted each other, nearly levelling Boston while doing so. Beacon may have succeeded in the fight but both sides lost. Both Anarchy and Beacon had died. However, that terrible event had passed, with Boston reforming itself, now named Beacon City in his honour.\n\nThe FMSA: A government that were formed to ensure that another Anarchy won't arise. Metas may be registered and employed as officers to enforce metahuman laws, becoming superheroes in a sense. However, not all is well in Beacon City.A dark legion led by a meta known only as Apollo, a meta with a formidable grasp over nature itself, scours the city for blood to fuel his twisted agenda. He seems to seek out those powerful and twisted. Could that be you?\n\nJoin Universe 3-7-7, and you too may help decide Beacon City's fate. Will you join the FMSA? Keeping the peace and defending metas and civillians. Will you be an Anarchist? Following the ways of the chaotic group she lived and died for. Or will you be a vigilante? Defying the FMSA while still saving lives.",

            "selftext": "After the bombings, a lot of bad things came about. And along with those things society tried to cope with everything. Some trying to go to space to ditch this ruined planet, and some trying to go to the sea to try and restart civilization from underneath the waves. And even some went full fallout and made bunkers to hunker down into so they can ride it all out. But then there are those who werent really effected by the bombings. Sure some things mutated but that was pretty much the full extent, and they were all in the more rural areas, away from any major cities. Real backwoods places. And surprisingly enough all of the factions that survived the bombings lasted quite well, if not for their own differences.\n\nThose that went to space were supposed to be the best of the best and the brightest of the bright. They knew pretty much everything and were in the lead of technology and minds that could only be matched by the aquatic faction, but only to sacrifice their bodies for their minds, all those years up there, generations in Zero G, their bodies became weak, falling ill to the slightest of diseases and not exactly having the best body structure. \n\nThe aquatic faction they were at odd with those that went to space. They were also a nation of minds except more....feral. They have their underwater cities, but they aren't in the best shape. It's almost always a state of anarchy. But they are fairly needed as they get the testing for everything done. Focus groups, medical trials, everything, but at this they'd evolved to adapt to the darkness under the sea, their eyes had grown to absorb more light and they're often very pale.\n\nThose that made their way into bunkers around the major cities and capitols ended up being merchant colonies, specializing in trade and information. They didn't end up changing that much and they turned out to be fairly normal looking with only a few features like skin colors that stood out like reds, greens, even yellows, teeth, and maybe some pointed ears on the occasion.\n\n And those rural men and women who just stuck it out in their homes? They're responsible for pretty much everyone's food across every nation, just like before the bombs had dropped. They're pretty alright considering that they were the farthest away from the radiation. Beside a few occasional differences. They're usually a lot bigger than the average human, stronger, used to the laborious jobs that they and generations before had led. Maybe an over sized limb here and there, an odd ear, and at least a good few deformities. \n\nSo, if you read this far, Hi, call me green, nice to meet ya. Been playing with this idea for a bit, you can probably see a lot of obvious ideas borrowed. Anyway, I don't really have a lot of requests for you dear reader. Just that you're literate and don't just one line unless it's necessary. Also that you have some creative input into this. I don't want to be leading this all the time, I have my ideas but you should have yours also. Dont really have any line limits to speak of, just do as you wish.\n\nI usually stick around Here, E-mail, and Discord so yeah. If you're interested send me a message and I'll hook you up with either or.\n\nI look forward to talking with you.",

I mean that in no way to say I am any good, but just that I\u2019ve been around the block a few times. I am male, happily married with an exhausting full time job. I swear, probably far too much and I\u2019ll try to keep this ad as clean as possible. I\u2019m going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible. \u00a0\n\n\nI don't really have any limits or triggers. Of course, people discover things every day that bother them so if this ever changes or anything ever bugs me, I will be sure to let you know. Please do the same with me and I will be respectful of any of your limits. I DO NOT Write smut, I am very happily married. Though I realize it does happen in story lines and is often essential to moving the story along. We will fade to black. So for that reason, Please be 18+. I am most experienced with M/F. \u00a0\n\nAs for length of posts. This is going to vary. Sometimes a post only warrants two paragraphs to get things rolling. It happens. I work a very mentally exhausting job. Some days I can bang out extremely long posts. Some days I can\u2019t and they may be garbage. But this is supposed to be a relaxing hobby for me, not stressful. So if you aren\u2019t okay with that, you probably shouldn\u2019t message me. All I ask is that when we connect, you understand my schedule and I will understand yours. I require no time table for a post other then a few hours after mine. Please don't ghost me, and please don't leave me hanging for 2 weeks then post. It breaks the emersion of it all. \n\n I am looking for someone to write about the events following D-Day. I, playing an American soldier. And you, a female soldier. Be she, British, Canadian, French. It doesn't matter to me honestly. This would be something that has a slow romance building to it as both go through the tragedy that was WWII.\n\nAs far as medium's, and contact information goes: PM's, Kik, Discord, email and Facebook are all things I've used, things I'm used to. I will not, under any circumstances use GoogleDOCS has not, and will not work for me. Email I'm on the fence about to, so that will definitely take some convincing.",

So basically we're going for an AU.\n\nSecond, be able to play multiple characters, with your playable genders being at least male and female.\n\nThird, I don't do purely romance. I need action and adventure to sustain my interest, so I hope you do too! Romance can, however, be an element. I'm all for that.\n\nLastly, be at least 18 years old. That one is self explanatory, as I'm above the legal American age.\n\nAlright enough of that. Here are the fandoms I'm currently looking for, ordered by importance.\n\n* My Hero Academia\n* Pokemon\n* Dragon Ball\n\nAnyway, that's it.

Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.\n\nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence.\n\nThe world is alive with tons of lore and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature.\n\nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.\n\n\nSome of the things possible within the realm we deliver is character progression through a system of time spent active. New players can create a character, hop in, and the more that character interacts with the world and participates, the stronger they become. And with character creating is two main paths to take. Magics are broken up into schools and types, but arcane is vast and deep. Technology on the other hand allows for just as much power through tools and science. Mix and match to your hearts content. An alien beast, with breath of fire and frost, rampaging through battlefields in search of prey. Or a mech, fully powered on a custom build energy conversion core and toting a machinegun with a full belt of bullets, ready to lay siege to any target. Or even walk the middle, a knight from some far of kingdom, a hardlight axe in hand and riding a spiritual mount blessed by a goddess. \n\n\nThe limit to what can be done is your own imagination. Take the first step, find a space on the wall, and carve your name in history.",

            "selftext": "Death clung to everything. The feeling of it lingering could be felt in the air where the putrid scent of it wafted. Miles outside of towns or villages you could sense that death was coming or perhaps had already been. Healers were at a loss, priests could pray no more, and everyone was looking for something, or someone, to blame. The swollen buboes, the dead fingers and toes, the black dots that peppered a persons body, the fatigue and sickness. It was the devil\u2019s work, some said. Others believed it to be a curse brought on by witchcraft. Many even believed it to be penance for people\u2019s sin. \n\nKnights were put to task by the Catholic church in an attempt to investigate possible pockets of witchcraft. A small village outside of the city has been mostly untouched by the black death, prompting many to believe something far more sinister is happening that involves sacrifices, necromancy, and devil worship. \n\nA young woman is one of the small village's healers. She is known to use powerful herbs and remedies to take away aches and pains, keep injuries from festering and resulting in infection and death. Is it knowledge beyond her years or is it more nefarious such as witchcraft? That is what the knights are there to determine. While she is not a suspect by any means, the fact that the village had yet to have the plague reach them, to have a low rate of death, add in the rumors swirling to the point where the Pope had chosen people to investigate? It wouldn't hurt to assume that everyone was a little bit suspicious.\n\nLed by a charismatic Knight, the band of men arrive in the village, setting everyone on edge. What did they want? What were they going to do? What if they brought the plague with them? For so long they hadn't been bothered, to know have people chosen by the Pope himself, it wasn't sitting well with some. Tensions soon rise as people begin to accuse one another of being stricken with love for the devil or are practicing witchcraft. A small disgruntled band of villagers even threaten to kill the knights if they don't leave and let them all alone and be in peace. \n\nIn an age where the inquisition was in full-swing, people's loyalties were questioned, and a changing in society and women's roles, it was only a matter of time before it all reached a head.\n\n------\n\nLooking for someone to bring this story to life with me, searching for someone to enthusiastically portray a knight hired on by the Pope to investigate the village and its inhabitants. I imagine this story to be dark and gritty, violent at times, with a possibility of NSFW themes. Given this, I ask that you be *well* over the age of eighteen. This is a rough idea and easily can be worked with. I would love to find someone who is serious about writing **and** researching the time period with me, even coming up with new ideas and issues to throw at our characters -- who I so love to challenge and make life hard for.\n\nI love any and all themes. While I envision this to be based in reality, given how the main female protag does dabble in witchcraft, supernatural elements are something I'd consider, but would like to chat it out first. \n\nI write lengthy replies, meaning far more than just five paragraphs. I don't ask you to match my length, but do put in an effort. If you get stuck, or maybe I will, I'd love to talk things out and see if we can't come up with something to get over the roadblock. \n\nI primarily use email as how I write, discord is used to talk things out OOC. If you wish to write via discord, I am fine with that, too. I'm adaptable.\n\nI work a full-time job. There are going to be times during the day when I can't respond, but I usually do reply once a day at minimum. I'd love to write many responses in a day, going back and forth, but understand life happens and schedules aren't always the same. \n\nIf you love the idea of the dark ages, witches, the plague...let's give it a go!",

            "selftext": "Website: [Forced Heroes](http://forcedheroes.jcink.net/)\n\n&gt;The world is a rough place. Politicians bicker, nations clash, and society ticks another step forward. and to make matters worse, the world is becoming privy to a handful of individuals with tremendous abilities. Aliens come rain hell down from the skies as demons come from below to torment and abuse.\n\n&gt;The world is on a cusp of change as people rise up and embrace their villainous nature while others become the heroes they were forced to be.\n\nForced Heroes is a shonen inspired RP, with heavy basis and inspiration on Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, taking place on a modern earth-like planet called Eden. Tone and tempo is more akin to other anime like Yu Yu Hakusho and Bleach in regards to world building and lore to sort of have a world and society that would plausibly react like one would expect in a universe where martial arts skill can allow you to invoke inner energy to shoot energy blasts and fly.\n\nBy being Dragon Ball (and other anime) inspired, Forced Heroes relies entirely on original characters, though Dragon Ball canon races are fair play, as well as adaptations from Bleach, which have already been interwoven into the lore. Adaptations from other animanga franchises or elsewhere are also fair play, and are up to the individual user to mesh and make work with board lore.\n\n__________\n\nWebsite: [Going South](http://goingsouth.jfbs.net/)\n\n&gt;Superman is dead, and as the world mourns its fallen hero, people of all stripes rise up to take advantage of the void left in his wake. A strong sense of urgency has Batman circling the wagons within Gotham City. To make matters worse, someone has altered the flow of time, and nothing is as it seems. But in the darkness, there's a forgotten Flash of light helping to guide the way.\n\n&gt;And they will need it, because there is something dark on the horizon....\n\nGoing South picks up immediately after DC Universe: Rebirth #1 and deals with the fallout of the Darkseid War, DCU: R, and the Final Days of Superman Arc.\n\nGoing South accepts DC characters based primarily on continuity starting with the New 52 reboot, though individuals are allowed to pick and choose elements of comics prior to the reboot, cartoons, or the CW shows when necessary to create a take on a character they like, just as long as it doesn't completely contradict the DC comics canon up until Rebirth started. Wildstorm characters, both those present and not present in the New 52 reboot are also allowed, though they should be tweaked in order to fit into DC canon where needed.\n\nOriginal creations as well as plainly obvious homage/pastiche characters are also allowed. Canons aplenty are available as well!",

This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What is Angarak?\n---\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What makes it unique?\n---\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What are the 'requirements'?\n---\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### Tl;Dr\n----\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, how are you all doing today?  Good, I hope!  Real quick like, I want to go ahead and mention that I am seeking people that are 18+ as I do like to explore NSFW themes and romance in my roleplays.\n\nThat out of the way, as one might guess, what I am currently seeking is a roleplay set in the Halo universe, specifically the time between Halo 3 and 4 as the Spartan-IVs are getting off the ground and the UNSC is experiencing a new wave of resentment from some of the colonies due to acts that they used to survive.  \n\nFor our roleplay, I wanted to do something of a what if and pose the theory that Spartan-B312, Noble Six, actually managed to survive Reach and was folded back in as a Headhunter for the remainder of the war and beyond.  What if, while still searching for Forerunner artefacts in the Outer Colonies, they hear word of a new Inssurrectionist movement, and the leaders will be meeting on the world in question?  Not wanting to potebtially lose this chance, they send in B312 to assassinate them and stop the movement from the start.\n\nAnd this is where my partner would come in.  I'm completely open to any ideas that one might have in terms of a character and woild love to brainstorm something.  I also enjoy playing as Fred-104 so I am not opposed to doubling where I am him and B312.\n\nAt any rate, I look forward to hearing from you all soon!",

            "selftext": "Hiya. I'm looking for a few RP partners to write with over on Discord. I'm quite flexible in terms of genres, although I do have mild preferences. What I am in the mood for is an engaging, twisty plot and depending on what it is I'm okay with it being short-term or long-term. \n\n* I write anywhere from 1-5 paragraphs, my starters usually being the most lengthy and shorter replies more common during a more quick-paced scenario. I expect my partner to be well past the beginning stages of writing, but certainly don't need novel-length replies.\n* I prefer writing past-tense 3rd person. \n* Open to any genre that I feel I can do justice to, but I have a soft spot for modern, modern fantasy, paranormal romance, romance in general, crime, and (post) apocalypse. Open to sci-fi, high fantasy, or anything I haven't mentioned if we can work up an interesting plot.\n* I'm going to have a little more time in the next week or two, so even better if you're in PST time - we can fire off multiple replies a day.\n* I pretty much always like romance to have a presence, so sorry if that's not really your cup of tea.\n* Speaking of which, I'm on board with smut, but it should be organic. \n* If we start RPing and I'm not really feeling it, I'll be sure to let you know. And if you don't feel like it's your cup of tea, my feelings won't be hurt. Better to be honest than just ghosting each other, yes?\n* Would be cool if you were at least 21+, anything younger feels a bit too young to be writing potential romantic themes.\n\n\nA few prompts I've been craving - * **also open to your ideas or plots!** *\n\n&gt;*Prompt 1: [Futuristic] [Mild sci-fi] [Mystery]*\n\nFeeling something in the realm of Ex Machina and Westworld. My character is a top of the line android, one of the most expensive prototypes to have existed, and one of the most humanoid in both physical makeup and AI. However, any known androids had been decommissioned in the last two years, and any leftover machine parts had been broken apart and liquidated by the sole company and producer of said androids, after an untimely attack on a civilian by one of their most lauded products. Someone took her and hid her amongst a pile of rubble in what is now known as a wasteland of thieves, smugglers, rouges in the vast desert lands of the Nevada. It could be because she was known to have real consciousness and the accomplishments of this particular android was too valuable to give up. Maybe her makers wanted to keep her to further production at some point. Maybe she was kept as a potential weapon to be developed. Your character (scavenger? bounty hunter? government official?) comes across her, reanimates her, and maybe word gets out she's still in tact. Cue hunters, shadowy organizations, and plenty of violence. \n\n\n&gt; *Prompt 2: [Noir] [Assassins] [Crime]*\n\nSet in modern days, both of our characters are hired assassins employed by rival crimelords of a large city that has seen better days. I\u2019d imagine the setting to be a lot like Sin City, rampant with drug use, criminals, and violence. Citizens are at the mercy of the corrupt major and his underlings, who all have been equally influenced by the two crimelords who up until now have had equal footing in terms of playing the major\u2019s right hand man. Both of them find an opportunity when it is discovered who their each most valuable assets are: their hired hands. My character\u2019s employer sends her on a mission to find and dispose of your character, who is tasked with the same assignment of finding her before she does him. They both have files and information on the other but we won\u2019t know how everything will play out until they meet. Of course, your character\u2019s motives and backgrounds are up to you. For this one realistically, our characters should really be no younger than mid-twenties.\n\n&gt; *Prompt 3: [Time travel] [Open-ended] [Fantasy]*\n\nThis one is more open-ended in terms of direction. We could chat endlessly about the possibilities, but the only starting point I got so far is that my character is from modern day, purchases an antique artifact from a dingy thrift store, and one night gets transported back in time to whatever era it is we want to play in. I think it'd be fun if there was also a presence of fantasy in said era. Feudal Japan, filled with demons and magic? The Middle Ages, with dragons and waged wars? During the Trojan war, in the midst of Greek gods and goddesses? Whenever and wherever it is, I'm sure we can come up with something fun. \n\n&gt; *Prompt 4: [Supernatural] [Demons &amp; Hunters] [Apocalyptic] [Dark themes] \n\nIn this plot I would be playing a demon of some sort. You would be playing a hunter of her kind, including other supernatural beings. Another ancient demon of a much higher power gets their hands on an ancient tome that has the ability of wipe out all humans only to leave the darker beings to roam the Earth. An unlikely duo, they set off finding the missing pages of the tome before the ancient demon does, encountering vampires, werewolves, ghouls, and other dark beings. I\u2019d imagine there would be trust issues and some tension between the two of our characters. (Time period is open.)\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\n ",

Finally the night of our graduation I decided it was time I told you how I felt about you. \nWe shared one passionate night together and it was better than I could've imagined but when you woke up, i was long gone. \nI come back 7 years later for my mothers funeral and as I'm trying to get you to forgive me, you tell me to just go but when I get to the state line we all bare witness to the largest terrorist  attack on U.S. soil.

I'm currently looking for long term RP who like to try new settings and branch out if the current story gets stale since almost every story eventually runs out of steam. I prefer to post at least once a day and I am okay with shorter and longer posts since I understand everyone has different styles and respect that. I try to be open with all types of settings and coming from tabletops I am very use to fantasy both high and low but am comfortable doing others as well. I am open to world building as well since I find that to be extremely fun and interesting. I am twenty years old and work from home so I am available all throughout the day on Discord. My view on NSFW themes is that I am okay with them but most certainly do not expect them I also don't expect them to be the main focus of the story even in a romance stories as there are other forms of intimacy. If this sounds like your cup of tea please send me a pm here on reddit! Thanks for your time.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I have recently been toying with an idea of a male OC and would love to test the waters with someone! I am 21 years old and have been roleplaying for nearly 10 years. I am flexible with length but prefer for the roleplay to be in third person. I use kik, email, and Reddit PM.\n\n\nSome details of my character: \nBeckett Knowles is a 21 year old university student who is majoring in business (only because his father would not pay his way for any other major). He\u2019s a quiet person but he isn\u2019t shy, he\u2019s just very choosey of who he interacts with. He spends a majority of his time in the library on the nearly abandoned second floor. His true passion is Art but his parents have talked so much trash about his creations, he honestly doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s any good. \n\n\nHe has long brown hair that he mostly wears in a bun and oversized circular glasses. He wears a lot of vintage clothing and his style can be very odd and questionable. He has a very aloof personality and no one can ever tell his true feelings. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in roleplaying with me, do not be afraid to send me a PM or chat!",

            "selftext": "I love it all. I always try to include some sort of battle or war, even if it's in the backdrop, to sate my fascination with the very idea of combat. Military tactics, last stands, ambushes...it's honestly enough to get me fully invested. It's incredibly difficult not to include it, even if it's something as simple as a barroom ball or a secret fight club, to the more chaotic battlefields of a medieval conquest or the mess that is sci-fi naval combat.\n\nWhen I decided to read the halo novels, I found the fight sequences, along with the backdrop of an interstellar war, to be blood pumping. Those were the most interesting moments for me, and I hated it when they ended, though the novels always were amazing enough to keep my interested when the fighting had toned down.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Why, I thought it would be obvious! I want to roleplay something that has a fair amount of combat. Everything else about the rp can be tweaked and modified to our choosing, but it *must* have some sort of conflict happening at some point. It could be a war where are characters are soldiers, a zombie apocalypse where every day is a constant battle, a Tournament where one must trade blood for glory... the possibilities are endless\n\nI don't really have an idea of what I want with the story, but rest assured, despite my belligerent stream of conscious, I'm fine with the conflicts taking a backseat. As long as conflict plays some sort of role, I'll be happy and eager to play.\n\nThat's the basic idea, if you have *any* questions or ideas feel free to message me!",

I'm currently looking for long term RP who like to try new settings and branch out if the current story gets stale since almost every story eventually runs out of steam. I prefer to post at least once a day and I am okay with shorter and longer posts since I understand everyone has different styles and respect that. I try to be open with all types of settings and coming from tabletops I am very use to fantasy both high and low but am comfortable doing others as well. I am open to world building as well since I find that to be extremely fun and interesting. I am twenty years old and work from home so I am available all throughout the day on Discord. My view on NSFW themes is that I am okay with them but most certainly do not expect them I also don't expect them to be the main focus of the story even in a romance stories as there are other forms of intimacy. If this sounds like your cup of tea please send me a pm here on reddit! Thanks for your time.",

For the last 97 years peace has been apparent throughout the continent, ever since the peace treaty was signed by the would be king, Robb Stark King in the North and the Southern King, King Tommen Baratheon. Robb would take the young Baratheon girl Mrycella to be his bride, Tommen would take the Northern princess Sansa in exchange for peace between the two kingdoms. House Lannister was defeated with exception to Tyrion Lannister who was allowed to keep his life as also part of the peace treaty. The grandchildren of these noble kings and lords now live in fear of the would be conquerer Rhaego II Targaryen. \n\nThis is just a shortened version of the main lore for our server, the rest can be found once you join up! You are able to create any character you wish, a king, a noble lord or even a peasant the choice is yours. \n\nWe do require all of our players to be 18+ as the server will contain adult themes that are also apparent in the books and tv show. If you are found out to be under the required age you will be kicked immediately. We also require that you are able to post a minimum of at least a couple of paragraphs, one liners will NOT be accepted as it doesn\u2019t give the roleplay a lot of opportunities and overall lessens from the experience.\n\nOf course the main purpose of the server is to have fun and meet new people so come join in on our server, we can\u2019t wait to meet you!

            "selftext": "I am wanting to set up a paranormal agency story with similar themes to Hellboy and the Hugh Jackman Van Helsing movie for those of you that are familiar with both of these great, if not it's fine. The story will have a mix of paranormal magic and the occult as well as elements of mad science Sci-fi. There will be heavy themes of action and paranormal investigation. Depending on how the story feels as we progress it could be very bloody. A lot of violence and blood is not a must have just be aware it is a possibiity.\n\nAnyone applying should be able to write literately and in detail as well as in 3rd person. If English is not your first language I understand just make sure you can write in a way I can understand you clearly. Also I would like anyone interested in this to be 18+ as I am 19 and I would just feel more comfortable the person I am role-playing with to be older than 18. I am OK with romance, but only M4F and only if it does not feel forced. As stated in the title this will be on Discord and maybe I could make an exception for just using PM. If you have read through all this and you're interested then please PM me so we can discuss more I hope to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "Hello and Welcome! Are you a detailed and experienced rp player who also loves meeting new people and the medieval times? Then you should move to the great city of Ordana.\n\nBefore i get into the details of the city i have a few criterias for you to be able to join. Firstly you need to be well detailed. I don't want any one liners or a smile \"he smiled and walked\". If you write like this then don't bother try to join. Secondly, i want you to be active. if you reply once a day that's not good enough. If someone has started an rp with you, then you should finish it before dissapearing. Also i don't want anyone to harass any of the other people in the chat. If you have problem with someone then come to me first before going into their dm's :)\n\nIf you're still reading here is what the rp is about:\n Ordana is a city surrounded by great nature and great people. It stands on its own and if you want to get to the next city it would probably take a few hours with horse. The people of Ordana are of the friendly bunch. In the middle of the small town there is a huge market. At the market every type of fruit and vegetable is being sold. As well as clothing, armor, and everyday necessities.\nThere is also a bar in the town. The bar is mostly lively in the evenings and nights but can also have a few people inside at most times. \n\nThats a little description of the town so far! So if you still want to become a part of Ordana then i want you to message me with the codeword: Ordana2\nI also want you fill out this:\nName,Age,Jobb,Sexual Orientation,Hobbies\nAnd i also want a small drabble about your character\n\nAnd a sample of your rp style. you can write whatever you want just show me how you would usually write a reply!\n\nI hope to hear from you all! Pm me for more info",

            "selftext": "Okay, so I'm going to try a shorter format, something more like a list of sorts and see how that goes.\n\nSo anyway greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...Pokemon, Splatoon, Little Witch Academia, My Hero Academia, and Legend of Zelda. With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes.  I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",

            "selftext": "Hello Redditors,\n\nI'm looking for a long term partner. My objective is less a specific story than someone that might be interested in a variety of stories, or building one up from the ground together depending on our mood. With the right person, I am willing to play more than one contiguous story line and dedicate to one on one, mostly \"live\" play. \n\nHere are a few of the basics I'm after:\n\n- Experienced partners only\n- I play male characters that prefer female characters.\n- One on one (Discord)\n- 3rd person\n- Grammar, spelling, etc. as expected.\n- Story structure and plot that is compelling.\n- Well-developed, out of the box characters that are wholy original.\n- Novela style, multiple paragraphs (post ranging depending on context and need from 200-2000 words per.\n- \"Live play\" where posts are exchanged in repetition for at least a few sessions a week.\n- Journalling/offline posts when schedules are unavailable. \n- Webpages, tumblrs, photos, and an interest in such things.\n- Yes to these genres: modern realistic, modern fantasy, period pieces (any) fantasy/realistic, near present sci fi, far future sci fi, deep space opera sci fi, adventure, thrillers, mystery, noir, W:tA (maybe). \nNo to these: canon, high fantasy, medieval fantasy, steampunk, college/school, slice of life. \nYes to: Adapting existing stories we each have into something uniquely ours, creating from scratch with a partner.\nNo to: Handholding and writing the entire plot and every twist myself, playing in another person's pre-set world I had no input in.\n\nI've been at this for a while, as you might guess. I am very choosy, but I'll never be rude and I'm pretty dedicated once settled with a partner. The truth is, experience has taught me that it's better to be very specific and risk scaring some people off. I'll be happier and a better match with the one person I do end up writing with than I would half a dozen mediocre partners I don't really line up with. \n\nI am happy to bend to your requirements as well within reason. If you are interested, I can provide writing samples, pages, and a good deal of whatever else you might need to judge. To get us started, here are a few of my existing character pages:\n\n[Memory's Undoing](https://memorysundoing.tumblr.com/)\n\n[What Clever Game](http://whatclevergame.wixsite.com/whatclevergame)\n\n[Nobody Gets Justice](https://nobodygetsjustice.tumblr.com/)\n\nWhat I'm really interested in is someone enthusiastically into all the nerdy parts of writing long form roleplay that I am. I would like a partner who gets excited about ideas and has a few of their own. I want to be challenged and surprised and fascinated. Most of all, I want objectively good writing that keeps me coming back for more.\n\nAll that said, we will need to actually speak to know if we are a true match. I play exclusively in Discord, if you PM me here on Reddit, I'll share my contact info so we can get to the important parts. \n",

I look forward to hearing from anyone whom is interested.  As for responses I don't have a problem with short replies depends on where the role play is or what's happening at the time.

The Jarl offers a banquet to thane him, with all the privileges that come with the title. The warrior is given a house within the hold, a sum of gold, an enchanted weapon and, as he expects, a housecarl. The warrior expects a housecarl of big stock, a Nord or an Orc or a tall Argonian; someone large and powerful enough to do his fighting and carry his burdens.

            "selftext": "Good evening, as the title already implies, I try to find someone willed to play Noctis for me. I'm a literate female RPer who would love to play out a little spin-off, extra-sequence or even just putting them into another setting to allow for some romance between them that the game has lacked. I don't need you to constantly write because we all have busy lives and lack of motivation, but if you do, please make sure you're using correct grammar and orthography aka spelling. To be fair, I would like to add as well, that I have not personally played the game, but I did watch a lot of lets plays and read through many wiki pages and I'm certain I can provide a believable Luna!\n\nNow, as for a first post to give you a sample of my writing: \n\nSighing quietly as I flipped the notebook open, my fingers were already gently stroking, almost caressing the smooth reddish leather back of the hardcover. I smiled to myself as I allowed me to indulge in old memories before I closed the book again, holding it to my heart like the precious thing it was. My eyes closed, I felt your presence drawing closer soon. Ever since the day I sacrificed my life for you I had waited. And even though I was happy to know that we would be united again, the thought you would have to part with others as the tribute to this meeting made my heart ache. \"Welcome\", I whispered quietly, turning around to you with a soft smile as you entered the room that looked so much like your own chambers in Insomnia - back then when the Crown City still was safe. But we were at another place now, a replica - however, at least, it would be safer than any other place we had been at together. This time, we would not be ripped apart again. I could not force myself to tell you where we were yet, though, so I just came closer, the same serene smile plastered across my face - the strong, faithful one I kept for occasions like this: when I had to hide the downsides. My right hand soon approached yours, the other keeping our shared memories in place. \"I missed you, Noctis.\"\n\nPS: I'd like to believe someone misses the romance just as I do. And I'm sure that someone of those who does, too, would like to fill the story up with it. After all, there seems to be a deep bond between them...even after all these years.",

I don't want to hassle people to post or reply and in that same regard, I don't want to be be pestered unless it's been a week or more.\n\n- I give about three paragraphs typically and want the same in return.\n\n- I want us to use canon characters. I don't really like insert-me characters/OCs.\n\n- I stick to third person, past tense. Me and my characters are different.\n\n- It's important we keep in touch to plot and stay on the same page. My partner should be happy and eager to post and that means voicing what we both want to happen. I love chatting with my partners. I also like knowing if any delay is gonna happen, if you need to wait a couple weeks, that's cool. I'm a patient person. I try to be chill but try not to keep me on the hook for too long. Generally speaking if we need a break, I'm fine as long as I'm not kept in the dark about it.\n\n- Lastly the general tone of my RPs tend to be light and focused on slice of life stuff. I don't need tons of action or dramatics happening all the time because it's just going to drain my motivation to post. To me writing is about escape and life is too dramatic to have it being written about as well. I want this to be fun, not bogged down by things like cheating or tons of lies and deception and drama. Conflict is fine but I'm not looking for a lot of depressing plots.\n\n**Fandoms:** Okay so below are a collection of canons I can play and ones I am seeking for someone to play for me. I am open for doubling and sharing roles so guys, don't feel like all male roles are on your shoulders. Please PM me to talk about plot and pairs. Or other fandoms or crossovers. Bolded roles are ones I really want.\n\n**The Good Place:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Eleanor, Tahani, Chidi, Jason and Trevor.\n\n*Characters I want someone to write as:* **Michael**, Tahani, Chidi and Eleanor.\n\n**Marval:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Pepper, Jessica, Trish, Steve, Tony, Colleen, Danny, Raven, Erik, Charles and Laura.\n\n*Characters I want someone to write as:* **Logan**, **Matt**, Tony, Steve, Jessica, **Kilgrave**, Danny and Natasha.\n\n**Harry Potter:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Hermione, Luna, Ron, Ginny, Draco and Lily.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* **Harry**, Draco, **Snape**, Lupin, Luna and Cho.\n\n**Death Note:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Light, Misa, Matsuda, Sayu, Near, Ryuk, Rem and Naomi.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* **L**, Light, **Ryuk**, and Rem.\n\n**Dot Hack:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Blackrose, Kite, Elk, Atoli, Haseo, Pi, Saku, Bo and Silabus.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* **Haseo**, **Kite**, Saku, **Kuhn**, Atoli and Alkaid.\n\n**Doctor Who:**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Rose, Tenth Doctor, Martha and Amy.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* **Ninth Doctor**, Tenth Doctor, Rory and Eleventh Doctor.\n\n**Fruits Basket**\n\n*Characters I write as:* Kagura, Tohru, Kisa, Momiji, Hana, Kyo, Yuki, Shigure and Ayame.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* **Haru**, **Hatori**, Kagura, **Momiji**, Kisa and Uo.\n\n**Naruto:** \n\n*Characters I write as:* Sakura, Ino, Naruto, Hinata and Lee.\n\n*Characters I want someone else to write as:* **Shikamaru**, **Kakashi**, Ino, Naruto, Shino and Sasuke.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! I have decided I wanted to rp some dragon ball/Z/Super/GT Whatever you prefer. Though I will prefer we not start out strong. Now let me give you the scene.\n\nIt's been 216 years since the end of Dragon Ball Z, once Son Goku leaves with Uub to train him. This is the timeline of Age 1000, the Z-Fighters had died and the heroic efforts of Son Goku and his friends have slowly faded into legend.  Among the Earthlings, much of his heroic efforts were claimed by Mr.Satan, who became the late renowned great savior of mankind.\n\nEarthlings have expanded themselves with fueled based advanced technology of the Capsule Corporation. Within two centuries Earth went from a backwater planet to one of the most central hubs in the North Galaxy. Because of Gohan's Book on Ki Control, a good portion of Earthlings have learned to harness Ki and a handful became skilled martial artists.\n\nSaiyans were originally eradicated by the galaxy dictator Lord Frieza, and only two pure blooded Saiyans remained Goku and Vegeta. Some earthlings may have tiny fractions of Saiyan blood due to Goku and Vegeta's lineage which makes these breeds stronger than normal Saiyans, but a century ago Vegeta had taken a trip to Planet Sadala in Universe 6 and convinced Saiyan volunteers to travel to Universe 7 to rebuild the Saiyan population. With no home planet and no one trusting them, the Saiyan visitors became nomads on Planet Earth.  Despite their mild mannered nature and good hearts, people didn't trust them because of the bad reputation of the race. There are thousands of Saiyans now, but they are scattered across Earth and the galaxy and many are living in tiny settlements on other worlds.\nNamakians slowly over time rebuilt their population on New Namek, and many of them still had a clear memory of being on Earth and how they stayed there after the original Namek's destruction. They ushered in their Earthling brethren with open arms and a handful of Namekians migrated to Earth a century ago. Some Earthlings helped the Namekians make a settlement on Earth in their own villages similar to Namek to advance towards a modern society. They are common amongst the Earthlings as of now.\n\nThe Frieza Force was nearly destroyed two centuries ago after Frieza's defeat, until he was revived by Lord Beerus' attendant Whis. Frieza had once again taken reign over his empire, a century later Frieza had sired a heir  to his organization which later went through an occurring cycle . These separate warlords completed among each other, However, a war was brought about with the Galactic Patrol vs the Frieza Force. With the rise of Frieza, the Galactic Patrol fell out of relevance. Despite their efforts at keeping peace and order in the galaxy, they were not warriors and simply got outclassed. It is said that the Galactic King noticed the potential of recruiting powerful martial artists after witnessing a tournament held by the God of Destruction. He set about rebuilding the ranks of the Patrol, eventually raising it up to be a solid paramilitary force that could rival the remnants of the Frieza Force. Two decades ago, they pushed their enemies out of heart of the galaxy in a valiant war. For now the Galactic Patrol is highly respected and well supported. This is due to the tentative peace they've restored.\n\nMajins started popping up after Majin Buu desired love after reading a book about love and he manifested a female Majin named Miss Buu. Majin Buu shot Miss Buu with a love beam called the Booby Booby Beam which caused her to fall in love with him and have a child named Baby Buu. Over time the child created a wwife and the cycle continued. The population of Majins increased taking over 1/3 of the Earth but it slowed down after a century.\n\nIf ya wanna rp in this please MSG me!",

            "selftext": "War. It is something that can last a few mere days or be dragged out for decades. For most, defeat is the very end of it all and refuse to lose even if their back is against the wall. Defeat is never an option to those not willing to back down even if it threatens their life.\n\nLeaf-bare is coming in and it is unsure if anybody is ready for the snow bound days to pass. Starvation is up on the table just as much as Hypothermia. Some won't be able to handle it unless they are not alone.\n\nA new shadow has cast itself in the territories and is looking to expand. Who can say no when they can't even defend themselves? This is the only way they can survive...and survival sounds better than slaughter. A rutheless man that doesn't take no for an answer and proves those wrong who says he will be defeated. He has yet to have his downfall. The Centurion going by the name of Vulkan.\n\nBut to every new evil to enter the world, there is an opposite. The good always comes to throw out the bad. A legion isn't much when you don't have the bare minimum of people. But quantity over quality can make the biggest difference. An uneasy conqueror, a warlord that doesn't know how to shut up, and [Y/C's Class] travel to Myre (Samurai Territory) in search of more skilled individuals in the battle field. The swampy terrain isn't enough to stop the determined yet small legion.//////////// [End introduction.]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIf anyone can't tell, this is a **For Honor** roleplay with just O/C characters. uwu For the characters involved in that little introduction, I can play them (excluding your own) unless you wish to help me out, then feel more than welcomed to do so. My character will be a Nobushi that the few run into (anyone get where the title is from?~) and she will end up joining the Legion. The names of the Legions, characters along the way, and everything else will be discussed in PM. Such as if we want to involve romance (yes please~). If you have messaged me before and I didn't reply, I was probably swamped with other messages. My bad, friendo.\n\nI roleplay with *only* literates so if you are a one liner, please kindly refrain from messaging me. I roleplay on Discord, Kik, and Reddit pms. uwu When you pm me, to show you are literate I'd like an example of your writing. I'd also appreciate knowing your character's class/name! Hopefully, we can jump right in if you have no questions.\n\nThanks for reading. Have a good day.~",

Something romantic but nonsexual, something cuddly and happy and snuggly. I know it's not for everyone but I'm just looking for someone who'd want to give it a shot. I roleplay third person paragraph style and I can play either a man or a woman. I prefer to work over PM or Discord but I'm openminded. If you'd like we can discuss plots and scenarios over PM :) And if you'd like to try a fandom we can discuss it! I'm open to trying a fandom, perhaps Overwatch! Or My Hero Academia since I just got into that! I know they\u2019re real life people but maybe something with the Rooster Teeth personalities, I\u2019m open :)",

A lot of it is based from taking Japanese (and some from other mythologies and some original) mythical creatures and reimagining them , and mixing the culture of Japan in the Heian period of Japanese history with modern technology to world build a unique setting, but all this is just explaining it lightly. \n\nThe setting fits into the following genres: high/epic fantasy, dark fantasy, science fantasy, space opera, and in some cases dying earth \n\nInfo on the setting here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vzpYYSTGClELDZNWIwamdr2JOpP_7m1RZunY_sg87E\n\nPlease be prepared to deal with some pretty dark issues, if anything triggers you please let me know. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required(but welcome), but please be detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

Most would know it as merely a vassal of the Efrenian Empire, but for those who dwell within the city it's much more important than that. It's a city of thieves and heroes, of men and monsters, of outcasts and fortune-seekers, and even of mages, although they tend to keep themselves hidden. But all is not well. In the west, the pirate republic of Skallista grows more and more ambitious. In Valentine, political tension between the myriad factions dwelling in the city threaten to split it apart. And at the center of the world, the Worldscar roils and flares, as it always has, releasing raw magic into the world. There is danger, yes, but there is opportunity. Will you be one of the few to seize it?\n-------------------\nHey! We\u2019re a growing, tight knit community of writers looking for members to hop in on the ground floor.

            "selftext": "**Me:** I'm a mature roleplayer (primarily in age, though the latter can be discussed in private) with some time and a hankering for some giant robot shenanigans. While I consider myself pretty competent with both grammar and my native grasp of the English language, I'm by no means an expert at either and am prone to making mistakes (I probably already have in typing this). I primarily play female roles, but other genders aren't necessarily out of the question. I'm LGBT friendly, in both terms of players and any character romance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**You:** Given that I'm not the best in the world, I can't expect potential partners to be either, but you should have at least a decent grasp of grammar and English and preferably be able to post more than one liners. You don't have to post miniature novels, but 3 to 5 sentences would be nice. Third person is also a must, this is just a personal preference and I'm simply not a fan of first person RPs -- sorry.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**That sort of thing in which I'm looking for:** Someone who is pretty chill, but still will post fairly regularly (at least once a day). I started writing this with the idea of a Gundam fandom-based RP set in a new original story and with original characters, but as I'm typing now I'd be up to discussing other mecha/giant robot series, be it from real or super robot genres. I'd even consider a completely original concept as like as it had those big robotboyes I'm craving. That said, I can do drama and gritty, but I do shine at the haha (comedy) so a story that can cater to that would be great. Romance would be nifty too, though I prefer it happen naturally if at all. I'm also hoping this will be a long term RP, I do enjoy character and world building. **If you have any other questions, or have any suggestion, please don't hesitate to speak up!**",
