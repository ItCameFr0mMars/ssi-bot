            "selftext": "I'm a pretty versatile RPer in terms of settings. I've basically played them all and am generally looking for a literate roleplayer who shares common interests with me. I usually prefer playing women, but am not opposed to M/M pairings. I would like to point out that RP does have the potential to be NSFW, but above all I put story. Not just \"the road to getting laid\" but the actual story, please be willing to do so as well. \n\nFirst, I'd like to set some guidelines:\n\n1. Please, please please be over 18. I, myself am 24 and will not, under any circumstances RP with anyone under the age of 18, because in a roleplay, sometimes things have the tendency to become somewhat x-rated and I will not risk getting in trouble for any reason.\n\n2. Please be willing to brainstorm and try new things. I am a very open minded person, and I feel that if I'm willing to check out a new series, whether it's TV, anime, movie, manga, comic (etc.) you should be too. \n\n3. Please be polite. I like to think of myself as a very nice person, and as such you should be too. My ideal partner will be someone who I can get along with easily, OOC. Maybe play games with (I have a PS4) if we feel like it. \n\n4. Don't Godmod. It's no fun to play/fight against someone who's super perfect. In a real fight people get hit, people go down, don't be afraid to make things realistic. Along with this is a very strict NO MARY SUE/GARY STU. They're not fun to play with. It just makes things boring. \n\nAnd last but not least:\n\n5. Please, don't get all weird and over personal. I have definitely had it being a female RPer, sometimes some guys tend to get a little weird. I'm not saying all of them are like that but it happens. I don't, under ANY circumstances want you asking me strange questions about my personal life. I don't care for weirdly sexual questions while we're rping. If we're rping, please leave it at that.\n\nWhew! Now that I've got that out of the way, let's get to the juicy bits!\n\n**IDEAS!!!**\n\nFirst, I would like to start by saying that I'm open to all pairing types, F/M, M/M and sometimes F/F. I'm also open to playing with girls who want to play a male.\n\nSo, I am a fan of many things. I've seen probably over 100 anime/movie/tv shows. And of course, I'll be more than happy to list some of my favorites along with pairings I'm a fan of.\n\nAnime:\n\n* Inuyasha (Sessh/Kag, Inutai/Kag, Inu/Kag, Sessh/Kagura, Kagura/Nar And a few others that can be discussed.)\n*  Naruto (Sasuke/Sakura, Naruto/Hinata, Naruto/Sakura, Minato/Kushina)\n* Fairy Tail (Lucy/Natsu, Lucy/Gray, Mirajane/Laxus, Levy/Gajeel)\n* Bleach (Orihime/Ichigo, Orihime/Grimmjow, Orihme/Ulquiorra, Rukia/Ichigo, Rukia/Byakuya, Rukia/Renji, Hisana/Byakuya, Also open to others just didn't want the list to get too long.)\n* Fullmetal Alchemist (Winry/Edward)\n\nExtras: Sailor Moon, Tokyo Ghoul, Seven Deadly Sins, My Hero Academia\n\nOf course those are just a few, for length's sake, please feel free to PM me with any others if you're curious!\n\nAside from anime, I love TV show fandoms such as:\n\n* The 100\n* Game of Thrones\n* Black Mirror\n* Firefly\n* Sherlock\n* The Walking Dead\n\nFeel free to ask about any others!\n\nI love movies as well! There's a few that I should probably mention since I've been craving the type of setting lately.\n\n* Underworld\n* Twilight **Actually sort of really into this right now.** It's silly, I know. And the books sucked and so did the movies, but the world interests me, and I'd like the opportunity to write a better story with the same setting.\n* Star Wars\n* Any and all Disney Movies\n* Studio Ghibli Movies\n\nI'm a fan of Marvel and DC settings and have a whole host of pairings to list off, I'll refrain from that simply so my post doesn't get too long! But please about about those as well.\n\nGames! Games are great too, I play a great deal of them--here's some options!\n\n* Bloodborne\n* NieR: Automata\n* Destiny 2\n* Mystic Messenger\n* Overwatch\n* Fallout (3, New Vegas, and 4)\n* Devil May Cry\n* God of War\n* Far Cry\n\nMoving out of canon settings, I enjoy medieval fantasy, modern, sci-fi, post apocalyptic, anything really. \n\nSmaller aspects I enjoy are romance, a very interesting story, slice-of-life, episodic stories, time lapse (or memory) plays. \n\nAnd a somewhat odd touch, I really enjoy historical RP. Such as taking place in a realistic world, but in an alternate world of sorts, say if Napoleon didn't lose France. Things like that.\n\nSo another idea that went through my head is more of a grittier scene. Something involving mexican cartels, mafia or other crime families. I think that could turn into a really interesting idea as well. I'm really open to all sorts of stories. \n\nAnd finally! A little about myself.\n\nI am 24 years old, female, pretty laid back. I'm friendly and really creative. I often use pictures to inspire myself and will show them to you as well if you're interested in that. I'm really super easy to talk to and just really want to have fun. I'd love to get some people to brainstorm with.\n\nMediums I'm open to:\n\nSkype, Discord, email. \n\nAnyway! Thanks everyone who read this. Please feel free to comment below or shoot a PM to my inbox. I'm so looking forward to hearing from people.",

Most of our world as we know it is uninhabitable, ravaged by horrendous monsters known as the Beasts of GRIMM. These beasts have forced us to stay put in our territories, finding some sort of painful co-existence with them. However, hope is not lost. Hunters, brave men and women trained in the art of war, have made it their mission to combat these beasts of GRIMM through any means necessary.\n\nThis story starts with one particular school for hunters: Beacon Academy. The best hunting school in Vale. It is here that the hopeful youth of our society test their mettle to become the best of the best. What will you do? Who will you become? There is only one way to find out.\n\nWe are a brand-new RWBY server where you can chose to either fight as your own OC or one of the many canon characters in this world! Hunter, villain, or anything in between; it's up to you! This rp will mostly follow the plotline of the show while elaborating on the daily life of the characters within it. Be warned, this RP will eventually contain spoilers for RWBY.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/gFqJBhg\n",

It caters to casual and serious gamers alike. Enjoy a variety of classes and paths to take your character. Maybe you want to host a Guild that uncovers hidden locations or maybe you want to be the best trader, offering up rare items that dazzle your clients. Or maybe you're a blood thirsty player who wants to rule in the arena and become a famous Emperor and player killer?\n\n- I am hoping for 3 to 5 writers for this.\n\n- Post frequency is not expected to be fast. I have a life and I don't want partners to feel like they have to post or be kicked off the group. That is not the case here. Generally I would like someone to try and post 2-3 times a week.\n\n- A post should be 4-5 paragraphs or so.\n\n- Our characters will be students who are approached by the son of their former favorite professor. He begs them for help, needing to why his mother fell into a coma, believing the truth lies somewhere in The World. His mother was playing it when she fell into a comatose state but so far, he feels left in the dark.\n\n- Our characters will be pushed into two groups. One group will be governed by a young AI named Aura. She is a myth that is very vital to the game's lore and only a few have ever seen the girl in white. Aura will appear and bestow a power to only a select few. The ones she does not select will form a second group of more rebellious characters, guided by the son of the comatose professor. He will use hacking and illegal methods to rip apart The World to find answers, while Aura and her group will follow other clues and take a more gentle approach. The second group is more aggressive and risky, while the first group follows the story of The World.\n\n- Both groups will cross paths frequently and are expected to still call one another to go on quests and hang out offline. \n\n- I will be playing Aura, the male son of the comatose professor and another female so I can have a hand in both groups. If you know you'd like to be assigned to a certain group, let me know and I'll try to accomodate you but I cannot promise anything. That said, the groups want the same thing, their methods will just differ.\n\n- Here is the link: https://discord.gg/jpxuUcj",

Okay, but seriously, I just binged this show and love it to pieces. I'm not familiar with the comics in the slightest, though, so please don't expect that of me. Would prefer someone who has seen both seasons, but it isn't mandatory.\n\nPretty much only looking for someone to write *Cassidy* for me; would happily write a Jesse or a Tulip in return (I hesitate to offer someone else, but talk to me and we'll see?). \n\n**Marvel/MCU**\n\n\nI've seen all the movies (Infinity War included) and would prefer to keep things movie-verse since I am not familiar with the comics at all. I'm more than happy to double on characters, and I prefer canon/OC pairs (though I'd happily play Clint/Natasha, Vision/Scarlet Witch, or Peter Quill/Gamora). I'm also perfectly okay with love-triangle-y things, or quadrupling if you're so inclined. Please ask if interested.\n\n*Play:* Tony Stark, Thor, Peter Quill, Peter Parker, Vision; lesser interests include Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Natasha, T'Challa, Hela, Dr. Strange. I will *not* write Loki or Bucky Barnes for you.\n\n*Play Against:* Loki, Dr. Strange; lesser interests include Thor, Hela (tl;dr - I'm mostly looking for a Loki but I won't turn down one of the other three with a good partner) \n\n**Gotham**\n\n\nI'm up-to-date on the show, and would strongly prefer you were as well, though it isn't mandatory. Again, I'm super AU-friendly. Doubling's fine, though I'll tell you right now I have no desire to play Selina Kyle or Tabitha Galavan in a main-character capacity. I will not write Lee/Ed under any circumstances; please do not ask.\n\n* **Oswald Cobblepot**/Edward Nygma\n* **f!OC**/Isabella\n* **f!OC**/Sofia Falcone\n* **Lee Thompkins**/Barbara Kean\n* Bruce Wayne/Jeremiah Valeska\n* **f!OC**/Edward Nygma\n* **m!OC**/Oswald Cobblepot\n\n**Special Mentions**\n* Inception (**Arthur**/Eames; open to AUs, not really looking to double)\n* The Flash (doubling; **f!OC**/Harrison Wells (Earth 2 iteration); willing to play Barry, Cisco, Caitlin, or others)\n\nThat's everything! If I've piqued your interest at all, please don't hesitate to send me an email! But please, make sure you've read over everything!

I roleplay 3rd person, and can adapt to any scenario as long as it has order. I\u2019m sure no one here enjoys roleplaying where everyone is just sending replies, causing everyone else to rewrite or negate their response.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to start a roleplay group: I\u2019m open to all ideas. I\u2019ve never roleplayed with a GM before, but if anyone has any experience with that let me know!

            "selftext": "*Behind Closed Doors, the Game of Perfection Ends.*\n\n*Like video games, life is a series of choices and for some, winning is everything.*\n\n- - -\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Set in modern day Tokyo, Japan at a private university where two characters are in their final year.\n\n- RP over discord or reddit pm, may make exception for google docs.\n\n- Posts should be anywhere from 300 to 600 words typically.\n\n- The pace should be slow enough that a partner shouldn't feel the need to post but should post when they feel able to.\n\n- This is a very loose plot which can be tweaked if needed, I leave details and such open to discussion. \n\n*Plot:*\n\nShe was always sought after. Her optimistic outlook was always infectious. Upon her first year when the cherry blossoms were blooming, she revitalized the university's theater club. To say she had a skill for melting into her roles would be an understatement. Plays were always sold out when she took center stage and yet, she never gave anyone a reason to doubt how humble she really was. Everyone saw her as a bright star in an otherwise dim Tokyo sky.\n\nHe was a skilled athlete. He could play soccer as well as tennis and baseball. He was always busy and had a following of girls who would watch over his practices and bring him snacks. He was a hard worker, without a doubt. And yet his studies were never neglected and if a friend ever needed a shoulder to cry on, he would be there by their side without hesitation. He was cool and strong while also seemingly sincere about his dedication to those around him.\n\nOn campus both of them were quite popular and yet they had never said much to one another over the first three years of schooling. The school itself was rather small, as its entrance exam was one of the hardest to crack in Japan. And yet as fate would have it, these two seemingly perfect individuals would cross paths whether they wanted to or not. As spring rolled around and their final year was about to begin, the school had no choice but to grant them both an apartment together. \n\nThe school being so small, had a limited amount of apartments and a limited amount of both sexes. Usually the school would put the same sex together but due to an issue with numbers, this year however would be the first in many years in which two people of the opposite sex had to live together. The school was very secure about its students so living on their own wasn't even a possibility.\n\nSo the pair moved in together, both having their own room to themselves. But the school's two perfect and popular individuals did not seem to click at all. Their first impression of one another was not pleasant by any means so they both decided to just stay out of each other's way. Of course her friends were curious about him. And his friends were equally jealous of his new living situation. \n\nBut after classes got out, they would hide in their rooms and pretend they had less arrogant roommates. They would lose themselves in an online game full of magic and monsters and dungeons and knights. Incidentally the pair were partners in the online world, often teaming up to find rare items or beat terrible bosses.\n\nAs it would seem these two perfect people had a secret hobby in gaming which they would never admit to having. Soon as the days drag on, their secret is exposed by the other. Will there be blackmail or acceptance? Or will they help one another hide their truest self? ",

They come and go, and I would like some that won\u2019t disappear after a few days. So with that said, here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for:\n\nI have done many genres: romance, crime, war, fiction, slice of life, etc. I will do any genre and role play except for video games or anime, as I am not into those. I would prefer a roleplay that is not centered around smut. I am fine with it, as long as it fits into the story. \n\nRight now I am looking for more of a crime, romance, and/or dark roleplay, as it fits my interests. \n\nI am looking for either male or female partners, but just let it be known; I play female and have never done a lesbian role play. I am up for it though, if we have a good plot. Speaking of plots, I have some ideas but would love to hear your ideas as well. I am okay with using either Reddit PM or kik. I do not have any other platforms but I am willing to get what is needed. If you have read this far and are still interested, shoot me a message. I\u2019ll be waiting! ",

I would love to find a partner that would stick with it for a while.  I usually play women roles,  but I've been known to play male roles,  especially if we are playing more than one character.  I'm a writer,  and i use Rp to help and kick away writers block sometimes,  so it'd be nice if I could find someone who would be active more than once or twice a day.  \n\n\nNow,  onto my interests:\nAs stated,  I'm a writer, so I have many scenarios already planned out in my head.  I have a couple in mind already,  but they both have dark themes to them.  I am always open to any suggestions of course.  I am not into the whole role-playing just for the sake of sex,  so if you are,  please don't send me a message.  However,  sex is a part of human nature and can always make the story have more of a meaning, that being said,  it usually does come in at some point and time.  \n\n\nIf you've made it this far,  and are still interested,  by all means send me a message,  I'd love to hear from you! I prefer to use Kik when I'm role-playing, but I'd be open to other ways if that would be of any interest of yours.  Please send more than \"hello\",  \"hey\"  or \"hi\".  Describe yourself,  tell me some interests, or just something to give me a taste of how you use words.  Looking forward to hearing from you! ",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I'll try to make this as short and sweet as possible, so I'll just start by saying that I'm hoping to create a fantasy world alongside you, and then, of course, roleplay in it. This might sound a bit obvious, but I'd like to reiterate that it should be an original world, I'm quite fine with ideas taken from other settings of course, but it has to feel relatively fresh. One of the things I've also been hoping to try out is a story wherein we play as the villains, or at least, start off that way. Or maybe only one character is a villain, and things work around there at first. I'd rather get into the details of it all on Skype, it's a bit more convenient for quick questions and answers.\n\nMy only requirements are that you take a bit of time to make sure your posts are presentable. I'd like to say I at least know where to put punctuation and capital letters, despite making some mistakes from time to time, and I'd expect that much from any partner. I also don't really mind how you express yourself when we're just chatting, unless it is absolutely horrible to witness.\n\nFeel free to PM me with Skype usernames, questions and anything in between?",

I'm looking to do a RP base on this but in a setting after the hunt is over but within the same city of Yarnham. This RP will be vastly different from any rp on here as I expect our characters to die... a lot throughout their journey. That said, no character will be over power from the start and said power will be increase as we venture further and further into the daydream of the city.\n\nIf you have any question about the world, lore or RP feel free to ask and I will answer the best I can.

We can also talk about where you would rather roleplay if you don't want to roleplay on Reddit. \n\nI would pots my OCS bio here and/or a starter but I'm not sure how I feel about it right now. Though maybe in the future. ",

            "selftext": "**SECURE. CONTAIN. PROTECT.**\n\nFellow writers, authors, science fiction enthusiasts and dedicated fans of the SCP Foundation; we bring to you a Discord-based roleplay community devoted to the SCP Foundation and its contained creatures and artifacts. \n\nAll around the planet, danger lurks. Anomalies of unimaginable power, endangering the very existence of humanity. Decades ago, mankind created an organization to secure these strange beings, so that men would be able to live out their lives completely unaware of the true reality.\n\nThis group is the SCP Foundation. Secure, Contain, Protect. \n\nIn this server, you will be able to play as both members of this organization and the SCPs, dangerous creatures and objects set to destroy, protect or anything in-between. Mainly taking place at Site 19, the largest of the Foundation's security establishments, you have choice of being one of the extremely dangerous and oddly unexplained SCPs or one of the many guards and staff who are employed by the Foundation. You can be part of an MTF taskforce, traveling around the world in search of these abnormalities to contain them at all costs. Or perhaps you would rather be a Class D, trying your hardest to survive the numerous experiments and expeditions that the Foundation puts you through. If you are looking to be the one doing the experimentation, join one of the many scientific groups that study these strange aberrations. You may also play as an SCP, enjoying yourself as you wreak havoc or play around within the numerous foundation sites. Either way, expect to have plenty of fun on this server. \n\nWith that, the staff of the server would like to say that this is a long form roleplay server, preferably with at least a paragraph written as a post. I feel it is safe to speak for both myself and my colleagues that fun and enjoyable experiences are guaranteed in this collaborative project. \n\nWe are not endorsed by or associated with the SCP Wiki.\n\nPlease, join us: https://discord.gg/HkKS9Sj",

            "selftext": "A Song of Sorrows is a freeform roleplay experience driven by its player base, with some nudging by the administrative staff along the way. We focus highly on character development, as well as world building to the extent in which your character can affect the world around them. It is set 200 years after the war between the living and the dead. Westeros is at peace and diplomatic relations are at an all time high, past differences have been set aside and forgotten allowing room for new alliances to grow. This 200 years should provide enough time for a detailed backstory, as well as a large enough disconnect from the canon time period that past grievances shouldn't be in the way of any new friendships. If this interests you, keep on reading and apply, plenty of twists and turns await!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/4Jrh9z",

            "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI\u2019m a straight female who loves a great MxM romance rp. I'm an experienced RPer and I'm open to almost any kind of plot as long as it's a good one! ;).\n\nI write in the 3rd person and hold my own in terms of length I'm typically flexible with my partner and will mirror what I get. Although I am flexible I hope that you can contribute to plot building and offer me more than one-liners as it's exhausting doing all the work myself!\n\n*If you love kpop you will become my new best friend!*\n\nBelow are some plots I'm very interested in playing out: \n*[MC= My Character YC= Your Character C1= Character 1 C2 = Character 2]*\n\n**Open Up {Teacher x Student, Modern Day, Slice of Life, Forbidden Romance}**\n\nMC hates showing up to class and refuses to participate in most classes, he is very close to being kicked out of school but he doesn\u2019t really care. He comes from a family with a very strict Father who likes to take his anger out on his Son when he doesn\u2019t perform. MC doesn\u2019t mind as he thinks its a way of protecting his Mom so he often acts out in order to take the heat. YC is a hard ass teacher who has little patience for students, especially for the ones  that don\u2019t give a shit about their future. YC isn\u2019t the model teacher by far and he is often given duty in detention. He takes special interest in MC because he is one of the only students that won\u2019t give into his aggressive tactics. Eventually YC finds himself lusting after MC and even though MC isn\u2019t for it at first (because he thinks he has no interest in men) he eventually gives in. Things get complicated when YC finds out more about MC\u2019s home life. Will their relationship be nothing more than a release from their current lives?\n\n**We Own the Sky {Sci-Fi, Military, Fantasy, Action/Adventure}**\n\nThis rp would take place in the future, C1 is a pilot and C2 is a navigation specialist. (This could either be for air combat, or something like mecha's). C1 and C2 may be from different planets (but both human-like form) this may still result in different beliefs and values. (One may be more cold hearted etc.) C1 and C2 are then transferred to the main space station for their year long training before being let out into the fleet. Pilot\u2019s and Navigators are paired up together based on testing system in compatibility. C1 and C2 are paired up but they find that they absolutely hate each other but they must learn to work together in order to pass the training and both are extremely competitive.\n\nPM me if you're interested!\n",

I\u2019ve always wanted to RP a Roman/Greek Mythology based RP based on modern day, but not quite Percy Jackson-esque? More like, Zeus is famous for his block parties in the city, Hades runs a underground criminal drug ring, Aphrodite runs a upscale beauty salon, etc. etc.? The idea is that magic still runs in the modern world, but it\u2019s more subtle than most expect it to be?\n\nMaybe modern Hercules does through the Disney version, or the twelve labors of any sort to get out of trouble? Or like a prophecy of some sort causes things to spiral? Or maybe even humans get integrated within the magic city?   \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ll be playing female personification of Cerberus!

            "selftext": "Hello, potential writing partner! I've been roleplaying for well over a decade. My preferred writing style is third person, past tense. I can do longer posts, bordering on novella a few times a week. Or we can do something a bit shorter and back and forth a few times a day. As long as there's detail and something to work with and plot, I'm fine. I would prefer for anyone I write with to be 21+ given that I am as well it just makes things quite a bit easier. \n\nI do follow book canon over show canon, I an up to date with the show and I do not mind taking certain aspects from the show. If you're only a show watcher that is also fine, I can adapt. \n\nI'm willing to write through docs, email or discord, though I prefer discord. \n\nI am wanting a partner that will toss ideas around with me, alternative timelines, develop characters and plots with me.  If I feel that I am the only one putting effort into these things I will lose interest rather quickly. \n\nCharacters I'm interested in writing: Sansa Stark, Robb Stark, Bran Stark, Arya Stark, Oberyn Martell, Theon Greyjoy, Asha Greyjoy. I'm open to writing almost anyone in canon, or even making an original character. \n\nShips I'd be interested in exploring: Gendry X Arya, Sansa X Margaery, Robb X Theon, Robb X  Margaery \n\nI'm not against writing a canon/Oc ship either, as long as the original character is well fleshed out. I also am absolutely in love with various concepts surrounding arranged marriages, so there doesn't have to actually be a lot of chemistry initially, or even any of the pairings I listed above. \n\nIf you're still interested please shoot me a message and we can chat it up. When you do so tell me a bit about yourself, what's your writing style, what aspects of this post are you interested in, etc. Thank you. ",

Now it is fractured, fragments floating on a sea of sky. But our people are strong, and we have conquered the sky to tame the scattered islands. These are the lands of Altera.\n\nAltera is a world made up of shifting fragments of land drifting over an endless void. There are only two known races that inhabit it; Humans and the Qiokri. The only human kingdom is the Isle of Mistral. Up until about a decade before the present day, travel between islands was impossible for humans and difficult for Qiokri. Then, the first airship was built and the age of exploration exploded to the forefront of civilization. Now, the restless city rushes to colonize new land.\n\nWe welcome roleplayers of all kinds.

At least in the breathing, talking, non-flesh craving, kind of living. There are a numerous groups spread across the US, who are banding together to try and rebuild what was left of civilization. But not everyone plays by the rules that were once a part of everyday life, all of those laws were left in the old world. This is the new world. Where survival of the fittest is most every leaders motto. As a male in the post apocalyptic world, you will be put to the test to prove that you are strong enough, fast enough, loyal enough, and that you have enough of those killer instincts in your veins to make you a use to the leaders of these groups. As a female you will have to either prove your worth to be matched up against the males and take your spot as someone who is productive, or you will simply be kept to do the only thing males can't do alone, repopulate the earth. The world was a terrifying place before the demise of a working society, now, the savagery that goes on outside and inside the safe gates of your compound, makes the world a living nightmare. \n\n *Will contain blood, gore, violence, strong language, and mature content,*\n\n\n\nNow,  if you have made it this far,  I'm needing to find a few people who would be willing to start a group rp (preferably on Kik or discord). \u00a0I have one male character that needs to be filled, the rest need can bring their own.  Need to be at the very least semi-literate, and detailed.  Anh and everyone is welcome,  if you're interested in more details,  message me.  \n",

            "selftext": "\"So ends, The bloody business of the day\" - Homer, Poet\n\nI\u2019m looking for a long-term writing partner. I\u2019m 28, with at least 14 years of role-play experience. I mean that in no way to say I am any good, but just that I\u2019ve been around the block a few times. I am male, happily married with an exhausting full time job. I swear, probably far too much and I\u2019ll try to keep this ad as clean as possible. I\u2019m going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible. \u00a0\n\nI don't really have any limits or triggers. Of course, people discover things every day that bother them so if this ever changes or anything ever bugs me, I will be sure to let you know. Please do the same with me and I will be respectful of any of your limits. I DO NOT Write smut, I am very happily married. Though I realize it does happen in story lines and is often essential to moving the story along. We will fade to black. So for that reason, Please be 18+. I am most experienced with M/F. \u00a0\n\nAs for length of posts. This is going to vary. Sometimes a post only warrants two paragraphs to get things rolling. It happens. I work a very mentally exhausting job. Some days I can bang out extremely long posts. Some days I can\u2019t and they may be garbage. But this is supposed to be a relaxing hobby for me, not stressful. So if you aren\u2019t okay with that, you probably shouldn\u2019t message me. All I ask is that when we connect, you understand my schedule and I will understand yours. I require no time table for a post other then a few hours after mine. Please don't ghost me, and please don't leave me hanging for 2 weeks then post. It breaks the emersion of it all.\n\nI am looking for someone to write about the events following D-Day. I, playing an American soldier. And you, a female soldier. Be she, British, Canadian, French. It doesn't matter to me honestly. This would be something that has a slow romance building to it as both go through the tragedy that was WWII.\n\nAs far as medium's, and contact information goes: PM's, Kik, Discord, email and Facebook are all things I've used, things I'm used to. I will not, under any circumstances use GoogleDOCS has not, and will not work for me. Email I'm on the fence about to, so that will definitely take some convincing.\n\n",

While I do understand making mistakes from time to time, I prefer it if you used capitalization and punctuation (I'm not too worried about that part, as long as there are no run-on sentences). \nI'd like a creative partner that wouldn't mind coming up with ideas with me. \n\nSo, in the story, I would be a detective on the brink of getting fired, due to having no work to do. That's where you come in. One morning, I saw you on the news. They happened to be reporting your execution, announcing that it would happen the next day at midnight. I decide to break you out and let it be known that you've escaped so that I can capture you and have my job back. You'd have a few more days to live, and I'd have more respect, right? Wrong. It seems as if you have unfinished business that needs to be taken care of.\n\nEventually, after tracking you down, we start to form a sort of bond, and it blossoms into something more. \n\nA bit about myself: I'm 19, from then United States. I use kik, discord, or skype. I can also use the reddit app if that's what you prefer. \n\nI hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "\\[Story/Description\\] Hellbound is post\\-apocalyptic, fantasy/horror genre RP taking place in a alternate timeline from 1900 to 1906 and continuing. We are currently small and looking for new members \\(Even Hosts/GMs\\) to help bring this world to life, yet what is this world you may ask? To paraphrase roughly:\n\n\u2022 Whats the world like? The world has been consumed by demons since the dreaded \"Day of Darkness\"\\(1900\\), forcing survivors to band together into great city\\-states under the protection of \"The Church\". Most of the world is gone now, its lands, populations, all taken by hordes of demons and plagued \\(Who are infected humans\\). Despite this, the last of humanity has banded together to fight against this menace in hoping to regain it from the demonic hordes. \\(It should be noted the world has been boosted in technological discoveries and advancements to up to late WWI, just so everyone can enjoy a little more stuff in the past.\\)\n\n\u2022 How do the people fight back? Well, they use blessed weaponry and materials from provided by \"The Church\", even some people such as priests being allowed to perform \"Blessing Magic\" to combat these foes. However the true trump card against these enemies are the individuals known as \"Devils Advocates\", humans who have a demon bonded to their body in order to use their powers against them. However there are many roles to choose from, from a simple townsfolk to a full fledged demon hunter. However, if you're feeling a little more \"devilish\", you can even be a demon yourself and fight against humanity or your fellow demons for power.\n\n\u2022 Where can you go? You are able to travel the globe to different locations, so long as you have the papers and permission to, meaning you don't have to stay cramped in one place. Hell, you can even be a demon and explore freely without permission too if you wanted. We have areas currently from the United States to Europe, Russia, or more \\(Currently working out\\).\n\n\u2022 What can you do? Not everyone has to be a demon hunting badass, or a cunning demon on a murdering spree. You can be a merchant should you like a more slower pace, or a simple townsfolk doing some casual city RP. Perhaps even a priest, staying in the cities to spread faith to the people. Even be a gunsmith or researcher trying to find new equipment to help those out on the field, or a priest researcher finding new spells.\n\n\\[Basic Info\\] As said before, we are currently small with a few active RPers, and only 2 hosts \\(Which is including me\\). However I will go ahead and note some basic things below about the server and how we RP:\n\n\u2022 We use a dice roll mechanic for combat to avoid any godmodding, but don't worry, it's not all luck of the dice. We also use stats to help boost rolls, that way you won't always get bad rolling streaks.\n\n\u2022 This server may be a bit more mature as 18\\+ elements such as violence, drugs/drinking, curse words, and sexual content are included in the RP.\n\n\u2022 We are always looking for ways to improve the RP, both lore wise or system wise. Suggestions are and advice are welcomed greatly should you have any \\(As well historical/religious knowledge pertaining up to 1900\\).\n\n\u2022 Google Docs is used to create your OC, from name, backstory, to equipment and perks, all which can be assisted upon when joining. You can have 3 characters as well, giving you a more broad field of RPing.\n\n\u2022 While we primarily do 3rd person, you may do 1st person as well. Replies do not need to be lengthy and descriptive either, that can be short and simple too.\n\n\\[Conclusion\\] Should you still be interested enough to be reading this, we hope you stop by and join us. There will be a lot more information on the server when joining, so fret not if somethings didn't come up you wanted to read. Until then, thank you for taking the time to read this, \"And may God bless you\".\n\n\\[Link\\] \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\&gt; [https://discord.gg/4nR2KD8](https://discord.gg/4nR2KD8)",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am an experienced, mature writer and RPer looking for a partner for a long term RP partnership. My post length varies depending on what is going on and what is given to me, but I tend to prefer multiple paragraphs in length. I usually only play female characters, and would prefer not to have to play a group of them (I find it over whelming and exhausting). This isn\u2019t to say that I won\u2019t handle any NPCs, but I want to handle them only as necessary for the story and focus on the main characters, as it were. I might be willing to make the occasional exception to that for the right story and partner, but it\u2019s not my strong suit so please be advised of that.\n\nIn general, I prefer to have a story in mind, I hate the \u201ccreate a couple characters and jump in without any plotting\u201d approach. I can write multiple times a day during the day, but I rarely have time to write much in the evening as I have other commitments. In general though, unless I\u2019m not feeling well you can usually depend on me to write 1-2 times a day, more if I get rapid replies. No, my post length does not change much depending on how often we\u2019re going back and forth. I use Gmail and would prefer that my partner use Hangouts so we can IM regularly and keep in touch real time, while the RPs happen via email.\n\nI\u2019m interested in a handful of fandom RPs, but I also adore world building and would be happy to work with a partner to build a world we can both be interested in creating and playing in. More information to follow. I would also like to point out that I do not mind having more than one story going with someone\u2026 muses can be fickle things, and if I find a writer I can really click with, I love knowing I can go to them and say \u201chey, I had this idea\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m really feeling X\u201d rather than feeling like I can never have an off day or a new idea I want to explore.\n\nIn regards to content, my RPs run the gamut. I\u2019m perfectly at ease with NSFW subjects and outside of furry, bodily fluids, bimboification, and a few other extremes I\u2019m pretty open to including things in a story as long as it\u2019s about 70-80% story and the sexual stuff is worked in when it makes sense for the story.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that I do not play canon characters in fandom RPs. I\u2019ve love if you did, but I am terrible at it and don\u2019t feel comfortable trying.\n\nOn to the fun stuff, shall we?\n\nGenres: Historical Fantasy, High Fantasy, Low Fantasy, Modern/Urban Fantasy, Horror Fantasy, Mythic Fantasy, Modern Mythic, Modern/Slice of Life, Crime, Romance, Urban Horror, Southern Gothic, Superheroes and more! Only thing I\u2019m a hard no on is sci-fi.\n\nFandoms: Marvel MCU, Lord of the Rings, Arthurian Legends (which movies and books can be discussed), Potterverse. There are probably other things but I can\u2019t remember what they are right now.",

            "selftext": "Hi there~! The name is Sam, and I'm looking for a literate partner to write some stuff with! I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nSo, what am I looking for? I'm looking for anything that's related to Spy stuff or Crime! Think; Kingsman, John Wick, Payday, Mission Impossible, etc. I want something with suits, weapons and secrecy. Or I could even be talked into something Military-like; A soldier thrusted into a high-ranking position, or maybe even during later times (circa 1800-1900s). I could even do something with Superheroes, but less about the powers and more about the responsibility!\n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well, and will probably want to avoid smut all-together. (Unless you have good ideas for it, of course.) I would love the stories we write to be less about the action and the like, and more about personalities and such!\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

As the title says I'm male, but open to roleplaying with any gender.\n\n\n\n\nI'm old enough to do smut, but it's not really my thing. I won't complain if I'm asked, but it's not something I initiate either.\n\n\n\n\nI'm open to all pairing types.\n\n\n\n\nI try to not be too fussy on length, but in general I like at least two paragraphs. That said I'm not a novel writer, so while I can go up to around 500 words, I often don't do more, unless it's a scene I just have a lot to say for.\n\n\n\n\nI'm someone who likes to double. I could be talked out of it.\n\n\n\n\nI have a dual issue where I don't like people feeling uncomfortable, but at the same time I sometimes find things to be silly. If my OC has a mental illness and you want me to take it out, that's fine. However, if my OC just looks a certain way you don't agree with, that's annoying to me.  It's especially annoying if we're doubling, I'm not telling you how your side has to go, please don't tell me how mine has to be.\n\n\n\n\nTalk to me I'm someone who loves talking to my partners. The RP should be for fun, not some chore.\n\n\n\n\nI'm into;\n\n\n\n\nDC the whole thing, but I guess I like Batman the most.\n\n\n\n\nMarvel I know the \"big stuff\" the movies, and as for comics I'm aware of like Spider-Man, X-Men, Avengers that kind of stuff.\n\n\n\n\nI've never played Danganronpa, but a Youtuber I watch streamed it, and I actually look up spoilers so I likely could give it a shot.\n\n\n\n\nI recently started playing Far Cry 5...it's the only Far Cry game I've played.\n\n\n\n\nI've played Diablo 3 a lot, and I know the Diablo series in general.\n\n\n\n\nI'll take a look at any original idea. Fantasy, Science-Fiction, Action, Slice-of-Life etc\n\n\n\n\nI'm a long time, fan of Pokemon\n\n\n\n\nI used to watch Digimon, up to the Tamers series.\n\n\n\n\nI've seen Dragonball, Dragonball Z, Dragonball GT, Dragonball Super, and I've played both Xenoverse games.\n\n\n\n\nInuyasha\n\n\n\n\nI've played the original Mass Effect trilogy, and Andromeda\n\n\n\n\nI never finished but I started plays on Dragon Age Inquisition, and Origins. I also watched someone else do a let's play of Inquisition. I also once did a crossover of Mass Effect, and Dragon Age as an RP.\n\n\n\n\nI am open to AU's (Alternate Universes) of any series, I know.\n\n\n\n\n\nCowboy Bebop\n\n\n\n\nI feel like I could do Disney characters, but would prefer an AU setting.\n\n\n\n\nI know Naruto pretty well, but it tends to be one of those things I get bored of roleplaying.\n\n\n\n\nBoku no Hero Academia is a series I'm into.\n\n\n\n\nI've either played, or seen a let's play of just about every horror game there is. Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Dead Space, Five Night's at Freddy's to name a few popular ones. I know a lot of lesser known ones as well.

            "selftext": "Welcome to the year 2024. We don't have flying cars yet, and we haven't found a cure for cancer. But you know what we do have? Catgirls!\n\nBy genetic discoveries of scientists, it has been found that cats and women have very similar DNA structures. Genetically modifying them produces a cat/human hybrid. It's very common for girls to be produced from this complicated process, but it is possible to produce a male (though very rare). \n\nThe market for catgirls exploded seemingly overnight. However as expected, the price for such a companion is quite high. They aren't commonly found unless you're fairly well off.\n\nIf you do happen to own one of these adorable little friends, there are some things you must take into consideration to ensure your catgirl lives a long, happy, and healthy life. Here's a standard issue required handbook for any owner looking to purchase a catgirl: https://catgirlcare.org/\n\n~\n\nYou're a busy executive for the world's leading computer hardware developer. You live in a high-rise penthouse, and are constantly swamped with work. You don't have much of a social life anymore, and frankly you feel alone and depressed. That is, until you find a [stray catgirl](https://i.imgur.com/ME9t6R2.jpg) in an alley. You decide to take the catgirl in, allowing her to become your companion, friend, and maybe something more. \n\n*Notes: I think it'd be cute to include a romance aspect in here, but that's entirely optional. Your catgirl could just be your cute little friend. :)*\n\n~ \n\nHello everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read this. This is quite closely based on the website that I linked above. I thought it was so cute, and the idea of being a catgirl really excited me. I'd really appreciate it if you skimmed through the website. However, you don't have to. It's basically how I want my character to act, sort of on the cat side of the human - cat ratio if that makes sense. \n\nI\u2019d like to keep this strictly on Discord. My Discord is magnacarta#5737.\n\nSo yeah! Feel free to send any questions my way. Don't worry, I don't bite. I'm looking forward to hearing from all of you!\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Welcome to anyone interested! As the title suggests, the roleplay advertised is set in the 4th Era of elder scrolls, around the time of Skyrim's occurance in late 4e202.\n\nThe Group is an established roleplay that has existed and expanded for over 3 years, bringing together a combination of the Elder Scrolls' rich lore and history, as well as the in-game occurances being altered or completed in the room's history to make for a well-populated world of player characters, all able to intertwine in their own plotlines across the continent of Tamriel. \n\nThe roleplay is written in 3rd person, past-tense format. All that is required of members is a knowledge of Elder Scrolls (Skyrim at the very least, preferably), and a good ability to write and tell stories together! \nThank you for reading! The link below is for anybody interested in joining! The group covers most timezones, with the majority of activity being in the afternoon/night time of GMT. \n\nWe look forward to new members!\n\n         - Oz\n\nhttps://discord.gg/xgpqFjk",

As you can see, I'm specifically looking for RP in the world of Harry Potter.\n\nAge: I'm 23, so it is a must that you are 18+, and preferably 20+\n\nTimezone: I'm in EST, but I'm up at all kinds of crazy hours, so don't worry about me not replying because of time zones. Note: I do still sleep. Sometimes.\n\nHow often I reply: I literally have nothing to do all day, so I'll reply as often as you do.\n\nPreferred contact: I'm good with email or Discord, though Discord's been a bit hit-or-miss lately. \n\nLength: I match my partner. I prefer 1-3 paragraph posts, but can go up to about 5 paragraphs. Length isn't super important to me, I prefer quality over quantity.\n\nWriting Style:  3rd person, past tense paragraph or multi-paragraph. At least semi-lit please.\n  \nCravings: I'll list these by era to make things easier. *Italics* is who I'd like to play, * denotes how much I want that pairing. \n\n**Harry Potter**\n**Marauders Era (1971-1981)**\n\n* James/Lily\n* *Sirius*/Remus (never done this one, but been wanting to give it a go)*\n* *Sirius*/OC\n* *Remus*/OC\n\n**Trio Era Post-Hogwarts (1998~2003)**\n\n* Draco/Hermione (I've written them both, so no preference to who I write)\n* *Hermione*/Harry\n* *Draco*/Astoria\n* *Draco*\n* *Theo Nott*/OC or Canon\n\n**Next Gen (2017~2024)**\n\n* *Scorpius*/Lily Luna (I'll play Lily, too, just prefer Scorp)\n* *Teddy*/Victoire\n* Will also play either of these boys against an OC.\n\n\nI think I've rambled on enough. If you're interested, shoot me an PM with what pairing you'd like to do, your age, etc. Hope to hear from you!\n ",

Four other Xenos then combine right before your eyes, and the newly formed monstrosity gazes upon your line, causing your blood to run cold. However, the Emperor smiled upon you, for in that moment an imperial knight, one the engines of his great will slammed into the creature dragging them away from you and your battle brothers. Only now do you notice that these are not the only giants on the battlefield. A massive xenos goliath had engaged an imperator class titan. The two goliaths traded cannon and missile fire, however you see that with it's fire drawn away the enemy air support had managed to slip through. You watch in horror as a bomber destroys a line of dunewalkers before being taken down by a war glaive. Only now does it fully impact you that your assault on the enemy is waning. You're brought back to reality by the sound of laser passing through Pvt. Mason killing him instantly. You take your lasgun and unleash another volley of las fire when you hear Pvt. Stevens yell out to the commissar \"Sir the Skitarii are regrouping!\" you look and see the red clad rangers moving back in attempt to reform a line. \"What do we do sir?\" the Private asks. Part of you swears the Commissar was going to put a bolt in the young man, but instead he looks out over the battlefield with a grim expression. \"Men!\" he calls out \"Affix bayonets!\" you pull out your bayonet, attach it your lasgun barrel, and level it towards the enemy. You are unsure of whether your charge will even be effective, but hey you've heard crazier things. \"Gaurdsmen!\" the commissar shouts as you give a prayer to the Emperor. The commissar pauses for but a moment \"CHAAAARGE!\"\n\n[Thank you to Mastermartin895 for writing.]\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nNow that we have our short story out of the way. Give me a moment of your time to explain what this server is and what it isn't.\n\nThis server is for you to have an open and fun roleplay experience while interacting with a nice and active community. This server has an overarching plot that you have the choice of planting yourself in, or you can avoid it in general and make your own stories with our members along the way.\n\nThis server isn't for you to bring in the most powerful character you can think of, we have measures to keep that in check. This also isn't a place for people who don't take RP seriously and just meme the whole time, or for people who are looking to ERP all the time.\n\nIf any of that sounds interesting to you, you can join here.

            "selftext": "Hello there! I am seeking people to play in my virtual world, I am a long term role player who likes to create stories and in this particular instance I am looking to GM a story that you will be a central part of, so what does this mean?\n\n**GM?**\n\nThe basic idea is, I will construct a story, a series of characters and this universe (Which I am fully happy to co-create the rules of) your character will exist and adventure in this universe, encountering many characters I will play, think of an ensemble cast and crew.\n\n**So what sort of Universe?**\n\nGreat question, I am open to this, I have some ideas but I am fully up to discussing anything and everything regarding the tone, one thing I am currently very interested in is the idea of doing \u201cEpisodes\u201d, there maybe an overarching story but what I would prefer is to have isolated stories in the Universe and perhaps a meta narrative on top, this way we can explore many themes and interests, an example is if you wanted to be a law enforcer each episode could be a case, if you wanted to be part of a space crew each episode could be a new mission, this sort of thing.\n\n**How much do you like to write?**\n\nSo this would be a different case to normal rps, I would be writing significantly more than you because I would be controlling the story you are taking a part in, giving you decisions to make, responding to those decisions, one of the great thrills of RP for me is throwing things in my partners direction and seeing how they respond. I am fully capable of writing 8 word pages in a post and I would fully accept a paragraph reply if it fit. I am perhaps the most relaxed rp partner you could have, if you cant post or dont post I am not going to stress or ask for one, all in good time, this is meant to be fun.\n\n**How much choice would I have?**\n\nI like to think im a pretty good partner, especially when it comes to out of RP discussions, the aim of this particular kind of RP is to give you as much choice as possible while also allowing me to flex my creative muscles in providing a coherent story, I like to say that I never write the ending in advance, I write the things I want to challenge you with and through those challenges we discover who your character is and who the characters I create end up being, its a very collaborative process.\n\n**Sound great, any requirements?**\n\nThat I do, \n\nOver 18\n\nAvailable regularly\n\nUsing Discord\n\nThoroughly decent human being\n\nRelaxed and open to discussing what is and isnt working\n\n\n\n**Do you do romance? Violence? How hardcore can you get?**\n\nIve never made an RP post expecting romance, if it happens it happens\nI have very few limits in regards to violence/graphic behaviour, but it has to make sense, I am a story writer, I love stories\n\n\n**Where do I sign up?**\n\nMessage me on here, ill get back to you ASAP.\n\nI am Male/31 From the UK",

            "selftext": "**Magic in General:**\n\nMagic is typically harnessed via staffs (not wands), although some can be done without one. Most magic is produced by spells, some elaborate, others one or two words, in a special language. Illusions and telepathy require special mental \"stages\", simple enough to access, but no spoken word. There are also runes, similar in use to spells, and potions, which don't take much magic to use as other methods. All magic requires some degree of concentration, energy, and magical reserves. If one uses up his/her magic reserves, they will pass into a state of unconsciousness for a time, and be unable to access magic of any form for around a day.\n\n**The Academy Itself:**\n\nCreated by the Council of Mages in the First Age, this academy has stood for many generations of skilled magicians. It became mandatory for all with the gift to be instructed in the use of magic, or have the Gift burned out. The Academy teaches spells, control, meditation, telepathy and shielding, the art of illusions, and anything else to do with magic. The Dark Arts are strictly forbidden to all students and teachers.\n\nBasic Rules/Requirements:\n\n1. Please try to be active. I'm hoping for at least a post a day, but I understand if you're busy.\n\n2. Semi-literate. As in, I would like to see a few sentences per post. I don't mind the occasional one-liner, but try not to make it a habit. I don't need multiple paragraphs either, but I certainly won't turn you away for adding extra detail.\n\n3. Keep it roughly PG-13. No graphic sex. Violence and swearing are fine. Gore and dark themes are okay, within reason.\n\nAt the moment, we are currently in need of professors and female students, but anyone is welcome to join! The rp has been running for a few weeks, but I'll be happy to catch anyone up with recent events. \n\nInvite Link: https://discord.gg/7uaprrg\n\n",

            "selftext": "I'm still partway through playing Far Cry 5 and I've gotten an itch to throw some characters around the world. I usually don't like playing with or against OCs, but I'm willing to make some exceptions for what my partner wants to play, and I would be more than willing to play the Junior Deputy character, since they are kind of a cannon/OC hybrid to begin with. Below is a little about me, who I am, what I do. Everything is flexible, everything can be changed, this is all just to inspire you.\n\n\n\n**Guidelines**\n\n**Doubling:** Doubling is great in the right context, but I will only do it when all the characters are necessary. If the plot does not call for more than two mains, then it shouldn't have more than two mains. Equally, if a plot calls for a wider main cast then I'll probably push for it. Context is key.\n\n\n**Ages:** I require that my partners be over the age of 18, partially because I am uncomfortable writing about some themes with anyone younger than that. As for characters, my mains are usually between 27-45 years old, an average being about 30. I hope you've got a similar range.\n\n\n**Medium:** Email is my preferred method of sharing replies That being said, I use Hangouts frequently and Discord for the sake of plotting. I could be convinced to use either for the plot itself. I strongly encourage you to contact me via Hangouts if you want to plot over messenger.\n\n\n**Limits:** I am open to mature subject matter with my partners.\n\n\n**Length:** In the quantity versus quality debate I'm a quality gal all the way. I'd rather have a pretty, succinct post than a droning twelve paragraph monster where it doesn't belong. Everything in its place, of corse; setting scenes should take time, just as conversations between characters may be quite short. My replies have a broad range, but you can expect nothing less than two paragraphs, unless, of corse, context demands otherwise. Intros can be anything beyond six paragraphs.\n\n\n**Pairings:** Primarily I do M/F, come to me with a fun plot and a good character to play against and I'll do F// and M// too.",

We also try and reply via paragraph form, but that does not mean we necessarily reply with short stories every single entry. Just try to keep it decent!\nThat's all you need to know as of right now.

Now let me go into some detail about the setting and my character.\n\nSetting: This takes place several years after Midoriya and friends graduate from U.A And become Pro Heroes. Midoriya is Number 1, Todoroki is Number 2, and Bakugo is number 3. Now a new generation of heroes takes center stage as they go to U.A Academy to try and become pro heroes of their own!\n\nMy Character: He is about 14 years old and managed to pass the test and got into U.A. His Quirk is Muscle Bound. His quirk allows him to augment the muscle fibers that are beneath the skin, increasing the power and speed of his movements. He has also been shown to use his quirk for defense; by covering his whole body in augmented muscle fiber. (Yes I know its Muscular's quirk but I really love it and so I say fuck it!) Of course, this quirk has a few weaknesses but I won't go into those now. He grew up in America with his mother being Japanese and his father being American. After passing through elementary school and middle school he took the test and practical and got into U.A, Being placed into class 1-B!\n\nNow that's all I got so far! I hope yall enjoyed that little opening! Now if you want to contact me please message me on Reddit or make a Reddit chat where we can talk and exchange discord information. Anywho! Tata!",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s been a while since I made a post like this, but here we go again.\n\n**About me:** \nI\u2019m 25 years old and have about 14-15 years of experience in writing of the roleplaying kind. English is not my native language, but I have learned from a young age and typically do quite well with it. I would consider myself to be literate/advanced in my writing. Most of my writing experience has been in English, about 10 years of the aforementioned 14-15. \n\n**Genres:** Fantasy, Modern, Historical (although not all too strict on the details) and the occasional Slice of Life. I like to include romance in my plots as I like what it adds to the story, for better or worse, but it is rarely of the easygoing variety when I\u2019m involved. In general, my plots tend towards a darker nature. \n\n**Limits/Rating:** I would probably end up in mature ratings most of the time, since I like to include themes that are not so PG-13. This is why I will only write with other adults. 18+ minimum, preferably around my own age or older. Language, violence, substance use, sex. I\u2019ll do it all, but within reason. I will never engage in mature themes just for the sake of it but will happily get into it if it furthers the plot one way or another. The most important thing to me when it comes to this stuff is good communication.\n\n**Post frequency:** I can occasionally be quite an active poster, but think of me as a weekly poster more than a daily poster. I try my best to get replies out within a reasonable time, but my life has a tendency to get busy every once in a while. When I'm swamped IRL, I\u2019m also more likely to experience writer\u2019s block. And we all know what that is like. I make it a point to keep open communication with my partners and would never simply leave you hanging or disappear. I expect the same courtesy in return.\n\n**More writing stuff:** *3rd person, past tense.* No exceptions. My post length will typically be in the 500-700 word range, and I am mostly looking for writers who do something similar. Longer can easily be okay (I do post-match to some degree), and shorter posts can happen for the sake of conversation/action and quick-fire posting. I usually prefer to write female characters if I am only allowed one main character, but I like doubling and adding NPCs into the mix.\n*I only RP through email*, but I could potentially be convinced to use something else. IM-type services and forums are out of the question though.\n   \nI have a few plots lying around in my brain that I wouldn\u2019t mind getting around to writing. They range from fantasy, to modern, to slice of life. I\u2019ll happily share them as we start talking. I generally like keeping in touch through Discord for OOC chatter, plotting etc.. If you do too, that would be amazing!\n\nIf any of this sounds interesting, don\u2019t hesitate to throw me a PM or add me on Discord (Gandhie#9028) and we\u2019ll talk. I hope to discuss things properly and hopefully exchange some samples and such before we get going on anything. I find that a proper start reduces the risk of things not working out down the line. \n\nIf, for some unknowable reason, you\u2019d like to read more, you can find more detailed info about me and my writing here: [https://ailitherp.weebly.com/](https://ailitherp.weebly.com/)\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the lengthy post, thank you for your time!",

            "selftext": "Hi there. \n\nI'm looking for a couple of additional partners to write with on Discord. I can be pretty flexible in terms of genre, but I am looking for writers who are more experienced and are willing to be involved with plotting, brainstorming, throwing out ideas, and are honest about what they like, don't like, and where they would like the story to go. \n\nHere are just some quick nuggets of what I'm looking for:\n\n* Aforementioned enthusiasm for creating a story together.\n* 3rd person, past tense writing.\n* A decent amount of experience writing under your belt. I'm not a super stickler, but I'd want someone at least at my level.\n* A variety of post lengths, but with enough meat to it to drive things forward. Post lengths can obviously vary between starters, action, dialogue heavy scenes, etc. \n* Preferably someone in my time zone (PST).\n* Someone who can be pretty responsive.\n* I have a soft spot for modern/fantasy/supernatural/dark themes, but am open to others. High/medieval fantasy is not my forte however and I do not have much interest in slice-of-life type stuff. \n* 21+ partner please. I do not feel comfortable introducing adult themes with someone who is younger than that, sorry (I am myself in my late 20s).\n* The ability to communicate with me if things aren't going as expected, if you are no longer feeling the story, or if you just don't want to continue. \n\nPlease give me a PM if you are interested, along with a writing sample if you have one! I would really appreciate it. ",

My goal is to find 4\\-7 similar entities for creative\\-filled, interpersonal driven and possibly chaotic roleplaying. Instead of a set plot to have and to hold, in *this* RP, my aim is to change the plots/characters/settings and reformat the server every set amount of IRL time \\(to be decided upon by all of us, should things become stale\\). Everyone will have a say in plot, specifics and ideas! This has a high rate of failure! Unless I introduce my other big goal! F R I E N D S H I P! Maybe it's short term friendship? Who cares, we're doing burner RPs anyway! I'd love to get 4\\-7 completely different types of people and creative styles! Common interest is for the birds! All I long for is a shared interest in creating something unique, whatever that may mean to you! Follow the golden rule \"be excellent to each other\" and don't be worried about expressing yourself! I love all that wholesome crap. \n\n**Looking for:** All 18\\+ ages, genders, sexyness, backgrounds and even time zones! I'm personally in EST and have a pretty predictable schedule. Everything works out easier when everyone is around the same timelines, so try to keep that in mind! I demand 3rd person, past tense, and I have a flexible rule of only allowing people that can consistently write 3 paragraphs at a time. I'm going to ask for a writing sample however, and anyone who is on the cusp of that rule is still welcome to apply. Quality will always outweigh Quantity! \n\nFor he short writing sample I'm asking for, please write me a small essay about something cute you've seen an animal do, from the perspective of the animal OR write me a small thing about how an OC would react to being thrown from a large building by a man with no face! OR WHATEVER, just show me your bitch\\-ass knows how to 'words.' \n\nFor the starting RP I figure i'd make something super simple, that could give all of the people who might be interested a chance to feel out each others creative styles and personalities! So, feel free to message me about how you have these and they're stupid, because they are! All of this is super open to a shared world building, and is more of a suggestion! Everything is open for change/discussion once we get together! \n\nBad Idea 1: This is one i've always dreamed of doing. IRL, you bitches tell me about what your pets are like. Their habits and personalities. And i'll tell you about mine, right? And then, we make OCs based off of each others damn pets. It's so bad, i'm so sorry \\(please pick this one\\) \n\nMore Cringy Idea 1: Hyper\\-cliche anime fighting RP! Some fucking 18 year olds get powers or some shit. We all get mega OP. And then the monsters attack....\n\nFull of potential comedy idea: HAUNTED APARTMENTS. Some of us are ghosts with objectives, others are just not rich enough to buy their own house yet \\(In THIS economy???\\) \n\nMessage me your sample through here, as well as your discord information!

            "selftext": "Good evening, as the title already implies, I try to find people willed to play FFXV characters withme. I'm a literate female RPer who would love to play out a little spin-off, extra-sequence or even just putting them into another setting to allow for some romance the game has lacked and more goofiness and friendship time between them. I don't need you to constantly write because we all have busy lives and lack of motivation sometimes, but if you do, please make sure you're using correct grammar and orthography aka spelling. To be fair, I would like to add as well, that I have not personally played the game, but I did watch a lot of lets plays and read through many wiki pages and I'm certain I can provide a believable Luna!\n\nSo...I used to just search for romance, but now I think that having the entire squad would be more fun and engaging.\n\nDrop in an orange envelope, if you're interested and tell me what role you want to play!\n\nNow, as for a first post to give you a sample of my writing:\n\nSighing quietly as I flipped the notebook open, my fingers were already gently stroking, almost caressing the smooth reddish leather back of the hardcover. I smiled to myself as I allowed me to indulge in old memories before I closed the book again, holding it to my heart like the precious thing it was. My eyes closed, I felt your presence drawing closer soon. Ever since the day I sacrificed my life for you I had waited. And even though I was happy to know that we would be united again, the thought you would have to part with others as the tribute to this meeting made my heart ache. \"Welcome\", I whispered quietly, turning around to you with a soft smile as you entered the room that looked so much like your own chambers in Insomnia - back then when the Crown City still was safe. But we were at another place now, a replica - however, at least, it would be safer than any other place we had been at together. This time, we would not be ripped apart again. I could not force myself to tell you where we were yet, though, so I just came closer, the same serene smile plastered across my face - the strong, faithful one I kept for occasions like this: when I had to hide the downsides. My right hand soon approached yours, the other keeping our shared memories in place. \"I missed you, Noctis.\"\n\nI also rp in third-person, so that shan't be a problem.",

            "selftext": "Helloooo. My name is Danielle and i'm a British 18 year old. I have been roleplaying for around 5 years now, and i'm craving a slice of life/realistic roleplay where I play a female character and you play a male character. I would like a lot of drama, angst, pain but also a lot of romance.\nHere's somethings about how i roleplay;\n\n- I like detailed roleplays. Usually I do about 3 paragraphs a post, but it depends on the situation and where we are in the rp. If we are at a scene where there is significantly less action then it\u2019s acceptable to just post 1 paragraph or a couple of sentences.\n\n- I roleplay in 3rd, but can do 1st if you prefer.\n\n- I like NSFW scenes. This includes gore, violence and blood. When it comes to sexual scenes I am totally up for doing them if you are 18+. But I would only want these sexual scenes when it is appropriate. We can discuss this more.\n\n- Please don\u2019t rush my reply, I\u2019m sure we are both busy at times, and I will respect when you don\u2019t reply. But I would like us to have a post out atleast within 2 days of the last reply. Don\u2019t leave it too long. If you reply almost instantly then that's great!\n\nUnfortunately I haven't come up with an idea yet...but I am in the process of researching through ( http://plotsforall.tumblr.com/tagged/romantic%20plot ) this post. If you have any ideas that you would like to bring up to me in dms pleaaase do so!\nCan't wait to hear from some of you!\n",

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow writers!  \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my roleplay post.  Let me start off by introducing myself \u2014 I\u2019m a man in his 20s who (like many of you) is seeking to find a roleplay partner.  I've been somewhat busy due to a combination of work and grad school, but as of late, it has been truly refreshing to connect with so many other like-minded people in this community of writers.  Given that I\u2019m expecting to have a bit more time on my hands in the upcoming weeks, I figured I\u2019d reach out again, and hopefully find a few more mature, talented writers.\n\n**Preferred Genres:**\n\nMy writing tends to span a wide variety of genres\u2014including science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic modern fiction.  My writing has spanned both a personal as well professional nature, and as a result, I\u2019m always up for experimenting with new genres and writing styles.  Recently, I\u2019ve been dabbling a bit more in fantasy themes; however, I\u2019m still a novice when it comes to taking on high-fantasy themes.\n\n**Writing Style:**\n\nI will humbly admit that I tend to be a voracious writer, and as a result, my posts frequently range in the 3-4+ paragraph range.  Granted, there are certain occasions when a shorter length is more desirable (especially in conversational, or dialogue-intensive scenes)\u2014and this is certainly something I implement when necessary.  I\u2019m a strong believer in quality over quantity, and I\u2019m hoping to find a fellow writer who has an appreciation for packing a large quantity of details in a condensed post (within reason).\n\n**Collaboration:**\n\nFor me, the pre-writing, collaborative stage is as enjoyable as the writing process itself.  I know that some writers prefer to jump head-first into writing the story itself\u2014with minimal discussion.  Based on experience, this approach is due to the fact that some writers fear that too much discussion may \u201creveal\u201d too much of the plot prior to writing.  While this is certainly a valid point, it is important for me to mention that my discussions do not pertain to plot;  rather, they pertain to exploring the characters\u2019 backstories, emotional orientations, cultural groundings, and other such factors.  It\u2019s more with regard to developing a creative discourse with my writing partner to truly immerse\u2014and \u201clive\u201d\u2014the experiences of our characters.  To me, it is this level of exploration and collaboration that truly make roleplaying a much more engaging process as compared to solo writing.\n\n**Writing Platforms:**\n\nI prefer to write my stories via email; however, I strongly prefer to collaborate with my co-writers via a text IM platform such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or Discord.  This is largely because an IM platform allows for a truly conversational, back-and-forth discourse about the story (rather than a static series of isolated messages via email).  I also find that my best stories tend to emerge with individuals with whom I am able to cultivate a strong intellectual chemistry with\u2014and as a result, this has led to several long-term stories.  I would be absolutely thrilled to find other writers in this subreddit who are also looking for long-term stories.  \n\n**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 [ideally over 21].**  This is not to suggest that my stories always involve adult themes.  In fact, many of my stories do not involve NSFW themes at all.  However, I feel exponentially more comfortable discussing literary ideas with fellow adults.  As a result, I set this as a strict limit, and I have a zero tolerance policy for those who lie about their age.  As a result, I will be firm for only this particular issue\u2014 *do not contact me unless you are 18 years of age.*\n\n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.**  As I mentioned above, I\u2019m seeking a writer who is truly interested in forming a long-term collaborative writing partnership.  This means not only focusing on issues pertaining to our story at hand, but also to broader issues concerning our writing as a whole.  Ideally, it would be nice to connect with other working professionals who are looking to use writing as a creative outlet, of sorts.\n\n* **Mutual respect.**  As I\u2019m sure is the case with many of you, I simply cannot be in front of the computer 24/7 due to real life responsibilities and obligations.  Because of this, I hope to find a writer who is committed, yet flexible\u2014someone who is willing to maintain open communication while at the same time, respecting one another\u2019s autonomy.\n\nIf this post has captured your interest or imagination, then by all means, I would love to hear from you!  In your post, please tell me a bit about yourself, and your background in writing.  Hopefully we can get a conversation going, and weave our way into writing a story together.\n\nThanks for your time; I hope to hear from you!",

I would like to preface this by saying that I\u2019m always open to suggestions when it comes to roleplay. So if you have other ideas that don\u2019t necessarily go with what I\u2019m requesting but think that we might get along, please don\u2019t hesitate to send me a message about them! Having nearly two decades of roleplaying/writing under my belt, I like to think that I\u2019m fairly versatile. \n\nPresently, I have a hankering for something more specific... \n\nWell, sort of..\n\nI\u2019m open regarding the setting, but I am in the mood for some good ol\u2019 Rivals-Turn-Romance. Maybe these characters are in high school and up for the same scholarship or award. Maybe they\u2019re co-workers trying to get that promotion. Maybe the setting isn\u2019t modern day at all. The sky is the limit, really. I could even be interested in exploring Original Characters within a Fandom setting. It is the type of relationship that is important to me, not where and when we place them. Bonus points if we manage to come up with something to disrupt all of their carefully laid plans on top of the rest. \n\nGiven that I\u2019m in my early thirties, I\u2019m going to insist that prospective roleplay partners be, at the very least, 18+. Also, I tend to prefer Discord these days, as I find it to be the most accessible across my various devices. I think that about covers it for now, but I look forward to hearing from you! \n",

The setting can be anywhere, and take place in any time period \n\nIt\u2019s not fully fleshed out, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nThis plot could possibly delve into some extremely dark themes, so just be aware of that. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses.

            "selftext": "*\"General Quarters, General Quarters - all hands man your battle stations. Transit up and forward starboard side, down and aft port side. Potential pirate vessel sighted...\"*\n\nThe klaxon sounded over the 1MC as I stepped onto the bridge, a seaman sealing the hatch behind me. Compared to all the USN sailors in their digital blue-and-grey coveralls, I was positively drab: woodland MARPAT, elbow pads, knee pads, olive khaki body armour and helmet. But with my kitted-out carbine, pouches festooned across my front - full of magazine after magazine of 5.56mm, holster strapped low on my right leg with my .45 - I stood out in a different way. But even dressed as I was, I only got a sharp glance before the sailors got back to their tasks at getting the ship to battle status. The captain sat in his chair, speaking orders into his comm handset - his silver-hair made spotting him across the bridge a piece of cake.\n\nBefore moving over to him, I looked at the bronze plate embedded on the rear bulkhead of the bridge. USS Jason Dunham - Jason L. Dunham, Cpl, USMC. He was a squad leader in Iraq, when an insurgent dropped a grenade near his squad. Rather than try to take cover, Dunham threw himself on top of the grenade. The blast killed him, but his body shielded his squad. He died eight days later - he was 22. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. I hoped I could be a fraction of the marine he was, and I was proud to be serving aboard the ship bearing his name. A ship that, upon passing its shakedown cruise, had been immediately assigned to Combined Task Force 151 - a multinational effort to combat piracy in the Gulf of Aden. There were ships from the US, Canada, Denmark, Korea, even the Aussies contributed a ship.\n\nThe ships of CTF-151 patrolled the waters from the Gulf of Aden to the western parts of the Arabian sea, especially around the coasts of Somalia. In doing so, they protected the merchant ships responsible for a large fraction of the world's commerce from pirates who threatened to hijack ships, take their crews hostage, and then take control of the vessels and cargoes. As an armed warship, the Dunham was one of ships tasks with hunting down any suspected pirate vessels - like the one we were about to board.\n\nAs as one of the \"Visit, Board, Search, and Seize\" (VBSS) team members, it was my job to actually board the ship - something the crew of which may or may not like - and take control of it. Not only that, but today, I was more than just a a team member.\n\nI stood at attention in front of the captain, \"Skipper.\"\n\nHe turned and reached to clip the comm handset back into its holder, \"Gunny. How's the team looking?\"\n\n\"Like clockwork, Skipper. We'll be ready once the RHIBs are within range,\" I nodded. \"Sir, is it true about the LT?\"\n\nThe captain grimaced, but likewise nodded. \"Afraid so, Gunny: Cirrhosis. Lieutenant Hoffman's not just off the boarding crew, he's out of the Navy. You up for taking the boarding party? Not just now, but until a new officer is assigned.\"\n\n\"Oorah, Skipper,\" I nodded again, this time with more certainty. I wasn't a Marine NCO if I wasn't ready to step up.\n\nOne of the look-outs called out to the captain, \"Captain, the boat still isn't heaving to.\"\n\nHe turned, looking out the front windows. He grabbed his handset again, \"Combat, Bridge. TAO: Send one last hail to the suspect vessel and slew the 5-inch of its bow. Then have one of the .50 cals ready to fire a warning burst.\"\n\nWhen the captain turned to give the orders, my eyes slid over to a Navy lieutenant (junior grade) who was acting as the Officer of the Deck. Wisps of her hair escaped her cap as she lowered her binoculars. Her bright eyes swiveled to me when she noticed me looking at her. Given the situation outside, no one on the bridge was aware that either of us noticed the other. But her eyes changed slightly and her lip crept into a delicate bite. In return I gave her a wink right before the captain turned back to me.\n\n\"Alright, looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way.\" He gave me a look and I snapped my attention back to him. \"Gunnery Sergeant Jackson, take TAIPAN. Board that ship, turn it inside out, and then give the crew a stern talking to.\"\n\n\"Aye aye, Skipper.\" I set off to leave the bridge. I gave one last look to the Officer of the Deck just as the port-side .50cal let off a throaty six-round burst.\n\n***\n\n&gt; A little, Long-Term RP with a bit of romance (and possibly a bit of adventure)",

I\u2019ve always wanted to RP a Roman/Greek Mythology based RP based on modern day, but not quite Percy Jackson-esque? More like, Zeus is famous for his block parties in the city, Hades runs a underground criminal drug ring, Aphrodite runs a upscale beauty salon, etc. etc.? The idea is that magic still runs in the modern world, but it\u2019s more subtle than most expect it to be?\n\nMaybe modern Hercules does through the Disney version, or the twelve labors of any sort to get out of trouble? Or like a prophecy of some sort causes things to spiral? Or maybe even humans get integrated within the magic city?   \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ll be playing female personification of Cerberus! She\u2019s a hot headed young girl who\u2019s Hades\u2019 right-hand woman, and can be curt and snappy. Personally, I\u2019d be interested in a love story between her and someone else?",

So instead of dancing on our feet, the splashes of ink drawn across the paper will do?\n\nI work from home, and have downtime between my projects often, so I generally am available to post all day long. It's not exactly rapid-fire, although on a good day you can expect more than a dozen posts.\n\nI only write in paragraph form, and in third-person. My general pots range from 200-500 words per, although this can be adjusted to my partner's preferences. I don't do one liners, and I don't do script form roleplay, however, so please bear that in mind.\n\nDiscord preferred, GH is an alternative, but I'm open to other platforms, provided that you can convince me that you are the hot potato, or that you're an amazing person. I like potatoes though.\n\nI prefer roleplaying with females. Sorry fellow men, but it's not my cup of tea.\n\nWhile I usually do prefer original roleplays, I can be convinced to do some fandom stuff, provided I'm familiar with it. I'm mostly familiar with anime and videogames, and TV shows and movies are not really my thing. Suggest it, tell me what character you're looking for, and I'll tell you how I feel about it. :)\n\nGenres: I'm looking for something with some fantasy in it. I like slice-of-life, as long as it has some sort of fantastical twist to it, even if it's very low-fantasy. Modern, medieval, post-apocalyptic, alternate history, just hit me with it.\n\nIf you are interested in doing a fandom of sorts, I've got mostly a list of anime/games. Overwatch, Persona 5, Danganronpa, My Hero Academia, Dungeonmeshi, Fate Stay, for some examples. I'm also more than down to use any element of these as an AU!\n\nI think I covered most things for now. If you're interested and like what you see, PM me and let's discuss further!",

I try to be open with all types of settings and coming from tabletops I am very use to fantasy both high and low but am comfortable doing others as well. I am open to world building as well since I find that to be extremely fun and interesting. I am twenty years old and work from home so I am available all throughout the day on Discord. My view on NSFW themes is that I am okay with them but most certainly do not expect them I also don't expect them to be the main focus of the story even in a romance stories as there are other forms of intimacy.

            "selftext": "I don't use Reddit much, or at all really, but I figured it was worth a shot lol. We're looking for new members to join and bring more activity to our little community of roleplayers on Amino. To sum it up, Deltascape is essentially a roleplaying community used as a social media app for your ocs. So rather than creating your profile for you (the admin), you would make it how your character would make it and blog how your character would blog. It's a great place if you're looking for a way to casually rp through in-character chatrooms or posts and to develop your oc.\nIt's pretty lenient, though we do have rules such as the oc not being TOO OP, and having you credit your faceclaim. Similarly, we prefer humanoid characters but supernatural powers are okay. We try to drive the saying that the admin is different than the oc and drama between two characters should stay between too characters. That and crediting your faceclaim is really the only thing we crack down on but other than that it's pretty lax. At the moment, it's relatively small (about 100 members in total) but we're hoping more people will join the more we advertise. It becomes a lot more fun when there are other ocs to interact with.\nI hope you like the community as much as I do and consider letting us advertise here!!!! Thanks so much, here's a link if you're interested http://aminoapps.com/c/Deltascape ",

            "selftext": "**About me:** Hello! I'm a writer in his 20's and, above all else, I love world\\-building and character writing. I've written several short\\-stories \\(some have been published anonymously\\) as well as some longer works of fiction that are currently in their editing stages.\n\n**Genre:** I usually stick to Sci\\-Fi or Fantasy. I love them both. Modern\\-day plots seem to always fall on the generic side of things for whatever reason, so Fantasy or Sci\\-Fi is always an easy way to spice it up in RP. Although, I wouldn't be averse to a modern\\-fantasy kind of setting.\n\n**Characters:** I create original characters for every single Roleplay. I don't re\\-use anyone. I tend to write darker characters, not in tone, but in execution. As in, characters with deep, deep flaws that aren't just \"he's sad because his mother died,\" or some schlock like that. I really enjoy crafting three\\-dimensional roles that challenge my partner, as well as creating for a story with no true heroes.\n\n**Plot:** To be determined. I do have ideas, as always, but I much rather create one with the partner. If you have an idea feel free to send it my way, as well, however, chances are we'll probably be going over things anyway. I just like being introduced to something new. I dislike unoriginal worlds that are fandom\\-oriented, they feel restrictive and honestly, kind of lazy. I do have a fantasy story i'm working on, however, if you have any original ideas as well, don't hesitate to message me.\n\nMy stories are often on the darker side as well, as in, 18\\+ themes. Gore, sex, drugs, and all that fun stuff! That doesn't mean they are doom and gloom, though. There will be plenty of comedy to go around, I assure you.\n\n**Partner Requirements:** Have fun! Love to write! Love to really engage! Have a passion for what you are doing. There is nothing more tedious and banal than a partner that seems to not care about what she is writing. You don't have to be George R.R Martin, just write something you care and are interested about.\n\nAlso, if we click and do create a fun idea together, I would like at least a modicum of commitment. Being ghosted is never fun. I will always show you the respect of telling you if the RP isn't interesting me or the characters aren't engaging. I expect the same from you.\n\n**Smut:** Ahh yes, we all love smut. Including myself. Smut is fun. While I don't really want a roleplay dedicated to it... usually, I quite like including it into facets where it belongs. Diagetically. I also enjoy partners that are creative, original, and unique when it comes to this. If your tastes are a little out of the norm, that is totally okay! We can discuss this further if you decide to message me.\n\n**Overall:** Don't be afraid to shoot me a message. Just tell me a bit about yourself. What ideas are wrapped up in that beautiful mind of yours? Lets have an awe\\-inspiring adventure together!",

Callsign \"Nightwing\" here, you might know me better as Batman's first Robin. And Gotham City isn't doing too hot. It's been 122 days since the disappearance of a large number of Justice Leaguers, including Batman himself. In those 122 days, no one in the city has been able to keep a lock on crime. The \"Bat-Family\" has been stretched thin trying to cover all the bases, but clearly, it isn't enough. People have begun to associate Batman's disappearance with the recent death of the Joker, and in turn spawned a new war between tribute gangs, people fighting to represent the names of either Batman or the Joker, just adding more onto the plates of the professionals. Everyone is having troubles, but consider this Gotham City's SOS; we need help. Be it from heroes or sidekicks not in Gotham, or anyone willing to directly aid us in saving this city. Until further action can be taken, we are the New Justice League. Nightwing out.\n\nPlease join!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/8CqVEwM",

            "selftext": "*...an alien just came out of it and wants you to go to space with him.*\n\nOk so first of all, hello. Hi. I've had this idea for a roleplay, which originally comes from a story I'm writing, so this post is probably going to be a mess. Brace yourself.\n\nFirst of all: this is **SFW**. I don't do SRPs and all that, sorry! but I'm okay with NSFW themes being discussed/mentioned by the characters in the story, though.\n\nThe story would be that you recently lost your job, your friends, your family and all that. Or maybe you never had any; you get to write your own backstory, of course. **Basically, you're a big loser and you don't know what to do with your life. But one night, you hear a crashing sound in your backyard,** and when you come out to check what it is, **you see that it's some weird alien car that fell from the stars. A black humanoid insect-looking alien** (played by me, hello!) **comes out of it,** looks at you with his glowing green eyes, **and basically tells you that he needs a human, for a job in space with him, and that you are absolutely *perfect* for it.** If you leave Earth and go with him right now, no one will come looking for you!\n\n**So then my character and yours go to space and have spacey adventures.** I'm looking for something funny and light-hearted, but it can have its dark and sad moments as well.\n\nMy character, the alien, is definitely not the nicest guy ever, though. **It's all about the relationship between him and your character!** Conflicts between the two makes everything 100x more interesting, especially if they have to work together during their adventures.\n\nI can play other characters, too. I can DM the world, or we could be both DMing it at the same time. Just tell me what you prefer.\n\nAlso, this one is going to be very important... I'm open to ideas. But like, **very open to ideas**, so don't hesitate to share them if you're interested. So if we're playing and you suddenly have an idea of something that could be fun to play, don't hesitate to pause the rp to tell me what it is. Some people might say, ***RP is like sex. If you don't communicate enough, it's a mess, but if you communicate too much, it can easily ruin the fun***. But you know what I say? ***There's no such thing as too much communication. ~~Please send me lots of messages, I'm lonely.~~***\n\nSo yeah, PM me if you're interested and somehow managed to read the whole thing. I do **kik** and **Discord**. Keep in mind that english isn't my first language, so my literacy level isn't incredible, and I might make small stupid grammatical errors at some points, but I always try to make my messages as clear as possible. The worst that could happen is me asking for the meaning of a word or something! Also I'm from France, so timezones and all that. So yeah, thanks for reading, PM me!",

I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet, and keep my fingers crossed!\n\nStuff you need to know:\n\n- I\u2019m over 21 and ask that you only contact me if you are too;\n\n- Email only;\n\n- English is my second language, so I make a mistake here and there - I welcome corrections;\n\n- I work full time, and usually post once a day or every other day - if you need rapid-fire, I\u2019m not your gal.\n\nWith that out of the way, here is the general idea I have: Character A (yours) is an older (maybe 40s) wizard, who\u2019s been disillusioned for years, after he\u2019s learned that most of his kind seek only power and not to help others. Character B (mine) is a down-on-her-luck orphan, looking for nothing more than a place to work and live and something to keep her from starving to death. When she meets A, all she wants from him is exactly that. But as time goes by, he can see she has untapped magical potential (we can discuss the details) and a kind and generous heart to match it, which prompts him to become her mentor, and probably more than that in the future. Details are up for discussion. PM  if interested. Thanks in advance!",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm currently looking for partners for a wide variety of plots I would like to do! Without further ado, I'll dive right into it!\u00a0\n\n**A little bit about me:**\u00a0I have been roleplaying for nearly four years now.  I'm usually available afternoons on most weekdays, and free on the weekends! I'll do my best to alert you if I am aware I'll be gone for an extended period of time.\n\n**What I'm looking for in a partner:**\n\n-\u00a0**Someone who is detailed.**\u00a0I'm looking for someone who puts detail and effort into the replies they send. I don't mind the occasional grammar error, I'm not too much of a stickler when it comes to it. I don't expect massive walls of text every reply, as long as you aren't constantly spitting out one line responses, I'll be happy! I tend to write two to three paragraphs per response, although I will do my best to match the length of what you send.\n\n-\u00a0**Someone who doesn't mind playing multiple characters.**\u00a0This one isn't too much a requirement as it is a preference. If you like playing several characters, cool! Otherwise, it's not a deal breaker for me.\n\n**Plots I'm interested in:**\n\n*Alright, so here is the list of plots I would like to do. It's kinda long, so I've divided it into two categories.\u00a0Fandom and Non-fandom.*\n\n**FANDOM**\n\n*Note: I'm not to big on OCs, I greatly prefer if you play only cannon characters.*\n\n**RWBY:**\n\n- My character would be a teenager, running around Vale as a thief. Eventually caught, but instead of being sent to a detention center, the headmaster of Beacon Academy has a better idea. He would be put under the watch of one of the teams of the academy. It could be team RWBY, JNPR, CFVY, Cinder's \"team\". Heck, I'd even be willing to give a team STQR approach. (They would be a bit younger, of course.) Maybe of unique team, composed of various different characters?\n\n- Same character as above, different scenario. What if all of the main cast of the show were put in one large house? Chaos would ensure, definitely. Chaos that my character would be thrown into. I'm pretty open to any character roster for this!\n\n- My character would be a new student to Atlas Academy. A bit of a troublemaker, until an dust incident results in him being put under the watch of Winter, much to his dismay. (Winter could be swapped out with Pyrrah, or even Glenda for this one!)\n\n**Overwatch:**\n\n- My character would be a teenager who ran away from home, sneaking aboard a cargo ship. For the last 6 months, I've been traveling the world this way, before accidentally coming across Watchpoint: Gibraltar\n\n- Alternatively, he could be kidnapped by Talon.\n\n**Borderlands:**\n\n- My character would be a teenager, the heir of a massive mining company. After a rebellious act of running away, he would crash land on Pandora, before being found by Lilith or Maya. This would take place after the main campaign of BL2 is done!\n\n- Or, my character could be a lowly thief on Pandora, before making the grave mistake of trying to rob Lilith/Maya/Athena.\n\n**Doki Doki Literature Club:**\n\nA mysterious event brings the characters of the game into the 'real' world, leaving a destructive rift behind in their wake. Chaos ensures, especially now that Monika has access to the object she desires most\u2026\n\n*Other characters I'm interested in my partner playing, but don't really have a plot for:*\n\n\n- Samus (Metroid)\n- Elizabeth (BioShock)\n- Monika (DDLC)\n- Cynthia (Pokemon)\n- Lusamine (Pokemon)\n- 2B (Neir: Automata)\n- Skyla (Pokemon)\n- Cortana (Halo)\n- IQ (R6)\n- Any girl from Pokemon, really.\n- Piper (Fallout)\n\n**NON-FANDOM**\n\n*So, I have a lot of non-fandom ideas. So I've simply listed roles I would be interested in my partner playing! If you would like to play any of these roles, just tell me which one and we can work a plot out!*\n\n- Soilder/other high military officer.\n- Teacher/principal.\n- Cop/security guard.\n- Assassin\n- Slime girl/other monster girl.\n- Classmate\n- Android (Like 2B from Neir).\n- Kidnapper.\n- Serial Killer.\n- Criminal.\n- Former Actress\n- Famous YouTuber\n\nIf your interested in any of the plots or roles, pm me or leave a comment!",
