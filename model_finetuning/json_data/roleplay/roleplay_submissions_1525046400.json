By now, his clothes were soaked and he dripped both blood and water, which hit the ground in somewhat of a melancholic rhythm.\n\nEventually, he lifted his head enough to examine his surroundings, and he saw the small shack in front of him, only about a quarter of a mile away. With that in mind, he kept moving forward, despite every muscle in his body screaming at him to stop and rest.\n\nWhile he made the final stretch, the events that lead him here replayed in his mind for the umpteenth time.  As one of the only Mage Thieves in the entire land, he was quite the rarity to see. It was scary to be the target of one who could dexterously and silently kill you in hand-to-hand combat, and also incinerate you to dust from a safe distance if he so pleased. With that in mind, he had started his own little circle, where the close knit family had robbed many and rescued some for years and years, enjoying each other\u2019s company and companionship.\n\nAnd life was good. Things went well, they never got into too much trouble, until, well, they did just that. In all fairness, how could they have known that one of their targets was the nephew to yet another Mage Thief, and one that didn\u2019t take kindly to strangers. When their target brought that up to them, they simply brushed it aside, and ended up fatally wounding the man in the ensuing clash, though they didn\u2019t know that.\n\nThe target died right there where he was mugged, and it didn\u2019t take long for word to spread that one Mage Thief had killed the nephew of another. Of course, this was accidental, yet no one made it out to be that way.\n\nAnd revenge is a cycle, one that these two Mage Thieves were now bound to. Gathering the most vicious mercenaries from across the land, the one who lost his nephew sought revenge for the murder, and that\u2019s what he got.\n\nIt was brutal, to say the least. The entire circle that had been built up for years now lied in ditches, their bodies bloodied and limp, their souls passed on.\n\nWith the last remaining strength, the surviving Mage Thief had headed towards the Witch\u2019s cottage, knowing that he would claim his own revenge once more, and he would need all the power and allies he can get.\n\nFinally arriving at the front door, he banged on it a few times, waiting for a response as the blood seeped from his injuries.",

            "selftext": " Great, looks like the clickbait has worked, once again. If you are reading this again and have messaged me before I urge you to message me again if I haven't yet responded. I am just a human and sometimes I just get overwhelmed, so don't be discouraged just message me, I am actually a pretty chill person, contrariety to popular belief.\n\nWith that aside a little about me, I am Elise Elson, a 19 year old student majoring in psychology. In my spare time among a plethora of other things I like to write. I don't always find the time in my hectic life right now but the winter break has given me some much needed writing time.\n\nA couple of things you should take away from this:\n\n* I won't be available to talk and RP 24/7\n* There will be some days with no RP or talk\n* I am older than 18 and expect my partner to be the same\n* I am not an author, this is only a hobby so don't come expecting a novel\n\nWhile I have your attention, I would also like to thank you for taking your time to read this ad. I know I might sound like and asshole, but really I am just a sweet girl who just want's to write. :\\)\n\nI am big into fandoms, but there are time when I just don't want to do a certain thing. So don't be afraid to ask me but don't be pissed if I say no. Some fandoms I am into right now:\n\n* Game Of Thrones\n* Harry Potter \\(This one is weird and will need discussing\\)\n* Star Wars \\(My knowledge goes as far as the movies, I have seen them all\\)\n* Disney \\(This too we need to discuss\\)\n\nI also like original worlds, but I won't make them all on my own. I know there are people out there like that, so be warned if you want to build a world it will need both of our input. I won't do it on my own.\n\nSo some genres I enjoy:\n\n* Adventure\n* Crime Syndicate\n* Fairytale\n* Fantasy \\(Vampire, Fey, Magic, etc\\)\n* Historical\n* Horror\n* Kidnapped / Slavery\n* Modern / Slice of life\n* Mythological \\(Greek\\)\n* Post Apocalyptic / Dystopian\n\nIf you have any others don't be afraid to ask me, who know I might enjoy it.\n\nSo finally I like to write, 3rd person, past / present. My lengths are generally 3 \\- 5 paragraphs and want my partners to match that. If you have a sample of your writing you get extra points :D I am not opposed to smut/romance, in fact I want that to be in my stories just not the only thing in my story.\n\nYou can reach me by DMs.\n\nThank you for reading, I look forward to all of your pretty orange letters. :\\)",

I *do* know, however, that I want it to be a tragic romance spanning the course of the war. I want to slowly develop our characters over time and explore how the war affects them and changes them forever. As to whether or not the ending will be tragic? Well, we'll just have to see how things play out. ;) I look forward to working out a story with you and am always open to suggestions.\n\nI don't have many requirements. You don't need to be an expert on the period, just a basic knowledge of it is good enough for me. Also, please be literate. My replies are generally short, but I try to avoid one-liners. I'm also incapable of writing a novel while RPing. :P just wanted to get that out of the way. I look forward to hearing from you. :)\n\nAlso: Though the overall tone of this RP will be quite dark, there will be lighter moments as well. I am a *huge* fan of fluff and sweetness! ",

I have quite a few OCs, so further plot from this will be dependent on what personality we go with. Your \u2018demon\u2019 (or whatever summonable race you\u2019d like) will be tether to my OC until one ultimate goal/task/wish has been completed. I\u2019ve got OCs with \u2018chosen one\u2019 syndrome that we can play a hero\u2019s tale in hell with, I\u2019ve got OCs who long for a wealthy husband, OCs who long for power, or ones with murderous or vengeful intentions. I\u2019ve got OCs coming out my ass honestly. The ultimate plot is infinitely adaptable, and anyone with multiple OCs of their own are highly encouraged to bring what you\u2019d like to the table! We can discuss all of this in PM! \n\nSo, now to get down to the nitty gritty. I\u2019m looking for people 18+ (the closer to my age the better) who can consistently write 2-3 paragraphs per response. I write in third person, past tense. Romance and smut are great, but shouldn\u2019t overshadow the story. Helping to move plot, control NPCs or play multiple characters is also a must! I\u2019m active with one post a day or more, though I do occasionally take days off. I\u2019ve got a predictable M-F schedule. Anyone with a passion for things like Welcome to Night Vale, folklore and absurdism are highly encouraged to apply! I like making friends with my partners too, but it\u2019s not a dealbreaker if you\u2019d prefer to remain anonymous. If you\u2019re interested and interesting, message me with one of your favorite quotes! Anyone who provides a writing sample will earn three points on their deductible. Feel free to introduce yourself if you\u2019d like, and we can get to discussing how we want the RP to move forward, and I\u2019ll send you (or vice versa) my discord! ",

Please don't ask if I'm \"still looking\" or if id be \"interested in plotting\" cause the answers are always gonna be **YES** hahaha\n\nAnyways, I won't dive into my personal life here. If you wanna know more about what makes me tick as a writer you can do so by reading things [HERE](https://sparenovel.weebly.com/). There's also a few ideas tucked away on that site that I'd love to try, but for now though, let me give you the basics.\n\nName's Jayy, I'm 25, live in the CST region, and I've been doing this sort of thing for 12+ years now. I'm on the computer about 75% of my time due to work and normally get at least a reply out once per day. 3rd person past tense is my typical flavor, though I'm open to trying first person depending on the scene. \n\nWhen it comes to fandom rp, I hardly ever play Canon characters unless for some reason you request one that I happened to have played before. Most of the time though, Original RPs are my main jam. Anything that's in bold below is my favorite just fyi\n\n\n*Fandoms of Interest*\n* **Star Wars**\n* **Marvel (MCU)**\n* DC (Comics)\n* Batman/Batman Beyond\n\n**Genres of Interest**\n\n*Fantasy*\n* Mutants/Gifted\n* **Modern**\n* **Supernatural**\n* Mythology\n* Post-Apocalyptic\n\n*Sci-Fi*\n* Cyberpunk\n* **Dystopian Worlds**\n* Alternate Universes\n* Space Stuff\n\n*Modern*\n* Slice of Life\n* **Mob/Crime**\n* University/Schools\n\nAs far as partners go, I'm not very picky. The main thing I ask is be at least 18+ as I do like to incorporate NSFW topics into things at times. It's not my main focus, but c'mon sometimes you need a mindless rp to get things flowing again.\n\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone. I am creating an interactive RP server right now. The idea behind it is that it will be heavily narrated and controlled by bot \\(that I am developing right now\\) and actual community. \n\nThis RP server will have at least these unique features: \n\n* **Character creation master.** This will allow users with bot guidance to make a balanced character. User will add stats and inventory up to the max amount of available points. Character pic and character description, everything will be combined into a single character object assigned to the user that created it. \n* **Location manager.** I am not sure if this is a good idea but every user will be able to see only locations that are nearby him. This way users won't be able to see all the locations at once and instantly tp to each of them. There will be also a delay moving between locations. Yet to get from one location to another user might get ambushed by other players, so it is better to think, do you want to pick a safe road or you're ready to face the enemy? \n* **Leveling system.** Each character will gain a small amount of XP for just talking in RP channels. To get more XP it is better to fight other players and NPCs\\(like bosses\\). The higher level your character is the more points you have to upgrade your stats and equipment. \n* **RP economy.** Users will be able to grind for money or trade with others. Special market locations will let everyone leave an ad to tell them what they are selling to meet up and trade. You better bring guards with you since.. you know.. Other player may be waiting to rob you right away. Town guards won't let this happen, but they also do not allow restricted goods, so you need to be careful. \n* **Observers.** Users will be able to become an observer of few locations for a limited time. They will look for fairplay and will be able to cast events in locations they are responsible for. Rain, thunder... or maybe the uprising of the dead? Users will be granted XP for their actions and more or less XP if other users like or not you being an observer. \n\nI have few more ideas but I am not sure about some of them, as well as those listed above. I need some team of creators and developers who want to help creating concepts, story, code bot to make everything work. Right now bot is in a very early stage, only very core components are created: Bot, Core command router, Command handler, MongoDB, Ubuntu server for hosting a bot online. Now there is only a need to implement features and generate ideas.  \n\nI am coding in JS using Discord.js. Ubuntu will be a server to host NodeJS application. Same Ubuntu already hosts MongoDB. If you willing to help and fluent with these technologies please join the server, we can talk a little bit.  \n\n[https://discord.gg/y2Mj29t](https://discord.gg/y2Mj29t)\n\nIf you have a lot of new ideas for this you should also join and share them, we might be able to create universal Discord RP server! \n\nYou shouldn't join if you want to play RP right now, the bot is very raw and commands are half done without any functionality that actually manages server. So literally server is empty for users who want to play. \n\nI hope to find interesting and enthusiastic people who want to see the interesting results of their unique ideas. Thanks for the attention. ",

I enjoy people playing Canon characters! though OCs are fine, But in all honesty I'd prefer the canons, but don't be afraid to contact me for an OC type thing. I myself am going to be playing an OC \\( A male one, just for clarification.\\), and don't mind giving you a run\\-down of what I'm looking for plot wise and etc. So please, feel free to contact me at your leisure to ask and learn!\\~ I'm eager to find more roleplaying partners. As for what I'd prefer people's post length to be? I don't mind at all to have a short post, ones ranging from a paragraph to four to three sentences are my preference, as I don't enjoy multi\\-paragraph posts due to them being slow.

You're in a semi-public space, but not currently with anyone one you know. You can tell this man is coming to talk to you. He's very young looking.   He speaks to you. He says your name in a questioning way, as if to make sure he has your attention. His voice is developed, and a little gruff. You turn to him, but you hesitate. You remember now. This boy has been stalking you for almost a month now. Always at a distance, but there nonetheless. This questionable interest in you is only a taste of what the young man feels for you. To put it simply, what you don\u2019t know is that he is raving in love with you. To clarify, he would rather die than be without you. There is very little he wouldn't do to win you for himself. \n\nHello! Shoot me a PM if you want to play, and we can figure out what platforms work for us both to use! If you have any questions, feel free to ask at any time. To start off, I'm gunna ask that you have a basic background for your character that my stalking character will have observed of yours, including appearance, occupation, place of residence, and anything she will have posted online. Also. The semi-public place of meeting will be your choice as well, just so that it\u2019s a place that works for your character! \n\nThanks! And I look forward to playing :D",

Also in your message post your favorite color so I know that you actually read this.\n",

            "selftext": "\nI'm looking for a long term partner. My objective is less a specific story than someone that might be interested in a variety of stories, or building one up from the ground together depending on our mood. With the right person, I am willing to play more than one contiguous story line and dedicate to one on one, mostly \"live\" play. \n\nNo, I don't know how to do fancy ads here on E, and I'm probably not going to learn. The ad, from my view, is just a means to an end. If you want to see what I can do, you'll need to look to what I have created and written.\n\nHere are a few of the basics I'm after:\n\n- Experienced partners only\n- I play male characters that prefer female characters.\n- One on one (Discord)\n- 3rd person, past tense.\n- Grammar, spelling, etc. as expected in literate writing.\n- Story structure and plot that is compelling.\n- Well-developed, out of the box characters that are wholy original.\n- Novela style, multiple paragraphs (post ranging depending on context and need from 200-2000 words per.\n- \"Live play\" where posts are exchanged in repetition for at least a few sessions a week.\n- Journalling/offline posts when schedules are unavailable. \n- Webpages, tumblrs, photos, and an interest in such things.\n- Yes to these genres: modern realistic, modern fantasy, period pieces (any) fantasy/realistic, near present sci fi, far future sci fi, deep space opera sci fi, adventure, thrillers, mystery, noir, W:tA (maybe). \nNo to these: canon, high fantasy, medieval fantasy, steampunk, college/school, slice of life. \nYes to: Adapting existing stories we each have into something uniquely ours, creating from scratch with a partner.\nNo to: Handholding and writing the entire plot and every twist myself, playing in another person's pre-set world I had no input in.\n\nI've been at this for a while, as you might guess. I am very choosy, but I'm pretty dedicated once settled with a partner. The truth is, experience has taught me that it's better to be very specific and risk scaring some people off. I'll be happier and a better match with the one person I do end up writing with than I would half a dozen mediocre partners I don't really line up with. \n\nI am happy to bend to your requirements as well within reason. If you are interested, I can provide writing samples, pages, and a good deal of whatever else you might need to judge. To get us started, here is a character hub:\n\nhttps://theskinofthequick.tumblr.com\n\nThis page is a work in progress and I'll be adding content the moment I have the time to, but for now it at least links off to more finished individual character pages with more info.\n\nWhat I'm really interested in is someone enthusiastically into all the detailed parts of writing long form roleplay that I am. I would like a partner who gets excited about ideas and has a few of their own. I want to be challenged and surprised and fascinated. Most of all, I want objectively good writing that keeps me coming back for more.\n\nAll that said, I know we will need to actually speak to know if we are a true match. I play exclusively in Discord, if you PM me here, I normally answer quickly and provide contact info.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.",

To see the wickedness that a person can do to another person? The darkness in the heart of a man, especially some of them that're pledged to do violence on the behalf of those that can't is something to truly behold. That's what I want to play here. Assassins, bodyguards, cops, survivors in an apocalypse. Maybe even the supernatural. We can do this modern, like John Wick and Grand Theft auto, or we can do this futuristic like Cyberpunk/Blade Runner. If you insist on medieval, I could see some political court, cloak and dagger drama happening.. I want that dark, noir, gritty kind of feeling. Romance is a definite option, as is smut, so I'm asking that you NOT contact me if you're under eighteen, just for sheer possible content.My preference is that your character's female, or at least feminine enough, but in the end? The story matters more than anything. See you around, Space Cowboy.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019m a looking for a world building partner for an original story. I have tried to roleplay this a few times before but I\u2019m looking to make the material more immersive and cohesive. I\u2019m seeking someone who can point out holes, ask questions and add to the world. \n\nI\u2019ve included a brief summary below. I\u2019ll respond with more material to those who are interested via PM:\n\nIn a world of magic and myths the Nation of 5 Queens, Sirenia is a coastal nation whose civilians are all women. But unlike the fabled Amazons, Sirenans are marked with stunning beauty. It is said that Sirenia was founded by the goddess, Sirena, who had populated the nation with the daughters of all the gods of the surrounding nations. One version of the tale tells it as an orgy that Sirena arranges with the neighboring gods, but that may just be a sensationalized account..\n\nWith warring nations all across the land, Sirenia maintains it\u2019s sovereignty on the fact that the 5 Queens are offspring of rulers from the 5 strongest Nations. The ranking of the Queens switch as the five nation\u2019s army count and financial health change. Though not often, this does happen. And in trying times like the present, it is even more likely to happen. This makes Sirenia one of the best connected and powerful by proxy empires. You may be wondering how this came to be.\n\nWell, Sirenia is more than happy to marry off their beautiful daughters to powerful men. Rulers taking on a Sirenan bride pay a hefty dowry before marriage as well as promising to have all daughters in their bloodline brought back as Sirenian civilians.\n\nSirena women are known to have fraternal twins when they are pregnant. Almost always both a boy and a girl. This works out perfectly for Kings and rulers who want an heir to their throne. This also benefits Sirena in repopulating their nation and serves a symbiotic lifeline.",

            "selftext": "Good evening, as the title already implies, I try to find people willed to play FFXV characters with me. I'm a literate female RPer who would love to play out a little spin-off, extra-sequence or even just putting them into another setting to allow for some romance the game has lacked and more goofiness and friendship time between them - by which I mean all characters involved.\n\nI don't need you to constantly write because we all have busy lives and lack of motivation sometimes, but if you do, please make sure you're using correct grammar and orthography aka spelling. To be fair, I would like to add as well, that I have not personally played the game, but I did watch a lot of lets plays and read through many wiki pages and I'm certain I can provide a believable Luna! (I hope I can make her more humane, though.)\n\nSo...I used to just search for romance, but now I think that having the entire squad would be more fun and engaging.\n\nDrop in an orange envelope, if you're interested and tell me what role you want to play!\n\nNow, as for a first post to give you a sample of my writing:\n\nSighing quietly as I flipped the notebook open, my fingers were already gently stroking, almost caressing the smooth reddish leather back of the hardcover. I smiled to myself as I allowed me to indulge in old memories before I closed the book again, holding it to my heart like the precious thing it was. My eyes closed, I felt your presence drawing closer soon. Ever since the day I sacrificed my life for you I had waited. And even though I was happy to know that we would be united again, the thought you would have to part with others as the tribute to this meeting made my heart ache. \"Welcome\", I whispered quietly, turning around to you with a soft smile as you entered the room that looked so much like your own chambers in Insomnia - back then when the Crown City still was safe. But we were at another place now, a replica - however, at least, it would be safer than any other place we had been at together. This time, we would not be ripped apart again. I could not force myself to tell you where we were yet, though, so I just came closer, the same serene smile plastered across my face - the strong, faithful one I kept for occasions like this: when I had to hide the downsides. My right hand soon approached yours, the other keeping our shared memories in place. \"I missed you, Noctis.\"\n\nI also rp in third-person, so that shan't be a problem.",

We've had several, like when the ever malicious *Tae* came to the Universe, with an admittedly noble intent. But he threatened the safety of everyone, so people banded together to stop his plan.\n\n--&gt; Themes/Characters taken from popular series like Dragon Ball, Warhammer, God Eater, Devil May Cry and many original characters!\n\n--&gt; The ability to be (almost) any type of character. There are of course limitations, no reality warping, no time warping, etc. We also do not allow meme characters.\n\n--&gt; Large faction battles. We've had a Halo x Warhammer faction war, and several several more.\n\n--&gt; Unique character interactions. We've had such interactions like a Warhammer x Halo battle, Dante from Devil May Cry and Shadow from Sonic the Hedgehog interacting. And plenty of OCs if you don't like established characters.\n\n--&gt; A tiering system to judge character's power. While you are first limited to a low tier, you can raise your character's power over time or make a new character to fit your new tier. \n\n--&gt; While offering a welcoming and friendly community.

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm looking for someone inspired by those two video games! I would love to build a world with someone that's a small farming town rooted deeply in tradition and community. The most fun part for me is all the festivals! \n\n**I'm most familiar with A Wonderful Life and Magical Melody**\n\n**Please be open to NSFW themes!!** Even though the game isn't rated M the roleplay will be. There will be relationships, scandals, drama, angst, and more. I can fade to black or include smut, whichever you're most comfortable with.\n\n**kik and discord** possibly reddit PMs too?? Seems interesting!!\n\nI have two plot ideas: \n\n**1.** We follow the game's inheritance plot, with a new farmer moving into the village after a family member passes away. The other character would be a townie. Please be open to playing side characters as needed!\n\n**2.** We each start off with 2-3 townies, each developed and with a special niche job in the Harvest Moon community. Farmers, ranchers, school teachers &amp; librarians, mayor and family, stores/cafes/bar/inn, etc., and even artists, musicians, tinkerers, scientists, and more!! Characters can move in and out, the town ever flowing and changing. **You must be open to playing both male and female and at least two of: m/f, m/m, and f/f.**\n\n**If enough people seem interested, maybe we can start a group!**\n\n**I like face claims** For this, I am open to real life and drawing depictions. We don't have to use them, but just be clear if you prefer to or not. ",

I'm thinking we could use a d20 to determine how our actions turn out (but only a d20, I've roleplayed this way before and it's so much fun). I'm not sure what format to play this on, but we can figure that out later. \n\nPM me for more info and we can sort out the details.",

Once contracted you will be sent to the dream to proceed. Do note hunters, you must complete your contract or you will never wake up again, hahaha.

The night hunt is over, the beast have thinned, now the city must breathe once more.\n\nNow, sign here with your blood and try not to lose yourself to the beast. For the old blood is strong through the streets of Yarnham, and those who do not watch it will be consume by the blood. \n\nHello reddit, I'm here looking for a unique style of RP here today. If you have ever played one of the souls game or watch any videos on it, you may have heard of bloodborne. I'm looking to do a RP base on this but in a setting after the hunt is over but within the same city of Yarnham. This RP will be vastly different from any rp on here as I expect our characters to die... a lot throughout their journey. That said, no character will be over power from the start and said power will be increase as we venture further and further into the daydream of the city.\n\nIf you have any question about the world, lore or RP feel free to ask and I will answer the best I can. Other then that, I look forward to anyone who want to take this leap into madness.",

            "selftext": "**Game of Thrones: The Winds of War**\n\nIn 306 AC, the War of the Five Kings had been raging for eight years by that point. Stannis Baratheon and his forces were in the North, having collected the remnants of Robb Stark\u2019s shattered Northern Army after the Red Wedding. In the South, loyalist forces, a combination of the Lannister and Tyrell armies, along with naval forces under Euron Greyjoy, were attempting to stamp out any remaining pockets of resistance, while gearing up for an invasion of the North. However, to the surprise of both sides, the Night King and his White Walkers launched an invasion of Westeros. Setting aside their differences and power struggles momentarily to defend against the true threat, a massive force of soldiers from every corner of Westeros poured to the North to push back the Army of the Dead.\n\nHowever, Cersei Lannister, ever the opportunist, believed this was her chance to end the war quickly and easily. Thousands of Lannister and Tyrell troops, secretly held back from the fight against the White Walkers, captured Storm\u2019s End. Cersei believed the war was over. Stannis\u2019 capital was hers, and the united army could do nothing to stop her after having their numbers decimated during the War of Dawn. This was the point the tide of the war changed. Though, not in the favor of House Lannister. Sensing the time for action was now, Doran Martell and Harrold Hardyng, now of House Arryn, joined the war on the side of Stannis Baratheon and the North, now under the leadership of Jon Snow, legitimized as a Stark. Cersei\u2019s allies abandoned her, unwilling to oppose such an overwhelming force. King\u2019s Landing and Casterly Rock were captured, the Lion defeated, and King Stannis sat upon the Iron Throne.\n\n***Game of Thrones: The Winds of War** is a brand new freeform roleplay server that takes place roughly 70 years after the events described above. It is an 18+ roleplay server, due to the graphic and adult themes associated with Game of Thrones. In addition, there is a one paragraph (5-8 well written sentences of 150 words) minimum limit for all posts. GoT:WoW offers a friendly and active staff, and welcoming players that are eager to expand their story with other literate players. As this server is just opening, there are many positions open, waiting to be filled. \n\nCome joins us, and see if you can survive the game of thrones.*\n\nhttps://discord.gg/sjURrtj",

I would like to build upon the fandom and create our own world out of it. \n\nWhat led me to this search was seeing Infinity War and coming across all the MCU themed searches here. I'm actually not all that passionate about the MCU, I just enjoy them as fun movies. Though I haven't read a comic in a decade either so the Marvel RP I would like to do would take inspiration from the various canon settings and build something with OCs out of it. \n\nI'm also open to anime fandoms but out of the popular ones here, maybe just Naruto or Bleach. One Piece or manwha like Tower of God are a few that I would love to do but there don't seem to be that many fans of those here.",

Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\n&gt; I don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n&gt; When it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\n&gt; Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n&gt; This is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n&gt; I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

            "selftext": "So, where to begin? I love Star Wars, it's hard not to when I've got so many books, comics and video games made about Star Wars! I'm a big fan of most Era's, but my favorite is the Great Galactic War - Cold War Era as mentioned above. I like it because I know a lot about it and there's a lot of opportunities for self contained stories spread through out the Galaxy Far, Far Away. From lowly smugglers attempting make a quick credit to near unstoppable Darths commanding vast Imperial armies, there are a lot of possibilities. As such, I've listed a few that I can think of below. You are not forced to choose any of these, they are just simple ideas to help get the ice broken.\n\n* Sith Perspective: On your first day on Korriban they abandoned your class in Wild Territory with no food, water, or any supplies save for the clothes on your back and the Electroblade strapped to said back. Your class of thirty was cut down to seventeen before you all made your way back to the Sith Academy. You never had it easy. Every day was a trial, dealing with sadistic teachers, treacherous students, the sands of Korriban so hit they could meet skin off bone, and the k'lor'slugs... There had been a rumor going around that some sort of Sith was coming in search of an apprentice, though how high up the chain he was depended on the person telling said rumor. He was either a Sith Lord or a Darth, though you couldn't really give a damn what he was. All you heard was your ticket out of here...\n\n* Turning: Jedi did not seek out confrontation. They were peacekeepers, guardians of those innocent under the oppressive thumb of evil. That did not mean that they could not fight, on the contrary actually, some of the most powerful people were in the Jedi Order. Back to the whole pacifism thing, you had heard the reports. Balmorra was under siege, yet despite that you were not allowed to help defend the Republic citizens inhabiting the world. You were a Padawan and you must continue your studies under your Masters tutelage. So, letting your normally calm reasoning take a backseat, you made the most logical decision of all time! You went to Balmorra, and the Republic and militia forces welcomed you with open arms.  Something was wrong though. You found yourself on the front lines and taking lives, and you found you enjoyed it. The thrill of combat, the adrenaline that came with it, the act of taking a *life.* You couldn't stop yourself from walking down the path of the Dark Side, though unbeknownst to you your internal struggle was being watched by someone who *definetly* wasn't on your side.\n\nThat's about it. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me, I'll be around for maybe an hour or so before I get some sleep, so if I'm up I'll respond back!",

            "selftext": "Platform: Discord (Preferred), Skype\n\nGenres: Adventure, Sci-Fi, Horror, Fantasy\n\nSo I'm seeking a long-term RP parter to write some with. I do original and fandom materials with equal ease. I'm a night owl, normally up between 12 AM CST and 6 AM CST most days. I'm also normally up between 12 PM and 5 PM CST. Between the two periods in the evening I have work and while I can chat or plot, I shy away from actively RPing. I try to give my partners my whole attention, and I can't very well do that while working at the same time. Plus mobile keyboards are the devil.\n\nI'm a very confident writer, having done this in one form or another since the early days of Brood War on Battle.Net. I normally do at least a paragraph; sometimes I do more, sometiems I do less. It simply depends on context of the given time. I don't expect a constant barrage of walls o' text to be exchanged, but at the very least I expect effort provided to be returned. The odd typo and what have you won't bother me, but I ask that you at least put forth a good faith effort into the spelling and presentation of things on your part.\n\nRomance, I'm flexible. I'll almost always play male characters, though occasionally I'll have the itch and play a woman. In either case, I don't have particular restrictions to who is on the opposite end of the romance. I'm also fine to talk about other details if those are sought after.\n\nI'm always happy to discuss ideas, genres, fandoms, and specifics. So if you think I'm a good fit, gimme a PM.\n\nTo provide some fandoms I'm predominantly interested in.\n\n* Mass Effect\n* Wheel of Time\n* Supernatural\n* Battletech\n* XCOM\n* Halo\n* Shadowrun\n* Kingdom Hearts\n* Exalted\n* D&amp;D / Pathfinder\n\nAnd to round it off, some genres I'm down to play with.\n\n* Post-Apocalypse\n* Horror\n* Monsters\n* Science Fiction\n* High Fantasy",

            "selftext": "Hey, hey. I'm looking for a female partner to do an in depth, gritty, and realistic RP set in the Halo universe. I just started to play the Master Chief Collection again and possibilities are floating in my head and I'm trying to get some out. I'm still new to RPing, but would love to venture out into the Halo universe.\n\nSex scenes are totally optional, but I'm not opposed to them. Also I like post consisting of at least a little paragraph. Short posts are good as well, as long as they are frequent. Knowledge about Halo is also kinda optional. Even if you know nothing I'd be ok with it as long as you are a good writer. I was never super into the books and even my game knowledge is a little rusty, but I want as little outside influence as possible. \n\nI have a broad idea of possibilities for potential storylines, but would prefer if we are non-spartan. The whole \"Spartan\" thing is explored plenty in the games, I want to get a chance to play out the experience for the common soldier. Reach is my favorite storyline because of the \"mortality\" it touches on, so think Reach as a baseline.\n\nAs long as this is up in still looking. Would love to hear from some of you!",

            "selftext": "So I'm putting the NSFW tag just to be safe but just know that it's entirely optional and doesn't need to be incorporated into the story.\n\nAs for the story itself, it isn't completely crystal on how we go about things, but the main idea would be that you're in need of help in getting better at fighting if you're to have any chance of getting into Beacon. It'll be mirroring the timeline of the show, so having watched all five volumes is important. There will be plenty of interaction with main characters throughout, and third person makes that far more manageable for that, as I'll be controlling plenty of characters just so it's easier on you. There's nothing concrete and can be flexible outside of the major events, specifically the end of volume three. Character deaths will happen in mostly the same way, though the way they die can slightly vary, but not drastically. We'd be starting off between the second and third volume as well, just so there isn't an incredibly long wait to get there. I'm not the best at explaining these sorts of things but I can promise they'll make a lot more sense after talk a bit, and promise that the responses for the roleplay will be well detailed and not as difficult to understand as this post.\n\nHopefully I get to hear from some of you soon, and just remember that this post is **always open for replies!**\n\nSee you later hopefully!",

You won\u2019t find any flying cars or sentient androids, but there\u2019s plenty of corruption, crime and counterculture. A totalitarian corporation rules over the city with restrictive laws and regulations, invasive surveillance and an army of brutal enforcement operatives. Every resident is monitored and forced into employment, in the megacity you work for the corp or you starve. \n\nSeeking to fight against this tyranny, some lash out, vandalising city property and breaking every rule they can while avoiding the watchful eye of their oppressors. Crime is rampant, but Rudie\u2019s act against the bureaucrats and CEOS on behalf of the regular folk that have grown complacent and accepting. Whether sabotaging a high-class gala or defacing monuments, they embody the resentment and hatred of the lower classes and impoverished. Leading double lives, they form cliques and crews spread throughout the megacity and hiding in plain sight. \n\nStill with me? Sound like your jam? Great! This is far from fully formed, so anyone with an interest in building a world from the ground up is very welcome. My aim is to populate the city with a host of characters, crews and landmarks. Do you just want to make some noise and cause some trouble? Thats cool too! Whether you\u2019re looking for a short, one off character driven adventure out on the streets, or a more long term plot full of twists and turns, don't hesitate to shoot me a message for more info.\n\nAny writing style is acceptable, although 3rd person is strongly preferred. I\u2019m far from a great writer so amateurs are welcome, all I ask is you are fluent in English and able to write with some level of detail.",

The idea is that magic still runs in the modern world, but it\u2019s more subtle than most expect it to be?\n\nMaybe modern Hercules does through the Disney version, or the twelve labors of any sort to get out of trouble? Or like a prophecy of some sort causes things to spiral? Or maybe even humans get integrated within the magic city?   \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ll be playing female personification of Cerberus!

I am currently an 18 year old Male who lives in California of the United States and I go by PST (Pacific Standard Time). I am a huge fan of modern day supernatural type rps. (Not the show supernatural but like supernatural based with magic, demons, such and such). Also, I am ok with smut and romance, I am not a pro but I am better than average. Anywho! Heres the premise for my rp idea! Btw It is set in the Universe of Buffy The Vampire Slayer/Angel. If you have not seen those shows I would highly recommend them!\n\nYou are the slayer, though very new. While you have had some training it has not been a lot as your watcher died quite quickly because of your incompetence as a new slayer. One night while you are attempting a patrol in a graveyard you are jumped by 3 vampires. While you hold your own you are overtaken and almost killed, however, a man saves you. Before you fall unconscious because of said injuries you watch the man dispatch of the vampires before looking at you as you fall into unconsciousness. You wake up the next morning in a house, surprisingly enough. The man from earlier walks in, noticing you're awake. However, when he reveals himself to be a vampire you attempt to slay him to no avail as he manages to disable you for a time being. He explains how he has a soul and that he never really lost it and after some talking, he agrees to begin helping you train to fight demons!\n\nI know it's not the best starter but I have never been very good at them! Anywho, if you like it please MSG me or start a Reddit chat with me to get my discord info as I can not share it in comments or posts because Reddit people are overprotective.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I am looking to do a literate to advanced-literate Game of Thrones RP with someone 18+.\n\nLiteracy: While a novella is too long, writing only 2 sentences is too short. Unless it is dialogue and the character is standing completely still and not emoting at all like a robot, you can make it more than a few sentences.\n\nScheduling: I can post +3 times a day if it happens to be a lighter day for me, but life happens. I get it. I expect at least one post from you a day unless you are going through a life or death situation. You feeling a bit ill should not hamper your RP abilities. If you feel that once a day is too restrictive, leave now.\n\nContent: I prefer to play straight male characters, and I expect my partner to play a straight female. However, I do not force romance or smut between characters, as I feel that romance needs to naturally evolve between two characters. I also follow book canon, but can adjust to show canon if necessary\n\nPlot: I am most flexible with plot, and will compromise heavily on plot points. I have RP'd just about every role in Game of Thrones, from Flea Bottom thief to a Lannister Lord.\n\nHere are some of my more specific interests:\n\nMargaery X Robb\n\nCatelyn X Brandon\n\nAshara X Ned\n\nOC X OC\n\nIf any of that interests you, shoot me a PM.",

            "selftext": "Hello there!  \nFor quite a time I'm on the search for a new roleplay partner, with whom I can build a OC world and one who will not disappear after a little time of playing. I know, life can be wild and we don't always know what time brings, but I'm searching a partner who is willing to build something bigger.   \n\nCurrently I'm living in Europe, this means my timezone is the CET one. I would prefer my partner living in this timezone, too, but I experienced other zones can work also, when the time rhythm of both fits.  \nI really like to do the roleplay synchronous. Which is the reason, why I prefer my own timezone. I don't like the dripping, two times a day replies, rather I like intense sessions. This means, I don't have to play everyday, but several times a week for a few hours.   \n\nI like to do 1 -  2 paragraphs replies, of course this varies with the situation and I also do shorter ones when it fits. I just don't like partners who are doing short and insignificant replies which don't drive the story. My partner should be able to come up with new ideas and drive the plot with me eagerly.\n\nThe setting I was thinking of was a medieval, fantasy one. Long time ago I've created a world with various races and kingdoms. I really want to do several story's in these kingdoms, using different characters. I don't have specific plots yet, but I'm looking forward to craft some with you!  \nI also like scifi setting a lot! But for this theme I don't have an idea yet, so when you have something in mind, just write your idea and we can talk about it.\n\nMy preferred medium is discord, but I'm also open to something new. But not kik, I like to do rp on a keyboard and kik is not the right thing for this. Email is also difficult for synchronous RP I think.\n\nIf you read this to this point, just write me a pm. Then we can talk about our future play and if we fit!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello, I am looking to do a literate to advanced-literate Game of Thrones RP with someone 18+.\n\nLiteracy: While a novella is too long, writing only 2 sentences is too short. Unless it is dialogue and the character is standing completely still and not emoting at all like a robot, you can make it more than a few sentences.\n\nScheduling: I can post +3 times a day if it happens to be a lighter day for me, but life happens. I get it. I expect at least one post from you a day unless you are going through a life or death situation. You feeling a bit ill should not hamper your RP abilities. If you feel that once a day is too restrictive, leave now.\n\nContent: I prefer to play straight male characters, and I expect my partner to play a straight female. However, I do not force romance or smut between characters, as I feel that romance needs to naturally evolve between two characters. I also follow book canon, but can adjust to show canon if necessary\n\nPlot: I am most flexible with plot, and will compromise heavily on plot points. I have RP'd just about every role in Game of Thrones, from Flea Bottom thief to a Lannister Lord.\n\nHere are some of my more specific interests:\n\nMargaery X Robb\n\nCatelyn X Brandon\n\nAshara X Ned\n\nOC X OC\n\nIf any of that interests you, shoot me a PM.\n",

            "selftext": "Hi. First off I prefer to only RP in Reddit PM. ***NO DISCORD, SLACK, KIK*** Email and Google Docs is negotiable, but not preferred because I tend to forget or don't have access on my phone all the time. PM is definitely best for me as I won't forget to check it. \n\n***YOU MUST BE OVER 18. It's a legal thing, soz.*** \n\n***NOT LOOKING FOR SMUT RP. It might come up, but I don't look for it.*** This doesn't mean I won't do it, but I don't want a Smut RP (tm) exclusively.\n\nI've been RPing for a long time. I play both OC and canon characters.  I tend to stick to non-male characters. I don't care what you are IRL! \n\nI'm in the US but am usually up for about 18 hours a day so I reasonably can say I can work with whatever time zone. If you'll respond once a day, please try to make it more than 1-2 lines, a paragraph or two would be great. I probably won't be able to check/write more than one or two times a day but I'll endeavor to make it more. \n\nPlease don't make me wait 4-7+ days between replies. If you're going to be busy just tell me, but I've had about 8-10 contacts and over 60% of them act like they're interested and then poof... Even though they are still busy on reddit and can read their PMs. \n\nFandoms I'm interested in:  \n\n* Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them  \n* Divergent  \n* Battlestar Galactica  \n* Vampire Academy  \n* Hunger Games    \n* Doctor Who (Not 11, would love to play my Rose against 9/10)  \n* Star Trek  \n* Hamilton  \n* Wicked  \n* RENT    \n* Game of Thrones (Margaery for me, please.)  \n\nThings I've played a lot of:\n\n* Percy Jackson  \n* Harry Potter (Prefer OCs, **no Marauders era/characters. Not a fan of the Gryffinfandom, which is at least 50% of the Potterverse**.)\n\nIf you'd like to RP with me and I don't have it listed, please feel free to enquire.\n\nSome things are going to be out, including most new Video Games (i simply don't play anymore) and most new anime as I don't watch it. Thanks. :3",

The characters involved will all be original and the story takes place a decade after the manga/anime.\n\nAs mentioned in the title this will have a romance element between two new male students at UA. I'm totally fine with it being NSFW though it's not a requirement in the least. The only things I ask is that you be semi-active and post more than a single line. Outside of that I really don't mind what kind of character you play.\n\nDrop me a message and we can work out the details!",

            "selftext": "Good morning, all. Thanks for the click. Hopefully, it'll be worth your time.\n\nObviously, I'm craving a good, strong Voyager RP. It was one of the first things I ever did RP for when I was a kid, and it's been the love of my life since I was seven years old (take my word for it - that's a long time; it hadn't even finished airing yet), and oh, I want to write for it again.\n\nI'm only interested in Voyager; I have no desire to explore any other Treks, even in crossover fashion. We can either set this during their time meandering around the Delta Quadrant, or we could explore the happenings directly after they get home - or we could even do something twenty or so years later. I'm completely down for anything, so long as I get to play with the world and characters of the show that's been one of my favorites since I was in second grade. \n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am a professional proofreader. I'm nitpicky for a living, and it's ruined me for being a nice person. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I'm not into those blue NSFW things. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories don't have gratuitous \"mature\" content, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think.\n\n* Despite the above, I still prefer to write with other adults. I'm not comfortable with anyone under 18. There are lines, and I'm not interested in accidentally crossing any of them.\n\n* For anything set in the Delta Quadrant or directly following \"End Game,\" I will be playing Kathryn Janeway. I would very much like you to at least double as Chakotay for me (I do not support the C/7 pairing and will only accept J/C). In return, I can and will double as any canon of your choice. OCs are all right with me. Conversely, as mentioned above, I'm open to something about twenty years later - in that case, I'll be playing my own OC, J/C's spitfire, contrary rebel of a daughter.\n\n...I think that's enough word vomit.\n\nSo! If you're interested, I very much encourage you to PM me, so we can see if we mesh! Please note that I DO NOT respond to comment replies left here under any circumstances, so please use the PM function. \n\nThank you!\n\n~Kisa",

I highly recommend seeing if it piques your interest!*\n\nFor as long as Conludia's 8 kingdoms have stood, the tradition of Guardianship has continued. As a powered human, devoting your life in service to your liege was considered the ultimate honour - though nowadays, perceptions can vary from contempt to fear. \n\nThus, it is no longer customary for every royal to appoint Guardians upon ascending the throne. That is, until a series of suspect Guardian disappearances was recently uncovered. In the wake of this revelation, that something could be taking out some of the most powerful individuals known to man, each kingdom has rushed to appoint more Guardians to allay their panic. \n\n\n###HIGHLIGHTS\n* **Leave a legacy**: Brand new roleplay means that you get to shape the world and direction of the plot!\n* **Flexible &amp; Inclusive**: Play however you like. Want dice rolls? Only enjoy small threads? All (rule-abiding) styles are welcome, and the mod team would love to help facilitate your particular style. \n* **Literate roleplayers**: However, the RP is semi-literate, based off quality standards not word minimums\n* **Beginner-friendly**: as Admin, I want to make it simple for anyone to join and have fun! There are [clear guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/royalguardianrp/wiki/beginners_guide) and you can take as long or as little as you like when it comes to character creation or plotting. Want to jump right in? Both premade and original characters are available!\n\n###MORE INFO\n* Not an 18+ roleplay; mature subject matter (explicit sexual content, detailed gore) must be marked NSFW\n* Application must be accepted prior to role-playing\n* Weekly activity checks (at least 2 posts a week)\n* Private threads and plotting is encouraged to increase intrigue\n* [OOC sub](/r/royalguardianooc) used to help structure the RP, make suggestions and shoot the breeze\n\nSince we have newly revived the roleplay, now is the perfect time to jump into /r/RoyalGuardianRP and make your mark on both Conludia and its meta!\n\n\n\n&gt; ##go forth and become legend.",

            "selftext": "For some reason lately I\u2019ve been craving a lengthy, story focused Mass Effect RP. I\u2019ve done several in the past, but it\u2019s been such a long time since I\u2019ve had one. Other sources have been less than good for this sort of thing. So this is actually my first post here. \n\nMy base idea is to have it set after the end of Mass Effect 3. We can alter whatever choices we want to something we agree upon. I have nothing set in stone. Typically, I do keep Shepard dead at the end. But I\u2019ve altered that before, so it\u2019s really up to us. We have basically unlimited freedom to alter things as we want to fit what we plan out. I\u2019m deliberately leaving this very, very open. I\u2019ve tried shoehorning things specific ways and it usually doesn\u2019t work out. So I\u2019m trying this approach. \n\nOne of my favorite characters to play as in Garrus. I\u2019ve played as him numerous times and basically have him down rock solid. His story is one of those that should be continued, honestly. He deserves so much more. \n\nAs the title tag states, this will most likely end up wit some adult content. I typically base this type of RP around a pairing. So I really, really stress that only 18+ for this one. Other than that, message me and we can go from there. Hope to hear from someone soon!",

            "selftext": "### Realm of Angarak\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What is Angarak?\n---\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What makes it unique?\n---\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What are the 'requirements'?\n---\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### Tl;Dr\n----\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj",

            "selftext": "We are a relatively small but dedicated roleplay community located on the game of minecraft. We use this platform for it's easy world-building properties and ability to easily immerse yourself into a variety of places and genres.\n\n  As the title suggests we are based in the fallout universe, and in the city of New Orleans where we have replicated ruined versions of landmarks from the real life version of New Orleans for your viewing and roleplaying pleasure. \n\n  If you are not familiar with the fallout universe but are still interested in the concept. Check out this video here that will prep you for our lore and what is general knowledge your character would likely know.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abdqo4v4NLQ\n\n  We've handcrafted lore to fit the city of New Orleans within the fallout universe and to immerse you into a world fully-fleshed out so you can roleplay your character to your heart's content. If you are interested you can check out our forums or hit us up on discord(found on the forums) for more information, our team will be more than happy to talk to you about it until you are satisfied.\n\n  How does roleplay work in minecraft you ask? Simple, plugins. Our plugins allow for rolling (A dice or basically a random number generator) a character card storage (Name, age, description, stats.) and the ability to restrict how far you can hear. So whenever you say something in chat only those relatively nearby can hear you(Dependent on if you are in local or the out of character global chat). For those who own minecraft and enjoy roleplaying I truly believe it is one of the best platforms out there for this and highly recommend you try it out.\n\nIf interested you can check out our minecraft forums post and apply via the link there! \n\nhttps://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers-java-edition/pc-servers/2902506-fallout-new-orleans-post-apocalyptic-rp-whitelist\n\n\n                              -Many Thanks,\n                                          Fallout New Orleans Staff Team\n\n\n",

I would love to build a world with someone that's a small farming town rooted deeply in tradition and community. The most fun part for me is all the festivals! \n\n**Please be open to NSFW themes!!** Even though the game isn't rated M the roleplay will be. There will be relationships, scandals, drama, angst, and more. I can fade to black or include smut, whichever you're most comfortable with.\n\n**kik and discord** possibly reddit PMs too?? Seems interesting!!\n\nI have two plot ideas: \n\n**1.** We follow the game's inheritance plot, with a new farmer moving into the village after a family member passes away. The other character would be a townie. Please be open to playing side characters as needed!\n\n**2.** We each start off with 2-3 townies, each developed and with a special niche job in the Harvest Moon community. Farmers, ranchers, school teachers &amp; librarians, mayor and family, stores/cafes/bar/inn, etc., and even artists, musicians, tinkerers, scientists, and more!! Characters can move in and out, the town ever flowing and changing. **You must be open to playing both male and female and at least two of: m/f, m/m, and f/f.**\n\n**If enough people seem interested, maybe we can start a group!**\n\n**I like face claims** For this, I am open to real life and drawing depictions. We don't have to use them, but just be clear if you prefer to or not. \n\n\n",

            "selftext": "(Hey there! Sorry to the people who had already responded to my previous posts that I either didn\u2019t respond to or seemed to drop, there\u2019s been a couple health issues going on. But now I\u2019m back at it!)\n\nA couple days ago you had received a peculiar letter in the mail, which read as follows:\n\nApril 13th, 1874\n\nSalutations! My name is Benjamin Howard, ~~self-proclaimed~~ world famous archaeological adventurer and captain of the mighty skyship, the S.S. Everdale! If you are receiving this letter, than a mass congratulations is in order as you have been accepted to be a crew member aboard my skyfaring vessel for our newest expedition! Whether your skills lie in combat, tinkering, cooking or machinery, we welcome you aboard with open arms! *(Unless you\u2019re in fact, a dentist, as dentistry is a **lie.**)* \n\nNow before we did into the expedition plans, you *must promise to never let these details escape your lips!* If this information gets out, we may easily have some competition during this expedition, or even worse; the government may discover my several acts of *tax evasion\u2026* \n\nNow then, to start, several expedition logs from several explorers and cartographers in the continent of South America have been recovered by yours truly, and the supposed findings of these explorers is immense! Apparently, they came across a massive ancient civilization located in the Brazilian rain forest, presumably in possession of a mysterious power source\u2026 *(Which of course, surely is nothing when compared to the power of steam, but it still strikes my intrigue.)* Our mission then? Well as an archeologist I knew it was my duty to uncover the truth of this civilization, (And to some extent, uncover what treasures lie within.) and as such, I knew I needed a proper crew! Just keep in mind, this will more than likely be a bizarre and dangerous mission. Many of you will perish, but that is a sacrifice **I** am willing to make for the sake of preserving history!\n\nBelow, me and my colleges have made a step by step flawless plan that will surely lead to our success! \n\n*(Underneath was a small list of bullet points, clearly hastily written down, making it barely legible)*\n\nTravel to ~~North~~ South America.\nUncover location of civilization \n???????????\n **Profit*\n\nWe will be departing on the twenty-third of April at the Rivington Docks. Being along any possessions and/or pets you feel necessary for such an expedition, as it could easily last a couple of months, depending on the weather our ship encounters. We\u2019ll be happy to bring you aboard, and remember, there is a 36.7% mortality rate on board! \n\nTell no one! \n\n~Benjamin T. Howard \n\n\n(Hey all! Thanks for taking the time to read through all this, I hope I caught your eye! Now as you can probably assume, I\u2019m looking for a partner who would like to embark on a high octane, quirky steampunk adventure! I\u2019m open to just about everyone, just keep in mind that  If you\u2019re  interested in doing a romantic sub plot, I\u2019d prefer to only carry it out with females. As for the plot as side characters, I\u2019ve already got a good amount planned for this rp, but I am completely open to any and all suggestions! \n\nNow I know some people are very specific on their interpretation of steampunk, so I\u2019ll give my two cents about it. To me, it\u2019s always seemed like a sci-fi fantasy genre. What does that mean exactly? Well think of by comparing Star Trek and Star Wars, both of which are science fiction, yet handle their explanations a bit differently. In Star Trek, a hard science fiction, an idea is presented and is then explained and described in all sorts of sciencey mumbo jumbo, whirl in Star Wars, a scifi fantasy, an idea is presented, and the whole universe just kind of goes \u201c*Just\u2026 Just don\u2019t think too much about it, okay?*\u201d \n\nSo for any elements you want to add for your character or the world, so long as they match the theme of strampunk as a whole, I don\u2019t mind at all! And since this also has a big theme on adventuring and whatnot, (think of this as a mashup of steampunk meets Indiana Jones) I am perfectly fine with small magical items, preferably in the shape of some sort of ancient artifact and such. \n\nAll I ask for is someone who is fairly literate, and can easily put a lot of emotion and passion behind what they write. I\u2019m not too picky, but if u txt lik this, then it definitely won\u2019t work out. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to send a private message\u2019 I hope to talk to you soon!) \n",

More like, Zeus is famous for his block parties in the city, Hades runs a underground criminal drug ring, Aphrodite runs a upscale beauty salon, etc. etc.? The idea is that magic still runs in the modern world, but it\u2019s more subtle than most expect it to be?\n\nMaybe modern Hercules does through the Disney version, or the twelve labors of any sort to get out of trouble? Or like a prophecy of some sort causes things to spiral? Or maybe even humans get integrated within the magic city?   \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ll be playing female personification of Cerberus!

It would be focussing on a romance, with our two characters against the world.\n\nI would love for this to take place in universes from games, an examples being the Overwatch, Pok\u00e9mon, Zelda, Fire Emblem or Metroid universes. If you have any other ideas of worlds/timeframes that you want to have our RP take place in, please let me know! I'd be more than happy to hear your thoughts.\n\nThe Characters we would play would most likely be OCs of sorts that fit in the universe. This would be like an Pokemon trainer or an OVERWATCH agent. That's not to say the other options of an OC with an actual character (Link and an OC) or two actual characters (Genji and Mercy) having a romance together.\n\nIf you are interested in the RP Prompt, then I ask you to send me a little message declaring your age and name along with an Idea or two for the RP. \n\n**ONLY LOOKING FOR 18+**\n\nWe would be doing this via Reddit PMing so I can't wait to see some red envalopes in my mailbox today and I hope we can write an awesome RP together!\n\nThanks for Reading!\n\n-Chris",
