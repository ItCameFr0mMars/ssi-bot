I recently got more time on my hands so I\u2019m able to reply very frequently!\n\nOn to my ideas! I have a lot of ideas but I have a handful that I want to do the most. \n\n1). Human falling for a vampire. A world where there\u2019s vampires, werewolves, ghouls, you name it! Either or may be the vampire. A scenario in which we meet could be during a hunt. Details can be discussed on whichever platform we select. \n\n2). Super powers! I\u2019ve been dying to do a role play in which the both of us have powers. It could be whichever powers we choose from and how we meet can be determined too. It could be in a school, at a workplace, or just out and about!\n\n3). A good old fashioned romance. Human and human. Meeting could take place at school or work and we slowly talk more and fall in love. Drama can be added in it as well. \n\nThese are just a few of my ideas. Of course your ideas can also be considered and maybe we can create a new one! \n\nAgain, I have more time on my hands so I\u2019ll be able to reply frequently. I\u2019m searching for somebody long term so please take this seriously. \n\nI can do first or third person first person. It does not matter to me. I use both discord and Kik. I look forward to hearing from you soon!",

That\u2019s basically the environment we\u2019ll be in. For the rp you can be anything human, alien, robot, cyborg, anything that fits the theme as long as you play as a female. The roleplay will be story driven and will only include smut when it\u2019s to add something to the story so don\u2019t expect smut ever 5 mins. \n\nIf you made it this far read this before you go to my user. Please make your first message catches  my attention, tell me a bit about yourself or anything you\u2019d include in an introduction of yourself.",

            "selftext": "\u2018Long ago magic ran wild through the lands of Vettra; natural and free as it was meant to be. It coursed through the earth and all living things, it was only a matter of time before Man discovered their ability to control this natural force. Wars were fought amongst the different tribes of Man, each one vying for complete control over the others. As the wars grew in the ferocity and damage, the other inhabitants of the land were drawn out of hiding and brought into the fray. As the tribes of Man marched from the North; the Dwarves from the East; Elves from the South; Witches from the West all converged in the heart of the land. A great and terrible war was fought, blood on all sides covered the land, corpses piled high and no foreseeable end was insight. As a last ditch effort the Witches of the West used all of their resources and magic to call forth a creature of great and terrible destruction; The Shade. Death and destruction followed, the armies of all sides suffered terribly, no sun reached the land; an eternal night seemed to stretch out across all of Vettra, the war ceased after three days of terror, death, nightmares and plague. Unfortunately for the Witches, The Shade was unable to be called back and thus wreaked havoc across the land, until seemingly it disappeared. Left in its wake the inhabitants of Vettra vowed to never again let their greed and pride get the better of them, they signed the Peace Accords, the leaders of Man, Elf, Dwarf and Witch stayed behind to settle a new city on the blood stained battle ground; thus New Vitas was born. The remaining survivors retreated back to their respective lands, as New Vitas grew, resentment and accusations of guilt were directed towards the Witches. The leaders of Man, Elf and Dwarf banished the Witches to the low lying fields beyond the walls of New Vitas, to settle their own refuge; Malignitas. \n\nAs the years marched on New Vitas grew from the humble settlement into a beacon of new beginnings and prosperous ventures. All races came from the farthest corners of Vettra to start a new life for themselves. But as New Vitas grew so did Malignitas; it morphed from the exiled lands of Witches, to the slums of New Vitas. The poor, lowly and unfortunate were sent there to scratch out a meager existence; slowly the Witches clawed their way back into the good graces of the other founding races, in the absence the Orcs, Faeries, Half-Breeds and some of the more unfortunate members of the other races. Centuries passed, and the city and it\u2019s smaller sister grew and forged together; though the disparity between the two never resolved. Time led the city into a new age, blending magic, science and technology into a new resource known as MagiTech. New Vitas was now, more than ever, a diamond in the heart of Vettra, steel and glass skyscrapers towered over the heads of the city\u2019s denizens, New Vitas and Vettra have entered their Modern Age.\u2019\n\nAsher threw the book into the dumpster where he found it, he rolled his eyes as he read and realized just how sanitized the history of New Vitas had become. He looked around him, taking in the dirty scene that surrounded him; Malignitas, or as it was known today Spite, was the same sleazy slum it had been ever since he could remember. Sure Witches were free to move about and live freely, just as the other races were but the old prejudices were still there. Not fully realized any more but just under the surface of everyday life, some days he could pass as human; only when his violet eyes were revealed; the distinguishing trait between Witches and Humans, did the old hatred begin to boil.\n\nAsher checked his phone, still no text, he lit a cigarette and leaned against the wall and waited. He\u2019d been waiting in this alley for nearly an hour and his contact still hadn\u2019t messaged him. He poked his head out around the corner, the sun was setting and still no sign of Kur, the giant green Orc. How hard would he be to find? Still Asher waited, he had nothing else to do tonight, eventually Kur would show up and if he didn\u2019t well then Asher would walk away with a significant amount of money still in his pocket. As his cigarette burned down Asher heard the one sound that was sure to send shivers down his spine, sirens. The police were on the way, he held his breath and pushed himself against the wall, somehow trying to blend in with his surroundings, but it was all in vain. The cop cars were blocking the only way out and Asher was left to deal with the consequences, two Orcs stepped out of the one car; big, muscular, greenish grey skin stretched over a thick frame of bone and sinew. Each one had sharp lower tusks that thrust upwards about an inch, their uniforms were snug effectively showing off their muscle mass and the insufficient funding of the local police.\n\n\u201cCome on out! We got you surrounded, Kur sold you out.\u201d one of them shouted.\n\n\u201cFuck...of course he did,\u201d Asher whispered to himself, \u201cWhat...what if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d he shouted back.\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019re gonna take you in, using as much force as we feel is necessary.\u201d A sick twisted glee creeping into the Orc\u2019s voice.\n\nAsher sighed, \u201cI\u2019m coming out with my hands up. I\u2019m peacefully complying with your demands, no funny business.\u201d\n\nHe walked towards the cops, his hands raised above his head, in the back of his mind he cursing Kur and the two cops in front of him. Not only did the transaction fall through, but now he was getting arrested and possibly going to endure the worst beating of his life. Orcs weren\u2019t the biggest fans of Witches, but then again not many were. As he reached the sidewalk Asher felt the full weight of two Orcs come down on him. His chest met the sidewalk and all the air was pushed from his lungs, he felt the arcanium had cuffs; no doubt inscribed with ancient Dwarven runes to negate magic on his wrists. He was dragged to his feet and led roughly to the backseat of the waiting cop car, where he was thrown into and taken away towards the heart of New Vitas.\n\n\n\n\nHours went by in the holding cell, Asher sat staring at the arcanium bars, the same Dwarven metal as his handcuffs glowing red with Dwarven runes, his magic would be useless here; he looked around at his cellmates. An Orc that was tattooed with tally marks up and down both arms, notating how many kills he had, three Elves that looked as though they were strung out on some kind of drug and a rather rough looking Human who was napping against the wall. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHey there, thank you for checking out my post and showing some interest in my idea! So what I'm looking for is someone that has a great imagination, is literate and knows how to tell a story and work off of someone else. I'm looking for someone to be in it for the long haul, I want to take this story as far as it can go and see where we end up. \n\nSo as the title suggests, I'm looking for a possible MxM relationship, be tween my character and yours, though I want it to be natural and work with the story,as for who you play that's totally up to you! Wanna be an Orc, an Elf, a Human, Dwarf, Fae or Witch? Totally fine with me! Just make sure they'd fit the plot of the story and have some kind of background set up for them.\n\nAs far as the starting point I figure we can start right where the prompt ends and go from there. My preferred method is to chat and set up some stuff on Discord and then RP on Gdocs. Not only am I looking for a partner I wanna make friends too! So lets get to know each other while we create the story! Feel free to message me and we can set something up!\n\nIf this sound like something you're into and you want to give it a shot",

It is reminiscent of the 50's, with rich architecture and housing. However, it has deteriorated over the years, and now is just a faded image of what it use to be. It use to thrive as a tourist location, but after a long run, it seems to have vanished from the eyes of society. People will tell you that the reason the town is so scarcely populated these days is because of the seemingly supernatural occurrences of the town. But is that really true, or just the crazy speculations of the townsfolk?",

There\u2019s rich history surrounding the small town, where everyone knows everyone. Among the majority population of regular humans, there\u2019s vampires, psychics, thralls, ghosts, and werewolves. There\u2019s a weird eerie feeling throughout the whole town, like maybe the scary stories people tell about it are true. Something else goes on aside from the promising local storefronts and family businesses.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to it than that. \nWe\u2019re looking for any literate 3rd person writer with a minimum age of 18 to come join our universe and create an original character to write in it with. \nIt\u2019s novella style writing, and there are about 20 people already in. Of those 20, maybe 5 or 6 have actually made a character though \ud83d\ude02.\nAnyway, comment below or message me for the link to the chat if you\u2019re interested!

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to DM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have. Firstly, a few important notes about me and what I'm looking for.\n\nI roleplay in first-person. Your choice in point-of-view doesn't matter to me at all, I'm fine with whatever you pick!\n\n**I want you to be the DM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\n---\n\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, **please send a PM to /u/LordDurand and we can discuss further. I will not reply to PMs sent to this account.**\n\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\n\n**KonoSuba**\n\nMy character would be a member of the Adventurer Guild in the world of KonoSuba, though he could either be a native there or end up there like Kazuma. The RP could be entirely OCs or have canon characters, though I'd prefer canon characters to be in it, whether on their own or with OCs sprinkled in (especially since I'm absolutely in love with Megumin).\n\nI do have one idea for the story that's pretty far detached from the story and structure of the show. My character would be a native to the world, or at least someone who's been there a long time. He'd be a monster hunter who runs a restaurant. He goes out and hunts monsters solely to supply meat for the restaurant. It'd be a mix of a restaurant management type of thing, as well as having a lot of monster hunting. He could also take on quests for people, in exchange for getting to hire them as employees (either working as party members or in the restaurant). There could even be sections where he travels to other places to set up more restaurants or to hunt exotic monsters.\n\nOf course, if you aren't a fan of that, we could have the more standard fare of an adventurer and his party taking on quests and exploring the world. In that case, it might be more interesting to give the entire RP a road trip vibe, instead of having it take place around a central hub.\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**\n\nThis would work best in a completely alternate Universe from any of the Parts, but versions of the canon characters could still appear. However, if you'd rather have it set in a canon Universe, or even during one of the Parts, that'd be fine too. For setting, I think either a school setting or some kind of grand adventure (like Parts 3 and 7) would work best.\n\nFor the school setting, my idea is that there's a boarding school for people with supernatural powers (Hamon Users, vampires, Stand Users, Spin Users, etc.). However, all the students are competing with each other, for the person who graduates at the top of their class will receive the prized possession of the school: the Requiem Arrow. In order to reach the top, many students have taken to trying to eliminate any competition they face. The school itself could have a secretive history and purpose that can be revealed over time.\n\nAs for the grand adventure setting, I was thinking maybe a pirate-esque thing, where the world is flooded and my character and his party are sailing the world in search of something. This one would need a lot more work though, since the idea I have is pretty rough.\n\n**Dragon Ball**\n\nThe idea I had for this one is actually heavily inspired by one of the Parts of JoJo. My idea is that, in the far-future of the main series (or in an alternate universe), the dragon balls become closely guarded to prevent anyone unworthy from making wishes. Each of the dragon balls is held by a Keeper. Every year, the Keepers set up a world-spanning event, where everyone is invited to participate. All participants gather at one place, at which point the locations of all seven Keepers is revealed to them. From then on, it's a race to not only reach the various Keepers, but to pass their tests in order to obtain their dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are taken from their Keepers, the location of a hidden shrine is revealed to everyone who has at least one of the dragon balls. The dragon balls only work when gathered together at this shrine, drawing all the holders to one spot for a final battle.\n\nI think this idea would be great in terms of character development. All characters would be working towards the goal of having their one wish granted while on a long journey, giving them plenty of time to develop. I'm thinking that before the race begins, some time can be spent showing the main characters training for it. Maybe they're training together, or maybe they're miles apart and only meet for the first time at the starting point of the race.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\n\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.\n\n**Persona**\n\nRecently picked up Persona 5 and am loving the style and story. I really like the concept behind it, where the worlds the main characters fight in are representations of people's inner darkness, so I think something similar to that would be great. I've got two ideas regarding that.\n\nMy first idea is focused on dreams. In our world, dreams are formed based on a person's memories. The more negative memories a person has, the more horrifying their dream worlds appear, and the more horrifying their personality and way of treating people is. The main characters are able to enter these dream worlds to learn more about the dreamer, and when they reach the end, they're able to implant new memories or remove old ones for the purpose of making the dreamer's mind be more at peace and turn them into a better person. I think this'd be a great way to explore the human psyche and how our memories shape who we are.\n\nMy second idea is based on technology. 'Cyberspace' is an actual world, and each person who makes use of digital technology has their own personal Cyberspace. Their Cyberspace is formed by everything they do online: the interactions they have, the things they install, the things they download, the stuff they look at and search for, and so on. It's not linked to a specific device either, but instead to any piece of technology they ever use. Thus, these Cyberspaces reveal a lot about people, particularly about the things they do in secret and want to hide from the world. Our main characters can infiltrate Cyberspaces and upload any information they find from there into the real world. But at the very end of every Cyberspace is the worst things people have done online that could destroy their career if ever leaked. Our characters would have the choice of threatening the owner of the Cyberspace, or simply leaking the information to the public and watching their life fall apart.\n\nIf you have an idea besides those though, I'm always happy to hear it!",

            "selftext": "In the beginning there was only light and darkness. It was a balance for you could not have one without the other. The creatures and races of the sun frolicked in the sun and the warmth it offered. The creatures and races of the moon bathed in its eerie light and how it would illuminate the darkened dwellings. Nothing can last forever. For centuries there was peace and happiness. Little by little a darkened evil started to rear its ugly head in the far reaches of the realm. Except it was not a product of darkness but rather of light that slowly gave way to an evil nature. Wanting reign over all the Kingdoms that washed over the realm. Control over all the races to manipulate in their own gain. An army was quickly rising filled with those whom were called by the darkness as well. The many Kingdom know that a threat looms but have hope the light will be strong enough to not let the sway pull enough to the wrong side. The war has yet to come but make no mistake it is coming. Whose side will you be on? \n\n\nThis is a medieval fantasy group rp. We are looking for the best of the best! After having been in many groups as a member and moderate I decided to create one along with my co-creator. A world of light and dark. Good and evil. Hero and villains.\n\n\nAre you looking for an adventure of the most epic proportions? If you are then feel free to shoot me a PM and we can talk all about it. As this rp is just getting off the ground there is a lot your character can delve into. Be one of the first members to join the rp!\n\n\n*This rp will be played over DISCORD. As will many other rps 1x1 or group we do have guidelines that we would like met by each member looking to join. Listed below you will find them. If you are interested and can check every one of them off then this group might just be for you. We want enthusiastic members who are eager to play in a medieval fantasy realm!\n\n\n*Guidelines Must be 18 years of age or older. If you are not please do not respond. Please do not lie and say you are 18+ just to be part of the group. If it comes to light that you are under that age that will be an automatic boot. Must be capable of writing multiple paragraphs per post. This does not mean you have to write a novel but a 2 well written paragraph minimum is required.\n\n\n*Must be capable of sustaining multiple characters. You do not have to start off with more than one but as the rp progresses there will be other cities/regions in the realm that will need characters catered to it. Of course all characters can move around to different places and are not mandated to stay in the same place they entered in at. Please be capable of writing in the third person for this is how the rp will be done. It is more fluid that way especially given there will be many characters moving within this realm.\n\n\n*This is an 18+ group, we are all adults, don\u2019t be a dick. If you are having a clash with another member please message either the creator or the mod. We will address the situation and try to find a solution to it. Give us time though because we are busy people and have things going on outside the group. Do not take it upon yourself however to be rude, mean or hurtful because you will be kicked from the group if doing such.\n\n\n*Along with this being an 18+ group know that there could be some gorey scenes. If you do not want to read them if they do not pertain to your character that is to your discretion. Scroll past it and get a brief summary from another member. All NSFW scenes such as sex between two characters should be moved to a private 1x1 chat. While I understand romances will spark between characters it is courteous to move those scene out of the public eye. Implying they did the deed in scene in a room is fine, just keep all the juicy details private.\n\n\n*Just to emphasize and make it clear so there can be no misconstrue of words. This is NOT a RAPID FIRE group. While, yes, some members will be on more often so at times there will be rapid fire responses that will NOT be ALL the time. Please do not get bent out of shape over this matter. We have no expectations that our members be capable of going back and forth at all times of the day. Many will have jobs, families, IRL situations that crop up and can only manage a couple if not one post per day. So if you are looking for a rapid fire rp then THIS group will not be one you want to join. Please be patient and understanding of this matter.\n\n\n**TRIAL PERIOD** There will be a mandatory two week trial period for all new members. This is not to deter you from the rp in the slightest. This trial period is only to ensure the members with interest in the group are serious about wanting to be here. Two weeks is enough time to come up with a character concept, establish a backstory for them, enter them into a room and mingle with the members. This will give the administration time to see how you not only participate in the rp but how you interact with the current members. We do not want anyone in the rp that does not want to be here or is only going to give 10% effort to it. If you are more than thrilled and have a deep love of the idea of the rp and meet all expectations listed above then you will no doubt make it through the trial with flying colors. This is only to insure our group is thriving with fantastic and excited members. \n\n*Thank you for reading and we hope to hear from you soon!*\n",

            "selftext": "Greetings! \n\nI'm looking for a hopefully long term, literate roleplay. It would have slice of life as a main base, but I'd also like to add some fantasy stuff to it. For example, how all kinds of fantasy creatures that seemed to only exist in books could be living in our neighbordhood, talking to us everyday - and we wouldn't even realize it!\n\nI'm totally open when it comes to the paths the story can take. It could be either tragedy-centered (even with major character death) or more of a comedy thing. I'm very flexible when it comes to writing, though I'm more bent towards the drama side. However, be sure to keep a few things in mind:\n\n-If something happened and you won't be able to post for a few days, be sure to tell me. Otherwise I'll just think you're ghosting me or something.\n\n-Be respectful! No one likes meanies :)\n\n-It's my character, not yours. If I need to change my character to fit the plot a little better, I'll do it. That doesn't mean I'll stretch out my character just because you want it.\n\n-The story can't fully depend on me to go on, it's interesting if you shared your ideas with me as well.\n\nI roleplay via PM too, but personally prefer using Discord. If you're interested, don't be shy to send me a PM telling me your opinions and ideas :D",

I've been roleplaying for over a decade, and I can write paragraphs upon paragraphs or script-style - whatever you'd like! I find that I tend towards paragraph-style, and I write a few paragraphs at a time typically. As I said I can crank out more than that, and usually do when first getting started, but once the stage has been set, so to speak, I'm usually a paragraph to several paragraphs at a time type of gal.\n\nI work full-time in an office. I can typically reply every day or every other day, but if I'm on a roll responses can come several times a day. I will communicate any issues with my partner(s).\n\nI like original stories and fandom-based. I'm comfortable in any scenario. If you've got an itch let me know! I'll most likely be down for it. :)\n\nWarning(?): I like to chitchat with my partners. I don't want the RP to be like work. I want to be on friendly terms with my RP partner. So I like OOC chatting. I have Whatsapp, Telegram, Skype, and Google Hangouts. I have no interest in downloading Kik out of respect for my IRL relationship (because seeing a Kik app on someone's phone usually raises an eyebrow or two).\n\nAs for RP platform... I really like Discord or Google Docs through Drive. \n\nWhat I'm itching to RP: I'm always down for a solid Game of Thrones/ASoIaF or Dragon Age RP. As far as original ideas, I've got a plot idea based loosely on Mage: The Ascension (WoD) that I'd like to see to fruition. \n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

Post length for me depend on what fits with the story,I'd be happy with 2-3 paragraphs to 5-7; no one word/sentence replies please,but a few sentences while dialog makes sense.I'm new to this format but not to roleplay as a whole. \n\nI'm looking for a partner who is happy and willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. I want these character to eventually care for one another over time. Someone who isn't afraid to move the story along and create plot twists without warning. Also a good knowledge of the Star Wars universe would go a miss.\n\nTheme and genre wise. I'm looking for the roleplay to go into some dark themes(E.g. blood and death), plus a romantic element which means players 18+ is a must. Action,crime,fantasy, adventure....etc. \n\nFor your character. It's mostly up to you. I'm a big fan of unique characters that aren't just a cookie cutter version of every other character. Another point is that I'm more then happy for doubling but, me personal ain't that versed with it. Face claims are also welcome, I will be using them with my characters.\n\n\nI had a few ideas for the story. From a group of smugglers being forced to work in a crime lords employ or a band of rebel/resistance members having to covertly take down the empire/first order. I'm leaving the options vague as I would love to have a second opinion and hear any ideas you may have. I'm open to any era as I'm familiar with all of them. I'm also more than happy to steer the story as the GM.\n\n\nThanks for making it this far. Feel free to send me a message. Could you included a bit about yourself and what sort of thing you'd like to include (If you have a character idea already, send that over as well; only if you have it of course)\n\nHope to hear from you all soon:)",

Seems to be a slightly different format!\n\nNow I don't exactly have a specific roleplay in mind, but I am entirely open to ideas for the most part. I do prefer science fiction a lot more than most people seem to. I don't mind doing video game based roleplay at all. Titanfall, Mass Effect, and Halo are really the only ones that I take a big interest in unfortunately. But they do have to have an original story with non-cannon characters at play. Romance, drama, horror, mystery and action are all things I am willing to work with. \n\nFantasy and Medieval are also some classic favorites of mine. Truly I will roleplay about anything though as long as I think the characters are well thought out, and the plot is thick enough to keep it moving along at a nice pace! While post length seems to be a common request...I don't much care how long the length is as long as it befits the situation. If my partner gives me a lot to work with, I can produce a novel style post. But if it is simply dialogue then there is no need for all of that over kill. Good spelling and grammar go a longer way with me compared to how much you can cram into one posting. \n\nI am fairly easy to get along with and enjoy OOC chit chat when there isn't time for  a full roleplay. Getting to know my partner is just as important to me as a the roleplay itself. This often times leads me to be more selective than not. \n\nPlease message me if this catches your interest. ",

You could start off with a feeling that the song gives you, or say 'I want our characters to fit story that the vocals tell' or with a few paragraphs of lore. Whatever takes your fancy. You could say nothing at all, and just include a link or name to the song you've chosen.\n\nI'd say I'm open to all genres and all types of characters, but feel free to include a list of your preferences so I don't throw an idea you'll hate at you. I'm also open to all genres of songs and I promise I won't judge you for your tastes. I say that because I can feel embarrassed at some of the 'cringier' songs in my playlist. I am no music snob. \\(I mean, I'm 16.

            "selftext": "Hi there. Seeking a partner for a long-term RP set during World War II. I have a vague idea for the characters but nothing set in stone yet. I do know, however, that I want it to be a tragic romance spanning the course of the war. I want to slowly develop our characters over time and explore how the war affects them and changes them forever. As to whether or not the ending will be tragic? Well, we'll just have to see how things play out. ;) I look forward to working out a story with you and am always open to suggestions.\n\nI don't have many requirements. You don't need to be an expert on the period, just a basic knowledge of it is good enough for me. Also, please be literate. My replies are generally short, but I try to avoid one-liners. I'm also incapable of writing a novel while RPing. :P just wanted to get that out of the way. I look forward to hearing from you. :)\n\nAlso: Though the overall tone of this RP will be quite dark, there will be lighter moments as well. I am a *huge* fan of fluff and sweetness!",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\n\nLooking to play out an idea for a medieval fantasy setting. I have a general draft for the world and will go into more detail if asked. And of course, you're welcome to help with the world building. You are free to design your own OC as you see fit of course. I do plan on this being a long-term thing but with the story having an end-goal. Send me a message of what kind of character you have in mind and if you're interested in the crafting the world.\n\n\nOnly requirement is that you be 18+.\n\n\n**Writing Style and Length:** I write in the third person and length in average is around three to four paragraphs. Might be more or less depending on the required response. I enjoy writing a mixture of plot-based and character-based adventure roleplays with dialogue heavy banter between the main two characters. Romance between characters is great if it fits but isn't a necessity.  I can provide a sample of my old writing if asked for one.\n\n\n**Frequency and Medium:** I am generally good for at least one response per day at the very least. If I have free time, I might respond more. If for any reason, I'm unable to write for a couple of days, I'll let you know beforehand. As for medium, I prefer email but am open to using anything that is not mobile based. As for OOC chat, I use discord but not for the story itself.\n\n\n**NSFW?:** I'm okay with blood, gore and sex but only if it applies to the setting and the plot. Again, if it needs to be forced, then probably not worth it.\n\n\nSo if you feel you're interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you guys soon.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nDevoid",

            "selftext": "The once mighty planet of Hyperion is dead, destroyed by the nuclear holocausts which have dwindled away to legends. The husk of the planet lives on as a shadow of its former majesty, inhabited by the last remnants of its people. They are divided into petty, tyrannical kingdoms, ruled by fear, superstition and poverty. In the wastelands strange, fearsome beasts roam and lurk, preying on the vestiges of the dead planet's population. Deep in the scorched southern deserts, rumours of a stronghold of psychic mutants filter along the caravan routes, the rumours state that they plot the conquest of the planet.  \n\nFeared and loathed more than even the beasts of the wastelands are the wizards of the science cults. Men who collect the scientific artifacts of the dead civilisation which once made Hyperion its home. The legends of the nuclear holocausts say that it was the scientists who created the terrible weapons which ravaged the planet and created the living hell they now endured. The people of this dead world believe that the wizards will bring about yet another holocaust though no warlord on the face of the planet is willing to challenge the science cults.  \n\nThe planet is on the brink of collapse but some retell the old legends, they say that one will come to unite the planet and lead it into a new golden age. Are these merely fairytales or are they prophecy?\n\n\nHello, so I've laid out the general premise of the setting above. This is a bit different in that it's a mix of a sword and sorcery fantasy setting and a futuristic science fiction setting with some post-apocalypse thrown in for good measure. This is a completely original world, I've drawn inspiration from a number of quite different sources and brought them all together into what I hope is an interesting and unique setting.\n\nI'm looking for someone to write in this world with me. Someone who is able to move the story along and build the world up as the story progresses, someone who can write to a good standard (at least 2-3 decent paragraphs). I can't always post every single day but I usually get a few posts out per week during weekdays. I'm looking for someone who is 18+ as this is going to be a dark and gritty setting that will have adult themes. I only use email for roleplaying as it means I can write while I'm at work which increases my posting activity quite a bit. \n\nIf you're interested PM me and we can discuss this further. \n",

            "selftext": "**Edit: most people seem to feel sceptical about the \"varying genders and orientations\" and \"multiple characters\" restrictions below. If that's the only thing you don't like, please contact me regardless. We can work something out, and maybe I need to adjust my criteria a bit. :)**\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

No sun peaks through the thick cloud cover as you kneel there, hands bound behind your back and head resting on the rank stump soaked in the blood of criminals past. Today is your judgement day. No court could prove your innocence despite your claims that you know to be true. The nobles have called in the executioner named Sohter. Known for having the wisdom of the Lady of Death when it comes to judging those knelt before him. As you see the wine colored surcoat of Sohter you knew this was the only chance you had left for your innocence to be know. \nUnsheathing the infamous dwarven blade at his hip, Sohter raised it towards the heavens in preparation to sever your head from your body. your eyes close, ready for you undeserved fate but suddenly the light breaks through the heavens and shines down upon you.\n\n\"Yes my Lady.\" the hushed words of Sohter echo in your ears. As you open your eyes you see the blade held off to Sohter's side. \"Lady Death has declared this woman innocent!\" his voice booming over the silent crowd. \"No one is to harm her for this is the word of Lady Death!\" with a quick flick of the blade Sohter cuts clean through the cords binding your hands. \"You are free.\" Sohter sheaths the blade, turns and walks off the stone platform. \n\nI will play Sohter the executioner. A man that has been called by Lady Death as an executioner. The only thing that keeps him from sinking into depression is the knowledge that Lady Death guides him to know those who do and do not deserve his blade. When Sohter is not called by the nobles you can find him in a tavern enjoying a tankard of mead and telling stories of legends passed or singing melodies to the folk around him.\n\nyou would play the young woman that has been spared. the choice of race is yours be it elf, half elf, or human. \n\nPlease message with a primpt of your own and include a reference picture, as well as a short bio.

            "selftext": "Humanity kept reaching for the stars and finally achieved the dream of reliable interstellar flight. Yet in the process of perfecting the kind of craft that could visit another star humanity also solved the problems that would have made people want to leave. The climate was fixed and every other possible corner of the solar system was colonized. Limits to resources had been bypassed and the species experienced the bounty of a post scarcity society. In the core world's anyone could become anything, there were a few small colonies set up in the nearest world's and exploratory ships had their adventures around other stars.\n\nThere was however a need for new colonies. Not because of overcrowding. Not to spread Earthly life ahead of any cataclysm. Not for any economic need. Not for any reason given to the general public. Bit the general public no longer wanted to leave. The pioneer's had left and that left a lot of empty ships. So criminals again became the colonists of choice. A list of crimes were drawn up with a sentence of exile to a new world. In ships with hundreds of stored embryos and the ability to clone more individuals and small groups of prisoners were sent out into the galaxy. Why, what does the government know, what dangers and risks will the exiles find at the edge of known space?\n\nThanks for reading this is as you can tell a wide open prompt.I see this story as being fairly long term. The general set up is a post scarcity society conceiving a reason to establish more colonies despite the risks as far from earth as possible. The ships are meant to be small to allow for plenty of time to develop a small cast of central characters. The story could settle on one colony ship uncovering the reason for the massive yet secret exodus. It could focus on the moral dilemma of having to set up a colony on an alien world with a blank slate. Or maybe there is another angle that would make for a compelling story. I'd like to exchange a few messages over Reddit before moving to some other medium.  I look forward to writing with you.",

            "selftext": "**Hey /roleplay!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\n&gt; I am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\n&gt; I don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n&gt; When it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\n&gt; Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n&gt; below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.\n\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy \n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n&gt; As for a few I'm not for:\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\n&gt;As for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n&gt; This is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n&gt; I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

            "selftext": "The reception of the invitation to Mr. Oliver Huntington's estate for the summer did not come as a shock to Emmeline Stanton. At 21, her mother and father had frequently attempted to find a way to make a match for her and have her married off, and the invitation reeked of her parents' meddling. \n\nThey needed her to be married off and soon. The family had fallen upon hard times, and while their name still commanded respect, their coffers were nearly empty. They had enough for a dowry, but that was about it. With just one daughter and no sons, they needed her to marry soon or they might find themselves in complete ruin. \n\nMuch to her parents' chagrin, Emmeline was not interested in marriage. She knew she must do so, but for the moment she had something else she was much more interested in: her various serving maids, one of her married friends she visits with quite frequently over the summers while the other lady's husband is away, and\\-\\-for a time\\-\\-the chaperone who accompanied her to a house party the previous year. \n\nThough her parents have no idea as to why their daughter is so averse to a husband, they do know that she is one of the most eligible young ladies in the country\\-\\-as long as no one knows of their descent to the poor house. Aware that her luxurious lifestyle is at stake, Emmeline knows it would be smart to settle for a husband, and Oliver Huntington is dashing, wealthy, and well\\-bred.  Still, she cannot resist the fairer sex and can't quite bring herself to do the settling she's meant to.\n\nRegardless, she accepts the invitation to the Huntington estate and begins to arrange for her journey there, guessing that she would make her decision between happiness in the face of financial and social ruin or stability over the summer.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nI watched BBC's Regency House Party again and it always gets me super in the mood to roleplay something during the Regency Era. \n\nFirst thing's first, I don't know everything about the Regency Era and don't expect you to either. I do a bit of research here and there in any roleplay I do and I hope that you'll be willing to do something like that as well if the need arises, but as long as things are relatively accurate to the time I'm happy. \n\nSecond of all, I prefer F/F stuff. I've set the stakes for the character I hope to play and would like to pair her up with another woman. I don't care if the other woman is a serving maid, another young woman in the same sort of position, or a chaperone. The long and short of it is that I love ladies and I love a scandal.\n\nGetting to the ins and outs of the roleplaying itself! I prefer to use third person and I generally roleplay on discord or through email, but I've tried google docs and hangouts and don't mind either of those. I tend to like a partner who can respond a handful of times a day, but that being said, I am a patient girl and can handle it if you get busy or something like that. I try to match my partner length\\-wise but my intros are usually pretty long. That being said, I like to settle into 1\\-3 paragraph responses. I live in Massachusetts, so I'm working with EST. I'd like for my partner to be at least 20 years old, as I tend to roleplay a bit more mature themes.\n\nLet me know if you're interested and we can figure something out!",

            "selftext": "Hello there people of /r/roleplay! I'm grappling with a terrible craving for a modern mythological/fantasy game lately. Something with pantheons of gods long since out of religious fashion, like Odin and Zeus, Ra and Amaterasu. Think American Gods. Think Percy Jackson. Think Scion. \n\nSo the basic request here is that I'd love to play a character in the world of the Scion RPG (1st or 2nd edition is open to negotiation, I can provide PDFs), but I'd like to mostly ditch the system outside of using EXP to help build the character's power level up over time. I want to tell a story only using the system to keep the character within a decent boundary for power. \n\nI'd like to play a character starting before their visitation (perhaps opening the first scene with that occurring?). I'd like someone who can GM things, controlling the world and the NPCs and throwing the story at me. I promise to be a proactive player in that story, I will drive things along as my character would, all you have to do is give me the story hooks to chase and chase them I will! I'm open to most pairing types and content is negotiable, we can always fade to black any adult stuff, or we can get into the nitty gritty of godling smut, if you prefer. I do, however, prefer to be more story than sex heavy. \n\nI always write 3rd person, past tense, and I prefer to write via email as I can write that way during the day easier than other mediums which would need to be relegated to afternoons between work and RL social priorities. My ability to post on the weekends is very hit or miss, depending on how things pan out with my plans. That said, I write lengthy posts and have been published and am regularly told my posts are all of ample quality to make up for the occasional lapse of time between them. Ideally, my partner would have google hangouts as a way of communicating OOC, or would be able and willing to communicate, though this is not a requirement. \n\nPlease feel free to hit me up if this interests you, I'd love to talk potentials with you! \n\n~BP",

I would like to RP an original setting where we can build not only our characters but also the world itself. \n\nI like to go into an RP with very little preparation, just a setting and we wing it from their. I like to create characters as we go rather than spend a lot of time creating character profiles. I enjoy adding details to the world and characters as we go playing off each others creativity. I understand that this isn\u2019t everyone's style however if it interests you shoot me a message. The settings I\u2019m interested in are below.\n\nSci-Fi (My favourite setting)\n\nSuperhero/Villain \n\nPro Wrestling (Yeah not a common setting but one that I would love to do with the right person)\n\nFantasy (No my favourite setting but one that I would be willing to do, I would most likely need to put some sort of spin on this in order to hold my interest)\n\nPost Apoc (Another one I would be very interested in)\n\nI would like to RP over PM however willing to RP via other means too however my availability on other platforms will be limited. \n",

            "selftext": "(M21)(Discord) London, 1851. Dark cobblestone streets wrapped around the disease stricken commons, the cold air of winter nipping at the edges of the fall breeze. With a bright crescent moon high in the sky, one would not even need the flickering gas lights spotting the open streets of Suffolk. Store windows sat vacant or dirty, a few shattered panels of glass from the exploits of a rather adventurous gang of neerdowellers trying to get a rise from the Bobbies patrolling the road. But in the alleyway just outside of Suffolk, heading into Mutton Road, red was staining the grey brick, spattered along the wall. The body of a young woman, almost ripped to pieces. The smell of...sulfur in the air. Some call him Jack the Ripper. Others, the Reaper of London. But what people don't realize is...this Ripper is no human, at least...not anymore. The streets of London are tattered with inhuman aspects. Bloodthirsty creatures waiting for the perfect moment to strike, feeding on the fear of its victims before hiding back into the shadows from wince it came. A black cloaked figure, standing above the visage of the poor girl, bends down before taking a small sample of the blood slowly dripping out of her mouth. Thick gloved hands prevent any fingerprints on the crime scene, which will inevitably be researched come the morn...Before leaving however, the figure slides a snow white envelope, adorned with a wax seal depicting the head of a crow holding a leaf in its mouth. Sliding the letter under the door of a nearby house, this was to be the start of a new era of London. One ripe with much more blood, but ultimately bringing about peace to this skeletal city. This house...belonged to you. And when dawn finally comes, the start to our story finally does as well\u2026.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read. Inspired by Penny Dreadful, this story is ripe with mystery and adventure, along with just the right amount of horror. I envision London as a cesspool of dark and mysterious beings behind the curtains, pulling unseen strings and feeding on the lives of humans. Vampires, Werewolves, Demons, you name it. Why was the letter sent to you specifically? It could be because of your rousing talent with weapons or knowledge. Maybe you know a thing or two about these dark powers. Maybe...just maybe...you are one of them...If you have any questions, just ask!",

            "selftext": "As the title says I'm looking to do a DITF roleplay. Yes I know the anime isn't finished yet but I figured we could go on own path to where the last episode left off. I have an idea of my own but I would love to hear if you have any ideas or maybe we can both come up with something. I would like to do a mix of both canon and oc. Mainly looking for someone to play Zero Two or really any of the girls from the anime, no not someone similar. No I will not play Zero Two so if you're looking for that look somewhere else. I really don't have many rules expect for no Godmodding and if you don't want to roleplay anymore at least let me know and don't just straight up ditch me.\n\nSo if you're interested message me for my Discord. Also in your message post your favorite color so I know that you actually read this.\n\nAnother thing. Actually stay committed to the roleplay. I've already had a couple of people who said they wanted to roleplay only to ditch me before we even discussed a plot idea. It's starting to get real annoying and I also consider that wasting my time which I absolutely hate. That's a good way to get on my block list.\n",

            "selftext": "Once you turned 18 and started your senior year everything was suppose to get better, but it didn't. A lengthy divorce between your parents had caused you to become a shut in, not wanting to interact with other kids at school, causing you to spend most of your time alone in the run down apartment complex you live in with your mother.  \n\nSchool use to be the place where you didn't have to listen to your parents scream at each other over the phone, a place where your mother wasn't shoving her religion down your throat at every waking second but thanks to a particular group of students it's became a place of bullying and relentless torment.  \n\nLonely nights were spent sitting in the courtyard by yourself or spying on your neighbors through your telescope, countless hours of watching them do the same routine every night until one night a Taxi pulled into the complex. An older man retrieving a large chest from the trunk of the vehicle before walking through the courtyard, a young boy following behind, his hood covering his face. \n\nThe large metal door to your building can be heard slamming shut on the lower level, the faint thud of foot steps shuffling up the stairwell. \"What are the odds?\"you thought to yourself as you slowly cracked open your front door, watching the much older gentlemen fumble with the keys before opening the door to the apartment next to yours. \n\n((Looking for partner 18+. This is really just a quick prompt to give you an idea. I'm more than willing to change up the story line, reverse the rolls, anything of the sorts really! Open to any ideas, I've just been dying to do an RP based off Let Me In. I'm 100% okay with blood, Gore, and smut aswell. The darker the better. Pm me if you are interested or have any questions!))",

            "selftext": "The title says it all really. I'm driven largely on adventure-driven stories revolved around a singular character that acts as the proto-protagonist as they muck about in another person's Medieval Fantasy world whose story encompasses violence, exploration of the unique cultures, races, nations, forgotten places left in mountains and holes in the ground, as well as discovering new monsters, magics, etc. In a way, I sort of enjoy being able to describe it as a universe similar to the Witcher. A bitter, unpleasant world that's coming to a new age as fantasy and the harshness of reality bleed together to create a profoundly dark world that drafts real concepts from reality like economics, geopolitics, causes for conflicts amongst rulers where they use casus belis to flimsily give themselves cause to push for their real ambitions...so on and so on. If it's a world that can manage to make me uncomfortable, then you're probably doing something right with it.\n\nI don't care about the gender of my partner or any other circumstances related to them. It's not my business unless you care to make it; that being said, I've been at this long enough that if you're someone who self-describes themselves as a 'detailed writer,' then ninety-percent of the time ti doesn't actually mean anything. If you know how to structure a paragraph and can convey the feelings you want to get across, then that's more than enough for me. I'll provide a writing sample further down. Obligation has me say that I have no trouble with smut whatsoever, though the character I had in mind was a female with a favortism shown towards the same sex, which may very well come into conflict with the societal norms of the world, or be something entirely ignored. Either works for me, and, indeed, having sexuality be a point of tension can be quite fun if designed and plotted out well.\n\nI use Discord, Skype, as well as GMail/GDocs; message me for contact details for that.\n\nThanks to Kevin for giving the chance for this piece.\n\n&gt; His attire was the usual of his imperious self, a simple pair of pressed trousers above polished leather boots. Over his shoulders was draped a collared shirt, and a light leather jacket above it; an odd choice in the hellish waste which was the Prestor's hold. Still, the man wasn't even sweating as he stepped forward, his limp obvious, while his hazel eyes gazed down at the girl with a thousand emotions flowing through, making a single indiscernible amalgamation. Her gaze met his, and she felt just as many, the strangest among them, among the fear, the anger, the respect, was the love. Not of a woman to her man, but of a daughter to her father. The man, for his part, did not look older than thirty, making it rather strange in the looks, but she had spent centuries with him... And while she felt nothing so strong as for the princess of her dreams, it was still enough to stop her strangling him until he inevitably forced her away. Instead, she just keeps a grim, determined look, causing him to sigh, and set the cane against the table, before pulling the chair on his side out, to sit down, with some struggle, due to the weak leg.\n\n&gt; When he has situated himself in the chair, Saria's eyes following him coldly as he does, he pulls it in, resting his arms on the table as the weak leg splays out for better comfort, before his eyes finally rest on her once more. The man seems unwilling, or at least unable, to say anything, wordlessly watching her in a mutual contest of whom could maintain poise longer. And Saria wasn't willing to play, yawning fakely to break the manufactured tension in the room, before leaning forward in turn; keeping her back straight and hands held perfectly, as she finally says, her first words since she'd talked to Raven's graving into the bedside, \u201cWell. You look good. Is that a new hair style you have?\u201d Daas, despite having not cut his hair in weeks, instinctively put a hand on his head to see what she was talking about, before casting an annoyed gaze at her and sighing. \u201cCan you take nothing seriously?\u201d He asks that, after a moment, his tone matching the gaze as his hand returns to the table, which causes her to shrug her shoulders, indifferent.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhen it's worth taking seriously, yes. But unfortunately for you, you aren't worth taking seriously.\u201d His gaze hardens again, his jaw set in a manner to indicate her words had bitten as harshly at she'd expected. There was a primal pleasure in tearing down those you hated; at least to her, and there was no one she hated more. Part of her disliked that pleasure she received, but she didn't care to listen to that; not here, not now. Her mental tangent is broken by Daas' words causing her to jolt; breaking her from the trance she'd already fallen into. \u201cSaria. Are you ever going to stop acting like a child, or am I going to have to treat you like one?\u201d Her gaze casts over him for a moment, coming up with a response which he immediately understands will be sarcastic, causing him to just cradle his head in a hand as she replies with, \u201cWell, I don't know. Children don't have to think, and they get to (Whoops, censored!) until they're nice and happy. Being treated like a child sounds like a dream.\u201d\n\n&gt; Daas' eyes glare her down, indicating she had gone a step too far in the wrong direction. She felt no remorse for the man's annoyance, however, shaking her head as she cuts in, before the man has a chance to criticize, \u201cYou're the one who forced me into this god-forsaken tower. Don't you fucking dare tell me to treat you with dignity or respect; you traded yours a long time ago.\u201d Rather than further annoyance, Daas' expression turns to that of a bemused smile, somewhat forced, as he chose to simply come to her side of thought, for now, if only to warm her up for the questions he had planned. \u201cYou did, too, you know. So I suppose that makes two of us, just pigs, rolling in the mud.\u201d Saria's eyes glance at the man, finding some anger at what he'd said, at the mention of her having given in her dignity. \u201cI didn't really have a choice in the matter,\u201d her tone is far more pressed, now, and her eyes slant. \u201cYou took my dignity... Though, if we're pigs, then I suppose that one of us is magical and the other's a murderer. Sounds like an excellent story for the ages. Maybe one of these days you can say that story to the next woman you kidnap and hold here.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI'll keep that in mind,\u201d He says, softly, before leaning forward, thinking on her remark on dignity. \u201cBut you say that as if you didn't enjoy it. You enjoyed every moment, every kill, every hunt. The difference between you and I is that I don't enjoy my atrocities; and you do, Saria.\u201d The man has barely finished speaking before Saria's chair is thrown into the wall behind her, chipping away the stones behind her as she stands, glaring down at Daas, who shows no chance in composure as he watches her staring down at him with barely-contained fury from his words. \u201cYou...\u201d She says, voice shaking in the same manner as her quivering arms, \u201cYou...\u201d Nothing more came. It was true; what he said, at least about her. But the fact he'd said it, and the way he'd done it, made her want to burn the man down. But she didn't. And slowly, his arm raised, as she saw the familiar deathly black energy running along it, powered from it, as he gestures to the thrown chair. \u201cPick it up,\u201d he says, calmly, \u201cAnd sit down.\u201d",

I'm aiming for a more D&amp;D style story campaign excluding all the state and the number crunching. I will be the proto GM keeping the story going and playing the side characters and such. I will have a dice bot implemented to avoid 'god modding\u2019 and put some risk to the game. \n\nI have a story and plot to start off. This will take place between return of the Jedi and the force awakens. As for the RP info. be happy with 2-3 paragraphs to 5-7; no one word/sentence replies please,but a few sentences while dialog makes sense.This wouldn't be PG so the roleplay will be going into some dark themes which means players 18+ is a must. Action,crime,fantasy, adventure, horror....etc will all be integrated in in some way. All theme are open and I'm hoping to delve deeper into theme's star wars doesn't venture to often into.\n\nFor the character. It's mostly up to you. This is star wars so you have some many opportunities to create a unique characters so feel free to go wild with it. Face claims and images of you character are also welcome, I will be using them with the side characters. I do have a character template that I'll send over that you can fill in with all the important info.\n\nHere's a quick synopsis of the setup...\n\n\u201cSet \u00a0four years after the battle of Endor, Our campaign takes place at the fall of the empire. They have gotten very desperate which in turn has made them all the more dangerous. This has put people on edge. Common criminals and bounty hunters however are loving the shift of power. The more protection, assassination or retrieval jobs they get the happier they are. This is where are band of adventurers come in. Each play has come from all sort of different background and some may be more pleasant than others. The only thing you know is that you all have be captured by the Star kry gang on the forest planet of Bandelar and your all on your way to meet infamous crime Lord,Faylor Tusk. Each one of you have had dealing or run in\u2019s with Tusk before which may be the reason your all in this mess\u201d\n\nSo if your interested,feel free to send me a DM. Could you included a bit about yourself and what sort of thing you'd like to include (If you have a character idea already, send that over as well; only if you have it of course). Also if to have any questions about the campaign or the setting and such, please ask away.\n\nThanks for reading:)",

            "selftext": "**Game of Thrones: The Winds of War**\n\nIn 306 AC, the War of the Five Kings had been raging for eight years by that point. Stannis Baratheon and his forces were in the North, having collected the remnants of Robb Stark\u2019s shattered Northern Army after the Red Wedding. In the South, loyalist forces, a combination of the Lannister and Tyrell armies, along with naval forces under Euron Greyjoy, were attempting to stamp out any remaining pockets of resistance, while gearing up for an invasion of the North. However, to the surprise of both sides, the Night King and his White Walkers launched an invasion of Westeros. Setting aside their differences and power struggles momentarily to defend against the true threat, a massive force of soldiers from every corner of Westeros poured to the North to push back the Army of the Dead.\n\nHowever, Cersei Lannister, ever the opportunist, believed this was her chance to end the war quickly and easily. Thousands of Lannister and Tyrell troops, secretly held back from the fight against the White Walkers, captured Storm\u2019s End. Cersei believed the war was over. Stannis\u2019 capital was hers, and the united army could do nothing to stop her after having their numbers decimated during the War of Dawn. This was the point the tide of the war changed. Though, not in the favor of House Lannister. Sensing the time for action was now, Doran Martell and Harrold Hardyng, now of House Arryn, joined the war on the side of Stannis Baratheon and the North, now under the leadership of Jon Snow, legitimized as a Stark. Cersei\u2019s allies abandoned her, unwilling to oppose such an overwhelming force. King\u2019s Landing and Casterly Rock were captured, the Lion defeated, and King Stannis sat upon the Iron Throne.\n\n*Game of Thrones: The Winds of War is a brand new freeform roleplay server that takes place roughly 70 years after the events described above. It is an 18+ roleplay server. In addition, there is a one paragraph (5-8 well written sentences of 150 words) minimum limit for all posts. GoT:WoW offers a friendly and active staff, and welcoming players that are eager to expand their story with other literate players. As this server is just opening, there are many positions open, waiting to be filled.*\n\n*Come joins us, and see if you can survive the game of thrones.*\n\nhttps://discord.gg/sjURrtj",

            "selftext": "Hey r/roleplay I\u2019m looking for creative, inspired people to create with. I\u2019m a 29 year old woman living on the East coast with more than a decade\u2019s worth of experience playing and creating with others. I enjoy a variety of settings and types of roles however what I\u2019m looking for as of recently has a thread of romance regardless of genre. In romantic roles I tend to play primarily female and usually do M\\+F pairings although I\u2019ve been known to make exceptions. I don\u2019t care about your actual gender as long as your characters are believable. I don\u2019t like to censor myself so I prefer to only play with those 21 and over. Graphic sexual scenes aren\u2019t my primary focus and I prefer for them to be within the context of the wider story. \n\nIn terms of style I write in multi\\-paragraph posts via e\\-mail or hangouts but primarily Discord. If I\u2019m inspired it\u2019s not unheard of for me to write multiple page posts. I put a lot of detail and effort into my characters in the form of character sheets, outfits and even family trees when occasion calls for it. In terms of availability I\u2019m around most afternoons and early evenings for chat. Depending on the length of the post my response times can vary from several hours to a couple of days. I have an actual life that I enjoy so I don\u2019t spend every moment chained to my keyboard and expect any potential partners to have a similar outlook. Roleplaying is supposed to be fun not a chore so any snarky, badgering or harassing requests for a response will only lead to the ceasing of any roleplay. \n\nHere are some of the particular ideas that have been standing out for me recently.\n\nSlice of Life such as:\n\n**Historical Roles** \\(just about any time period but especially Renaissance, Reformation, Gilded Age, Edwardian Era. I also love alternate realities of existing historical eras\\)\n\n**Odd or Mismatched pairings** \\(this could and has taken many interesting forms from our characters being vastly different classes, Beauty &amp; The Beast style roles to one of our characters have supernatural abilities\\)\n\n**Mob or Criminal Enterprises** \\( I\u2019m perfectly comfortable being the criminal within this roleplay if you prefer but I am happy either way. You can either be a rival, a forced ally, law enforcement or even an innocent guy\n\n***I am also extremely interested in GOT/ASOIAF themed roleplays.*** However just because it isn\u2019t listed doesn\u2019t mean I am not interested. I welcome all new ideas that you may have and want to share. However copy/pasted walls of texts probably won\u2019t garner a response. If anything I said strikes an interest feel free to message me with your discord name or your ideas. I wholeheartedly look forward to hearing from all you wonderful people.  Good luck on your search.",

            "selftext": "**About me:** I can play Hermione, Luna, Draco, Ron and Ginny though the last two I tend to play as antagonists. I am seeking a Harry to my Hermione, plain and simple. I tend to want 2-4 paragraphs from my partner and 2-3 posts a week is a good enough average for me. Mature content can be discussed privately. Now without much delay, below are some possible plots. If you have suggestions, let me know. If interested please PM but given the time of the year, replies may not be immediate. Apologies.\n\n- - -\n\n**Deception:**\n\nHarry and Hermione have known each other since their first year at Hogwarts. That year they became friends and overcame several obstacles from learning Quidditch to fending off a troll in the girl's lavatory. They then found the fabled stone, then went on to the Chamber of Secrets. They uncovered the mystery of Harry's past and its ties to Sirius Black and used a Time Turner to change a dark night's events. They trained for a dangerous wizard tournament and went on to teach themselves spells in secret. Throughout all of the challenges and deadly encounters, both Harry and Hermione have remained by one another's side faithfully and without question.\n\nAnd yet...Ron grabbed Hermione's attention while Harry was busy with his own troubles, while Ginny was there to comfort Harry when he needed it. Something happened in their sixth and seventh year that pushed Harry and Hermione apart. Maybe they both realized their feelings for one another and had to distract themselves somehow? Maybe they figured their friendship wasn't strong enough to endure life's many changes and challenges?\n\nNow they're on the run from Deatheaters and spies who working for Snape as well as Voldemort. Things between the trio are shaky as they try to get clues from the locket for the whereabouts of the remaining horcruxes. Anxiety and fear swim through the air of the tent as Ron snaps and leaves Harry and Hermione behind. Hermione can't believe how things had suddenly crumbled in her hands. She doesn't love Ron, doesn't even consider going after him. In fact, it feels like a weight has been lifted from her shoulders. She feels awful and looks back to Harry who just lost his best mate too. Ron wasn't the only one making sacrifices though. Both she and Harry have suffered too.\n\nLittle do either know that Ron has gone to Voldemort to ensure his family is kept safe, in exchange for becoming a double spy to lure Harry back to the school for one final confrontation. While Ron is gone, Harry and Hermione turn to one another for comfort as they survive in the wilderness. They move from camp to camp, only venturing to muggle villages to restock supplies. Though there is danger lurking in the shadows, both souls find it difficult to hide their true feelings from one another.\n\nSince I'm not big on Ron I tend to make him change sides since I think he is near his breaking point during the final book/film and I think his friendship with Harry has been a bit rocky since their fourth year.\n\n**Complying:**\n\nIn Harry's first year, he has been assigned to Slytherin House much to his dismay. He and Draco form a friendship while Ron becomes their target for bullying. In Gryffindor, Ron builds a quick resentment to Harry Potter who seems to have everything handed to him, even somehow making Quidditch at such a young age. Meanwhile Hermione has been assigned to Ravenclaw and she does her best to stay out of trouble until Halloween when a troll is released. Hermione sees it going after Harry in the dungeons and she saves him. The two become friends, despite Draco's dislike for the mudblood. \n\nThe first year ends with Hermione, Draco and Harry finding the coveted stone beneath Hogwarts. Draco begins to learn that perhaps he may not need to follow in his father's footsteps if all he sees is misery at his own home. Draco's father insists that Draco continue to befriend Harry in order to give him up to the Dark Lord when the time is right. Draco isn't so sure about this. The stage is set for their second year as Luna and Ginny begin their first year at Hogwarts. We will juggle new dynamics, expectations and developments. If we want to work with the side roles, we can or we can jump to another year with the different dynamics of Ron, Harry, Hermione and Draco I can play Draco and or Ron or they could be shared roles.\n\n**Undercover:**\n\nTaking place in the summer of their sixth and seventh year, Harry and Hermione decide to go undercover, into hiding in the muggle world. Voldemort is quickly rising to power and Harry has run out of time. Harry feels the stress of trying to be some powerful wizard who can stand up to him. Hermione and Harry decide to go on the hunt for horcruxes on their own as Voldemort destroys everything in his path to dominate the wizard and muggle way of life in Great Britain. In the meantime, Hermione runs a bookstore while Harry helps her. They keep training and hunting in secret, trying to get the courage to finally take down Voldemort. This is more of a light, slice of life, tone than many of the others but it does have plenty of room for change.\n\n**Erosion:**\n\nIn Harry's second year, he failed to save Ginny and she died in the Chamber of Secrets. In Harry's third year, he failed to stop Sirius from being executed. And in his fourth year, he saw Cedric die. And in his fifth year, Ron's father is killed. Needless to say death seems to surround Harry and when his father dies, Ron has had enough of his best friend. Ron distances himself from Harry and demands that Hermione also wise up and do the same. She cannot.\n\nEven though Harry feels like a pawn used by Voldemort, like he's useless, he won't give up. \n\nWhen he cannot stop Dumbledore from being killed, everyone has given up on Harry and his ability to save the wizarding world. How can he be \"The Chosen One\" anyway? Harry sinks into depression as Ron stays at Hogwarts during their seventh year. Hermione sides with Harry as they go on the hunt for horcruxes together. This will be a lot more dark and depressing, I'd even like other characters to die along the way. It's likely a stretch and depends on how comfortable you feel playing Harry leaning into teenage angst.\n\n**Normalcy:**\n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione and even Draco and Luna, all return to school once it is rebuilt after the war. They try to figure out where they would all like to see their lives branch out. Ron wants to become a professional Quidditch player while Harry wants to either become an Auror or perhaps a teacher. Hermione is set on running a bookstore or teaching. While the trio try to remember what it was like to be at school without such a dark cloud hanging over their head, Harry and Hermione grow closer. While the three friends have grown up together, their values and interests have shifted, making a bit of a gap between Harry and Hermione, and Ron. ",

No questions asked.\n\n* Write solely through email, usually reply within 24 hours (may take longer on the weekend).\n\n* Don't use any messengers to roleplay, sorry about that.\n\n\nI think all of the important info is up there, so let us move on to the plot, shall we? \n\n\nBehind closed doors: Basically, this is a modern plot. My plan is to have a covertly arranged marriage. The guy is a member of a very wealthy family, and the girl is not, which makes the whole idea of marriage between them odd. Once the story starts progressing, at some point, we'll find out that the guy's family and the girl's are both involved in something big (either natural or supernatural), and his family wanted to secure her and mix their blood for the next generation before another family could. Drama, mystery, possible supernatural elements, emotional conflict.\n\n\nIf interested, please PM me! I can provide a writing sample, and would like you to provide one too, if possible! Thank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "I'm currently looking for partners who are interested in RP focused on the various comic book universes (Marvel and DC). My main preference is Marvel, but I have enough of a DC background that it's usually not difficult to work something out. As a player I'm a female, but I enjoy playing male characters, so if you're interested in playing M/M or M/F don't hesitate to hit me up! I'm comfortable playing the male opposite a female, or a female character opposite a male.\n\nI'm also in my 30s, and generally tend to get along better with older partners. If you're interested in NSFW subject matter, please be of the legal age to view sexual content; I'm too pretty to go to prison.\n\nMy preference is to play on Discord, so either message me your Discord contact details, or message me to get mine. Also, come prepared for posts in the 2,000 - 4,000 character range. I do multi-para to novella length posts, though I'm not above sessions of shorter length shitposting. Basically, you'll want to have a strong grasp of grammar, punctuation, and spelling, as well as some practice at having RPed if you want to mesh well with me. I'm open to giving some coaching or pointers if you're close enough to my skill level for it to seem worthwhile.\n\nBelow are my strongest fandoms, listed from favorite to least favorite, with any applicable characters mentioned in parenthesis. If you don't see the character you're looking for, but you find a fandom that you enjoy, try messaging me to make a suggestion; I'll often pick up characters for people, especially if they come to me with a solid idea.\n\nFandoms__________\nMarvel (Females: Gwen Stacy, Elektra Natchios, Regan Wyngarde, Kitty Pryde, Hope Pym) (Males: Steve Rogers, Brock Rumlow, Bucky Barnes, Grant Ward, Kurt Wagner, Warren Worthington). I also play genderbent versions of a few of these, as well as some AU version; inquire within for more information. If you're super interesting you may be able to get me to take on Wanda Maximoff or Natasha Romanov.\n\nDC Comics: (Males: Dick Grayson, Roy Harper, Harvey Dent, Booster Gold), (Females: Selina Kyle, Mera, Felicity Smoak). I'm familiar with plenty of other DC characters, so this is the 'verse I'm most likely to take suggestions on. At the end of the day I just haven't played with many people who were into DC, so it's more a matter of not having the opportunity to get into as opposed to a lack of interest.\n\nAttack on Titan: Levi Ackerman is the main character I've played, but AoT is my second weakness after Marvel, so if you're the least bit interested please hit me up. Seriously.\n\nVoltron: I mainly play Shiro, with a focus on Shiro/Keith, but feel free to ask about other types of Voltron trash.\n\nStark Trek: Mostly Captain Kirk. Just talk to me about this one.\n\nDune: I've never found anyone who's into RPing Dune, but on the off chance there's some fans out there, holler at me!\n\nOverwatch: I play Mercy. End of story. No, I haven't played the actual game, but I'm a quick study and have read up on it.\n\nWorld of Warcraft / Final Fantasy 14: Inquire within. I'm currently on FF 14 after burning out on WoW's Legion expac.\n\n\nIf you've made it this far either you're intrigued or you aren't, but if I've tickled your interest (or at the very least your curiosity) then you should go message me ASAP so we can start plotting something fun!\n",

Totally up to you! \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs\n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

At this time, I'm totally open to writing either canon or OC characters, or even a mix of both if you want! I'm looking for someone who is 20 years old or older, is an open communicator, has and wants to contribute plot ideas and feedback, and is chill and friendly.\n\nAs my title also denotes, I'm currently looking to write some male slash pairings, and that is a stipulation for me right now as it's just what I am interested in exploring at this moment. I know not everyone is open to that so I just wanted to put it out there up front! If that sounds good to you, proceed onward!\n\nIf writing in the canon universe, I would absolutely adore a Remus/Sirius \\(Wolfstar\\) pairing, so definitely hit me up if that's been on your radar as well. I would prefer to stay within that general theme and area if you want to stick to canon. For OC characters, however, I'm basically open to any era or plot line!\n\nI really enjoy lovely, descriptive writing, so I am definitely looking for a literate or lit\\-adv partner who is interested in reading and creating detailed responses. I tend to write a lot, but will match you, and I typically reply once a day on average. I currently prefer email for my medium but I am absolutely open to other methods.\n\n\\*\\*FOR MORE INFO\\*\\*: Check out my [profile post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/8992qf/unicorn_alien/) on r/Roleplaygateway for a more detailed look at who I am and what I'm seeking as well as some writing samples!\n\nPlease reach out to me with any questions or things you are interested in!

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI'm currently looking to do some roleplays in a setting I've been developing for a a long time. A lot of it is based from taking Japanese (and some from other mythologies and some original) mythical creatures and reimagining them , and mixing the culture of Japan in the Heian period of Japanese history with modern technology to world build a unique setting, but all this is just explaining it lightly. \n\nThe setting fits into the following genres: high/epic fantasy, dark fantasy, science fantasy, space opera, and in some cases dying earth \n\nInfo on the setting here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vzpYYSTGClELDZNWIwamdr2JOpP_7m1RZunY_sg87E\n\nPlease be prepared to deal with some pretty dark issues, if anything triggers you please let me know. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required(but welcome), but please be detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

She grew up in the mountains, hunting to support her lame father and far too frail brother. During the winter where food was scarcer than ever, she succumbs to the ice and snow with a heavy heart. That night, she died. \nUntil she did not.\nShe woke to same of the people from her village hovering abover her body wrapped with linens. She was told that she had been in the mountains for over a week before she was found under a mound of snow. \nWord of her survival spread to the king who had her transported to learn more of her.\n\nMUSE B\nMuse B is a young king known his love of the female form, his ruthlessness and his rage. He is oppressive and intelligent and quite possibly mad with grief after the assassination of his mother, his last remaining family member.\nHis court a pit of vipers, eager to see his fall and put themselves in control but after he welcomes a strange new power to his world, they must contend with a being beyond their imagination: a girl wreathed with ice and anger. \n\nInterested?\nIf you're interested, you don't need to have an oc ready for this but it is a semi-lit to lit rp.

Time period, I prefer modern but anything in the second half of the 20th century would be great too! I'm open to pretty much everything, just tell me your ideas and we'll see if we can find common ground.\n\nI can be very busy, so I'm sorry if I don't reply right away but things are lightening up on my end. I tend not to take over a day, if I do, please send me a message. But in general, I tend to reply quickly and do various replies throughout the day. I'm okay writing in first or third person. I have to say that I struggle with \"mirroring\" sometimes, I'm not really someone who writes a lot of lines for a paragraph all the time. I can try, though.

But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",

            "selftext": "Hey there. As always, I'm looking for more partners for some great writing. Right now I'm mostly feeling my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts. (I also have the beginnings of a modern/paranormal setting inspired by the Skillet song, \"Lucy,\" if that interests anyone...)\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I'm a professional editor, and it's ruined me for polite society. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! (Please note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.)",

            "selftext": "Heyo ,\nI\u2019m Mia, and I come to you, dear reader with a simple request. Would you like to roleplay? I have a specfic sci-fi plot in mind that I think would be pretty interesting. Here are some basic skeleton points, we can flesh out important plot details later.\n\n\nThe story revolves around the idea of a virus.\nThe virus happens to be harmless to most. But it can be fatal to few, and beneficial to even fewer.\nBy beneficial, I mean one of the side effects are superpowers.\n\u1d9c\u02e1\u1da6\u1d9c\u02b0\u1d49, \u1d35 \u1d4f\u207f\u1d52\u02b7.\nThe story will take place in a world like, or very similar to the one we actually live in. It will also take place in a modern time period.\nSaid powers aren\u2019t crazy mutations like the hulk or the flash, but rather... slight... advantages. (Think watered down Luke Cage.)\n\nNow to plot/logistical stuff.\n\nI will play as a character that is part of a gang bent on destroying the virus and its hosts. She wouldn\u2019t have any powers herself, just guns, street training, and resources.\nYour character would most likely be one of the hosts of said virus. Our characters would occupy the same town, with two different agendas, causing obvious tension.\nTo add onto said tension, maybe our characters can be having an affair beyond the masks and not even know that it\u2019s their sworn enemy.\n\u1d9c\u02e1\u1da6\u1d9c\u02b0\u1d49, \u1d35 \u1d4f\u207f\u1d52\u02b7\nThough I usually prefer FxF, for this RP, I could honestly go either way.\nAgain, these are basic plot ideas, we can flesh out the details together later.\nLogistics:\nI\u2019m in the EST time Zone\nI\u2019d prefer you\u2019d be 18+ if you wanted to rp mature themes.\nI\u2019m fine with some smut here and there, but keep it plot consistent please, dont force it...\nI roleplay in a literate style, meaning long-ass openings and 1-2 paragraphs per response (it always ends up shorter by the middle of the RP but that is the plan \ud83d\ude02)\nI guess that\u2019s all for now... if you\u2019re interested, PM me. Unless you still are under your annoying 10+ post bondage, then just comment me to PM you. First come first serve ig... hopefully people will click this.\nK byeeeee",

I can write anywhere from a few sentences, to a few paragraphs. It really just depends on my mood and if I\u2019m inspired or not. Sometimes I\u2019m lazy, or prefer rapid fire and sometimes I prefer more thought out responses.\n- Characters: I highly prefer canon x oc, but I'm also willing to do canon parings. I also double, prefer it.\n- Reply time: I know very well we all have lives outside the internet, and we all get busy and can\u2019t reply every hour of every day. All I ask is more than one response a week, and we\u2019ll be good.\n- Extra: please be 18+.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! I want to start up a RP and have a decent plot idea, a sort of high adventure combined with forbidden love in fantasy. It has to do with my character, who is a half orc, beginning life as an adventurer after awakening mystic abilities. I was thinking that initially, he might join up with another character on their quest, thinking that traveling the world will help him learn more about what's going on with his abilities. It's pretty open ended, but that's mostly the beauty of it. \n\nIn terms of roleplay requirements, I usually prefer literate roleplays that are medium length (half to full paragraph on response) and reply times that aren't too long. I'm fine with NSFW, if you're not that's cool, although I am 20 and would prefer to play with someone who's 18+. (for reasons I'm sure everyone is aware of) Feel free to PM me if you are interested, my discord is HalfOrcAllSupermodel#6973\n(it's a reference to a DnD campaign I played awhile back where I had an orc warlock with really high charisma and who rolled a lot of natural 20 charisma checks, inside joke with my friends) Thanks!",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs\n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! I'm looking for a long term boy x boy plot that has alot of angst and action. Id prefer for there to be some NSFW content but i dont mind if theres not. I have a character set out and here are a few plots I was thinking could be fun :\n\n 1. **Muse A** has been a resident of the local psychiatric hospital since their youth. \u00a0Because of the nature of their disorder, they keep primarily to themselves and don\u2019t go out of the way to meet people. \u00a0Other patients aren\u2019t necessarily scared of them, but it\u2019s common knowledge that **Muse A** is not to be bothered and people generally comply.\n\n**Muse B** is a newly admitted patient to the same hospital. \u00a0They\u2019re loud, aggressive, and in the short amount of time they\u2019ve been there, have managed to get on almost everybody\u2019s nerves at least once. \u00a0\n\n\n**Muse A**, by habit, goes out of their way to avoid **Muse B**, but **Muse B** is fascinated by them and how they\u2019re viewed by the other patients. \u00a0 They make it their personal mission to get as close as they possibly can to **Muse A**, to the point that the staff takes notice and has to threaten **Muse B** with a stint in solitary confinement.\n\n2.  **Muse A** is an aspiring artist who goes to a prestigious art school in the city. Upon attending a gallery show with friends, **Muse A** is introduced to the work of an up\\-and\\-coming artist whom they\u2019ve never heard of before. The artwork speaks to them on a personal level, as they see definite similarities between this artist\u2019s themes and technique and their own work. To **Muse A\u2019s** dismay, the artist isn\u2019t there to speak to, but they\u2019re able to get the artist\u2019s contact email from the show\u2019s curator. Taking a chance**, Muse** A emails the artist \\(muse B\\) and explains how their work has inspired them and how honored they\u2019d be if the artist might one day give them some tips on how to make it in the fine art industry. T**o Muse A**\u2019s surprise, they receive a response f**rom Mu**se B almost immediate**ly. Mu**se B wants to meet them the next morning at their studio. When the next day daw**ns, Mu**se A arrives at the address given and is surprised to discover t**hat Mu**se B is close to them in age. They talk a little bit bef**ore Mu**se B invites them into their work space.\n\n3.  **Muse A** is driving along an unfamiliar road on what the meteorologists have dubbed \u2018the coldest day of the year\u2019. The sky is overcast and gray, signaling that a blizzard is imminent. Anxious to get home before the snow begins, **Muse A** drives faster and his/her car slides on a patch of black ice. The car swerves off the road and into a ravine that **Muse A** is unable to maneuver out of. There\u2019s no cell phone reception here, and there are no other cars passing by. Panic begins to creep in until **Muse A** hears a sound coming from within the thick of the snow\\-capped trees. He/She treks into the woods that border the desolate road in hopes of finding help. What little daylight there was is dwindling and the bite of frigid, winter air is setting in. **Muse A** can barely feel his/her fingers or toes when he/she stumbles upon a small cabin, smoke rising from a thin chimney.** Muse **B inhabits this cabin. He/She is on his/her way back to the cozy dwelling with an armful of fire wood when he/she spots** Muse A**, shivering in the ankle\\-deep snow.** Muse **B invite**s Muse** A inside to warm up. \u00a0 \n\nAnd here are some shorter ones :\n\n1.  When **muse a** misses the bus, they reluctantly turn to **muse b**, their crazy hot next door neighbor, for a ride to school. Before the lunch bell rings, rumors are flying about the two of them being a couple.\u00a0 \n2.  When **muse a** shows up for their first day of work study program \\(at the campus cafe, library, computer lab, tutoring center, bookstore, etc.\\), they learn that\u00a0**muse b**, the quiet loner who sits behind them in class, is their co\\-worker. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n3.  On a scorching day, Muse A comes across an open fire hydrant in their neighborhood and joins the group of people enjoying the cool spray of water; among them is Muse B whom Muse A has often seen around but has never spoken to because they\u2019ve always seemed intimidating\u2013but they don\u2019t seem very intimidating after getting a bucket of water dumped on their head and laughing about it.\n\nI cant wait to hear from you! Here are my handles :\n\nKik : Randomness002\n\nDiscord : Randomness002#1820\n\nWattpad : Random\\_n3ss",

The husk of the planet lives on as a shadow of its former majesty, inhabited by the last remnants of its people. They are divided into petty, tyrannical kingdoms, ruled by fear, superstition and poverty. In the wastelands strange, fearsome beasts roam and lurk, preying on the vestiges of the dead planet's population. Deep in the scorched southern deserts, rumours of a stronghold of psychic mutants filter along the caravan routes, the rumours state that they plot the conquest of the planet.\n\n\nFeared and loathed more than even the beasts of the wastelands are the wizards of the science cults. Men who collect the scientific artifacts of the dead civilisation which once made Hyperion its home. The legends of the nuclear holocausts say that it was the scientists who created the terrible weapons which ravaged the planet and created the living hell they now endured. The people of this dead world believe that the wizards will bring about yet another holocaust though no warlord on the face of the planet is willing to challenge the science cults.\n\n\nThe planet is on the brink of collapse but some retell the old legends, they say that one will come to unite the planet and lead it into a new golden age. Are these merely fairytales or are they prophecy?**\n\n\nHello, so I've laid out the general premise of the setting above. This is a bit different in that it's a mix of a sword and sorcery fantasy setting and a futuristic science fiction setting with some post-apocalypse thrown in for good measure. This is a completely original world, I've drawn inspiration from a number of quite different sources and brought them all together into what I hope is an interesting and unique setting.\n\n\nI'm looking for someone to write in this world with me. Someone who is able to move the story along and build the world up as the story progresses, someone who can write to a good standard (at least 2-3 decent paragraphs). I can't always post every single day but I usually get a few posts out per week during weekdays. I'm looking for someone who is 18+ as this is going to be a dark and gritty setting that will have adult themes. I only use email for roleplaying as it means I can write while I'm at work which increases my posting activity quite a bit.\n\n\nIf you're interested PM me and we can discuss this further.",

            "selftext": "First post here, and I have a group for this so I get the many reminders that I have been doing this, because I am not on Reddit as much as I would like to be. [https://discord.gg/NCAQeGE](https://discord.gg/NCAQeGE)\n\nThe story\u00a0is told on the continent of Elregard,\u00a0where the 300 year old empire of Magnolia was built upon the ideas of hope, possibility and wisdom. However, it hadn't always been like this. Prior to our story, humans had battled over land and honor for their country after the Elves gave it to them, in return for their services for a war they had against the Orcish tribes. Each country wanted to seize absolute control over the feudal lands, while the rest of the world had faced doom from monstrous creatures that came from the grounds below the Genesis Mountain, where it is said to be the beginning of Elregard. Of the monsters, there stood someone that they bowed to. A\u00a0dragon god, Ashram,\u00a0who gained godhood from the Genesis Mountain\u00a0with\u00a0a ritual, and turned against his fellow people, with he being the reason that the Manaketes had went endangered. It was said\u00a0Ashram was once peaceful and hated the idea of war, but soon became\u00a0disgusted in all lifeforms and their wars without gains. He felt as if it was his mission to eradicate the population of Elregard\u00a0and start anew, where everyone who agreed to kneel\u00a0before him could flourish. It was only when the humans started to get attacked by these monsters that they involved themselves against Ashram.\n\nIt was soon before they realized that the only way to defeat a god is to have holy weapons, because normal weapons did nothing against the divine beings. The humans took seven of their weapons,\u00a0A Sword, an Axe, a Lance, a Bow, a tome of Light Magic, a tome of Dark Magic and a Dagger, to a sacred shrine in the heart of the Willow Springs, a lake said to have divine power. Placing their weapons within the shrine's waters and offering a gift to the gods, their weapons became blessed, and it was used to fatally damage Ashram and his monster army\u00a0so that he could be sealed away within the World's Heart, a dark, hellish domain underneath the Genesis Mountain, used to imprison those who seemed as a true threat to the gods. When the monsters were sealed away, the lords had set aside past differences and united the feudal lands to form an empire, as well as a council that created the laws and put people in power. When those lords or representatives\u00a0died or retired, new ones were elected, and so on, and when the seven feudal lords died, their weapons were hidden away in temples and\u00a0across the continent, where they waited for new, worthy wielders to defend the empire.\n\nFor these years, the empire had progressed well, and nothing had seemed to be going wrong...\u00a0Until\u00a0the\u00a0current Emperor, Kassius Of Manchester, a wise, strong and well taught leader, fell ill\u00a0to a new epidemic, dubbed Agonia,\u00a0and rumors fly by that he died from this, but\u00a0he hadn\u2019t, and wasn't expected to make a full recovery.. You would suppose\u00a0it would be passed to his eldest son, right? Wrong. He\u00a0couldn\u2019t have kids because he was sterile, thus preventing an heir to the throne from his bloodline.\u00a0So from his wife, Maria of Florence\u2019s \\(who died a year before\\)\u00a0side of the family,\u00a0came\u00a0his\u00a0son in law, \u201cAscended Lion\u201d\u00a0Cecilio of Florence,\u00a0an ignorant, cowardly, dumbfounded sadist, who was the emperors\u2019 Right Hand Man, took the empty throne for himself after a vote 4 to 3, and appointed\u00a0new leaders, senators, etc. of strength and reputation, but also selfish, greedy and stone\\-hearted. These were the ones he appointed as his new council: \u201cMerciless Soldier\u201d\u00a0Shalashaska of Cairo,\u00a0\u201cCunning Chemist\u201d Yoshitsune of Edo, \u201cDark Valkyrie\u201d Agnessa of Volgograd, \u201cConmaster\u201d\u00a0Nixon of Concord, \u201cRenowned Warrior\u201d\u00a0Ermanno of Florence, \u201cDeadly Shaman\u201d\u00a0Ihaia\u00a0of Auckland, and \u201cSinful Sage\u201d\u00a0Beckler of Manchester, all of which he has\u00a0history with, and since they share the same idea \\- Only the strong survive... a point\u00a0were going to prove.\n\nWeeks after the psuedo emperor and senator\u2019s\u00a0coronations, things had went downhill. Because of the rise in taxes and the cut of markets, not only did members of society begin to lose their money and jobs, but\u00a0the supply of food was shortened. When demanding for markets to be opened up again, protests had begun, and to control the masses via force, the guards had attacked these protestors, fatally injuring and killing some, and placing others under arrest. Not only that, but\u00a0sorts of uncivilized riots broke out among society\u00a0because fears taken control of them and now they lash out against each other.\n\nAs things had seemed bad enough, it was only getting worse.\u00a0The same Agonia, the one that made the emperor sick had spread because of these open wounds caused by the guards, as well as from vermin and termites. Symptoms had included muscle pain, upset stomach, chills, trouble hearing, rashes, dark urine and confusion. All of this, and they had the ability to get away with it, due to Cecilio putting equal power between himself and his council, and less to no power to anyone below that. Anyone who had caught on to their plans and threatened to overthrow were arrested immediately... and never heard from again. The council only consisted of the eight after the massive removal of senators, and the massive payments to be doing this from other corrupt officials.\n\nThere are some who don\u2019t fall to any of what has happened and are extremely pissed. They do come to terms in agreement that\u00a0the \u2018Emperor\u2019 must be dethroned, a cure\u00a0must be found,\u00a0and the truth must be revealed so that everything can go back to normal. Of course, the new adviser and head Tactician of the Empire, \u201cMastermind\u201d Corypheus of Genesis Mountain,\u00a0had plans to unseal the same\u00a0dragon\\-god\u00a0and\u00a0Monsters from years prior by sacrificing the\u00a0body and blood of the true emperor where the monsters had been sealed.\u00a0The epidemic,\u00a0the uncontrolled\u00a0chaos, and the psuedo government, all were being\u00a0as bait for heroes looking to save their country. Will our heroes set everything right, or\u00a0will it be the end of the empire?\n\nAbout the RP:\n\nDistricts: these were the former feudal lands before the empire\u2019s formation. Wherever your character comes from will affect their stats and growth rate.\n\nConcord District: Heart of the empire, formerly named after founder Henry, and lord during the formation was Roosevelt, a renowned sword user. Most of the riots happen here. They\u2019re well rounded in their skills. \\(Neutral stats\\)\n\nOuter Regions: Beyond the walls of the empire exists a truly wonderful area, mostly occupied by elves, dwarves, manaketes, orcs and other people. Like Concordians, they are well rounded.\u00a0\n\nEdo District: home of art in the empire, it was formerly named after founder Kojima, and lord during the formation was Tanahashi, a master shot with a bow and arrow. Home to many beautiful illustrations, adored and patroned\u00a0by Kassius.\u00a0They hold more speed in return for less luck. \\(\\+Spd,\\-Lck\\).\n\nManchester District: the magical area of the empire, formerly named after founder Arthur, and lord during the formation was Perceval, a\u00a0master of the holy arts. Many gifted individuals come here to hone their untapped skill. Their magic makes up for loss in strength. \\(\\+Mag,\\-Str\\)\n\nVolgrograd District: the beef of the empires military, formerly named after founder Novgorod, and lord during the formation was Volgin, innovative Axeman. It\u2019s known for its harsh weather. Their defense outlasts their skill. \\(\\+Def,\\-Skl\\)\n\nCairo District: the mining area of the empire, formerly named after founder Mansa, and lord during the formation\u00a0was Nzinga, a swift lance user. The hottest district of the empire. Their luck truly defeats their persistence. \\(\\+Lck,\\-Res\\)\n\nAuckland District: the port of the empire, formerly named after founder Malok, and lord during the formation was Ratana, a hexing dark arts master. Known for its trade. Their strength lasts longer than their vitality. \\(\\+Atk,\\-HP\\)\n\nFlorence District:\u00a0the cooks\u00a0of the empire, formerly named after founder Benito, and lord during the formation was Cicero, tricky dagger user. Its scent of delicious food can be snuffed out from a mile away. Their persistence is stronger than their skill. \\(\\+Res,\\-Skl\\)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIdeologies within the Empire: When mixing together groups, new ideas come to rise, as its been in the case of history. Here is just a few of them:\n\nRomulism \\- originated from Florence, this ideology focuses on self worth and possibility for all.\n\nVladmirism\u00a0\\- originated from Volgrograd, this ideology is all about strength in one and hardship.\n\nMerlinism \\- originated from Manchester, this ideology shows what magic really is, and how one can tap into his own power.\n\nKusamism \\- originated from Edo, this ideology reveals the power in art and what creativity does for the individual.\n\nPikism \\- originated from Auckland, this ideology has inspired hard work and the right mindset.\n\nShakism \\- originated from Cairo, this ideology shows peace for the soul and to be one with the ancestors.\n\nThese ideas had also carried out to the outer regions during expeditions for goods for the empire.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPeople of the Districts and their appearances:\n\nConcord: nothing really special about the Concordians. Most cap height at around 5\u20196, and most weigh around 200 pounds or less.\n\nManchester: the Manchesterians are paler than most and have poncy accents. Their height cap is 5\u201911, and weigh around 170\\-180 pounds.\n\nEdo: the Edoans are darker\u00a0than Concordians when it comes to skin color, but are only around 5\u20191 and weigh around 155 pounds.\n\nVolgrograd: the Volgogradians are taller than Concordians, around 6\u20194\u00a0and are naturally built people around 230\u00a0lbs.\n\nAuckland: The Aucklandians are the\u00a0darkest in skin color, their height around 6\u20191 and around 210 lbs or more.\n\nFlorence: The Florenians are about the same as the Manchesterians, around 5\u20198 and weigh at 170 lbs.\n\nOthers: others outside of the Empire\u2019s walls may vary. Elves are medium in height\u00a0and yet pale with their renowned ears. Dwarves are the second shortest of people, and they don\u2019t have a lot of weight. Orcs are about as tall as the Volgrogradians, are built and have their signature skin color with War paint as birth marks. Hobbits are the shortest of the people, having hairy feet and are light skinned. Kitsunes have signature fox ears and tail and are very magical. Manaketes don\u2019t age as much as the rest of the races, and they are about as tall as the Manchesterians.\n\nRules:1. Nothing OP2. Be respectful to one another3. If you have anything to say out of character, put it in parenthesis and say OOC:4. Try to have as much fun as you can\n\nCharacter Sheet: \n\nName \\(Your characters name, obviously\\)\n\nGender \\(Dont want to be classified as genderless, right?\\)\n\nAge \\(this speaks for itself\\)\n\nFrom District \\(where your character lives. Put in an Outer Region if not from the empire\\)\n\nChoice of Weapon \\(do I have to explain? And you have to have a skill to have more than one type of weapon, or a promotion in class\\)\n\nWeapon Grade \\(Players who join from the start of the Roleplay have a Weapon grade of D. If joined later, they\u2019ll start with a C Weapon in their inventory, but may have a better weapon grade. Every time you battle, it increases by 3\u00a0EXP by battle, and 6 EXP per battle win,\u00a0and you must have 65 EXP to get a weapon grade level up\\)\n\nStats:\u00a0\\(Roll 2d20 for health, and 2d10 for other skills.\\) Strength determines physical damage, Magic determines magical damage, speed determines who attacks first and how many attacks they can get \\(If you hit the first time, you can roll again to try and double up, but the chance of hitting will be lowered to 7, and you will do 3 less damage\\), Luck determines evasion and hit rates, Skill determines rate of skill triggers,  Defense determines the lowering of damage taken physically, and Resistance determines the lowering of damage taken magically.\n\nSkills \\(This should be pretty simple. Each player starts off with 128 Skill Points, and can put extra skill points for stat growth, but must have 30 points in a growth for it to increase. Some skills have tiers, and the higher in tier, the more it\u2019ll cost. Each level up will get 10\u00a0extra skill points. I will discuss the skills when I can.\\)\n\nLevel \\(Simple. Each player must reach 100 EXP to level up. You get more if you\u2019re fighting/KO\u2019ing\u00a0a stronger foe, and less if fighting/KO\u2019ing a weaker foe. Each battle gives off 5 LEXP points, and each battle victory gives 10 LEXP\\)\n\nStarting Equipment \\(There are also equipment points. A player starts with 128 Equipment Points, and equipment have \u00a0tier system as stated: E \\- D \\- C \\- B \\- A \\- S, where E costs the lest, and S costs the most. Your weapon experience is the tier system. I will make a spreadsheet for this\\)\n\nWeapons:\u00a0[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\\_ikh65SssGSBMROj7ihXrR2Q\\_jYY\\-d\\-WW0MIC5fa0Mk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_ikh65SssGSBMROj7ihXrR2Q_jYY-d-WW0MIC5fa0Mk/edit?usp=sharing)Items:\u00a0[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JTpdmi7kOb\\_aILBmIvf2KSHBJSQgw2sPz3tnyAGt3uw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JTpdmi7kOb_aILBmIvf2KSHBJSQgw2sPz3tnyAGt3uw/edit?usp=sharing) Skills \\(not final\\): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eJ7o8IrLgkGkdbW4x1FJxibSWWNxQzQJVpl6qY4e8\\-4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eJ7o8IrLgkGkdbW4x1FJxibSWWNxQzQJVpl6qY4e8-4/edit?usp=sharing)",
