The basic concept is a post apocalyptic world (think Mad Max) with heavy satanic and magical themes. Having demons hunt in the wastelands, tribes of fanatics that represent the layers of hell, powerful necromancers and survivors just trying to make best of their situation.\n\nI\u2019m wanting someone who could help build this world *together*. Having someone to bounce ideas off of and bring stuff to the table is what I\u2019m looking for most.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to just build a world with you, I want to RP in it! I can post around a paragraph or two per response and I pride myself on the creative characters and situations I can create. As you can probably tell by the subject matter it will be quiet a dark RP and I\u2019m totally okay with the NSFW themes that may come up. I prefer to RP on Reddit and can respond quiet often when possible! I\u2019m also a big fan of drawing so maybe if we get really into it I can doodle up something?\n\n\nAnywho, PM me if interested!",

This is my first time posting in this particular sub-reddit, so please forgive me if I leave out any details.\n\nFirst off, a little bit about me: my name is Caitlin and I\u2019m twenty-two. I\u2019ve been roleplaying on and off for about seven years. I started at a particularly young age, and most of my earlier content is nothing to really show. I was pretty terrible, but that\u2019s not to say I\u2019m an expert. I\u2019m still learning on how to perfect my skill, and I hope that you are too. I work a full-time job and I still attend college. In my downtime, you can probably find me playing video games such as Fortnite and League of Legends.\n\nSo, what am I looking for? In terms of roleplay partners, I\u2019m looking for consistency. I understand that our lives can get pretty busy. I can be spotty as well, but I\u2019ll do my best to keep people updated. I\u2019m also looking for someone who won\u2019t one day disappear. I can get quite attached to stories I adore. I\u2019ll pour my heart and soul into them, and can get quite upset if someone one day leaves with no explanation. If you\u2019re not feeling it **please let me know**. For writing styles, I can write anywhere between a paragraph to six pages. It depends on what\u2019s being given to me, and your writing style as well.\n\nIn terms of roleplays, I\u2019m currently wanting the following:\n\n* Crime investigation (legal partners, crime scene investigators)\n\n*World of Warcraft-based (horde vs alliance friends, perhaps?)\n\n* Rock n\u2019 roll (perhaps some sort of alternative rock band mates, living out the rock n\u2019 roll lifestyle)\n\n* Let\u2019s build our own world! I already have a bit of a world in mind, but it\u2019s in a dystopian future.\n\n* Your ideas! I would love to have a partner who can contribute as well and not always have to be a \u201cyes\u201d man.\n\nI\u2019m sure I have more ideas locked up in my head somewhere, but currently I\u2019m sleep deprived. If you\u2019re slightly interested or have any inquires, shoot me a message and I will get back to you in a timely manner.",

The stars she had yearned for were almost close enough to touch, but of course she wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d never been off her home planet before and now she was quite far away, not to mention she was with a bunch of space pirates, of sorts.\nThe Andromeda set off two week prior and now was thousands of light years away from where it had last docked. The crew was full of both criminals and militants from all around the galaxy. The captain was a stern man who left no room for slaking off, though some still managed to. There was a place for each and every one of his crew and he made sure they knew it. To keep that at least thousand year old ship running the crew had to.\nClara was no different from any other person on the ship, though she had a mission. She was going to find her Aunt, a famous explorer of the cosmos and Milky way. The woman had completely gone off the grid, which was very hard concerning all the air traffic. Everyone knew that she was dead and Clara was the one who was going to follow the trail that lead to her and her journey started here.\n\n\nHello, hello,\n\nI\u2019m glad you decided to read this little blurb, I promise that my actual writing is better than this. Late nights aren\u2019t the best for me. \nAs you can tell this will be an interesting intergalactic trek and I\u2019d love for someone to join Clara. It doesn\u2019t have to be romantic but it can be, I can works with either gender if so.\nI\u2019d like this to be long term, so don\u2019t skip out on me after a few days, I won\u2019t try to get your attention or anything because even on the internet my anxiety likes to rear it\u2019s ugly head. If you do message me I\u2019d like you to know I\u2019m free pretty much all the time, so I\u2019m going to reply after an hour at max, but I do sleep. If you could do the same that would be fabulous but if it\u2019s only two or three messages a day that\u2019s chill too.   \nI\u2019m pretty picky too so if I don\u2019t message you back it\u2019s not your fault.\nAnd FINALLY, I usually use discord, or pm here.\n\nTo get this started send me your reply to the prompt and we can move from there! \n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "Hey, I'm Mandi, and I'm very much into the fantasy romance cliche with an arranged marriage. Not where the two meet and become instant friends, but where they despise each other and have to work out their differences for the sake of their respective kingdoms...and they have to appear in public together, attend parties, etc., all while resenting their new spouse that was handpicked for them.\n\nThat is, until they begin to form an unlikely companionship. And then perhaps, a romance?\n\nI know I specify \"M\" in the title but your gender doesn't matter, as long as you're willing to play a male character opposite my female one. The details can be sorted out between us, but basically, what would happen if two rival kingdoms paired up my character and yours for the sake of peace? Celebrations abound, and at last the war is over, but tensions still remain under the veneer of happiness. We can make this as simple or as complex as you want, but I love fantasy politics. I have no specific world in mind, so come with ideas and we'll throw something together.\n\nThe character I have in mind is Rada, a deceptively quiet princess with a sharp tongue. She's the youngest of her four sisters and the only one who hasn't been married off thus far. Despite her innocent appearance, she's been known to bribe guards and have a small army of spies disguised as handmaidens. Her beauty is described as \"satisfactory\" and her manners are \"questionable,\" but she is remarkably well-versed in politics, making her an ideal political pawn. The sort of woman you'd find in the Tudor era. Let's hope she escapes the beheading part.\n\nAll I request is that you have a good grasp of the English language, are somewhat near my timezone (Eastern, GMT -5,) and are okay with the fact that I might not be able to reply daily. Weekends are busy and I'm handling both work and college. If you could give me a short snippet of what your character is like, that would be lovely. Hope to hear from some of you soon!",

            "selftext": "\u201cCenturies ago, all wielders of Magic were sentenced to die. What once started as a small group of religious masters against magic wielders had grown to become an overwhelming problem. With the support- or truly, the fear of the communities these Purists ravaged, the people of the cities and realm were forced to relinquish children to the Purists- no older the the lot of you! Three, four- all the way up to young men like you, Jeddah, were ripped from their homes and families to become witch hunters.\u201d The fire before them crackled and popped quietly, illuminating the face of the old woman before the group of children. She was traveled, decorated in jewelry and textures from around the realms. The four children sat leaned forward listening to one of her many stories with great intent. \n  \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have gotten me.\u201d Jeddah answered, confidently shaking his head and sitting back. \u201cI would have fought back- stabbed them.\u201d The old woman laughed, shaking her head slowly. \n  \u201cI know you would have dear... but that wouldn\u2019t have stopped them. Each child they caught had there blood drawn, tested over whatever magical gem they could find. Those who passed the test... well... they were almost luckier then the children who failed. The children proved of no magical abilities became property of the Masters.  Trained to become witch hunters. Convinced of the \u2018ugliness\u2019 of magic. That it needed to be cleansed of the world.\u201d\n  \u201cI- I heard that they used to make them fight each other to the death!\u201d\n  \u201cWell I heard, that the masters would force them to sit for hours under the effects of a burning spell!\u201d\n  \u201cThat\u2019s not true...\u201d one of the older girls shook their head. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. They just trained them to fight. Forced them to listen to lectures and shit about what witches could do. Right Helga?\u201d\n  The old woman shifted in her seat, a frown sitting on her lips. \u201cIt is all true. And much more. The hunters lived a sorry existence. Not that it excused their actions... nothing could make up for the wrongs done to the people of the Dalmeu.\u201d All the children fell silent with an uncomfortable air at the word. \u2018Dalmeu.\u2019 It was practically a curse. A name used by the Purists to refer to the wielders of Magic after they began to seek refuge in the forest bearing the same name.  \u201cFor years the Dalmeu his amongst the dense dark trees of the forest. Rotting along with the ruins of their once great society. Until one day, a group of witches had enough. They began to band together- creating a rebellion amongst them. \n  \u201cTogether they would seek out more of their kind. Create a home. Find relics lost to past to try and strengthen the blood within their veins. Though... this wasn\u2019t lost on the eyes of the Purists, or their hunters.  For years they both went on, fighting, hunting, gathering. It seemed things were coming to a stalemate... the witches had enough power to stop the hunters, but the hunters had the element of brutality. Cunning. A mission that was their only purpose to complete. So it continued. On and on, hundreds of lives lost. Hundreds of artifacts stolen.\u201d Helga paused for a long while, looking out into the fire while she recalled her story. \n  \u201cUntil the most fateful day a group of witches came across a party of hunters in the southern most water temple. Said to be home of the Moon\u2019s Eye- a powerful moonstone used by the elementalists long ago.  A fight ensued at once, magic flying every which way, swords and arrows. Though... one of the three hunters was gone. After the Moon\u2019s Eye no doubt. (Your character\u2019s name here), the bravest of the bunch decided to find her- stop her from finding the moon\u2019s eye. However, by the time he found her- it was too late.  She had already reached the precious ancient stone. So he-\u201c\n  \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d Jeddah interrupted. \u201cIf she had touched it, she would have died. Non-magic wielders couldn\u2019t have handled that much energy. Even Elder McKell won\u2019t touch the Moon\u2019s Eye. It\u2019s to powerful.\u201d\n  \u201cYeah.\u201d Edith chimes in. \u201cSeems like he shouldn\u2019t have let her touch it. Be done with it.\u201d\n  \u201cAh... but there\u2019s the problem children. The hunter did not die. Quite the opposite. That was the day her life truly began.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHello! Thank you for reading this far if you have! I\u2019m looking for someone to tell this story with me- I know it was a bit of an unconventional way to set up the story, but I felt it was the most interesting way to give you the details. \n\nI will be playing the hunter, Rowan. I would like you to play the man who catches her touching the moonstone. At her touch, the stone glows and creates quite a spectacle of elemental magic then causes Rowan to collapse. YC decides to not only rescue the stone, but also the mysterious hunter who was somehow able to use it. He takes her back to his compound- despite knowing the dangers of when she wakes up in hopes of discovering her connection to the stone and hopefully some intel on Hunters. \n\nI would like this very much to be an unlikely love story, where two people raised to hate one another come together to form something beautiful. A story about helping heal the broken parts of Rowan, teaching her how to be human. How to love. \n\nAlong with a bunch of lore and adventure along the way!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please send me a message. Looking forward to it!",

            "selftext": "**The devil's in the details, so hang with me....**\n\n\n- Roleplayer and writer for over a decade and looking for a few more long term, descriptive partners. \n- I always make an attempt to warn my partners if I know of an impending issue in schedule. If I do not know ahead of time, that cannot be helped. *Life comes first.*\n- I prefer that you don't mind OOC chatter sometimes as well, considering some days, one just doesn't feel like RPing and needs someone to talk to. I enjoy being able to ask how you are from time to time and I prefer a different email thread for doing just that as well as any RP question that may come up once we start.\n- I am willing to answer any questions that come my way, all you have to do is PM me.\n- Again, life comes first, and if something comes up that pulls me away from RP, please be aware that I will attempt to warn you before it happens if I can. If I am unable, I will contact you as soon as is feasible.\n\n\n**Play Style:**\n\n\n- I am perfectly adept at playing either a male or female character in any given setting. Message me about an idea you have. I will respond.\n- As my character is not me, your character is not you. It doesn't matter to me whether you are male or female and what your character is. \n- Heterosexual relationships are my first and foremost preference in romance RPs, but I will not discount a different relationship in an RP idea that strikes my attention enough. \n- If something is not working for you, please tell me and do not disappear on me. I do my best to not disappear on my partners, and it would be nice to know what can be improved or changed. \n- Be willing to plan with me. A little world-building can save a lot of floundering later in the game, and I'd like to be able to sketch out at least a little bit before we begin. (This does not mean we have to have a rigid storyline, setting or otherwise.)\n- **I will politely decline to keep responding to you if you cannot produce anything over one line or incomplete sentences.** The purpose of this long, thought-out advert is to deter you from wasting my time and your own.\n\n\n**Post Schedule:**\n\n\n- I am completely unavailable on Sundays and Wednesdays, there are very few exceptions to this. Most Saturdays, I am unavailable as well. \n- On a good day, I may be able to get in 2+ posts per day or more. I may be able to rapid fire. Others, I may not be able to post at all. *Please be patient.* That being said, if it has been 3 days or more since I have responded, feel free to send me an OOC email to remind me. Your email may have been one I opened on my phone and did not reset as unread, or I may be having an issue in responding at that time.\n\n\n**Post-Length:**\n\n\n- I typically range anywhere from three to six paragraphs or more, depending on necessity. My introduction posts or description posts will obviously be longer than simple conversation. I am not asking you to mirror me.\n- I would prefer a partner that is both literate and descriptive. At least two paragraphs or more.\n- My posts include internal dialogue and conflict, if that bothers you - please do not waste my time or yours.\n\n\n**Platforms:**\n\n\n- I use email. It is the easiest way for me to keep track of everything. \n- The only acceptable time I will use Google Hangouts is for OOC chatter, and nothing more. \n*My apologies, but I will not be changing to any other platforms, it is simply too inconvenient for me. You will, unfortunately, not be convincing me otherwise.*\n\n\n**Genres:**\n\n\n- Darker themes, gore, survival horror, drama, high or low fantasy, sci-fi, steampunk, crime noir.... a vibrant mix of several, you name it and we can talk it over and see if we can find something we will both enjoy. \n- Romance is a preferred subplot, but in a slow-burn atmosphere. I prefer things to develop organically and I do not want this to be the main focus of any RP.\n- NSFW content is not necessarily off-limits, but please be aware that I would like to discuss things first.\n- I will not change a character completely to suit your wants/needs. If I want to use one I already have and alter their histories or otherwise, that is my choice.\n- I reserve the right to say no. \n\n\n**Time Periods**\n\n\n- Any. Let's talk it out. I prefer an element of fantasy in anything I do, which means I will prefer any offers for it over completely realistic.\n-  I can absolutely be convinced otherwise, if you have a good enough idea or plot that is also realistic - let's talk.\n\n\n**Fandoms:**\n\n\n- I will readily attempt to play in a fandom that I like. That being said, I do not prefer to play very many canon characters.... just in canon universes. Want to play OC mutants? New heroes in the DC or Marvel universe? Let's try it. (If you're wondering who I am willing to play canon in these universes, please just ask. \n\n\n**Need Not Apply:**\n\n\n- I can and will refuse any RP I want, but it is likely that I will give it a shot first if we mesh well together in our initial conversations.\n- Do NOT contact me with a situation in which I am basically under your thumb and you are a DM/GM type.... I do NOT like this type of RP and I you will not be changing my mind. Thanks.\n- Do not expect rapid-fire posts or conversations from me constantly, I will reply when I am able, I promise.\n- Anyone seeking nothing but NSFW roleplay can keep looking, I prefer rich story and worlds. \n\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\n\n- Please contact me via **message,** I do not respond to comments. \n- Let's talk it out before or after we move to email, I don't mind either way. If I seem to have missed your message or email in 2 or max 3 days, send another and I will reply right away. ",

I have an idea of a small crew of rookie young pirates going on an adventure in search of a legendary treasure and meeting hardships and new friends as they go. I would like to include some fantasy elements, rival pirate crews and maybe marines too! If you know anything about the world of One Piece I'd like to borrow some elements from the manga \\(Like the Grand Line, marines, devil fruits\\) but if not, it\u2019s okay as we can make stuff up together too!\n\nThis rp would obviously require more than one character for both of us and while I want at least one pairing to be m/m I am also fine with f/m and f/f too for other pairings : \\) \n\nIf any of this sounds fun to you please pm me for contacts!

Users are free to create and playout a narrative unique to their character, that can involve others\u2019 characters, or NPC like characters of your own creation. We\u2019re all about members enjoying themselves and developing their characters in this world, how they see fit.\n\nOur staff is friendly, and are open to suggestions to be added to lore, and even event ideas. We run a \u2018democracy\u2019 in this group. So if you have an idea, you are encouraged to share it.\n\nWe are a new, and small community, but are growing, and keep the atmosphere relaxed and welcoming to everyone.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have an age limit, this server has a lot of 18+ content, and we expect members to act in a mature manner in the majority of situations, as a way to limit OOC drama.\n\nJoin us for some roleplay fun.

Three is the minimum I give and take but I like writing more. And I have no issue waiting days or even weeks if the post is more thoughtful and epic, than one thrown together in haste.*\n\n- *Finally, mature themes are probably going to arise but I don't make a big deal about them. I'd prefer to have someone who is old enough to handle darker topics but who doesn't want to push them onto me constantly.*\n\n- *Below I have outlined characters I am capable of playing. They are listed in order of both experience and interest. I will outline my vision for the character and then the male characters I would want someone else against them and how I see those dynamics playing out. I am open to other suggestions. We can plot together and see what we both want to try.*\n\n- *And this is all pertaining to the movies and tv shows, sadly I cannot compensate much for not being aware of the comics or outside information. To me it's too much to really dig into so I would like us to stick to the movies and shows if possible. Thank you.*\n\n**Characters I can play:**\n\n- - -\n\n**Pepper Potts:** *I see her as being outspoken and bold. She has worked for one of the most difficult people in the world. She came from a small town with loving parents who secretly wish Pepper worked elsewhere but they cannot deny how their daughter's hard work paid off. Pepper makes sure her parents don't have to work another day in their lives. She gets things done and she is wildly independant. Her social life is nonexistent as she's poured her life into bettering both Stark Industries and Tony Stark himself. Dating has been pretty much cast aside as she works on her career. She believes Stark Industries can be a global force for good. She has even taken steps to learn self-defense and firearms from Natasha. Pepper Potts is a woman who is always in control, knows what she wants and doesn't let anything stop her from achieving her goals.*\n\n**Suitable Matches:**\n\n- **Tony Stark:** *He was her boss for many years. They know each other rather well. Pepper has always held a soft spot for him, despite the many headaches he has caused her. He has taken steps to better himself, not wanting to die without having done more for the world than make money off of its old wars. Tony is protective and very smart, hopefully smart enough to see the amazing woman who has remained by his side for so long.*\n\n- **Logan:** *A man who keeps people at arms length. He has been through a lot, he has lived through a lot. He could either fall back in time or Pepper could fall forward in time. Old or young is welcomed. Logan pretends that he's cold, hoping to not just protect himself but those he's hurt in the past. Pepper has dealt with difficult men before, she knows their walls will crumble eventually.*\n\n- **Matt Murdock:** *Needing a lawyer is pretty vital when you run a company and Mr. Murdock had proven his heart is in the right place. He is brought to Stark Industries to help with the public image and ensure the Stark name isn't dragged through the mud. Matt's other identity is something Pepper perhaps stumbles upon and she takes it upon herself to accompany him in his pursuit of The Hand.*\n\n- **Steve Rogers:** *By all accounts, Steve is a good guy looking to acclimate to his new life. And Pepper is hoping for a break from work, the stress prompting a needed vacation o her own. They come together in a small town, hoping to save a few people and remember who they are, not just what they have done. They have different strengths but can find comfort in one another, aware their past doesn't define them.*\n\n- **Charles Xavier:** *He is a man who has many gifts. He and Pepper converge when mutants come forward to help in defending New York from an alien invasion. Charles decides to offer his services to Tony and Pepper, believing it vital for everyone with gifts to work together. While Tony is busy tinkering, Pepper and Charles grow closer as Charles begins to reopen his school and Pepper assists him, using grants from Stark Industries. Young Charles preferred here but I'm not picky.*\n\n**Jessica Jones:** *I see her as young and snarky, able to cut down the biggest man with a snide comment. She loves her best friend and sister dearly, would do anything for Trish. Jessica is tying to give up drinking, trying to take on more cases, likely following the events of season two (or one) of JJ. She is slowly learning to open up to people. She is still damaged after being kidnapped and raped by Kilgrave, having been reduced to a pretty puppet under his control. Now she tries to reclaim her life and her freedom.*\n\n**Suitable Matches:**\n\n- **Logan:** *The two meet in a dive bar, both deciding to break up a fight. Both then decide to team up to take down a pharmaceutical company called Transigen. They uncover the truth about mutants being genetically modified and free the children inside, including a girl named Laura.*\n\n- **Tony Stark:** *He and Jessica meet at AA. Both of them promised their respective best friends they'd try to do better. But upon meeting one another, they start to slip. They continue to bond over bottles of scotch and vodka. When caught they decide to stop dragging the other down and finally shape up and be better people.*\n\n- **Peter Quill:** *When finally able to return to Earth, there is a lot of adjusting that has to happen for Starlord. He just so happens to rent an apartment in Jessica's complex and the two begin to form a strange friendship as she helps him adjust to the shitty life on Earth.*\n\n**Trish Walker:** *She is passionate about her work, wanting to make the world a better place. She has done a lot of stupid things and she is hoping to move beyond her past as a child star. She was abused and manipulated. She then went on to try her hand at singing which didn't go that well and planted a wedge between her and Jessica. Now that they're reconnecting, Trish wants to move forward. Jessica has her business and Trish wants to get into more serious investigation pieces. Trish decides to be a different kind of hero, beginning to explore the catlike skills she's starting to develop.*\n\n- **Kilgrave:** *Kilgrave is not dead. He has been resurrected and is considering a change in his path. He sees now that Jessica will never be his again. Not truly. He decides to seek out the one person who has been somewhat sympathetic to him (at least when he had been held captive and assaulted by Jessica), aka Trish Walker. He decides to make her his mentor in order to better himself. Will he bring out her darker side or will she bring out some good in him?*\n\n- **Logan:** *After a long night of drinking and mild property destruction, Trish bails out Jessica along with someone else who was with her, a man named Logan. Trish and Logan get to know each other over coffee as a way him somewhat paying Trish back for her help. The two continue to see each other and when Will returns, Logan is there to help put him in his place.*\n\n- **Steve Rogers:** *As she's following a tip for one of her radio programs, she crosses paths with Captain America. She ends up convincing him to let her interview him and they hit it off. When Trish begins to exhibit signs of having powers, Steve decides to take her under his wing.*\n\n**Raven Darkholme:** *Depending on where she is in the timeline, I see her as a fearless warrior but not keen on leaving her human side behind either. She struggles to embrace both her mutant side as well as her human side. She wants to embrace who she is but believes the world will only use or mock or fear her. Raven is skilled in combat and enjoys used her shapeshiting to get what she wants. She has no qualms about lying to people if it means she and those she's close to, get what they need. Raven can be sweet just as she can be ruthless. Deep down she wants to live a quiet life.*\n\n**Suitable Matches:**\n\n- **Erik Lehnsherr:** *His views on the world may be skewed but he is the one person who sees Raven as she is and not who she could be thanks to her gift. Erik relies upon her companionship and together they take on the world. I'd prefer something between FC and DoFP or something during Logan's timeline.*\n\n- **Logan:** *Set during the Logan timeline, Raven disguises herself as a nurse and helps Laura escape and unite with her father, Logan. Together she, Logan, Laura and Charles embark on a quest to save the mutant children. Along the way, Raven makes it her mission to destroy Transigen and its various labs throughout the country. She and Logan eventually run into cloned mutants of their fallen comrades.*\n\n- **Steve Rogers:** *Steve believes there's no to Raven then meets the eye. He also doubts that she has truly turned her back on the world. But to Raven, the world has turned its back on her. Steve tries to help Raven seen that the country still needs people like her and him and that she is beautiful in her truest form. At the same time, Raven brings a bit of a wild side out of Captain America.*\n\n**Karen Page:** *Karen is sick of staying on the sidelines. She decides to step up her investigations into the various crime syndicates of New York City. She begins to prowl around Hell's Kitchen and ends up following a few leads. In her past, to get through college she had to take part in a certain film industry. But she is trying to put those mistakes behind her and make a name for herself, hoping to carry on Ben Urich's legacy.*\n\n**Suitable Matches:**\n\n- **Matt Murdock:** *As Matt continues to be the Daredevil protecting Hell's Kitchen, Karen insists she helps him fight crime. Matt teaches Karen some self-defense and together they fight crime.*\n\n- **Peter Parker:** *While Karen is lurking around the streets of Hell's Kitchen, Peter ends up saving her from some thugs. She decides to get to know him better they bond over their need to make the world a better place. Peter is attending college now and Karen offers him an internship at her newspaper gig. Together, they work to clean up Hell's Kitchen.*\n\n- **Charles Xavier:** *Karen is tasked to investigate some unusual activity in upstate New York, she uncovers a school for mutants and decides to help keep their school a secret. Eventually Charles decides it's time to start promoting for more students in need of guidance. Karen takes on a professor position in hopes of helping some of the wayward mutants turn down a more positive path in their lives.*",

The RP is a fantasy school-based roleplay with a combat system and a stats system with various combat events taking place throughout the RP. Its not controlled by a bot because I'm still learning discord bots but hopefully in the future it will. The roleplay allows you to be a monster archetype of many different kinds, such as a vampire, werewolf, mermaid, and so on. The RP DOES allow NSFW in certain RP channels so we'd prefer if applicants be 18+ and comfortable with some NSFW RP. \nStaff applications are open and we're new and looking to improve, but we'd really like to grow and become a fun and successful RP!

            "selftext": "Despite decades of informally role playing online with friends for fun, I've never really had any luck setting up anything in any more formal sense.\n\nAnd among one of the troubles I feel like I run into is that formal RP prompts always appear to involve treating characters a little bit like Sid from Toy Story treats his dolls: a bit sadistically and callously. Let them suffer, let terrible things happen to them, \"whatever I'll just make more. what's the big deal?\"\n\nAnd I can appreciate the allure of that pattern of writing, it allows a person to really explore a lot of dynamics that you'd have a hard time gaining experience about most any other way. But it's just not a dynamic I feel like I'm suited to participate in because any character I make just feels like a little piece of my soul. I identify with them, I feel empathy towards other characters, and that's not something I know how to turn off.\n\nIs there any name for a form of RP shaped like what I'm describing? Where a person's character is basically *themselves* adapted to the world they inhabit, instead of toy soldiers sent into a battle most won't come back from by bored deities with no skin in the game?\n\nThank you for your time, I look forward to your perspectives. :)",

            "selftext": "Hey there, /r/roleplay! It's been a while since I've posted here, so if you've seen this post before, messaged me and never got a response, I apologize. Feel free to message me again!\n\nAnyways, as the title says, I have an idea for a very anime-esque roleplay! It's something I've been crafting and refining for a very long time now so I have a pretty good idea of it's plot, rhythm and pace. With that in mind, I am not completely turned off to the idea of building new arcs and pieces of the story together with my partner - however, I would prefer if the first story arc or two were left unaltered and followed more or less how I've prepared them, just so you can get a feel for how this roleplay is themed and such. (And because the first arc especially sets up a lot for later.)\n\nAs a completely original roleplay and therefore requires a cast completely made up of original characters. I would prefer if you were interested in playing multiple characters. Playing one *might* work, but honestly, I'm not 100% sure about it and the more characters you'd be interested in playing, the better. Some would stick around and stay on our main cast, others become side-characters, even some villains if you'd like!\n\nThis roleplay is heavily inspired by classic shonen series, so it's going to be mainly oriented toward action and adventure though I do love me some romance and drama, so I'm not at all opposed to that kind of stuff.\n\nSpecifically, this roleplay is inspired by four key series:\n\n* Dragonball\n* Yu Yu Hakusho\n* Inuyasha\n* Chrono Crusade\n\nThere are other inspirations that will most likely become clear as the roleplay goes on, but those are the four heavy hitters so if you're familiar with any of them, you'll have a pretty decent idea of how this roleplay will probably be.\n\nSorry if this post seems a bit vague, but I'm purposely being that way! I'd prefer you go into more in-depth explanations one-on-one.\n\nHowever, here are some highlights of might interest you in this roleplay:\n\n* A multitude of races including angels, demons, elves, humans, vampires and more! (However, they are tuned to this world so they might not be exactly what you're expecting.)\n* Energy attacks.\n* Elemental attacks.\n* Transformations.\n* Escalating enemy power levels.\n* Story arcs! Some short, some long.\n* At least two of which will be tournament arcs. (Because who doesn't love a good tournament arc? ~~The Dark Tournament from Yu Yu Hakusho ftw.~~)\n\nI grew up on roleplaying on forums, so I like posts to be on the longer, more descriptive side. However, I can roleplay on here or through e-mail, or perhaps on Discord. Skype isn't an impossibility, but I really don't use it much anymore.\n\nI tend to stick to third-person, paragraph-style roleplaying. Length and descriptiveness fluctuates of course, I'm not going to crank out a novel with every single post and I don't expect you to either. Just half of one :p But seriously, I get it. Not every post is going to be gigantic and if you can't find the time or motivation to post four hundred times a day, that's cool too. I get it, I'm not going to pressure you into replying!\n\nAlso, if we roleplay together, I'd very much enjoy if it we talked outside of the roleplay as well. To me, roleplaying is about making friendships as much as it is about... well, roleplaying! If you really **don't** want to be friends though, that's okay too.\n\nAnyways, hope to hear from you soon! Shoot me a message on here and we'll sort things out!",

I also do bearded dragon rescue, so, expect pictures of lizards* (*unless you have a phobia, in which I will obviously respect that).*\n\n**~The Basics:~**\n\n-I work mainly on Discord, this is just for convenience reasons. I have found Skype to be a bit wonky/glitchy.  \n-I work Saturday \u2013 Wednesday, 4:30pm-1:0am EST so, while I may show online, I\u2019m usually not available during those hours.\n-Communication is HUGE for me, and I\u2019m guilty of not communicating 100% sometimes. All I\u2019m asking is don\u2019t ghost on me. If you\u2019re not interested in something, please let me know. I\u2019m not gonna get offended, it happens. If you feel our writing styles don\u2019t work, no worries. \n-I like people to be 18+ for legality reasons\u2026\n-On that same token, if you haven\u2019t heard from me in a day or two, just message me\u2026please. I have a full time job and a lot going on in my head, I\u2019m 9 times out of 10 not ignoring you on purpose. \n\n**~Writing:~**\n\n*I\u2019d say these are more general guidelines, and I\u2019m not super strict on it. I\u2019d prefer you be grammatical correct, and at least know how to construct a paragraph, but I\u2019m not going to ring you out to dry if you spelled something wrong here or there.*\n-I can play male characters, however, if I\u2019m being honest, I prefer to play female characters because it\u2019s a bit easier for me to relate to them.\n-Third person perspective only, please.\n-I can write anywhere from 150-2000 words, depending on the context of the story. It is usually a paragraph minimum, and I will not take one-liners.\n-NSFW themes are fine, if again, appropriate with the context. I\u2019m not here to smut it up, y\u2019all.\n\n**~Topics:~**\n\nI primarily play in pre-established worlds, or fandom worlds, just because I really, really, enjoy a lot of the worlds that are created out there. That said, I\u2019m happy to do some world building and custom story writing.\n-Sorry, but not slice of life or reality things. I live in reality, I like to get away from it, please.\n-I like things with a sort of fantastical element to it; super powers, magic, highly advanced technology that is like magic, that sort of thing.\n-Some \u2018fandom\u2019 style stuff I\u2019m into would be;\n\t*Witcher\n\t*Marvel (MCU)\n\t*Game of Thrones\n\t*Bloodborne\n\t*Fallout\n\t*Elder Scrolls\n\t*Etc. [-Insert Bill Mays Here-]\n\n*Feel free to send me a DM, we can chat more there and exchange contact information if needed. Since you\u2019ve made it all the way to the end, please tell me what your favorite kind of fruit/vegetable is, so I know you\u2019ve read through (or at least skimmed) what I posted. *\n\nHope to hear from y\u2019all! \n\n-Brie \n\n",

A caveat is that I will not play romance with male on male, sorry!\n\n\nI love world-building, and while for this specific roleplay I do have a reference in mind, there will still be a lot of original content to flesh out!\n\n\nI also like to spend time properly setting up the roleplay, do not expect to dive right in!\n\n\nWill I roleplay NSFW material? Only under very specific circumstances, for example, it must make sense in the story. I do not want smut to be even remotely a focus for this roleplay.\n\n\nI typically write in 1st person but this can change as need be. As far as a partner goes, I have a preference for 1st but is not a requirement.\n\n\nWhen it comes to writing, I typically do multiple paragraphs per response, and can usually respond a few times or more a day. \nFor my partner, I would request a similar minimum length, but I am far more concerned with quality of quantity.

Light hearted with little commitment is fine with me.\n\n\nI'd prefer to use reddit chat or something similar.\n\nI'm fine with any length posts, but if we are having a conversation I'm not going to write 3 paragraphs so I can answer a yes or no question. (I've found it kills rp when 8 people write 12 pages to come to a simple decision.)\n\nI'm not here for romance or anything lewd.

            "selftext": "Looking for a few to start a little Overwatch Roleplay using only original characters. I thought it would be a cool concept and the background of the roleplay would be around the formation of Overwatch around the time of the Omnic Crisis. All the characters would be new Overwatch recruits with their own abilities and powers and could all go on missions. Alternatively, if we had enough of an interest (10+ users) we could have opposing factions with their own private communication chats and such and certain missions by the people could contain fights between members of these factions. Furthermore, ideally, the missions would be improvisational. Meaning no one would know where the mission was headed and all the altercations in the mission would form fluidly. This would mean some kind of fighting mechanics would have to be in place (preferably something simple like dice) to ensure fair fights between players. Anyways, I thought it would be an interesting concept.\n\nIf anyone is interested, here is the discord invite:https://discord.gg/tHFKtZD\n\nP.S. If anyone is good with setting up bots, writing rules, and such, it would be much appreciated. I'm not much of an adept organizer of RPs and wanted to bring this to attention to see if anyone else was interested in an OC roleplay in the Overwatch world.\n\nThanks for reading \u2665",

I am capable of playing Botan, Yukina, Kuwabara, Keiko, Koto and Yusuke.\n\n- I might be open to doing an OC situation after the series where both of our characters die and are given a chance to be spirit detectives like Yusuke but it might take some convincing and good planning because I felt YYH lost its way a bit when they did more fighting than actual detective/spiritual work.\n\n- Generally I give 4-6 paragraph and I have the most experience writing as Botan and I can provide a sample if you'd like. \n\n- Mature themes are cool in my book. I do like a balance of slice of life, romance, action and mystery. \n\n- Posts come every 2-3 days so someone who isn't going to be looking for a million posts a day, is ideal. I have a life, I hate promising posts by certain times or days, I try to post when I can and I leave it at that.\n\n- I may also be interested in doing Canon x OC pairs but like the above OC plot, it would take convincing and probably doubling to be fair.\n\n- Crossovers might also be doable from other shows or anime too.\n\n**Pairs I'd be interested in:**\n\nKurama x Botan\n\nYusuke x Bonta\n\nKurama x Koto\n\nHiei x Keiko\n\nYusuke x Yukina\n\nYusuke x Genkai\n\nKuwabara x Keiko\n\nKoenma x Botan\n\nJin x Botan\n\nKurama x Keiko",

            "selftext": "Hey all! I am looking to fulfill a very specific RP preference I have had for a while now and I think it'd be a good time to post an ad for it once again.\n\nMy specific craving is that I'd like to do a roleplay involving time manipulation. I specifically enjoy slowing down time and am a huge fan of slow motion.\n\nI really like using it to draw out scenes in a surreal, dramatic way. There are some rather obvious plots for this but I like to incorporate it in more exciting ways as well and would prefer a partner who is up for some experimentation and more thought out possibilities. It can be as something as simple as a magic/power being used to slow down and ride out a scene or something more complex like an ongoing plot device or a tie into the actual plot of the RP. And many other options as well! It's really beneficial for of all sorts of things both mature and SFW and I don't like to limit it. \n\nUsing it in roleplay can lead to both interesting and some rather odd writing techniques so I'm looking for partners who enjoy the surreal and sensual. Other genres that this might be good for are any sorts of drama, over-the-top action, suspenseful conflict, sexy plotlines, and the sci-fi and fantasy realm. I know it's not really an effect too many people would fawn over but I seem to have a weird affinity for it and would love to play around with it in any way. \n\nI am open to playing multiple canon possibilities as well as completely OC endeavors. I'd prefer a literate partner with a paragraph standard of writing at the very least. I'm open to ideas as well so let me know if you have any thoughts. \n\nIf you are interested in the idea send me a message and we can discuss where we'd like to RP and so on. I am happy to answer any questions you may have and will gladly discuss this further with any interested roleplayers. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "### Realm of Angarak\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What is Angarak?\n---\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What makes it unique?\n---\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What are the 'requirements'?\n---\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### Tl;Dr\n----\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj",

            "selftext": "Hey there. As always, I'm looking for more partners for some great writing. Right now I'm mostly feeling my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts. (I also have the beginnings of a modern/paranormal setting inspired by the Skillet song, \"Lucy,\" if that interests anyone...)\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I'm a professional editor, and it's ruined me for polite society. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! (Please note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.)",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, and thanks for reading my post! (it is somewhat long and detailed, much like my preferred role plays).\n\nI just finished a very long term role play with someone on a difference medium, and am getting the itch once again to start something new.  I joined Reddit very recently just to join this group (and a literature group), and would like to throw my hat into the ring in finding the perfect female fit for my roleplay long-term future.\n\nMy name is Rick, (why don\u2019t many people put their first names in their intros?) and I am in my forties (I can hear younger women clicking to another post from all across the country as I write this, lol).  I have been interested in writing for as long as I can remember, and have written a lot of collaborative stories (in roleplay form) with like-minded women primarily using primarily \u201creal life\u201d scenarios.  (I have been told that my writing style allows the reader to feel as if they are in whatever scene I write about).  With regards to specific ideas, in addition to slice of life type scenarios, I also can write about Fantasy/Medieval, historical, etc. I can certainly try to write about demonic or extraterrestrial type scenarios, but have little experience so I would have to do some research, which I don\u2019t mind doing.  (I once had a friend request a scene involving a mermaid, I did my online research, and together we were able to come up with something pretty creative and interesting).\n\nMy plan is to be VERY picky with whom I write with, and I am only going to pick ONE person to continue forward with.  (I don\u2019t like sharing myself when I role play.)  I have a job that allows me to work at home most days, so I will be able to contribute to a collaboration at least a few times every work day as needed.  I am a night owl (on the east coast of USA), and in addition to writing on my computer during the day, I usually end up coming up with interesting ideas lying in bed at night, and having to grab my Ipad to put my idea down before I forget.  I LOVE when I am challenged to develop ideas to bring a story forward, and tend to crank out several paragraphs at a time, and appreciate effort and creativity in returns, which gets my creativity going even more.  There is NOTHING better than a well written collaborative piece of work that seems to flow as if one person is writing when it is in actuality two people going with the flow.  \n\nAs I mentioned above, I also belong to a literature group, which means that YES, I do love to write all types of stories (including some smut).  What sets me apart from many others (I think), is that when I write, it is all about the setup, characters, etc. and I don\u2019t only want to \u201cjust get to the good stuff\u201d.  To me a realistic feeling romantic, adventurous plot with or without detailed smut is fine if that is what my partner prefers, and that is what the story needs.  I just love to write, and can certainly do so with or without other graphic content.\n\nIn addition to having several stories on Reddit, I am also published in MANY other places.  To get a feel for how I write, please read my recent posts here, and then if you are interested in reading more, PM me, and I will show you where else I can be found using my \u201cpen name\u201d.  I have always written in first person form, but even if my partner only writes in third person, I have found that a roleplay story can still flow quite nicely.\n\nIn the past I have used primarily email for sharing ideas and creating collaborative roleplay stories, however I JUST signed up for Discord, so as long as you don\u2019t mind a newbie on this specific platform, I can certainly figure it out.  If you have been thinking about starting a roleplay collaborative with an intelligent, creative, no-nonsense, \u201cnice\u201d, guy then please send me a PM and introduce yourself.  Please be over 18 (preferably close to my age, but not necessary), and be detailed as to what you enjoy and expect in an online roleplay relationship. \n\nI hope to hear from you soon!\n\nRick",

            "selftext": "They\u2019d held out for as long as they could but after half a day of ferocious ship to ship fighting the already dwindling remnants of the Royal Navy laid at the bottom of the English Channel. The Kriegsmarine plunged forward and before dark beachheads had been opened all across the coastline between Portsmouth and Dover. More devastating losses through the night as they fought to retake their home on the ground but by morning the grimness of the situation had set in and the order made to fall back. Despite taking a hammering from artillery for two days straight, London had remained in English hands as Churchill pushed for an evacuation to the countryside and the prospect of fighting another day.\n\n\u201cEven after we blow the damn bridge it\u2019s not like a little water is going to stop the Krauts,\u201d Lance Corporal Rupert Hastings remarked in an English cadence, \u201cHow long do you think the Thames will slow them down Mike? Michael?\u201d \nSergeant Michael Quinn was busy staring up at the gaping hole in Big Ben where the clock used to be. It had been hit by a shell in the night but most it was still there for now despite some crumbling. The two soldiers were tucked in behind sandbags a few yards away from Westminster bridge, the last road across the Thames not demolished by the Royal Engineers. Eventually Mike looked down and shot the persistent Englishman a confused look.\n\n\u201cThe bridge, good plan?\u201d Rupert repeated.\n\n\u201cFucking hell it might be if those bloody Sappers ever come back,\u201d he answered in his Irish brogue, \u201cIf I see a Tiger try and roll across I\u2019ll blow the damn thing myself,\u201d\nRupert looked satisfied with the answer and just before replying he narrowed his eyes towards the other side of the river. The Lance Corporal snatched up his binoculars and pressed them to his face.\n\n\u201cLooks like the Sappers are back, and they\u2019ve got some locals,\u201d Rupert nodded toward the bridge and handed Michael the binoculars to see for himself.\n\nMike held them up and saw there was about a dozen civilians following the engineers out onto the bridge. The soldiers ushered them along whilst one of the Sappers leant over the edge to check on the state of the bombs wired along the sides. Mike returned the binoculars to Rupert and quickly stood to man the Vickers gun. When the civilians were nearly halfway across they all heard engines descending suddenly from the sky. A pair of German fighter planes ripped into view over the river in a dive toward the bridge, their machine guns swiftly blasting and chewing up stone and concrete. Mike answered their arrival with the Vickers gun and sprayed desperately in front of the lead plane during its descent. Everyone scattered across the bridge wildly trying to avoid the hail of bullets, mothers shielded their children with their own bodies and dove to the ground.\n\nRupert yelled loudly at the sight as the cacophony of gunfire continued all around him. The leading Bf 109 suddenly jerked to the right as it flew into Mike\u2019s sights and took a barrage of shots along the fuselage. It disappeared into the side of a building with a crashing boom leaving behind only a ripped off wing as the rest of the plane burned. Mike saw the surviving soldiers on the bridge try to get the civilians moving as the second plane climbed back up into the sky. There were a handful of unmoving bodies on the bridge that had been struck down during the attack.\n \n\u201cDismount the gun and follow me,\u201d Mike barked at Rupert before he jumped the various sandbags and rushed toward the bridge.\n\nA few of the guys at the rear of the group stayed behind to watch their backs while the rest of the group kept moving. Mike took a few steps out onto the bridge and beckoned the civilians toward him faster, knowing full well that the Bf 109 would probably make another run at any moment. He looked at the detonator just a couple of metres behind him where it was clear of the bridge. The safety fuse attached to it ran down toward the water and then snaked along the edge of the bridge and onto a network of bombs. Mike was thinking about using it when a fusillade of bullets erupted from the far side of the bridge. The three soldiers that were at the back got chewed up rapidly as a group of German infantry firing StG 44\u2019s barged forward. Their rifles rattled on loudly while they pushed onto the bridge, determined to keep it standing for the final push into London.\n\nBehind them the fighting in the streets was coming to an end as Panzer divisions flattened buildings with their armored vehicles on their way to the Thames. The Wehrmacht had squads going systematically from body to body on the street and sticking them with bayonets just to be sure. Mike glanced over his shoulder to check on Rupert who was running over carrying the Vickers in both arms. Just as the civilians hurrying toward him got so close he could see the terror on their faces Mike heard the fighter plane come back down for another swoop.\n\n---\n\nI'm looking for somebody to create an alternate history with where the Axis powers ultimately win WW2. The time period when we start could be during the war but before the invasion of Britain or after where even the United States has fallen. Eventually I want to do a group project around this idea but for now I just want to try it out and see what happens. \n\nI'd prefer to use discord if possible, message me your interest and we can discuss further details.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! First let me introduce myself;\nMy name is Danielle and I am from the UK. I'm an English 18y/o working a 9:00am - 5:30pm job as a Web Designer in a small town, basically meaning I am on a computer most of my time, so It is very easy for me to reply to messages at most times. I love making friends, gaming, and listening to all sorts of music. So, now that you know a bit about me...\nHere are some general things I expect when I roleplay with someone.\n\n- **Take things slow((. I do no want to rush the relationship of our characters. Yes, maybe they will gain feelings early on, or have a 'one night stand' approach, but I don't expect them to act on strong feelings straight away, and would like to long this out as much as we possibly can. We can talk this through on how their feelings will uncover and change over time.\n\n- **Atleast one or two replies a day** I understand if you're busy, because I am too! I work, play games, spend time with family...and i expect that you have things to do. But I would like you to make sure you can reply to the roleplay at least preferably two times in a day. If it's only once, i understand.\n\n- **Kindness and Respect** This is a simple one. Just be nice! I'm here to also make friends whilst roleplaying, so I would like us to get along. It makes for a great roleplay when we can happily share ideas with eachother!\n\n- **Be literate** I like well written out english in the roleplay. It doesn't have to be like Shakespeare, but you get the jist of it. Feel free to send me a roleplay sample!\n\nNow, I love nsfw themes. These include sexual scenes, gore, violence, drug abuse, alcohol abuse... many other things that we can discuss. Because of this I wish that you are 18+ , and that you\u2019re willing to discuss scenes like this with me so we know where we both stand and what we both want/don\u2019t want! I am very willing to have a 'fade to black' approach.\n\nOkay, so... *themes*. I'm actually looking for any that I will list down below, so in your pm please state with you are interested in, or any new ones you have in your mind and want to share! I'm open-minded, and would love to hear ideas from you, as this is a duo thing, and we are both involved.\n\n- **Superhero &amp; Girl** For this one, I was thinking of the 'superhero' being a Deadpool type of character, (or even Deadpool himself). Honestly, the character doesn't need to be a superhero as such, he can just be a guy with powers that fights bad guys, or even good guys! This would be up to you. I was imagining him having a comedic sense around him, and being a douchey/asshole type before meeting the girl, who I would be playing. I was aiming for the girl to be in an abusive workplace/relationship (my main idea is her being forced into prostitution with an abusive boss, etc). They would meet when the 'superhero' goes to fight crime near a petrol station, maybe there's been a robbery or something like that, and it's obviously very easy for him. The girl is standing outside the petrol station, light shining on her, and the superhero meets her eyes, obvious to him that she saw the whole thing. \nThey have a moment of gentle flirting (mainly from the guy), but she is obviously disinterested, and she flees. The 'superhero' becomes intrigued by her, as he has never been turned down before. So, he goes out to find her every day, and try talking to her, or getting her to open up to him. After a week of 'stalking' her, he witnesses her being abused by her boss. In shock, and unknowing to why he cares so much, he makes it his mission to save her. This will lead to romance between the two. (This is my favourite one, and most in depth one.)\n \n- **Apocalyptic** This one doesn't really have a specific plot line, it will just involve two teens/adults meeting in a post-apocalyptic world (zombies,nuclear etc) who have clashing personalities. Whether they meet in a roaming group outside of the quarantine zones, or meet inside a zone. Whether one of our characters has an immunity to the virus or they are both very vunerable... im up for anything! \n\n- **Slice of Life** Again, this doesn't have a specific plot line. All I'm looking for in this one is a romance story, MxF or FxF. For themes, I'm into: college/high school, dark themes, arranged marriage, reincarnation and dystopian. I am very open to ideas so feel free to just throw them at me!\n\n- **Overwatch** I can play most females in this genre.\n\n- **Marvel Universe** I can play Spiderman mainly from this one, but I am willing to try playing others. I am new to this genre though.\n\n- **Medieval Fantasy** For this one, I like utilizing mythical creatures, like elves, dragons, witches, wizards etc. I like playing princesses/princes, dragons, dragon trainers and wizards. I'm very open to ideas.\n\nI hope to hear from you! Thank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "It was just *one of those* times. Bruce and I had been fighting again. I don\u2019t even remember what it was about, something about a missing diamond or something like that... But that\u2019s not the point! The point is *I am done with him.* So foolish of me to think that a hero like him could have some fun. \n\nOf corse we would still have the awkward run-in in te city, that\u2019s just the nature of the job. And tonight was one of those nights. The Gotham museum just received an exquisite piece. A small monk statue coming from Nanda Parbat. Worth around a million dollars. Bats has to know that I just can\u2019t resist myself around that kind of things. So I was ready to face him. \n\nAt around midnight I snuck into the museum. [My black skin tight suit](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZSXg4) helping me disappear in the darkness. It only took about twenty minutes to case the place, or I should say, it only took twenty for me to find *you*. The little redhead on a bat costume. \n\n\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t even want to see me now? That\u2019s just cold.\u201d I say nonchalantly, already sitting on a ledge behind you. I saw your little jump and chuckled, so sweet to see you turn around in a fighting stance right after. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m enough to handle you.\u201d You said, so feisty and lively. \u201cBatman Warned me about you, Selina.\u201d\n\nMy eyes widen a bit. \u201cBruce even gave you my name? Oh he\u2019s been such a bad boy.\u201d I say dropping from the ledge I was sitting in. After a bit of a fist fight you were overpowered of course. It\u2019s not that your fighting was bad.... but it kind of was. \n\nSoon enough you\u2019re on your knees with me standing tall in front of you. A pair of zip ties both on your hands and feet should make this all much easier. \n\nThe glass breaks and boom! The small statue is on my hands. And once that\u2019s taken care of, I can give you my full attention again. \n\n\u201cI know who you are.\u201d I say stepping closer. \u201cYou\u2019re his oracle aren\u2019t you?\u201d My hands move close and one of my claws softly traces your jawline. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you on his ear, when we were together.\u201d \n\n\u201cBruce doesn\u2019t want you anymore.\u201d You reply with just as much fight in your tone as the first time. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. He\u2019s boring anyways.\u201d I say and softly slap your face. \u201cBut you... my darling you\u2019re a lot more fun than him.\u201d I say with a sly smile, seeing your eyes go wide with surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re not a gifted fighter or that good at hiding.\u201d I chuckle as the words come out of my mouth. \u201cBut I see potential.\u201d And of course, the biggest motive was to make Bruce jealous but I couldn\u2019t tell you that. \n\n\u201cWhy do you think I would want anything to do with you?\u201d You said. \n\n\u201cYou think Bruce did at first?\u201d I say and drop to my knees, both of my hands holding your cheeks as I leaned in, pressing my lips against yours. At first you were in shock and understandably didn\u2019t move but soon enough... I could feel it! Your own lips starting to come alive, corresponding mine as I bit your bottom lip, making sure to leave a little mark. \n\n\u201cSee?\u201d I saw with just a big of a smile as before. \u201cTell Bruce I stole this, tell him I beat your ass. But don\u2019t tell him about this.\u201d I say and pull out a small piece of paper, a number already written on it. I place it under your belt and stand up again. \u201cSee you soon darling.\u201d I say and kick over some stupid statue that was next to us. The loud alarm goes off and I disappear into the shadows. \n\n(Hey! If you\u2019ve read all the way down here. Thank you so much for taking the time! Of course this would probably end up as a long term idea, with Barbara and Selina starting an adventure that could end a million ways! Maybe you decide to leave bats for me, or we can try to keep the relationship secret? \n\nIf I\u2019m honest I was looking this to go sort of a romantic way, maybe we just like each other too much? \n\nI\u2019m not sure, I just sort of wrote this while daydreaming at class :P. \n\nOne thing I do ask from you is, please find a *real* faceclaim for Barbara. I picked Anne Hathaway for mine but you don\u2019t need someone who\u2019s played the character. \n\nI really hope to find some partners because this feels like one of better prompts &lt;3 thanks for reading!)

            "selftext": "Those were the words I heard before AL was shot. So acting on instincts, I heeded that command. Turning on my heel I started running as fast as my sneakers would carry me. I didn't have anything to defend myself with. After all, I never killed anyone. I was just a runner after all.\n\nI was stupid to have gotten into this. But I needed the money. I started out small, doing work for small gangs running drugs. I wasn't good at anything else. Eventually I'd become a notorious wheel for hire. Boosting cars and running off, only the tire marks signifying I was there. I ran bank jobs, drugs, get aways, and even saw some cars off into the sunset.\n\nI was feeling lucky. I took up a job for a series of contracts with a notorious gang. One that was so successful for reasons unknown. But that was my mistake. The only regret I had in this messed up nitro fueled life. because you see, they were so successful because they tied up loose ends. No mouths to report them to the feds. Sure, I'd gotten the job done. I got everyone back with their brains in their skulls. But AL, he knew what was about to happen. We exited the car and he turned to me.\n\n\"Run to the hills Dusty.\" He said still using the code name I'd gotten. None of us knew each other's actual names. Kept each other safe if one of us were captured by the feds. That's all we were to refer to each other as. Then the old Greying man was gunned down, some of his blood splashing onto on my jacket. So I turned and started running. They'd gotten all the other seats in my car but I was gone. Now was the time to run.\n\nAn engine started and I was gone. Except for an unmarked vehicle smashing into me. My vision started fading and I saw two figures exiting the front side of the car. Then I blacked out.\n\nNow where does Dusty here wake up? An interrogation room in some fed building? A drug room of another gang? The boiler room of the gang I was running from? I'm giving you some freedom here. Be creative.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you",

I highly recommend seeing if it piques your interest!*\n\nFor as long as Conludia's 8 kingdoms have stood, the tradition of Guardianship has continued. As a powered human, devoting your life in service to your liege was considered the ultimate honour - or at least, that was tradition.\n\nNowadays, perceptions can vary from contempt to fear. It is no longer customary for every royal to appoint Guardians upon ascending the throne. That is, until a series of suspect Guardian disappearances was recently uncovered. In the wake of this revelation, that something could be taking out some of the most powerful individuals known to man, each kingdom has rushed to appoint more Guardians to allay their panic. \n\nBut will these new Guardians be any more successful than their predecessors? And what of the courts, who stop their plotting for no one?\n\n###HIGHLIGHTS\n* **Leave a legacy**: Brand new roleplay means that you get to shape the world and direction of the plot!\n* **Flexible &amp; Inclusive**: Play however you like.

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs\n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

            "selftext": "**Condemned Memories:** *Shining Through the Trees*\n\n**General Setting:**\n\nIt is the beginning of April, the cherry trees are in bloom and our characters have finally broken their chains of youth. They are ready and eager to begin their lives as adults. Our characters have gained admittance to a private university situated in the heart of Tokyo, right outside the Takadanobaba Station, called Kanda International. The university caters to students who come from all walks of life, from London, New York, Dublin, and of course Tokyo itself, these students are proud of their culture but are interested in bolstering their grasp of the English and Japanese languages.\n\nAs our characters mingle and get to know one another, they continue to study and do their best academically. Their lives are taking shape as they find themselves settled into their Japanese History class, under the guide of their favorite professor. He has a way of engaging the class in a casual manner which most other professors at K.I, seem to lack. It is during one of his games that our group is rewarded with special stones, according to Mr. Haplin anyway. Our characters are doubtful of their significance but end up keeping them anyway because they're pretty attractive, as far as rocks go.\n\nOn an adventure to the nearby mountain, Kawanoriyama, the group stumbles upon something extraordinary. In the middle of the dense greenery there is a lighthouse. It is made of white stone and stands at least nine feet high, peeking through the lofty canopy of leaves. And yet according the maps, the lighthouse doesn't seem to exist. Our characters will embark on a journey into the past by seeing what secrets the lighthouse holds and what sort of powers these rocks actually possess. \n\n**General Info:**\n\n- I am seeking 1-2 other RPers for this story. If we finish this, I do have another plot in mind for another one we could tackle, if interested. But that it a long way out.\n\n- The pace of this is pretty relaxed. While I don't want us having to post every day, I do want the RP to still move forward without a lot of prolonged silences between posts. I would love 2-3 posts a week ideally since this is a small group, we shouldn't have to wait too long for one another.\n\n- In regards to a regular post size, I'd love to see about 3 paragraphs, more is welcome but no less than 3 please. And the posts should be in past tense, third person.\n\n- If you're curious if we really go back in time, we do not but we will be learning a lot about the history of the lighthouse itself.\n\n- Our characters will be 19 years old and will be living in the same on campus dorm. There will be build up before they make it to the lighthouse itself. The characters should be given enough depth that they come to life. This is a small group who becomes friends, who explores the Tokyo nightlife together, at the core of this story is friendship and curiosity. This is very slice of life with a dab of history and fantasy.\n\n- **Link here:** https://discord.gg/GsuCnMR",

The husk of the planet lives on as a shadow of its former majesty, inhabited by the last remnants of its people. They are divided into petty, tyrannical kingdoms, ruled by fear, superstition and poverty. In the wastelands strange, fearsome beasts roam and lurk, preying on the vestiges of the dead planet's population. Deep in the scorched southern deserts, rumours of a stronghold of psychic mutants filter along the caravan routes, the rumours state that they plot the conquest of the planet.**\n\n\n**Feared and loathed more than even the beasts of the wastelands are the wizards of the science cults. Men who collect the scientific artifacts of the dead civilisation which once made Hyperion its home. The legends of the nuclear holocausts say that it was the scientists who created the terrible weapons which ravaged the planet and created the living hell they now endured. The people of this dead world believe that the wizards will bring about yet another holocaust though no warlord on the face of the planet is willing to challenge the science cults.**\n\n\n**The planet is on the brink of collapse but some retell the old legends, they say that one will come to unite the planet and lead it into a new golden age. Are these merely fairytales or are they prophecy?**\n\n\nHello, so I've laid out the general premise of the setting above. This is a bit different in that it's a mix of a sword and sorcery fantasy setting and a futuristic science fiction setting with some post-apocalypse thrown in for good measure. This is a completely original world, I've drawn inspiration from a number of quite different sources and brought them all together into what I hope is an interesting and unique setting.\n\n\nI'm looking for someone to write in this world with me. Someone who is able to move the story along and build the world up as the story progresses, someone who can write to a good standard (at least 2-3 decent paragraphs). I can't always post every single day but I usually get a few posts out per week during weekdays. I'm looking for someone who is 18+ as this is going to be a dark and gritty setting that will have adult themes. I only use email for roleplaying as it means I can write while I'm at work which increases my posting activity quite a bit.\n\n\nIf you're interested PM me and we can discuss this further.",

I have a good few years RP experience and have used various sites though things have slowed to a halt for me to the point where I don\u2019t RP much these days except with one person. I use various apps as well and that can be discussed to choose whichever is preferable. I\u2019m honestly very laid back when it comes to RP and I\u2019m fine with most concepts as long as both of us are comfortable. And of course, having fun! \n\nI\u2019d also be up for RPing with a Logan (Wolverine) with my OC. Or Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. I have written for both Tony and Pepper before though my preference is Pepper. \n\nAny of these can simply be platonic relationships. We can discuss matters and decide if we want any of them to be romantically involved. While I don\u2019t mind writing some NSFW I do prefer actual storytelling and working on a plot. \n\nI\u2019m also from the UK, 21+ and I\u2019m fairly quick on replies. Though replies will be slower during the week while I\u2019m at work. I do prefer para/multi para to one liners. Lemme know if interested :3",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am writing this to seek out one new writing partner. I have embarked on the long and arduous journey towards a PhD, which will limit my availability considerably. But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nI'd like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. I would also love a Dragon Age Inquisition plot. I'm no expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed the game.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",

Here are a few rules I'd like to point out before we get much further. \n\n- 3rd person, past tense \n- Be literate. I write somewhere about 2+ paragraphs per post. Sometime less if there isnt much going on but never less then a paragraph. Be able to match that please.\n- Dont ghost me! If you arent feeling the roleplay just tell me. I'm a big girl, I'll understand and we can either leave it at that or come up with something else to do. \n\nI think that's all the main ones. As for genre I'm up for anything really.

I've created a new server on discord in which people will be able to rp using the pathfinder rules.\n\nWe're looking for staffs \\(moderators, dms\\) as well as players.\n\nThe idea is for players to create characters and interact with each other, and for the dms to create small 'sessions' in the world in which the player will be able to participate for loot and xp. Eventually, after the players play a while, they can create a second and third character.For now, the setting is Forgotten Realms, in 1373 DR, and more specifically, the city of Waterdeep and its surroundings.\n\nWe'll start small and looking to expand.

I work in an office all day, and I find myself booooooooooooored out of my mind wanting someone to toss ideas around with.\n\nI play F/F, M/M and anything in between but not super fond of F/M. Would love more F/F centered rps. Note that I do not rp with anyone under the age of 18.\n\nI love romance and smut that's cheesier than a grilled cheese. However, I need it to feel compelling. I want the characters to have chemistry and a good plot is a MUST. I do pretty casual back and forths over IM consisting mainly of dialogue, typically one paragraph or so.\n\nThings I love: D&amp;D inspired fantasy! Elves and Mages, Sci Fi, Aliens, Modern settings, future settings, College/high school settings. Imaginative scenarios as well as cliche ones. LOL. Student/teacher, etc. People who are quick witted and funny. I like fandom as well as OC's and am equally happy playing both\n\nFandoms I love: Overwatch, Stranger things, The Elder Scrolls, The Fallout Universe, Black panther, Mad Max, Game of thrones, The Thor movies (mmmm Thorki)\n\nThings I don't care for: Novel posts/ 3+ paragraph replies. People who say \"anything is fine with me!\". I am really good at popping off ideas, but I need someone to go back and forth with. Please have opinions and preferences. \n\nFor more detailed Yums and Yucks, you'll have to ask me, as r/roleplay wants to keep their content PG. \n\nAnyway yeah! if it sounds like we would get along, please send me a message and we can have a chat.

I\u2019m GMing a Tails of Equestria Tabletop RPG on Roll20, and we are looking for more players. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n The premise is:\n\n*The Mane Six have taken on apprentices to replace them as controllers of their elements so they can focus on other things. However, while they\u2019re still in training, a new threat to Equestria emerges; ponies seem to be becoming corrupted, becoming more and more aggressive towards one another. Now it\u2019s up to their apprentices to figure out what\u2019s going on, and how to save their mentors!*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA couple quick notes:\n\n- Discord is recommended. We make most of our announcements with it. \n\n- Game runs on Roll20.net every Saturday at 8:00PM EST, currently scheduled to start on May 12th. If, after you join, there\u2019s any reason you can\u2019t make it or are going to be running late, please let us know! We\u2019ll do the same!\n\n- We are currently only looking for someone to take over Loyalty, as the other elements have been filled. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, send me a note or post a comment and let me know!\n",

Just a theme (or fandom) a character and just go. I've found myself at odds with others over this in the past, maybe I'm too casual?\n\nJust to as some additional information, I'm LGBT+ friendly, romance friendly, mature content friendly, an adult, chill, and pretty much a huge nerd. As far as my RP interests, sci-fi as a whole and a lot of anime fandom stuff -- it's a bit of a list and I'm willing to discuss topics. I also enjoy Marvel too, though I'm less knowledgeable about everything. Video game fandom I enjoy are Fallout, Mass Effect, and even dare I say Destiny.

The game begins with the World\u2019s Fair where the major countries come together in the name of progress and innovation. However, in the south, those same major countries vie for dominance over the sea and skies and scramble to colonize the treacherous continent of Alkebu. It is up to you to swing the direction of our world and discover the secrets that will lead you on an adventure of your own making.\n\nIn Black Skies RP, you can create a character with a unique set of skills and abilities. As the conflict and tensions grow between countrymen, roll the dice for a successful rebellion. Or attempt to explore the hidden secrets of Alkebu, or invent new technologies to improve the world. Black Skies RP features rebellion mechanics, battle mechanics, mechanically-supported character growth, and the most steampunk-y of all \u2013 alchemy mechanics that will help create, invent, and shape the world around you - from the biggest invention to the smallest. The possibilities are endless, and with some creativity, collaboration with others, writing, and a spot of luck you can craft all sorts of stories.\n\nWe are a text based roleplaying game and no matter what your skill level of writing, we invite you to come, check us out, and join a community of steampunk enthusiasts in a world that is all our own.

Totally up to you! \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs\n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

The setting is an original universe that we will organically build with the story. Don't be afraid to lift elements from other universes.\n\nI expect us to write on a googledocs file. I would like to arrange times that we can work on the story together. Since it's gdocs we can also edit independently on our own time.\n\nI like multi-layered stories and characters with psychological depth. We can include and play as many characters as the narrative calls for, but we should have at least two main characters. Content can range from any genre and style but must fit within a superhero framework.\n\nI would like to include romance, probably as a sub-plot but it can be the main focus of the story. Story elements must be discussed before we start up.\n\nSome ideas:\n- We are two young heroes that have started dating as we both try to adjust to independence. We try to juggle our individual superheroics, romance, work and other obligations in a world seemingly on the brink of apocalypse every day.\n- I am a hero and you are a villain (or vice versa) but in spite of our different positions on the law, we grow on each other.\n\nPM me if you're interested/would like to ask questions.",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\n\nSo, It's pretty much as the title says. The basic premise is that it is parallel world to ours where both humans and mutants co-exist. Mutants are registered by the government and have to get through a special training camp to use their powers in public and to act as super-police of sorts. As per usual, with super human abilities - there's going to be people who would abuse the abilities or control the mutants. I was planning on this being a mix of action, adventure and espionage based roleplay. I'd be happy to get discuss details if you feel this something you'd be up for. You are free to design your own OC as you see fit of course. \n\n\nOnly requirement is that you be 18+ and write in 3rd. \n\n\n**Writing Style and Length:** I write in the third person and length in average is around three to four paragraphs. Might be more or less depending on the required response. I enjoy writing a mixture of plot-based and character-based adventure roleplays with dialogue heavy banter between the main two characters. Romance between characters is great if it fits but isn't a necessity.  I can provide a sample of my old writing if asked for one.\n\n\n**Frequency and Medium:** I am generally good for at least one response per day at the very least. If I have free time, I might respond more. If for any reason, I'm unable to write for a couple of days, I'll let you know beforehand. As for medium, I prefer email but am open to using anything that is not mobile based. As for OOC chat, I use discord but not for the story itself.\n\n\n**NSFW?:** I'm okay with blood, gore and sex but only if it applies to the setting and the plot. Again, if it needs to be forced, then probably not worth it.\n\n\nSo if you feel you're interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you guys soon.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nDevoid",

            "selftext": "Hello All,\n\nI have been looking for the last little bit to get a roleplay partner again, so I can begin writing a little bit more. At this time, I don't have many limitations or rules when it comes to roleplays, but I know that I want my roleplays to 18+, open to anything and everything, and involve some adult writing as well as I want to practice that a bit more. But, anything would truly go.\n\nI usually like to roleplay in some sort of instant messenger type of communication as it allows for quick and easy out of character chat, but if you would prefer to chat over Reddit that would be great as well. Last resort for me would be email as I feel that is the slowest out of all the forms. I love a fast roleplay so that whenever the two of us are together at the same time, we can push forward as quickly or slowly as possible.\n\nI usually write in the present tense, third person. I like to keep entry to right around three to five paragraphs long, maybe even as short as a sentence or full paragraph during communication or romance scenes. I prefer to mainly write male characters, but could play female characters as well. In my time, I have done everything from medieval to slice of life to futuristic, so we can discuss that a little more when you message me.\n\nI really don't like to dive to far into fandoms, as I would prefer the world building aspect as well as the original content aspect of my roleplays. If you would like your character to be based off of characters in a different fandom, that would be fine, however, please be original. Also, if you can write multiple NPC's as well as your main, that would be great. I definitely can't wait to hear from you and get to writing as soon as possible.",

Unless it is dialogue and the character is standing completely still and not emoting at all like a robot, you can make it more than a few sentences.\n\nScheduling: I can post +3 times a day if it happens to be a lighter day for me, but life happens. I get it. I expect at least one post from you a day unless you are going through a life or death situation. You feeling a bit ill should not hamper your RP abilities. If you feel that once a day is too restrictive, leave now.\n\nContent: I prefer to play straight male characters, and I expect my partner to play a straight female. However, I do not force romance or smut between characters, as I feel that romance needs to naturally evolve between two characters. I also follow book canon, but can adjust to show canon if necessary\n\nPlot: I am most flexible with plot, and will compromise heavily on plot points. I have RP'd just about every role in Game of Thrones, from Flea Bottom thief to a Lannister Lord.\n\nHere are some of my more specific interests:\n\nMargaery X Robb\n\nCatelyn X Brandon\n\nAshara X Ned\n\nIf any of that interests you, shoot me a PM.\n",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m a literate writer, who\u2019s looking to roleplay a story about a sweet celebrity romance. Finding romance as a celebrity must be tough, especially with all the trials and tribulations fame and fortune bring. I want to develop a story of a young famous celebrity who has trouble finding love, or perhaps isn\u2019t even interested in love, to find it where she least expects it. I want this to be realistic, sweet, sensual, flirty, and romantic. Perhaps even taboo, if that romance is with a much older man or someone they shouldn\u2019t be with. \n\nLooking for female writers who are interested in getting into the mind and body of a celebrity, and who wants to develop that character naturally and in a way that seems real. Romance will be a big focus of this roleplay, and with much of romance, smut may be involved. Please be comfortable with writing smut, if the story evolves that way. \n\nI am not expecting novels to be written between us, but I am capable of writing multiple paragraphs if my partner wishes. I generally write according to how my partner does, to fit with their style and sensibilities, as I\u2019m a versatile writer who can fit the level and need of any partner I\u2019m with. \n\nI generally get along with partners who\u2019re easy going, friendly, and sociable. Who are open minded and aren\u2019t quick to judge.  Someone I can be friends with OOC as much as IC. \n\nI\u2019d want us to discuss the setting, characters, and direction of the story before getting into it. \n\nSome celebrities I\u2019d be interested in playing for this prompt:\n\nGenevieve Hannelius, Sabrina Carpenter, Sophie Turner, Rowan Blanchard, Auli'i Cravalho, Haillee Steinfeld, Daisy Ridley, Emilia Clarke, Shailene Woodley, Rosabell Laurenti Sellers, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Brie Larson.\n\nOpen to many other celebrities too. If you\u2019re interested, please put the celeb you want to play as in the title of the subject. ",

I enjoy people playing Canon characters! though OCs are fine, But in all honesty I'd prefer the canons, but don't be afraid to contact me for an OC type thing. I myself am going to be playing an OC ( A male one, just for clarification.), and don't mind giving you a run-down of what I'm looking for plot wise and etc. So please, feel free to contact me at your leisure to ask and learn!~ I'm eager to find more roleplaying partners. As for what I'd prefer people's post length to be? I don't mind at all to have a short post, ones ranging from a paragraph to four to three sentences are my preference, as I don't enjoy multi-paragraph posts due to them being slow.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!  \n\nI'm interested in doing an rp that involved rival gang leaders having to come together and work towards a common goal.  They could either be having to play nice to avoid cops coming into their areas and beginning to shut things down.  Or another gang could have popped up and both of them want to take it down, so they pick the lesser of two evils and decide to work together.  Or if neither of those sound like a fun idea, we can brain storm and come up with a new plot!  I'm pretty open to different plots.\n\nIn the roleplay I prefer to roleplay in third person and like to keep responses to a few paragraphs.  I feel that it helps to build the characters and the story more.\n\nIn the story, I don't mind dark themes and NSFW scenes.  There in a gang, so strong language and core should be expected.  I would like to eventually develope a relationship with our characters, so it'll be a forbidden love kind of thing. \n\nI'm okay with basically any kind of character pairing whether it's F/M, F/F, or M/M.  I'm comfortable doing any of those, so I'll leave it up for you to decide.  \n\nIf you're interested, and me a PM and we can work out the details.  I usually roleplay on Discord, but the PM is fine too",

It looks like I live alone and maintain the farm also, it's just what you've been looking for, plenty of space.\n\nAs your eyes follow me throughout the house, I start blowing out lanterns until I reach my bedroom, stripping out of my clothing, giving you a long look at your future husband, my body chiselled, firm and slender. Then, as I blow out the last lantern, darkness... The house is asleep, and so am I, maybe it's time to wake me up?\n\n(Thanks for Reading!

For a price.\nYou would be the main character, keeping track of all the clients and my sessions with them, while alternating between all of my clients.\nMaybe we hire the monstergirls that can help us around the farm/brothel, or just keep the ones we like in the house as permanent residents?\nThis can go however you like, and I am totally open to changes.\nThanks again for reading and hopefully I've sparked your interest!)\n\nIf you want to talk on Discord, it's the same as my username.\n\nFavorite Kinks: Cum Addiction, Cumsluts, Cock Worship, Cock Milking, Multiple women, Romance, Large assets, Sizeplay, Dom/Sub, Ageplay, Incest, Ass play, titfucks.",

I'm looking for a (or maybe a couple) literate to advanced partners to help me build and play out some creative and original roles. We can either start from scratch or you can tell me something you've had in mind. \n\nI have no real limits besides incest (yes, that includes violence up to death and gore) and really like trying new roles, so if you have any you've been thinking of, shoot me a PM. If it's new, I'd love to try. I'm pretty active and can roleplay in paragraphs or one-liners, whichever works best for the roleplay, but do prefer a few sentences. By NSFW, I do mean smut, yes, but all the other and much darker things that term covers. Though I can do roleplays where smut might be the main part of the story, I do enjoy ones where it's more a dominant, but not primary component. \n\nIn terms of genres, I'm really into horror/thriller, fantasy, sci-fi, historical and apocalypse, but am open to other as well. I don't do fandoms sorry. \n\nAnyways, send me a PM if any of this interests you. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "By the end of the first day, it was already over. The world as humanity knew it, gone in the blink of an eye. No one knows where it started, how they got here. Many refuse to believe that their society fell to demons at all. The few pockets of survivors floundered in the wake of the demons' arrival. How can they hope to stand against a threat of this magnitude? There is no one to save them. And some believe that it is only a matter of time, that they are already too late to save themselves.\n\nThe southern dorms fell to the demonic hordes first. It'd happened so fast, been over so quickly, none of them stood a chance at getting out alive. But their sacrifice gave their fellows time, a chance to grab what little they could and flee before the demons came for them. But as they stood, miles from their fallen home, the other witches realized that this newfound safety was only temporary. The demons would move on. They would be found again. For now, though, all they could do was wait, and prepare for the inevitable. They would find a way to destroy the evil that took their home - or they would die trying.\n\nThey'd heard it on the news, before the station was overrun and the city went dark. In the confusion that followed, the pack found themselves venturing north. Their alpha claimed that demons couldn't be used to the bitter winds and harsh winters the land would subject them to, that they would be safer there. The werewolves would be safe - they had fur, after all, and were more accustomed to the climate. But there were whispers of uncertainty, some doubting that they would make it to safety before the demons caught up to them. Even if they were to make it...how did their alpha plan to survive?\n\nHe'd long since ceased his pacing around the room like a caged tiger. There was nothing for it - the sun was still up, and like it or not, he was stuck here in this godforsaken room until night fell. Not that he was worried, of course. Unlike the sorry saps that had woken him up with their screaming, he was capable of holding his own against the hellish nightmare that had all but destroyed the city. Well, long enough for him to flee, at least. Immortal or not, he didn't plan to stick around once the sun set.\n\nEverywhere he turned, fires burned and rubble littered the street. There were bodies, of course. Far too many to count, if he'd cared to do so. Humans dropped like flies all the time - they were so terribly fragile it was almost laughable. He'd witnessed a entire squad of police officers ravaged by a *hell hound*, of all things! Still, the situation as it was now could not stand. They could not afford to have the riff-raff running amok and killing indiscriminately. Not without the Queen's permission, at least. The demonic scout grimaced as the screams of several survivors started up once again. Such a distasteful noise - one he would be glad to be rid of. He had a report to make to the Queen, and, thankfully, an excuse to return to Hell without further interference.\n\n~~~\n\nHello, hello!\n\nAs you read, demons have escaped from the Negative Plane and are running wild across our plane! You would be playing one of the few survivors/fighters. You can be any one of the species I have described above in this RP (even a demon!). I have set up lore for each other them, but I'm open to suggestions on changes!\n\nThere is a plot I have in mind, but I want each character to still have motivation to keep living without my plot. I want to keep this RP driven, but give everyone room to be able to do something they love with their character.\n\nThis is a detailed RP, so we expect 2-4 paragraphs per reply (exceptions do apply). I hope this will encourage people of all schedules to join in! I intend to do my best to keep everyone involved no matter what time you wake up or go to bed! We also expect that players who join will be proactive with their characters. We wish to build a story together, but sometimes time constraints come up, so having other plots to follow will keep things going.\n\nHere is the link to the server:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/sj6nWZg\n\nI look forward to preparing you for the end of the world!",

I don't mind a lot more or a little bit less as long as there is momentum to the story. If I wanted to write something by myself I wouldn't be here, lol.\n\n\\- I have almost no triggers and don't mind adult situations. I won't jump right into ERP/NSFW sex but I'm open to fade to blacks.\n\n**WHAT I WANT TO RP:**\n\n\\- Basically any World of Warcraft setting. We can take the lore and make up our own ideas, or go with the current world situation, or go back in time. I just really want to do something WoW\\-related.\n\n\\- Fandom mash! Which is basically taking a few fandoms and smashing them together to create something interesting and new. Sorta like taking Mass Effect and smashing Star Wars into it for Jedi vs Reapers or something insane like that. This would be mostly us talking about what we like and seeing what we create.\n\n\\- A Court of Thorns and Roses setting. It would be set outside of the canon since it's a very well\\-populated world and the canon characters took all the fun roles, lol.\n\n\\- I am going to play a female character no matter what the setting is. I am burnt out on playing dudes for awhile as I have been exclusively playing male characters for about 3 years now.\n\nInterested? Hit me up!",

I\u2019m extremely knowledgeable in the lore, not so much ASOIAF but the TV show I am. \nAnyways my name is Lewis, and I require a semi literate partner and I write in 1st but can do 3rd if you would like. Smut will be involved but will not be the main focus, but I like smut in a roleplay. \nI have a few ideas;\n1) We are settlers caught up in Daenerys\u2019 conquest of Westeros\n2) (OC\u2019s or not, I don\u2019t mind) Arranged marriage to secure alliance as Daenerys has just arrived at Dragonstone\n3) We are knights in an army and have a love interest in each other which is heavily frowned upon. \n4) I am assigned to your queensguard (open to interpretation)\nAnyways I\u2019m open to any ideas you might have!

            "selftext": "Being a cosplayer is fun. You get to meet people at conventions, you get to step into the shoes of someone from quite literally a while other world, and for a brief, shining glimmer all eyes are on you. If you could catch a passing glimpse of her, you\u2019d think Ally had it all. Her social media presence was unparalleled in the cosplay community and she ruled every convention she went to. She had more fans than anyone, including her, would say she deserves. But she doesn\u2019t feel whole, she\u2019s not happy. Everyone sees the happy persona she puts up but no one sees the sleepless nights alone, no one knows what she looks like without the costumes and makeup. At every convention she would be surrounded by fans, and she never felt more alone. Until you came along.\n\nJust something I thought of while browsing cosplay sites online today. Looking for someone to tell a sweet story of romance and coming to grips with one\u2019s demons. I\u2019ll be playing the cosplayer and id like you to play the love interest. Either gender will do! I\u2019m good for MxF or FxF. This will be an SFW roleplay so no smut. I write in 3rd person paragraph form, so literacy is a MUST. As far as post length goes I prefer quality over quantity, but don\u2019t phone it in. I want this to be mostly happy but real life isn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows so it\u2019ll get dark and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m happy to discuss potential ideas for the story with anyone interested, just PM me and we\u2019ll talk :D",

            "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\n Firstly thank you for taking the time to read this promot :). A little bit about me. I have been role playing for around ten years now so have indulged in many different role play types ranging from modern to medevil ... Fantasy to slide of life :). I typically post at least a paragraph but I typically multi-paragraph if I'm honest , that being said I would like a partner who could match my descriptive nature and use the same type of style when playing. I don't accept one liners and I would like some effort put into the role play... I hate being the one to lead all the time I really enjoy a partner who can add there own creative flares into the role play :). I'm seeking a partner for long term play. I really enjoy character development and plot creating long term play really helps to develop this :). I love romance so would really like that involved , NSFW scenes included naturally ... How much?.. That's up to us of course! I'm not shy of NSFW scenes and enjoy acting them out, no fade to black here :). Below is a few ideas of what we could do! Please take a read of them. The ideas below are not all I will do there just there to give an idea to what we could do! I would really like to hear anything you have in mind if none of the below interest you.\n\n\n1) a pretty woman type scene. this is based of my favourite film \u201cpretty woman \u201c i want to make it our own and twig a few of the details. The basis is a woman who gets mixed up in a wealthy business mans life ( i have loads of sub ideas around this to keep it interesting , message me for more details around this.... this role play is one I REALLY want to do :3 ) \n\n\n2) fantasy - seeking fantasy based role play , would prefer modern times . Vampires/werewolves/demons/Angels/magical creatures etc. Anything will go here! Would prefer it to be a world where humans are oblivious to the fantasy world around them!. Perhaps even something like shadow hunters? ( if you have read that if not I can explain a bit about it to give an idea :) )\n\n\n3) marvel based!.... Seeking something from the X-men universe . Would love for there to be a storm And wolverine pairing involved happy to include other X-men characters or we can create our own! Plenty of action/drama to be involved here :)\n\n4) medevil - hunter and the princess - looking to act out a scene where a bounty hunter takes up the task of kidnapping a princess from a rival kingdom with the intention of using her as bait in the war that's sparking around them... ( please message me and we can discuss more into this :) ))\n\n\nI'm very versatile so will happily try anything with the right storyline, just pop me a message and we can discuss more about any of the ideas above or anything you have in mind. I should point out I'm not a spelling and grammar nazi don't worry if you make a few mistakes as long as it's readable :). Thanks for taking the time to read through this! Hoping to hear from some of you soon :). ",

            "selftext": "Seven hundred years ago magic, as well as the powerful demons that plagued mankind, dissapeared from the isolated continent of Ostanna. In the following centuries the once fractured and tribal communities of humanity grew into grand nation states, true civilisation opposed to warring clans. The next few hundred years saw unprecedented social and technologic development. Now, airships allow easy transportation and trade across the continent for the workshop factories that produce continuous streams of cheap goods. Cities of hundreds of thousands shine bright even in the darkest of nights due to warm glowing gas lamps. Gunpowder and explosives has revolutionised warfare into something too brutal and costly to become commonplace. Many arguments have been made questioning whether mankind's ability for magic was merely holding back the species and that only without its destructive force could we rise above stagnating barbarism.\n\nThen, as if tempted by mankind's arrogant disregard, magic was rediscovered. A powerful and dangerous 'Dark Art' that came in the form of an eldritch, inhuman language. Merely thinking in 'Demonic' turned ones mind into a tool, into a weapon with the capacity to bring forth the long gone Demons as destructive forces of nature. This Witchcraft provoked a new magical arms race between the myriad human nations, with ambitious imperial minded states already claiming expansive conquests and more peaceful trader kingdoms rejecting any chance of finding themselves defenceless. Yet the fear of magic persists, and the strength of the emerging magical institutions remains extremely limited as they try to both teach and research the emerging art.\n\nYou have lived your whole life within one of these less violent countries, specifically the coastal Kingdom of Oltoria. It is a nation built on a back bone of wealthy guilds and even wealthier aristocratic houses, but unfortunately you belong to neither. As an orphan, you would have been doomed to a life of grim poverty in the always growing slums of Oltoria's port capital where it not for being 'adopted' by a mysterious talking cat who claims to have been preparing your entire life for one of magical grandeur. \n\nToday is the date of the annual Oltorian Witchcraft Institution Intake, a day you have been preparing for your entire life. The chances of acceptance are slim, but the potential future that lies ahead, the escape from the slums, the fantastical power, the act of rubbing shoulders with the noble elite, is well.worth the effort. \n\n-\n\nThank you for reading! That was a brief introduction to my original fantasy world, a world I hope you'll enjoy exploring and meeting characters in. I don't consider this to be a 'Magic School' story akin to Harry Potter, rather something with larger stakes and high fantasy shenanigans. However, it does indeed start with your character enlisting in a college that teaches magic.\n\nI am looking for someone willing to roleplay as a 17-19 year old young woman who can type detailed responses in third or first person. The reason I ask for a female character is because I believe the greater story is more impactful and generally better if the protagonist is female. \n\nI will be taking on the role of the 'DM', describing the settings, playing the majority of supporting characters and be responsible for making sure the story is coherent and flows properly while taking into account your characters own agency. It goes without saying that I'll be writing in third person. One of the main reasons I roleplay is to entertain my partner, I am to use this control to tell the most enjoyable story for you to star in, and hopefully, also become immersed in!\n\nI prefer KIK as an app to use, but will use Discord if KIK is unavailable. I'm a nineteen year old guy living in London, which means I operate off of GMT, however, I don't think small timezone differences (under six or seven hours) will be much of a problem as I sleep late and send lengthy messages anyway. The roleplay may well bring up rather dark themes or include rather graphic imagery and I'd like my partner to be 18+. Of course, there's no way of knowing that you really are 18+, but at least tell me so for peace of mind! Similarly, smut is not strictly off the table, although it's not a focus of the story and will only happen if the plot justifies it, even then, it's ultimately your characters decision to accept the scene or not. \n\nIf this interests you, please don't hesitate to send me a PM and I'll get back to you within a few hours! Please tell me the timezone you are in and feel free to ask any questions you might have about the roleplay. \n\nIf you aren't interested but are really bored, please tell me why you don't want to roleplay with me! I will appreciate the insight into why my idea didn't appeal to you and hopefully be able to avoid the problem in future roleplay ideas.\n\nValrald",

            "selftext": "Following the Fourth Shinobi World War, peace was settled, as per usual.\n\nA proposal was set forward for a new village to be settled, larger than the rest, and containing mixed villagers from the many other locations across the nation in order to symbolize the new agreements being made. Following a few technological advances and a boom of industry following the war, a village known as Taiy\u014dgakure \\(Village Hidden by the Sun\\) was founded. It uses massive wind turbines to generate its own electricity and houses several cooperative research centers, including one for altering weather to extend farming seasons. A tall spire is housed in the center of the town that serves as a center for most of the research, often with weather balloons and zeppelins launching from a dock at the top of the spire on a platform.\n\nThe village, at the beginning of this roleplay, is only a year old. It is a center for research and mostly a symbolic effort \\- and isn't without its problems. Though there are spats here and there between villagers from different lands, it is slowly forming its own identity and beginning to absorb those living there into its own culture.\n\nYou will be a citizen of this new village. This village is the majority setting for the roleplay, but not the entire setting. Think of it as like the big hub.\n\nEveryone will start at genin \\- but there will be ample opportunity for character development, growth, and increase of status in the world of shinobi as many phenomenon begin to unravel in a post\\-war world. \n\n[https://discord.gg/QmGB7Ba](https://discord.gg/QmGB7Ba)",
