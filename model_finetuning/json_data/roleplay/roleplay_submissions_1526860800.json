I don't know if this is a normal sort of post, so bear with me. \n\nA long time ago a romantic interest ran something like this, where he let me explore what he believed his mind to be. It felt so close, so intimate, and I think that's what I've been missing. Not looking for anything necessarily dirty, just to get to know someone by exploring their imagination. Whatever your mindscape is, if you're willing to take an adventurer to learn the depths of your character, meet the parts of your psyche, or simply get in too deep and lost in the jungle of your past and present, this might be for you. If that sounds interesting to you, feel free to send a message and we can talk further!",

            "selftext": "There were better ways to kill time or spend a night, he could have stayed in and kept to himself instead of burning the money in his pocket. As always, he willingly found himself back in the familiar bar with a sour taste in his mouth that he associated with a hangover. At some point in the early morning he had to have vacated the contents of his stomach. The bat must have been closed, but the staff knew him well enough to put him at the end of the list of things to take care of. Nathaniel had made a habit of occupying the last stall in the men\u2019s room, if he didn\u2019t make it out the front door at some point in the night that\u2019s where he could be found. Long, spindly legs stretched out across the dirty tile floor of the bathroom, his back against the stall wall, he finally forced himself to open his eyes and focus on the florescent bulbs above him. He could hear them buzzing with current and someone in the kitchen cleaning, likely the orc who usually worked Thursday nights, he\u2019d come in here and force Nate out last before he locked up.\n\u00a0\nHis heavy eyelids closed again and when they opened the large male orc was standing in front of him, arms crossed stubbornly over his broad chest. \u201cGet out Nate, I want to go home,\u201d he sounded exasperated. As far as orcs went the man was kind enough, not that they actually had a history of accepting humans on any level socially. \u201cRight, right,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0a sharp, pungent exhale left the wolf and he stood up, a hand braced against the stall door for support. The room spun a few times but he forced himself to find some semblance of balance and exit the bathroom, then the bar all together. \u201cSee you tomorrow night?\u201d Nathaniel nodded as the door closed and locked behind him. Lycanthropy was generally a sickness strictly associated with humans, to make his own situation even more complicated Nathaniel had forcefully bypassed the social hierarchy generally associated with that sickness and steered away from tradition. Other humans, orcs, elves, they were all trouble and should be approached with the utmost caution. Nate couldn\u2019t be bothered with sticking to pack dynamics, not at this particular chapter of his life at least. He had deviated away from what was expected of him, moved away from the culture and community he\u2019d been born into. The pull of the large city had been too much, that had been years ago and it hadn\u2019t been kind to him. Werewolves rarely lived more than a few years on their own, there had been a study out there somewhere but the numbers were likely skewed. Werewolves were technically required to register, but most didn\u2019t because of the stigma.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to wake up,\u201d someone was urging, a voice that he didn\u2019t recognize or want to acknowledge. The original plan had been to go home and sleep this off, but at some point in the early hours of the morning he had curled up on a park bench instead.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDetails: So this is my introduction, it\u2019s an original character that I\u2019ve been working on for a while. The world he occupies is base loosely off of bright (Netflix) if you haven\u2019t seen it that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s simply a world where all of the fantasy creatures are basically out in the open and living among the human population. Elves are one percenters, orcs aren\u2019t generally accepted and humans are somewhere in between. You can be a witch, another werewolf, an orc, an elf, a human,\u00a0\u00a0whatever you want to be! I generally prefer to interact through discord and write in google docs but I can adapt to whatever you prefer. Nathaniel is an alcoholic mess of a werewolf and I\u2019d just love for just about anyone to interact with him. I\u2019d be interested in romance, m/m is preferred but m/f is accepted as well. Or maybe even anything platonic, I have a few setups to how this can go and develop long term. If you\u2019re interested feel free to reply to the starter above and tell me a bit about yourself, how you prefer to write, etc. I do want anyone I write with to be at least 21+ as I am as well, it just makes me more comfortable.

            "selftext": "Vakia.\n\nIt\u2019s a planet unlike earth, a planet which looks as if it\u2019s still in the Roman Age, but is technologically superior to earth. There\u2019s ships, robotics, and space faring ships. Vakia is ruled by a foolish king, who gains his entertainment by watching his slaves fight to the death against Vakia\u2019s best and worse beasts and demons. The central coliseum, known as Debtar, (Named after the king himself, the old cocky son of a bitch.) is its largest and grandest structure, is the final destination for many slaves. \n\nDebtar is able to create thousands of different environments via solid projections, one day you\u2019ll be fighting large two-headed giants in the deep jungle, then the next day (if you survived) you\u2019d be fighting an Earth Yeti in the cold mountains. \n\nHere\u2019s where are subsequent heroes are located, the bottom most floor, underground being held in separate cages, waiting to be thrown into the fray, may Vakia have mercy on these lost souls.\n\n\nHello! I hope you enjoyed that beginning segment to my RP idea, \u201cA Tin Spider and a 4 Headed Mutant from beneath.\u201d (That is what he title is, yes). This is the first time I\u2019m attempting something of this caliber, so if you\u2019ll have me, I\u2019ll explain my idea.\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to always be a dungeon or game master, controlling everything that my group encounters, and I thought to why not do it now. I will be everything you encounter in Vakia, from a street beggar to the king himself. \n\nThe way combat would work is simply based off of RP, no stats. (This is definitely subject to change, if I can figure it out.) You\u2019ll have to work together and use your brains and not just your brawn. (Obviously, you can\u2019t one hit these monsters.)\n\nI\u2019m asking for 4-5 literate Roleplayers to join. I will make an edit to this post if or when it\u2019s filled.  DM me with a short example of your rp ability, and any questions you have. After that I\u2019ll give you a character sheet, and I\u2019ll get you into the discord server!\n\nIf you have any ideas to how I can improve as a DM, then please comment or DM, I\u2019m open to all ideas and criticism.\n\nI hope to see you in Vakia, goodbye!\n\n",

We run what is basically a science fantasy slice of life adventure group. Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.\n\nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence.\n\nThe world is alive with tons of lore and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature.\n\nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Bailey and I\u2019m in need of some new partners, as my previous ones failed to respond or weren\u2019t doing it for me. I use kik or reddit for my role plays, and absolutely do not like discord, and refuse to use it. I don\u2019t know why, but it never rolled with me. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI\u2019ve never been good at describing fight scenes or action, but do like to incorporate it into my scenes. Some of my favorite role plays I have done have included vampires, rich people, some fandoms, I\u2019m also picky on those, crime, reality, drama, romance, high school, trauma, and the list could go on forever. I know there\u2019s so many more, but these are the only things I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but am more than fine with smut if it fits into the story. Also. as for pairings, I prefer MxF, with me as F, but I can dabble in FxF if it is necessary. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and find a paragraph just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where lots of words are necessary. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey. ",

However, they're confined to a specific chain of islands not very far from where the MCs reside. Talking about the two main characters, they know each other and have been through some rough phases. Both of them at different times have had feelings for each other but nothing romantic has ever happened between them.\n\nSo, the dragons unexpectedly intervene and then chaos arises. Some people die but most of them are missing. Much of everything is in ruins. From here the journey to the Dragon Islands begins, in a very laughable attempt to rescue the missing people if still alive. \n\nOf course, I want this to be a long term RP.

            "selftext": "**Information:** This is a movie on Netflix (well US, not sure about the rest of you guys) and I'd love to do something following its conclusion because it leaves things very open. Generally speaking it's about a couple who aren't quite right for each other but get married anyway. However the woman is quite famous and she runs off, having had enough of the pesky press messing up her romantic and personal life. In order to ensure the wedding isn't ruined, a stand-in is used to make sure the press don't keep messing everything up. Of course thie stand-in and the husband don't get along and go on a quirky trip to find his real bride and try to get a divorce. It's quite charming and funny and it's a great cast of folks.\n\n**Plot itself:** I would love to play Katie and see where the future takes her and James. I also would love to keep Lara involved somehow because I think she's also pretty fun. I am open to doing this with original characters (maaaybe) or starting sooner than the end of the movie itself. This is going to be slice of life, romance at its finest. I'm thinking we could mix in a hint of say Bridget Jones' Diary or something like that too. I just want some cute funny romance where things work out in the end.\n\n**Other stuff:** I can do this over reddit or discord. I prefer reddit though. I wanna give about 3-4 paragraphs and probably a few times a week, nothing excessive. I will say it's mandatory to see the movie since we're playing roles from it. If it's not on Netflix, I'm sure you can find it elsewhere. If you're interested, let me know!",

            "selftext": "Hello glorious roleplaying community! I'd like to let you all know about an RP community that is what a community is supposed to be, not one guild with branches, but a network of different guilds and roleplayers!\n\nAt its core, The Chronicles [CHRP] is a community. A community for roleplayers and roleplaying guilds alike, a home where roleplayers can stop and figure out what game they want to roleplay in and what guild they want to roleplay with. All experienced roleplayers know the frustration of finding an RP guild in a game they like and invest time in building their backstory and progression for their characters only to get so many obstacles thrown in their way that they\u2019re left with only one choice: to leave their guild and start over. It can be due to drama, lack of experience of the officers in their guild, lack of content or player activity, we\u2019ve all been through this and we\u2019ve all be frustrated by this apparent void in the gaming community for roleplayers.\n\nThe Chronicles is here to propose a solution to that problem. We are a community of multiples RP independent guilds across different games and we seek to build a social network for roleplayers, a network where they can find guilds that have been vetted based on high standards (quality of RP, good management, consistent roleplay events, etc.) to give an opportunity for the roleplayers to find a home, or multiple homes, to RP in and not waste their time \u201cguild-jumping\u201d in the search of a good community.\n\nThis gives an opportunity for lots of different kinds of RP and give a variety of games to avoid burning out on a single one. Some of the current games and guilds you are welcome to join within The Chronicles include:\n\n* Ashes of Creation (future), Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy XIV Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Warframe, Bless Online (soon).\n\n* Multiple D&amp;D campaigns (D&amp;D and Starfinder).\n\n* More to be announced in the future.\n\n* Or if you want to check things out and just hang out with us without wanting to join a guild, join us as an Independent Roleplayer for that community feel!\n\nIn the community, we try to keep a high standard of RP as all guilds work together to give anyone within the community great RP chances! \n\nWhen there is no RP to be had, our members also play other games together such as Overwatch, League of Legends, or ARK: Survival Evolved, Conan Exiles, and more to give another fun side of gaming to the community. \n\nThere are already many great roleplayers in this community and we'd love to see you there too! So if you want to learn more about The Chronicles, feel free to reach out on Discord to Pacha51#3232 and Korupcia#0070, who are both board members of CHRP and if you have any specific guild questions, we can direct you to the leadership of that guild! Also feel free to join the website and peek at our calendar to get a good idea of this community!\n\nSee you there, glorious roleplayers!\n\nOur [website](https://chroniclesrp.com/)!\nOur current [calendar](https://www.guilded.gg/ChroniclesRP)!",

However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply\n- I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out \n- I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does \n- I would prefer literate partners\n\nPlease PM or comment if you\u2019re at all interested!",

            "selftext": "Hey, thanks for clicking.\n\nI've been searching for some roleplaying partners who are actually able to write consistently with me. I have a couple great roleplays going on currently, but the response rate of my counterparts is unsavory. In a lot of the situations I find I get someone who is mega excited to roleplay day 1, then have no interest beyond that. I was hoping to have a good solid roleplay, minimum daily responses, with someone my age or older, willing to indulge in my interests.\n\nI know, I sound like a spoiled brat. But a girl can hope.\n\nI am 24/F, on EST. I'm an adult with a time consuming job, so I understand life happens. I am very flexible - looking to write fantasy or sci-fi primarily. I play strong female characters, can double, and I'm into creating romance/sexual tension/smut. I have a couple things in mind but I'm also totally open to anything you have in mind!\n\nIf this sounds applicable to you feel free to DM me - I have discord and Google docs. I'm also fine with creating a friendship outside the writing. I have roleplayed for a couple years and genuinely want to improve my writing and adaptability.\n\nIf you read this far, thanks for reading this far :) have a good day!",

            "selftext": " Hello! First let me introduce myself; My name is Danielle and I am from the UK. I'm an English 18y/o working a 9:00am \\- 5:30pm job as a Web Designer in a small town, basically meaning I am on a computer most of my time, so It is very easy for me to reply to messages at most times. I love making friends, gaming, and listening to all sorts of music.\n\nHere are my Preferences for my partners.\n\n* **Take things slow**. I do no want to rush the relationship of our characters. Yes, maybe they will gain feelings early on, or have a 'one night stand' approach, but I don't expect them to act on strong feelings straight away, and would like to long this out as much as we possibly can. We can talk this through on how their feelings will uncover and change over time.\n* **Atleast one or two replies a day** I understand if you're busy, because I am too! I work, play games, spend time with family...and i expect that you have things to do. But I would like you to make sure you can reply to the roleplay at least preferably two times in a day. If it's only once, i understand.\n* **Kindness and Respect** This is a simple one. Just be nice! I'm here to also make friends whilst roleplaying, so I would like us to get along. It makes for a great roleplay when we can happily share ideas with eachother!\n* **Be literate** I like well written out english in the roleplay. It doesn't have to be like Shakespeare, but you get the jist of it. Feel free to send me a roleplay sample!\n\nNow, I love nsfw themes. These include sexual scenes, gore, violence, drug abuse, alcohol abuse... many other things that we can discuss. Because of this I wish that you are 18\\+ , and that you\u2019re willing to discuss scenes like this with me so we know where we both stand and what we both want/don\u2019t want! I am very willing to have a 'fade to black' approach.  \n\n\nOkay...so my idea. I am looking for a superhero roleplay involving either a MxF or FxF relationship. I'm very open to ideas, and would love to include OC's, but I am also down for including canon characters from the Marvel universe, It's up to you. I'm looking for a slice of life style, basing on a superhero theme with our characters either being both superheroes or only one. I have an idea for this, it is listed here:\n\n* **Superhero &amp; Girl** For this one, I was thinking of the 'superhero' being a Deadpool type of character, \\(or even Deadpool himself\\). Honestly, the character doesn't need to be a superhero as such, he can just be a guy with powers that fights bad guys, or even good guys! This would be up to you. I was imagining him having a comedic sense around him, and being a douchey/asshole type before meeting the girl, who I would be playing. I was aiming for the girl to be in an abusive workplace/relationship \\(my main idea is her being forced into prostitution with an abusive boss, etc\\). They would meet when the 'superhero' goes to fight crime near a petrol station, maybe there's been a robbery or something like that, and it's obviously very easy for him. The girl is standing outside the petrol station, light shining on her, and the superhero meets her eyes, obvious to him that she saw the whole thing. They have a moment of gentle flirting \\(mainly from the guy\\), but she is obviously disinterested, and she flees. The 'superhero' becomes intrigued by her, as he has never been turned down before. So, he goes out to find her every day, and try talking to her, or getting her to open up to him. After a week of 'stalking' her, he witnesses her being abused by her boss. In shock, and unknowing to why he cares so much, he makes it his mission to save her. This will lead to romance between the two. \\(This is my favourite one, and most in depth one.\\)\n\nBut I am very open to any ideas, and would love to discuss this with someone. I love involving drama, angst, romance, nsfw scenes, and storytelling passionately together. \n\nI hope to hear from you! Thank you for reading!",

Of course, I will participate when I am at home as well but I would love something to regularly read and respond to just like I used to.\n\n I am female, 28 and I really only have interest in roleplaying original characters. This being said I also prefer to RP in established settings, usually from video games or anime. Here is a list of settings related to existing proporties that I am familier with and interested in Roleplaying:\n\nFallout\n\nElder Scrolls\n\nSword Art Online\n\nGeneric slice of life setttings\n\nGeneric Fantasy Settings\n\nmight update with more later.\n\nI also adapt well to original settings as long as the rules of the setting are clear and easy to understand. I am fairly literate but the occasional typo can happen. I am happy to do a single RP or Join a group. Must be strictly SFW, and I would require any possible partners to be LGBTQ\\+ friendly, I don't wanna be stressed out in my own rp. \n\nSo that's it, if you have something that you would be interested in roleplaying with me, please send me a message and we can work out something hopefully, thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! My last post got a lot of good attention so I decided to come back with another idea. This one is more of a general thing, with lots of room for my partner to add on and come up with things. Before I get into the specifics I want to give some extra background about myself.\n\nSo in my Midnight Animal prompt (you can go back and look for it in this very sub) I briefly talked about how I like playing games. I am a huge ***weeb*** and ***gamer*** having played just about every console out there, including the PC. Over the years I\u2019ve always thought about crossing random things over for the funsies, and now I\u2019ve come here to hopefully attract some partners!\n\nSo if you haven\u2019t caught on already I\u2019m looking for partners for cool one-on-one stories featuring different characters from different games! We would come up with our own unique story, either combining the games or placing our characters in a strange new world! Romance would be a huge plus, along with some cool action! I\u2019m not stranger to smut either, so I\u2019m okay with it as long as we don\u2019t rush into it or make it the whole RP. Smut isn\u2019t necessary though, so I\u2019m okay with fluffy and clean romances as well!\n\nThe idea is for us to play existing characters, so I\u2019m not really looking for something with OCs. If it\u2019s something like PUBG or Battlefield where there\u2019s no real concrete characters then that\u2019s where I\u2019m open to OCs, as long as they fit the world/classes in the game. I\u2019m also open to genderbends, so if you wanted to play like a Female or Male version of different characters that\u2019s fine too!\n\nI\u2019m looking for detailed writers, so if you can\u2019t at least provide one paragraph for your responses I\u2019m sorry but like anything below that is a major turn off for me. I\u2019m not looking for crazy overly detailed responses either, but I won\u2019t turn you down if you write like that. I usually write 1-3 paragraphs, with 1-2 being my norm consistently. So just a heads up!\n\nAnyways that\u2019s all for my caveats and requirements. If you have any other questions please mention them in your message! I don\u2019t like giving out contact info so please message (don\u2019t comment) through here! Also to prove that you read this much in your message rate on a 1-10 how cool is Samus from the Metroid series! I\u2019m going to put a huge list of stuff I\u2019m willing to crossover right under here so take a look and remember, you can suggest anything that isn\u2019t on the list as well. Looking forward to getting your guys\u2019 and gals\u2019 messages!\n\nList of Games/Series: Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Metal Gear Solid, House of the Dead, Time Crisis, Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, Final Fantasy, Dark Souls, Nioh, PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battleground, Fortnite, Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, Left 4 Dead, Dragon\u2019s Dogma, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Counterstrike, Rainbow Six, NieR Automata, Metroid, Fire Emblem, Overwatch, Life is Strange\n\nI tried to make the list as varied as possible to show you that you can suggest just about anything to me, so don\u2019t be scared!",

Thank you for clicking on my post, if it was on purpose I hope you stay until the end (don\u2019t worry I won\u2019t keep you long) but if you happened to accidentally click on my post I hope you become interested!\n\nWhat am I looking for? I\u2019m on the search for a person to write out stories with, to escape this reality and dive into one where we can be in control! I\u2019m looking for someone who has the same raging interest in immersing themselves into a good story; characters, conflict, plot, subplots, and all. (I have been dying to write a pirate-esque story and/or a supernatural themed one; mainly involving werewolves- so if either of those interest you, brownie points to you and please consider sending me a PM.) I enjoy genres like action, adventure, mystery, crime, fantasy, romance, sci-fi, maybe even horror! My point is, I\u2019m an open book so it would be my pleasure to open a book with you.\n\nIf this sounds like something you\u2019d like to try please drop me a PM. I will be more than happy to answer any questions there, how we can communicate, and how we can work things out so that the two of us have the best time possible. Hope to hear from you soon :)\n\n",

            "selftext": "A little bit of introduction. First off I'm a 24 year old male that's employed full time, I'm an avid reader that works odd hours that happens to provide lots of downtime. I'm also a self proclaimed action film expert and martial arts geek, also I work in the film industry as a stunt\\-cordinator. I come from a background of D&amp;D and writing lots of short novels that started from prompts. I started to RP only a few years ago and found it lacking in compatibility when it comes to the quality of writing in my partner.   \n\n\nYes I know what it sounds like. Why is this asshole so picky and high maintnaince? well I am picky but I never blamed anyone if they were less than satisfactory. I understand that everyone has to start somewhere and I'll always be honest and let them know nicely if what they write isn't what I'm looking for. I'm not perfect either but what I'm mainly looking at is the ability to create characters and settings that are compelling. Characters that can evolve and grow, have depth and objectives while also being able to establish a proper background that defines who they are. This also applies to the simple elements of story telling such as creating friction between our characters to increase the dynamics between the characters and their settings. Is there conflict in there? or are they simply going to get what they want when they want without a hiccup. Conflict, strife and variable dynamics, all of these can be established before hand.  \n\n\nStill with me? Good, ok so I'm strictly looking for someone mature and preferbaly even 20\\+ however age dosen't always equate to maturity and intelligence so if you feel like you have what it takes, you can still PM me. Trust me I'm fair. Secondly I'm looking for something long term, the themes and settings can span a multitude of universes, fandoms and time periods. However I have a predisposition to original characters and original worlds. However I did have fun playing in fandom settings from games such as Battletech, Elder Scrolls, Ruiner, Shadowrun, warhammer and many many more. I'm open to NSFW and romance too, generally letting that bud on it's own if my partner wishes to. I never force any control over anyone's characters and I have the utmost respect of my partner's characters and his/her boundaries that we establish prior to writing.  \n\n\nIf you're interested or just want to discuss and ask a few questions, just send a PM. Have a nice day yall!  \n",

            "selftext": "It's on chatzy. It's run very differently than most are, though. \n\nInstead of one big overarching plot, it's more focused on creativity. People come up with their own plots, RP them for as long as they want, however they want. \n\nThe RP universe isn't the MCU, but it's not 100% 616 (comics) either. It's classic comics. Trippy, fun, action-packed. In terms of movies, think Ragnarok, Civil War, Infinity War, rather than Avengers or Iron Man 3.\n\nGood examples of the type of universe we're going for are Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes and the 90s X-Men cartoon. \n\nSo yeah, comment if you're interested, comment any questions, and afterward I'll send you the taken and open lists and give you the link!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! are you in the need of a consistent role-play community only bound by location? well then Paradigm RP is the place for you! A role-play community where near anything is possible!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am Tadg but most people know me as Thist. I am the founder of Paradigm and all of the work surrounding it. We are currently a discord based Roleplay community based around an original universe. Paradigm is a universe where you can roleplay to your heart's content. Near anything is possible in this world; from clan warfare, to disease control, to even small talk. Paradigm has its own unique self-run turn based combat system that players can use for combat as well as simple general chat areas where roleplayers can chat, share memes, and have fun.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe lore of this world is deep and extensive and if you wish to read in to it, we have an extensive codex on the server to tell you just about everything you could ever want to know about the universe. This codex covers everything including the governmental systems of factions, how magic works, and even how fuel works in this universe.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe moderators hold podcasts live on the audio channels regularly that they use to chat about anything and everything. One of our moderators writes screenplays and film pitches set in the universe that he reads on his podcast titled 'film crew'. While our other show 'deeper questions' has us tackling some of the more finicky and ridiculous questions the members of the server can come up with. As well as that there is another in the making that is intended to be fun and lighthearted so look out for that. While our other shows 'Jam Sesh' and 'Production Ramble' Look at how we would make video games and talks about the intricacies with making Paradigm and all the other material projected to come out around it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBooks, stories, Radio plays, In depth character designs, Youtube content, and so much more is projected to come out surrounding paradigm so why not join up now and catch it while it is fresh:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://discord.gg/VTmgzsF\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you would like to look into the lore of the community we have documentation on the whole universe it takes place in. Take a read here:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/14l_-GbeZD1TPC2usS4ZD7MlC44F7ZPcuRjigZETUi5o/edit?usp=sharing\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll the appropriate links are also found in the server itself too. what are you waiting for? Join up now!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe are now also launching a youtube channel where you can listen to our old shows incase you missed any so if you want you can also subscribe to that!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaLnh8RMHWungmCCTDvWWNA",

Just plain seeking adventure in the Wild West, start fresh and be apart of American history?  \n\n\nCome to Sanctuary, Nevada! The only town this side of the Mississippi offering a safe heaven to any non\\-human\\(though, open\\-minded humans are welcome, too\\)! With the founder himself being a witch, you're guaranteed a warm welcome.   \n\n\nGather your family, your pack, your coven, and move out West! Practice your magic and natural ways before the railroads take over and humans and non\\-magics force you back into the shadows. Yes, we're the same Sanctuary, Nevada you heard about from your crystal seller!   \n\n\nFeaturing; friendly staff, an open world, and 9 playable species. We are a brand\\-new server\\(still kind of getting on our feet\\), so there is lots of space for everyone and any idea, to play large or small roles! As we are fresh, so many town roles have yet to be filled, from saloon owner to sheriff. We are based in America\\(CST\\), but welcome to anyone who wants to join from around the world. The only requirements are:  \n\n\n* Be 18 or over. \n* Be literate and play in 3rd person.\n* Be prepared to follow rules and regulations. \n* Be semi\\-active. Us current members are rather busy adults and welcome people who are on the same activity scale as us.\n* Be polite, inventive, and willing to take active roles in the stories, plots and events.\n\nPM me with a brief blurb about your interest and I'll send you an invite!

            "selftext": "Welcome to anyone interested! As the title suggests, the roleplay advertised is set in the 4th Era of elder scrolls, set roughly in the time of Skyrim's game events, 4e203.\n\nThe Group is an established roleplay that has existed and expanded for over 3 years, bringing together a combination of the Elder Scrolls' rich lore and history, as well as the in-game occurances being altered or completed in the room's history to make for a well-populated world of player characters, all able to intertwine in their own plotlines across the continent of Tamriel.\n\nThe roleplay is written in 3rd person, past-tense format. All that is required of members is a knowledge of Elder Scrolls (Skyrim at the very least, preferably), and a good ability to write and tell stories together! Thank you for reading! The link below is for anybody interested in joining! The group covers most timezones, with the majority of activity being in the afternoon/night time of GMT.\n\nWe look forward to new members!\n\n     - Oz\nhttps://discord.gg/xgpqFjk",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! My last post got a lot of good attention so I decided to come back with another idea. This one is more of a general thing, with lots of room for my partner to add on and come up with things. Before I get into the specifics I want to give some extra background about myself.\n\nSo in my Midnight Animal prompt \\(you can go back and look for it in this very sub\\) I briefly talked about how I like playing games. I am a huge ***weeb*** an***d gam***er having played just about every console out there, including the PC. Over the years I\u2019ve always thought about crossing random things over for the funsies, and now I\u2019ve come here to hopefully attract some partners!\n\nSo if you haven\u2019t caught on already I\u2019m looking for partners for cool one\\-on\\-one stories featuring different characters from different games! We would come up with our own unique story, either combining the games or placing our characters in a strange new world! Romance would be a huge plus, along with some cool action! I\u2019m not stranger to smut either, so I\u2019m okay with it as long as we don\u2019t rush into it or make it the whole RP. Smut isn\u2019t necessary though, so I\u2019m okay with fluffy and clean romances as well!\n\nThe idea is for us to play existing characters, so I\u2019m not really looking for something with OCs. If it\u2019s something like PUBG or Battlefield where there\u2019s no real concrete characters then that\u2019s where I\u2019m open to OCs, as long as they fit the world/classes in the game. I\u2019m also open to genderbends, so if you wanted to play like a Female or Male version of different characters that\u2019s fine too!\n\nI\u2019m looking for detailed writers, so if you can\u2019t at least provide one paragraph for your responses I\u2019m sorry but like anything below that is a major turn off for me. I\u2019m not looking for crazy overly detailed responses either, but I won\u2019t turn you down if you write like that. I usually write 1\\-3 paragraphs, with 1\\-2 being my norm consistently. So just a heads up!\n\nAnyways that\u2019s all for my caveats and requirements. If you have any other questions please mention them in your message! I don\u2019t like giving out contact info so please message \\(don\u2019t comment\\) through here! Also to prove that you read this much in your message rate on a 1\\-10 how cool is Samus from the Metroid series! I\u2019m going to put a huge list of stuff I\u2019m willing to crossover right under here so take a look and remember, you can suggest anything that isn\u2019t on the list as well. Looking forward to getting your guys\u2019 and gals\u2019 messages!\n\nList of Games/Series: Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Metal Gear Solid, House of the Dead, Time Crisis, Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, Final Fantasy, Dark Souls, Nioh, PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battleground, Fortnite, Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, Left 4 Dead, Dragon\u2019s Dogma, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Counterstrike, Rainbow Six, NieR Automata, Metroid, Fire Emblem, Overwatch, Life is Strange\n\nI tried to make the list as varied as possible to show you that you can suggest just about anything to me, so don\u2019t be scared!",

Burning almost half of my savings for this trip is a bad enough idea but consciously spending a shot that costs as much as the really cheap shirt I like but deprive myself on buying is a whole 'nother level of fuckery in itself. But then again, I'm dumb and I'm kinda lonely, that's why I agreed to go on this trip. *'So I could have a dumb story to tell anyone at parties,'* I thought but the *dings* of notifications from my four-year-old smartphone reminded me that, as expected, it'll be one regretful memory instead.\n\n*\"Ah\u2014screw this,\"* I cursed as I drag myself out of the club after six more nice breakfast sandwiches worth of shots and a text saying my two bestest friends found something else to do (or is it *someone*?) so I might as well bring myself to the place we rented if I'm not keen on joining 'em. And it's all been a blur, walking down the damp, brightly-lit streets with annoyance painted on my face, passing European cars and people with an accent different from mine. My feet and my dissolving rage brought me to a pub because... why not?\n\nIt's not long after I found myself sitting on a stool that barely contained my ass with a bowl of *fries* and a bubbling drink in front of me.\n\n\"Jesus, don't they have anything besides *sexy football*?\" I said, my tired hand cradling my head, not minding if anyone hears... and there's really not a lot who would anyway. I sat on one end of the bar, a corner where a large flatscreen TV hung imposingly overhead. It was airing the match of *Saracens* against *Bath*... or at least that's what it says. Not a lot of people were in that part of spacious pub. A group of rowdy guys are chatting a booth behind me while several men wearing something a little more formal are situated a couple of seats to my left. \"Huh, no gear...\" I mumbled, exhausted and slowly feeling the alcohol wash away from my system. \"Looks super painful.\"\n\nPulling my eyes out of the scene, I fished my phone out from my black windbreaker, gathering all of my options in my head. Or really... just the *other* option. Doing a quick google search, I scrolled through several pages, debating whether or not I should even consider doing this. And I thought about it, you know. I thought about it a million times, even before the trip started. Hiring an escort to show me around and... stuff. But as always, it ended up with one sentence. \"Oh... of course, they're expensive.\"\n\nI then looked up after hearing what sounded like a chuckle. My eyebrows knitting in hazy confusion. \"Uh\u2014excuse me?\" I asked the man smirking down on me. \"Did you say anything?\"\n\n*###*\n\nAs the title and the blabbery chunk of text above suggest, this role-play will revolve around a royalty hooking up with a clueless tourist and what happens after that\u2014a whirlwind romance? Something with a bitter-sweet ending? We'll see. So I'm looking for someone who could play masculine-leaning character to play opposite mine, the unsuspecting tourist.\n\nBut I don't want to limit your character to be just a prince. You can be a really big *soccer*\u2014I mean, *football* star, or that hot, tech billionaire, an A-list actor that will have my character thinking, *huh... this dude's oddly familiar*, that bad boy rock star, or, hell, even a famous adult film actor.\n\nBeyond the fluff, smutty, and the chatty nature of this role-play, it doesn't have to be the only thing going on for this. I also like the play of consequences; your character's reputation having to be 'seen' with me and mine figuring out what is up with this weird, weird dude and *oh my god, I'm going back to counting boxes and cleaning grocery aisles in my country in 5 days!*\n\nSo send in some orange envelopes if you want to discuss this further before jumping into the role-play or continue the prompt as you please. Surprises are nice, too.\n\nHope to hear from you soon xx",

First one being Brazilian Portuguese.\n\n* Write in 3rd person, past tense.\n\n* Post length varies, but I'm really fond of details and longer posts.\n\n* A big stickler for grammar. Very open to being corrected when I get anything wrong (please, do correct me).\n\n* Ditch-friendly, just let me know you're ditching so I can reopen the idea. No questions asked.\n\n* Looking to write this plot *exclusively* through email, usually reply within 24 hours (may take longer on the weekend).\n\n* Roleplay almost exclusively female characters.\n\n* Don't use any messengers to roleplay, sorry about that.\n\n\nI think all of the important info is up there, so let us move on to the plot, shall we? \n\n\nCharacter A - my partner\u2019s character - had a perfect life. He had married his highschool sweetheart, they had a lovely house in their hometown, their first child was on the way, he had a good job and she planned on being a stay at home mom for their future children. They were living the dream\u2026 until the dream became a nightmare. \n\n\nDespite the fact that everything seemed to be fine, something went terribly wrong during the birth, and neither mother nor child survived. Character A lost everything in a few hours.\n\n\nFor the next years, he dove head first into work and alcohol to cope, and avoided even getting closer to any woman he wasn\u2019t blood related to. That is, until Character B got a job as a bartender at his favorite spot to drown his sorrows. She wasn\u2019t trying to seduce him, but she always had a smile and a kind word whenever Character A walked in. As time went by, they started opening up to each other, and, before they even noticed, they were dating. Things moved on really quickly from them. They were both lonely, and had a lot in common. \n\n\nWhen they got married, life was bliss - that is, until she started getting baby fever - and he freaked out thinking he would lose everything all over again. If we want to amp up the drama, she\u2019s totally gonna be capable of getting pregnant behind his back and hoping he\u2019ll love the baby anyway.\n\n\nNow, we can start off anywhere. It can be when they first meet, when they\u2019re dating, when they\u2019re married. If you want long term, I\u2019m more than happy to indulge. I love long term roleplays. \n\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for: drama, romance, someone willing to write Character A (his backstory can be edited if my partner likes it), longer posts, attention to grammar and spelling. \n\n\n\nIf interested, please PM me! I can provide a writing sample, if you\u2019d like me to! Thank you for reading!\n",

Totally up to you! \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs\n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

            "selftext": "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t but a year ago... The meteor hit, only to be followed by another. They say that shit happens once in a few billion years, or whatever it was. I guess the Earth just got a bit unlucky. Funny isn\u2019t it? We spent all this time worrying about global warming, pollution, over population and whatever else those smart-ass scientists wanted to push into our heads. Guess we don\u2019t have to worry too much about it now... Either way a year and a half later it\u2019s only gotten worse. Four, maybe five military forces including that of my own wage war against one another just to control what little is left. It\u2019s pathetic really. Us humans never change but that doesn\u2019t mean I can lay down and die, right? I\u2019ve made it this far... No point in pushing daisies just yet... I guess, although the barrel of whatever gun I happen to hold looks awfully tempting, I keep telling myself it\u2019ll get better, knowing damn well that\u2019s a shit-fed lie. Regardless we haven\u2019t gained much ground against the OpFor. If anything it constantly seems like we\u2019re on the shorter end of the shaft... We\u2019ve gathered as much intel as we could but still we have yet to clearly identify the enemy, and that\u2019s the scary part. We believe that the the two closest to our AO happen to be Laurania and Leutonia, two bordering countries. If that\u2019s true and they hadn\u2019t been wiped out like us, it could be trouble. Amongst themselves they were forging an uneasy alliance before the world went to shit, and other than contact outside of where we operate there hasn\u2019t been much conflict, so that much tells us something... Almaigne seems to stand alone for now, against two hostile forces who merely seem to be testing us. It\u2019s constantly dark with some light that varies, the weather itself is bipolar as fuck.. It\u2019s just a hellhole now. Here I am thinking Almaigne should\u2019ve made more efforts for peace with Leutonia after all this time... It\u2019s only a matter of time before shit hits the fan and we have no choice but to push forward and try to fight our way out of it. Along the grapevine I\u2019ve heard that we\u2019re about to start moving out. Who knows. It\u2019s probably why we\u2019ve started training civilians for war. Either way it doesn\u2019t matter to me. I\u2019m just here for now to get shit done, because at the end of the day, all we have are each other. \u2014 Staff Sergeant Weaver, 1st Special Forces Group, 171st Infantry Division, Bravo Team. Signing Off.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHey! I hope you enjoyed that! Took a minute to collect my thoughts but just in case you\u2019re wondering I\u2019m getting this idea from the video game, Advance Wars: Days it Ruin. I\u2019d love for it to be a bit futuristic, but not too much so. Imagine maybe a 2100 timeline. No crazy shit. Still a bit modern with a bit more technology you know? As for what I\u2019m looking for... Just a literate and loyal partner willing to give this a go! Of course you can have your own OC but I only do FxM pairings, feel free to create a character for the opposing forces, or allied, it doesn\u2019t matter. Romance and action are adored and smut can either fade to black or whatever else. I don\u2019t mind! I\u2019d love someone with a tactical sense of how a military sort of operates? But then again that\u2019s not a necessity. Nor is knowing the background of the game from which I got this idea from. I\u2019m not looking for a real world scenario here - it\u2019s entirely fictional with real world elements thrown in. That being said I can work with you! I\u2019d love to exchange ideas and plot beforehand so we can get on the same page and hopefully kick off soon.~ \n\nIf there\u2019s anything you may think I\u2019ve missed feel free to ask! I hope to hear from you soon!~ ",

            "selftext": "***In Los Angeles, various criminal organizations run the town, with the police scrambling around to constantly combat the threat. On the surface, it is a sunny paradise, the perfect vacation destination with nice beaches and clean streets. Under that sugar-coated facade however lies the real world, one full of murder, corruption and deceit. People have to keep one eye over their shoulder at all times, or less they be gunned down in cold blood.***\n\n***Among the various criminal families and illegal coalitions, the one that reigns supreme is the Vasiliev family, a splinter group from the Russian mob that runs New York. They have the political connections to run their business in broad daylight, and are the ones that keep the other organizations in check. No families, no kids or innocent civilians, unless they stick their noses into their business. Anyone breaks these rules or tries to cut in on their operations will find themselves gunned down by corrupt SWAT officers.***\n\n***However, rumors are spreading that a masked vigilante is rolling through town, wiping out small-time operations and other illegal businesses one by one. The gruesome violence that follows the vigilante, along with the bizarre animal masks has earned them the moniker \u201cMidnight Animal.\u201d Every crime boss and their followers have now started to scramble around, strengthening their defenses in case the demon decides to go after them next. Oddly enough, the only people calm about the whole ordeal seems to be the Vasiliev Family, who have the largest target painted on their backs for the Midnight Animal.***\n\n***And yet, a young woman finds herself sitting with a Russian girl, listening to the details of her next assignment...***\n\nHi everyone! If you read through that wall-o-text then thanks and welcome! I\u2019m currently a full-time college student, struggling to find ways of spending my free time. State of Decay 2 is keeping me occupied so far, but there is a certain roleplay itch I\u2019ve been meaning to scratch!\n\nI grew up watching action movies with my dad, Terminator, Die Hard, Rambo, I love these movies to death! And being a girl I\u2019ve always wanted to see a woman on screen kick an equal amount of butt! I haven\u2019t seen any movies so far that have done this, but games are a whole different story. Tomb Raider, Bayonetta, and Metroid have these awesome cute heroines being super cool and badass! More recently movies like John Wick and The Raid have had cool female characters in them, but like still haven\u2019t given me that awesome female protagonist.\n\nWhich is why we are here! I\u2019m hoping for you guys on here to help me out with this story I\u2019ve been planning for a long time. The story is inspired by primarily John Wick and Hotline Miami, hence the masked killer/vigilante. This plot is going to be full of action, romance and drama so I hope you\u2019ll be able to indulge me on all three of these things. The action is going to be visceral and intense, so I hope you can handle that. In addition, for the romance bits I\u2019m also open to making that nsfw as well, but please don\u2019t rush into it and make it the main focus of the story.\n\nI\u2019m fairly lenient with writing style, I do both third and first person, although the scope of this story will probably fit 3rd person best, as there are multiple characters and such. I usually write a paragraph per response, and sometimes go longer if needed. If you guys do only one liners please move along cause it\u2019s a real turn off when I get short responses. As for a RP platform, Discord is the most convenient for me and everything else won\u2019t work for me. So again if you guys rp on like email or Kik that\u2019s super inconvenient for me so please move on sorry.\n\nAs for characters and such, my character is a bit of a self-insert if I\u2019m going to be terribly honest. She\u2019s a 21 year old university student by day, and expert hitman/cleaner by night. Her story would be revealed as the rp progresses, adding a mystery element to the whole shebang. My partners can play either male or female, whether that be the Russian contact, a classmate/peer, or perhaps another cleaner in the business is up to you! As long as it fits the story I\u2019m open to anything really. \n\nSo if you\u2019ve read all so far, congrats! And if you are interested, awesome! Please PM through here with \u201c1911\u201d so that we can get to planning and other specifics. Bonus points if you can guess what I\u2019m referring to with that number! :)",

            "selftext": "Hey! \n\nThis is basically a shout-out post to anyone who is willing to RP. I use Discord, Skype, Kik etc if people prefer to RP there. I understand the fact that most people already have an established RP group or partners that they write with and the last thing I want to do is interfere. I understand if people just ignore this and don\u2019t reach out. I get it. Writing with someone new is always challenging at first as you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like. It\u2019s easier to write with those that you\u2019ve come to know really well and made friends with. And there\u2019s also the fact that I have anxiety and I\u2019m terrified of approaching people and annoying them. \n\nSo this is why I\u2019m making this post instead and anyone can reply or drop me a message if they\u2019re interested! \n\nBasically looking for anyone willing to RP Blaine Debeers from iZombie with my vampire OC. I have a good few years RP experience and have used various sites though things have slowed to a halt for me to the point where I don\u2019t RP much these days except with one person. I use various apps as well and that can be discussed to choose whichever is preferable. I\u2019m honestly very laid back when it comes to RP and I\u2019m fine with most concepts as long as both of us are comfortable. And of course, having fun! \n\nI\u2019d also be up for RPing with a Logan (Wolverine) with my OC. Or Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. I have written for both Tony and Pepper before though my preference is Pepper. Any of these can simply be platonic relationships. We can discuss matters and decide if we want any of them to be romantically involved. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t mind writing some NSFW I do prefer actual storytelling and working on a plot. I\u2019m also from the UK, 21+ and I\u2019m fairly quick on replies. Though replies will be slower during the week while I\u2019m at work. I do prefer para/multi para to one liners. \n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid to contact me! I\u2019m the least threatening person ever. If you are interested just let me know and we can discuss further! All I\u2019m looking for is having fun, making sure whomever I write with is comfortable and also having fun, and making new friends along the way. You can also reach me on my main tumblr as I\u2019m active there often and have also just recently made a side-blog for RP purposes: http://frozenbanana00.tumblr.com I hope to write with some of you soon. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "**About me and what I'm looking for:** \n\n- I'm in college so posting won't be rapid. I will try to give my partner at least one to three posts a week but again, I'm in my 20s so it's tough to really nail down exact posting habits. What it boils down to is that I don't want someone to demand I post, but to be patient and understanding that life comes first. In the same regard, I won't nag someone to post unless it's been over a week.\n\n- I give about three to five paragraphs. Generally my posts stick to the 500-1000 words range but I can give more or less, it just depends. I'm looking for someone who enjoys a lengthy post (and doesn't mind waiting). \n\n- I want us to use canon characters. In some special circumstances, I'll deal with canons but it's a very rare occurrence and does require us to both double as a canon and an OC and to make sure we're not overly favorable towards just our OC. That's not fair.\n\n- I stick to third person, past tense. It's important for me to distinguish myself from who I write as and I hope my partner can respect that and not confuse the two.\n\n- I will say Reddit is my first choice, followed by Discord, followed by Google Docs and lastly, email. I do not use kik or skype. \n\n- It's important we keep in touch to plot and stay on the same page. My partner should be happy and eager to post and that means voicing what we both want to happen. I love chatting with my partners. I also like knowing if any delay is gonna happen, if you need to wait a couple weeks, that's cool. I'm a patient person. I try to stay chill but please try not to keep me on the hook for too long. Generally speaking if we need a break, I'm fine as long as I'm not kept in the dark about it.\n\n- Mature content is okay with me but I don't like it creeping into the RP frequently. My focus is on storytelling, not ripping off one another's clothes or seeing who can create the music epic combat scenes. Also any characters who might be under 18 will be aged up to be 18 for romantic plots. I'd also love it if partners were also over 18 for more obvious, legal reasons.\n\n- Lastly the general tone of my RPs tend to be light and focused on slice of life stuff. I don't need tons of action or dramatics happening all the time because it's just going to drain my motivation to post. To me writing is about escape and life is too dramatic to have it being written about as well.\n\n**Fandoms:** Okay so below are a collection of canons I can play and ones I am seeking for someone to play for me. I am open for doubling and sharing roles. Please PM me to talk about plot and pairs. Before we move to another platform, I do want to talk via Reddit PM so I know we're on the same page. I'm also open to other fandoms and maybe even crossovers.

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow writers!  \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my roleplay post.  Let me start off by introducing myself \u2014 I\u2019m a man in his mid-20s who (like many of you) is seeking to find a roleplay partner.  I've been somewhat busy due to a combination of work and grad school, but as of late, it has been truly refreshing to connect with so many other like-minded people in this community of writers.  Given that I\u2019m expecting to have a bit more time on my hands in the upcoming weeks, I figured I\u2019d reach out again, and hopefully find a few more mature, talented writers.\n\n**Preferred Genres:**\n\nMy writing tends to span a wide variety of genres\u2014including science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic modern fiction.  My writing has spanned both a personal as well professional nature, and as a result, I\u2019m always up for experimenting with new genres and writing styles.  Recently, I\u2019ve been dabbling a bit more in fantasy themes; however, I\u2019m still a novice when it comes to taking on high-fantasy themes.\n\n**Writing Style:**\n\nI will humbly admit that I tend to be a voracious writer, and as a result, my posts frequently range in the 3-4+ paragraph range.  Granted, there are certain occasions when a shorter length is more desirable (especially in conversational, or dialogue-intensive scenes)\u2014and this is certainly something I implement when necessary.  I\u2019m a strong believer in quality over quantity, and I\u2019m hoping to find a fellow writer who has an appreciation for packing a large quantity of details in a condensed post (within reason).\n\n**Collaboration:**\n\nFor me, the pre-writing, collaborative stage is as enjoyable as the writing process itself.  I know that some writers prefer to jump head-first into writing the story itself\u2014with minimal discussion.  Based on experience, this approach is due to the fact that some writers fear that too much discussion may \u201creveal\u201d too much of the plot prior to writing.  While this is certainly a valid point, it is important for me to mention that my discussions do not pertain to plot;  rather, they pertain to exploring the characters\u2019 backstories, emotional orientations, cultural groundings, and other such factors.  It\u2019s more with regard to developing a creative discourse with my writing partner to truly immerse\u2014and \u201clive\u201d\u2014the experiences of our characters.  To me, it is this level of exploration and collaboration that truly make roleplaying a much more engaging process as compared to solo writing.\n\n**Writing Platforms:**\n\nI prefer to write my stories via email; however, I strongly prefer to collaborate with my co-writers via a text IM platform such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or Discord.  This is largely because an IM platform allows for a truly conversational, back-and-forth discourse about the story (rather than a static series of isolated messages via email).  I also find that my best stories tend to emerge with individuals with whom I am able to cultivate a strong intellectual chemistry with\u2014and as a result, this has led to several long-term stories.  I would be absolutely thrilled to find other writers in this subreddit who are also looking for long-term stories.  \n\n**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 [ideally over 21].**  This is not to suggest that my stories always involve adult themes.  In fact, many of my stories do not involve NSFW themes at all.  However, I feel exponentially more comfortable discussing literary ideas with fellow adults.  As a result, I set this as a strict limit, and I have a zero tolerance policy for those who lie about their age.  As a result, I will be firm for only this particular issue\u2014 *do not contact me unless you are 18 years of age.*\n\n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.**  As I mentioned above, I\u2019m seeking a writer who is truly interested in forming a long-term collaborative writing partnership.  This means not only focusing on issues pertaining to our story at hand, but also to broader issues concerning our writing as a whole.  Ideally, it would be nice to connect with other working professionals who are looking to use writing as a creative outlet, of sorts.\n\n* **Mutual respect.**  As I\u2019m sure is the case with many of you, I simply cannot be in front of the computer 24/7 due to real life responsibilities and obligations.  Because of this, I hope to find a writer who is committed, yet flexible\u2014someone who is willing to maintain open communication while at the same time, respecting one another\u2019s autonomy.\n\nIf this post has captured your interest or imagination, then by all means, I would love to hear from you!  In your post, please tell me a bit about yourself, and your background in writing.  Hopefully we can get a conversation going, and weave our way into writing a story together.\n\nThanks for your time; I hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "My ideal story would take place at least a good generation or two after the first public superhero. The existence of powers is now an established part of society, with superheroes acting more as special forces/SWAT than rogue vigilantes. Our story would follow some of the new recruits to a powered academy. \n\nAt the academy recruits are pushed to the limit in a series of qualifying exams and trials. Only the absolute best in body, mind, will, and character are able to pass and attain the honor of wearing a cape. \n\nThose that don the cape soon discover that their examinations were the easy part. As the small few holding back the forces of chaos in the world, they\u2019re work never cease and never lets up. \n\nAnother aspect I\u2019d also like to focus on is the effect fame has on these characters. Capes would be more popular than your professional atheletes, and even the most insignificant aspects of their lives would be covered by the paparazzi. \n\nMy preference would be for us to create an OC universe, and I have some ideas for how we\u2019d structure powers in that world. However, if you would prefer a more canonical setting we could do Marvel/DC, just as long as OC characters are our focus. I think My Hero Academia has a similar structure to this, but I haven\u2019t watched the anime so would prefer to avoid it. \n\nI can rp as any gender and am fine with any sort of pairing. I would prefer the story to be SFW, but can be persuaded otherwise. \n\nIf interested, please send me a pm with the appropriate contact information and a bit of information about you and what you would like to do with the story.

I want to do a roleplay where my character, the male, is the one who is vulnerable and in need of protection and is maybe not as forward as the woman who is seeking his affection, or seeking to protect him from some terrible danger. At the same time, I would like for him to have a darker side he's not aware of that can channel untold power, making him a danger to himself and others, perhaps that's why she is seeking to keep him safe. All the better if their relationship is something taboo or just not meant to happen. I can play with a bit of back and forth power dynamic as well.\n\nI don't have a set idea or plot in mind and this is where I'm hoping you'll step in. Throw a suggestion at me, let's build a world together. I lean more towards fantasy roleplays obviously, but the more fantasy the better, including sci\\-fi. I'm not opposed to getting into murky areas where hard decisions with bad consequences have to be made, so if this gets dark and serious, all the better. I'm not opposed to steamy scenes either. I love hi\\-octane action as well, so fight scenes are welcome. I am an adept writer and I tend to bounce back to my partner in terms of detail and length...the more to give me to play off of and work with, the more I tend to put out and innovate on my own. Just as a small note, I am quite fond of having my character be a scion of acolyte of a Moon God \\(whether he is aware of it or not.\\) I just like the moon imagery, it doesn't have to come into play at all.",

So if i don't respond quickly, it may be the crack of dawn.\n* I've been actively rping since about 2011, though I had a bit of a break in 2015 due to classes. \n* Typically unless otherwise specified I rp in either 1st or 3rd person, depending on your preference, and in multi paragraph format, sending between 1 and 5 paragraphs, typically averaging 2 or 3. And while i don't necessarily expect you to do the same, if i send something along the lines of 4 paragraphs and get something along the lines of 3 sentences back I might be a little peeved. The length of the paragraphs may also very if the current situation is very dialog heavy and in the need of both parties to respond to continue. \n* I do rp NSFW content though I prefer it appropriate to the situation and not just smut for smuts sake unless that's whole purpose of the rp.\n* Lastly I do prefer being an original character vs that of a cannon character though I'm willing to flex and bend on this depending on the fandom or idea presented.\n\nId prefer to discuss one on one about what kind of rp you're interested in, I've done just about everyone of them. From Star Wars, to RWBY*, to a current one involving a Mass Effect style universe, to simple medieval rps. And while I am willing to do the whole \"Man saves girl because girl is special,\" theme, I'd like to have my partner be a bit more involved than that. If it's an action scene help me fight, or maybe save me from danger. If it's a political drama, get involved. Don't just sit on the sidelines throwing out one meaningful shout in the middle of court, hoping that will change and woo everyone hearts.\nIf you have an idea you've been dying to try or a good old cookie cutter rp to make you nostalgic and feel all fuzzy inside, don't be afraid to shoot me a message here on reddit and we can either continue from there or I'll be glad to give you my Discord, Kik, or email to continue.",

            "selftext": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sky above the castle of Ilya was still a series of pastels, darkness lingering to the west. Light poured in the windows, leaving small puddles along the length of the hall. Moving gracefully through the pools of light was a girl with pale locks cascading down her back and a tiara that shimmered as she moved. At her side was a wolf far too large to roam inside the castle walls and yet he was ever at her side if her guard could not be. On that morning she had chose to leave the warrior sprawled out in the bed they shared, warmed by the sun.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was often early that a queen\u2019s work began but that morning was especially so. A quiet service girl had tapped on the door before the sun had risen, whispering of a foreign dignitary that was requesting an audience with her. Many had come since the end of the war, old, peaceful men and women looking to rebuild treaties, forge alliances. And so she let her love sleep as she readied herself for what would likely be a tiresome meeting. However the dignitary that awaited her through the grand doors of the chamber was hardly *old* and the wolf\u2019s stance at her side was quickly anything but peaceful.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A few members of the council were chatting with the stranger. One she scarcely saw smile released a chuckle, falling silent only when he caught sight of Aurelia. She smiled in her gentle way, nodding as the others bowed slightly. Kato released a snarl as she stepped further into the chamber. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHonestly, your grace. That beast is going to give our guest the wrong impression!\u201d exclaimed one of the melodramatic women that were on the council. Aurelia\u2019s only response was to caress the wolf\u2019s fur softly, looking curiously at their guest.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWelcome to Ilya,\u201d Her voice was delicate, as graceful as her stance. \n\n\n____________________________\n\n\nAs the title would suggest, a suitor has come to Ilya to claim the hand of the young, new Queen. What claim he has to it is something we can discuss. Perhaps before their deaths her parents created an agreement with his family. Perhaps that is a lie. Maybe it is all far more nefarious\u2026 \n\n\nMagic exists within this world. It is rare but you would be welcome to create something for your character.\n\n\nNote. This seems like it's sort of forcing you into the suitor role. That isn't the case. Her guard, a new stranger, the castle wizard, the wolf\u2026 feel free to choose. I'm always fascinated with new angles and ideas.\n\n\nWriting notes\u2026 Third and past tense. I'm fairly adaptable but I do not like first person. Long term. PMs. I tend to write lengthy responses but that is not something I need from you.",

This power is what essentially created the know universes, is also the power that allowed for the adventures of Goku, Jiren, Frieza, and all the other great names and tales we know. All the battles against foes who were mesmerized by the Dragon balls that would grant any wish, and not to forget the ones that were simply just to destroy the world and rule the universe...   And as always, Goku and the Z Fighters stood tall against the enemies and warriors and gods of all kinds.\nHowever... \nThere was always something bigger and badder around the corner... \n\nhttps://discord.gg/Tn6E5aA",

I have 18 years of roleplay and creative writing experience.\n\nMy long-term group, whom I have been writing with on Chatzy, Tumblr, Google Docs and recently FB messenger for the last 8 yrs is dead and unfortunately, it seems it won\u2019t be revived any time soon.\n\nSo, I\u2019m looking to find a home in a moderately active group, and/or some new one on one partners. The partners I'm seeking, should be comfortable writing at least two or three paragraphs at a time, with minimal spelling and grammar errors. (No one is perfect, but it is nice to strive for perfection.)\n\nMy partner/group will need to be 18+, because just like good fan fiction, unless it has a PG-13 or mature rating, it just isn\u2019t worth reading.\n\nThat being said, I am comfortable with various triggers that may send others off. If you are uncomfortable with something, I will be sensitive to that! I am well rounded at playing both male and female characters. I actually have a strength at playing male characters because my previous group has been all female for ages. That may be why I am searching for females to RP with. Just more comfortable with that. Groups can me mixed of course, but I would feel comfortable writing privately with a female.\n\nBelow is a non exhaustive list of media that I love and would find it easy to play in. If you don\u2019t find anything there or have ideas of your own PM me. I have a few original plots that I\u2019d love to flesh out as well. I always RP in 3rd person and my replies are long-winded paragraphs.\n\nThe categories are in no particular order.\n\nAnime/Otome: Mystic Messenger, Dandelion, Nameless, Persona 5, Fruit\u2019s Basket, Rurouni Kenshin, Ouran HS...\n\nVideo games: Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, Assassin\u2019s Creed, Fallout 4...\n\nMovies/Books/Shows: Harry Potter, Doctor Who, BBC Sherlock, Marvel, Game of Thrones, Westworld, Borgias, Once Upon a Time, Supernatural, Archer...\n\nOriginal Themes: Medieval, Shogun, Modern, Mystical/Goddesses, and a mixture thereof... I'm generally a fan of any era+magic, and any sort of anachronistic plot where a person gets sent back in time or vice versa.\n\nSo, if you'd like to get to know more about me, feel free to PM me here. I'm on Discord, but haven't ever used it. \n\n",

            "selftext": "*This is my fist post, so lets just jump in.*\n\n*I'm looking for someone to RP a travel partner. The setting I'm thinking of is like this:*\n\nIt was the late 2020's, the earth was dying but no one seemed to notice , at least no one living there. When other races came to the Earth, their goal was to help save the humans. They heard of this proud, crafty race of easily manipulated warriors and how soon they would need help. At first the races tried to slip undetected, they wanted to learn more about the humans, get their own people to  better positions in human society and make it easier to ally themselves with the humans. \n\n**Through what could only be called the single greatest environmental disaster unknown to man, everything changed.** \n\nThe influx of creatures from another realm brought with a subtle flooding of toxic energy and substance. With in the next generation the pollutant would be called \"Mana.\" It was highly reactive in strange ways. Humans had no idea how it worked, and other races only had pieces of the puzzle. But one thing was known, and even agreed on between these perpetually warring races, Mana was never meant to be on Earth. Grasslands turned to jungles, but in the winter they would be tundras. Oceans would turn to deserts, small lap dogs would warp into war hounds,  and humans? Some humans suddenly turned into wizards. A select few who were mutated by the mana, and took time to harmonize with it became more prolific and powerful than anything any of the other races have seen before.\n\nThat last one was an unexpected outcome. Sure the Elvin races had magi, and the Centaurs and Orcs had shaman, heck, even the dwarves, goblins, and golems all had some form of priests.... But a spell slinging wizard? Someone who started cracking the secrets of Mana? Unheard of. But most importantly, most wanted.\n\nSuddenly the races had all the more reason to want to recruit and befriend humans, even if they were hostile and had weird habits like sleeping seven hours, spicing their food, and farming. It was clear though, to elders and wise men, what the single best way to win the humans favor was....Get to the westside of the first Mana spring and close it. ~~It would be dangerous, it would be stupid, it would be a task only the dumbest, most unlucky creatures could be forced into.~~\n\nOh. Hello traveler, you need 1 gold and three rations of bread? Can I interest you in a quest? \\(Y/N\\)\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nSo, this is more or less the story. Key points though:\n\n* Humans dont know what caused the Mana to appear. Some blame the other races \\(because hey, racism and 'cause and effect'\\) and some are happy to have help from them\n\n* The other races are......found on google. Seriously. Give me a description, maybe come up with a quick culture reference \\(like \"Oh... its a Darglewargle elf...Think scottish sterotype but less sheep and more [tutrles](http://photobucket.com/gallery/user/sunnydaleclassof99/media/cGF0aDovTWFzdGVyIG9mIERpc2d1aXNlX3pwc2dpbzZ4ajZuLmdpZg==/?searchTerm=master%20of%20disguise%20turtle&amp;page=1)...Dont ask\\).\n\n* I am a huge fan of romance. Not the high school kind that turns into smut right away, but the slow burn where two adults quickly realize there is and attraction but they arent going to rush in. That being said, I'm comfortable with taking the romance as far as you want, or as not far as you want. Consent is cool, kids. [So is respecting boundaries.](https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/captain-america-psa.jpg)\n\n* I am looking for something long term. But if you need to pause for a few days because of real life, please do so. Dont stress, this is for fun, just let me know.\n\nAs for the setting on a more acute scale, I was thinking human society could be broken up into small towns that are MILES apart. This would provide a good change of scene and quick changes in subplots pretty easily. Maybe one town is being run by a threatening pair of wizard humans, and the people are all living in fear. Maybe the next hates your race and we desperately need to resupply. Maybe the next one is a weird cult and we dont realize it until it's too late and we signed up for their timeshare.\n\nIm always up for changes, just let me know!",

            "selftext": "Well, first things first, some of these I want to do more than others, people asking about those ones will get priority. Most of them are based around my original characters, but some of them I'd like to play against canon people and the others are up for debate. If I'm going to do romance it'll only be F//. Going to Discord would be preferable to me over staying here on Reddit. As the title says, I don't care whether you're actually a guy or not, just be willing and able to play a female character and we'll be fine. Now onto the prompts.\n\nModern day - Another morning in this run down old apartment that Cecil, or as her fans come to know her, Chrystal, finds herself waking up in. She slowly stands from the single mattress on the floor and makes her to the cramped bathroom across the small, messy room she calls an apartment. She looks herself in the mirror, finding that she's only wearing her underwear, and brushes out her light blue hair. Once she's cleaned herself up a little bit, she hears the one she shares the apartment with stirring and looks over at her much less feminine lover starting to wake up. \"About time, you're supposed to wake up first.\"\n\n*This one has my DJ and her punk girlfriend living together and trying to make ends meet. They make enough to get by, but only because their bills are so cheap. If anyone is interested, I'll go further in depth in private.*\n\nMarvel - The Avengers, the Defenders, the Fantastic four, S.H.I.E.L.D., and most of the other teams protecting the other we're doing fairly good jobs, as a team. But what about the solo heroes and anti heroes working in the shadows? Well, no one seems to care about them in the grand scheme of things. With so many Spider people running around now, the new ones really need to do their own things to stand out among the rest. Well, how about one that has no problem killing people? That seems to be the case when a small group of about three gang members were found hung by webbing from separate streetlights come one morning. The Defenders are appalled, except the Punisher, of course. People are quick to blame Spider-Man, but he never did it. Even S.H.I.E.L.D. seems baffled. But the real mystery lies in the webbing. Upon further inspection, this web appears to be he strongest out of any Spider person currently running around.\n\n*Pretty obvious. I have a Spider Woman, I want to play as her against really anyone, she's an anti hero. The Avengers may not like her, S.H.I.E.L.D. certainly doesn't, but the villains know that when they ever see her, they need to run.*\n\nHalo - The Spartan-III program is well known as the suicide trooper program. All of those Spartans were sent on suicide missions and expected never to come back. But one continues to break that mold. No one knows her actual name, but everyone knows her as the last surviving member of Spartan company Iceberg. Some of the newer Spartans and ODST's hearing about her have taken to calling her \"Phoenix\" because whenever she goes into a mission, everyone going in with her dies, but she keeps coming back. As if out of the ashes of a failed mission to come back and live the same cycle over and over again.\n\n*This is a really old one, but my idea here is that a group of Spartans or ODST's are sent on a mission to a distant planet. Standard enough mission for them. But what they don't expect is to uncover a legend from the UNSC.*\n\nRight now I'm drawing a blank on any others. If you're interested, just message me whenever. This post may or may not be changed or altered in the future, so I guess just keep an eye on it.\n\nDead by Daylight - \"La la la, la la-la la-la...\" The Huntress' lullaby echoed through the halls of the hospital, even over the faint murmur of the generators coming to life. Her heavy steps could be heard from relatively far away, but the lullaby was easily the most audible thing in the entirety of the hospital. It drew closer to the locker housing one of the terrified survivors, the source slowly coming into view. The survivor covered their mouth to keep from screaming, but the Huntress came to a stop and slowly turned her head toward the locker. The survivor shut their eyes tight to avoid looking into the mask for fear of what lay behind it, but try as they might to hide from her, the locker door yanked open and their screams echoed throughout the halls.\n\n*I sort of have an idea in mind here, but I don't know how well it can be done. So for the time being, I just want to roleplay the Huntress doing what she does based. If interested, don't be a toxic, tea bagging, mega flashlight wielding, palette looping...well, you get the idea.*\n\nDragonball- *Unfortunately no big, long prompt for this. I just have a quadrillion characters to use. Some of them work with GT, some of them work with Super. But some of their stories are pretty far fetched, so don't laugh at me if you ask for them.*\n\nSteven Universe - An ordinary day on Earth has Steven sitting on the beach hanging out with Connie, Lion and even Peridot coming down from the barn just to relax for a little while, in her own fashion. The three of them are soaking up sun and listening to the ocean when a gem pod lands in front of them, close enough for the tide to evaporate on contact with the metal. Peridot is obviously shaken up, but the other three seem ready for whatever is about to come out. \n\nSuddenly, the pod cracks open in the middle and the liquid inside comes pouring out, steaming and solidifying the sand underneath. Outside of the pod stands a tall, monochromatic gem with dark, thick sunglasses under white bangs, wearing home world armor. Peridot's chatter comes to a dead stop when she sees this gem and is replaced by a single word. \"Onyx...\"\n\n*This one's my favorite, it'll have my character trying to come to terms with what happened to Rose Quartz while also adapting to life on Earth and with the Crystal Gems.*",

            "selftext": "**Edit: most people seem to feel sceptical about the \"varying genders and orientations\" and \"multiple characters\" restrictions below. If that's the only thing you don't like, please contact me regardless. We can work something out, and maybe I need to adjust my criteria a bit. :)**\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

I like stories with a good helping of romance, but it doesn't have to be the sole focus. I'm into pretty standard 'hero's journey' type stories, but again, I'm flexible.\n\nI try to make my replies as substantial as I can, I shoot for at least one paragraph.

            "selftext": "Hello all\n\nI'm a dude from the United Kingdom! Just in case you want to know about timezone differences. I've been roleplaying for a good 5-6 years, give or take. And I'm fortunate enough to usually get a lot of free time so I can be rather fairly active when it comes to roleplaying in general. But, Monday's and Tuesday's are quiet until the afternoon due to tech and looking after my puppy.\n\nAnyhow, I'm wishing to find a partner who would be interested in roleplaying long term with the One Punch Man fandom in mind. I've watched the anime in its entirety and currently caught up to the manga which is on chapter 91. So 35 chapters behind on the webcomic. (Even doe I know some spoilers ahead in the webcomic. Which I'm honestly fine with hearing about if it includes anything you're wanting to include in our roleplay. Heck, diverting and making our own variants from the arcs is perfectly A-O-Kay to me.)\n\n&gt; I'm an advanced literate roleplayer myself and would be expecting similar details from yourself. That means roleplaying in detail at say, lengths of multiple paragraphs. Depends really on what's happening in the scenario, honestly.\n\n&gt; I play as both male and female characters! And that applies for ALMOST any romance if you're wishing to do so within the One Punch Man verse. I say almost as MxM is uncomfortable for me. I also prefer romances to be slow to fruitation! So feel free to hit me up with any ships you have in OPM! Also, I'm fine with any NSFW themes in terms of violence and such. Guess you'd have to expect that from such a verse, lol.\n\n&gt; This is a biggie likely to put many folk off, but I do not roleplay with OC's. I generally find them unappealing to roleplay with and will be doing soley canon characters. Expecting the same from you. But hey, we can double with canons as well if that's your type of thing!\u0016\n\nIf this interests you, feel free to PM me. Danke!",

            "selftext": "I am looking for a long term role play partner who enjoys doing romance plays. I am hoping for at minimum one reply a day, if not more from my new partner. Email is my preferred method of communication, although I would also be open to Google Docs. There are several ideas bouncing around in my head (some original, some thanks to other plays I have started in the past), but I am always open to new suggestions. I am big into the 1800s and early 1900s history, Doctor Who, Sherlock, The Walking Dead, and a few other shows, just for reference. Onto the ideas!\n\n1) Two strangers meet at a wedding. Maybe they are members of the wedding party. The thing is, this isn't the typical 'I want to hook up at a wedding' neither person really wants to be there, but the conversation eventually leads to romance or getting physical.\n\n2) A man, down on his luck had one night with an Escort/Hooker, and it doesn't go as planned. He starts falling for her. What happens next? (Check out the movie The Escort which this idea comes from!)\n\n3) Daily schedules always cause us to run into each other, maybe at the coffee shop or at lunch. We notice each other in passing, but one day a conversation starts.\n\n4) We start emailing back and forth, having met in a chat room or on reddit. We get to know each other and fall for each other. Little do we know, that we actually are co-workers, or friends...completely unaware we are really talking to each other.\n\n5) This could be combined with ideas 1 and 2 really, or be a stand alone. We are strangers, maybe we meet at a bar, and things get heated the first night. A couple months later the guy gets a phone call because, well...you are now pregnant. (See Amazon's Series Catastrophe for more on this idea!)\n\n6) One of the two characters could be an Uber driver that either frequently picks up the other person, or the pair is sent on a long journey together (See the movie Take Me Home for reference). What starts as two complete strangers becomes a friendship with romance eventually entering the picture.\n\n7) This one is the same principle as the Uber one above, except it involves an airplane. Here we could either play pilot and flight attendant, flight attendant and passenger, or two passengers who either hook up in a quick romantic rendezvous or who develop the slow burn of passion over time. \n\nThere are other subtle ideas we could add in...conservative family members, jobs, long distance, etc. None of these ideas really have to get sexual, but I am open to that as well...as part of the play. This isn't supposed to be a purely sexual RP, but getting physical is one part of romance. Hopefully one of these ideas has peaked your interest. Sorry for the long post, but I really am enjoying role playing, and would like to find some serious friends. It is always fun to get to know someone through a role play...because you never know if they are developing a character or pulling from experiences in their own lives. Hope to hear from you!",

She made it all the way through high school with no relationship struggles or issues but right before graduation she made one huge mistake that she\u2019s going to have to deal with for nine months. She leaves the state to go away for school for a fresh start, having to deal with dorm life while balancing her new struggles. You\u2019re the only thing keeping her from going crazy\n\nJust something I thought of while browsing cosplay sites online the other day, as well as an idea I was considering. Looking for someone to tell a sweet narrative-focused story of romance and coming to grips with one\u2019s demons. I\u2019ll be playing the character in the prompt and id like you to play the love interest. Either gender will do! I\u2019m good for MxF or FxF. This will be an SFW roleplay so no smut.

            "selftext": "\u201cCenturies ago, all wielders of Magic were sentenced to die. What once started as a small group of religious masters against magic wielders had grown to become an overwhelming problem. With the support- or truly, the fear of the communities these Purists ravaged, the people of the cities and realm were forced to relinquish children to the Purists- no older the the lot of you! Three, four- all the way up to young men like you, Jeddah, were ripped from their homes and families to become witch hunters.\u201d The fire before them crackled and popped quietly, illuminating the face of the old woman before the group of children. She was traveled, decorated in jewelry and textures from around the realms. The four children sat leaned forward listening to one of her many stories with great intent. \n  \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have gotten me.\u201d Jeddah answered, confidently shaking his head and sitting back. \u201cI would have fought back- stabbed them.\u201d The old woman laughed, shaking her head slowly. \n  \u201cI know you would have dear... but that wouldn\u2019t have stopped them. Each child they caught had there blood drawn, tested over whatever magical gem they could find. Those who passed the test... well... they were almost luckier then the children who failed. The children proved of no magical abilities became property of the Masters.  Trained to become witch hunters. Convinced of the \u2018ugliness\u2019 of magic. That it needed to be cleansed of the world.\u201d\n  \u201cI- I heard that they used to make them fight each other to the death!\u201d\n  \u201cWell I heard, that the masters would force them to sit for hours under the effects of a burning spell!\u201d\n  \u201cThat\u2019s not true...\u201d one of the older girls shook their head. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. They just trained them to fight. Forced them to listen to lectures and shit about what witches could do. Right Helga?\u201d\n  The old woman shifted in her seat, a frown sitting on her lips. \u201cIt is all true. And much more. The hunters lived a sorry existence. Not that it excused their actions... nothing could make up for the wrongs done to the people of the Dalmeu.\u201d All the children fell silent with an uncomfortable air at the word. \u2018Dalmeu.\u2019 It was practically a curse. A name used by the Purists to refer to the wielders of Magic after they began to seek refuge in the forest bearing the same name.  \u201cFor years the Dalmeu his amongst the dense dark trees of the forest. Rotting along with the ruins of their once great society. Until one day, a group of witches had enough. They began to band together- creating a rebellion amongst them. \n  \u201cTogether they would seek out more of their kind. Create a home. Find relics lost to past to try and strengthen the blood within their veins. Though... this wasn\u2019t lost on the eyes of the Purists, or their hunters.  For years they both went on, fighting, hunting, gathering. It seemed things were coming to a stalemate... the witches had enough power to stop the hunters, but the hunters had the element of brutality. Cunning. A mission that was their only purpose to complete. So it continued. On and on, hundreds of lives lost. Hundreds of artifacts stolen.\u201d Helga paused for a long while, looking out into the fire while she recalled her story. \n  \u201cUntil the most fateful day a group of witches came across a party of hunters in the southern most water temple. Said to be home of the Moon\u2019s Eye- a powerful moonstone used by the elementalists long ago.  A fight ensued at once, magic flying every which way, swords and arrows. Though... one of the three hunters was gone. After the Moon\u2019s Eye no doubt. (Your character\u2019s name here), the bravest of the bunch decided to find her- stop her from finding the moon\u2019s eye. However, by the time he found her- it was too late.  She had already reached the precious ancient stone. So he-\u201c\n  \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d Jeddah interrupted. \u201cIf she had touched it, she would have died. Non-magic wielders couldn\u2019t have handled that much energy. Even Elder McKell won\u2019t touch the Moon\u2019s Eye. It\u2019s to powerful.\u201d\n  \u201cYeah.\u201d Edith chimes in. \u201cSeems like he shouldn\u2019t have let her touch it. Be done with it.\u201d\n  \u201cAh... but there\u2019s the problem children. The hunter did not die. Quite the opposite. That was the day her life truly began.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHello! Thank you for reading this far if you have! I\u2019m looking for someone to tell this story with me- I know it was a bit of an unconventional way to set up the story, but I felt it was the most interesting way to give you the details. \n\nI will be playing the hunter, Rowan. I would like you to play the man who catches her touching the moonstone. At her touch, the stone glows and creates quite a spectacle of elemental magic then causes Rowan to collapse. YC decides to not only rescue the stone, but also the mysterious hunter who was somehow able to use it. He takes her back to his compound- despite knowing the dangers of when she wakes up in hopes of discovering her connection to the stone and hopefully some intel on Hunters. \n\nI would like this very much to be an unlikely love story, where two people raised to hate one another come together to form something beautiful. A story about helping heal the broken parts of Rowan, teaching her how to be human. How to love. \n\nAlong with a bunch of lore and adventure along the way!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please send me a message. Looking forward to it!",

            "selftext": "My ideal story would take place at least a good generation or two after the first public superhero. The existence of powers is now an established part of society, with superheroes acting more as special forces/SWAT than rogue vigilantes. Our story would follow some of the new recruits to a powered academy. \n\nAt the academy recruits are pushed to the limit in a series of qualifying exams and trials. Only the absolute best in body, mind, will, and character are able to pass and attain the honor of wearing a cape. \n\nThose that don the cape soon discover that their examinations were the easy part. As the small few holding back the forces of chaos in the world, they\u2019re work never cease and never lets up. \n\nAnother aspect I\u2019d also like to focus on is the effect fame has on these characters. Capes would be more popular than your professional atheletes, and even the most insignificant aspects of their lives would be covered by the paparazzi. \n\nMy preference would be for us to create an OC universe, and I have some ideas for how we\u2019d structure powers in that world. However, if you would prefer a more canonical setting we could do Marvel/DC, just as long as OC characters are our focus. I think My Hero Academia has a similar structure to this, but I haven\u2019t watched the anime so would prefer to avoid it. \n\nI can rp as any gender and am fine with any sort of pairing. I would prefer the story to be SFW, but can be persuaded otherwise. \n\nIf interested, please send me a pm with the appropriate contact information and a bit of information about you and what you would like to do with the story.

However, I think it would be a lot more fun with a partner! \n\nThe idea is basically following the events of the Epic, but filling in the blanks so stuff is just generally happening in between. It would involve developing Gilgamesh and Enkidu\u2019s relationship and I guess, would technically have an end :( \n\nThis would involve smut, so 18+ is a must. I was also hoping to play Gil, and do prefer third person. Discord is probably the best medium for me, but we can do whatever you prefer! \n\nThanks for reading! ",

It was something I never got to do during high school and finally during my junior year of college I finally was able to with a scholarship that I earned which payed for all of the classes that I would be taking, the only problem is that I would have to provide myself housing and a couple meals a day. The food wouldn't be the problem as much as the housing. So I took to Reddit and reached out to anyone who would be willing to house me while I was staying in Russia which was very discouraging at first, who would have thought people would be so hesitant to let some person, I couldn't blame them though. I would be hesitant if somebody I didn't know was looking to stay in my home for 6 months. Either way, I was lucky to finally hear back from one user who said that she would be more than happy to let me stay in her large manor with her as long as I helped with the cleaning and yard work explaining that it was hard to keep up with when it was just her in the manor. \n\nAfter a couple months of back and forth while we got to know each other it was finally time to meet her face to face, taking a cab to the address she provided and walking up the walkway to the large door of the gothic appearing mansion before knocking on the large and solid wood door waiting a few anxious minutes before hearing footsteps and the handle turn as the door slowly opened ",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am writing this to seek out one new writing partner. I have embarked on the long and arduous journey towards a PhD, which will limit my availability considerably. But fear not, I'm not going to stop writing any time soon!\n\nI seek engaging, mature stories, that allow me to study the different ways different characters react to various situations. Playing adult women is what I am best versed at, but I enjoy playing NPCs of all genders. My posting requirements are also rather simple: anything above one meaty paragraph makes me a happy gal. The goal is advancing the story and explaining what the characters feel, so do it the way you think best.\n\nPlease, please let me know if you don't like the RP. We can create something new or part as friends.\n\nMature content is also to be expected, as we are dealing with real people, leading real lives, but I need a plot to go with it as well. For that reason, I would seek to write with those above 18 years of age.\n\nI'd like to ask for something a little more specific: a roleplay inspired by the fabulous works of George R. R. Martin. I have read the books, but I will work with the TV series (Game of Thrones), just as easily. I prefer to focus on personal relationships, dramatic events, politics and diplomacy, so I'm not the right gal for anything combat based. Having said that, I have many ideas and different suggestions: listing them all here would only tire you out. It's enough to note I have a fondness for niche, relatively unknown characters and situations. I would also love a Dragon Age Inquisition plot. I'm no expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed the game.\n\nThe only things I tend to shy away from are related to anime and furry characters. If you have cravings and ideas you always wanted to do, please send them my way.\n\nThanks for reading all this! PM me to get this started!",

I have a full time job Mon-Fri (9-5 GMT) but I will try reply in my free time as often as possible. However, I\u2019ll try be active as possible at the start of the RP so we can get the ball rolling. \n\nAs the title states, I\u2019m willing to play any gender role, although I would prefer to write against a female character - I don\u2019t care so much what your real life gender is, just that you write as a female. Far as plots go, I have a couple ideas in mind and they are entirely dependent on my partners interests. \nMy ideas vary along every theme/genre, the only thing I will not write is Anime/Furry.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, I hope to hear from you soon, send me a message and I\u2019ll add you on Discord!
