I dont know where to start! I've downloaded discord in hopes of joining a group, and I'm interested in so many concepts posted here, but I just don't know how to initiate anything. \n\nWhat are some of your tips on starting? Are there any particularly useful websites/articles/posts that are good reading for a total beginner like me? And what do you think might be someone starting out should know that the roleplaying community ignores (warnings? maybe even the one thing you absolutely HATE about roleplaying?\n\nThank you everyone!",

There\u2019s holographic technology robotics, and space faring ships. Vakia is ruled by a foolish king, who gains his entertainment by watching his slaves barbarically fight to the death against Vakia\u2019s best and worse beasts and demons. The central coliseum, known as Debtar, (Named after the king himself, the old cocky son of a bitch.) is its largest and grandest structure, is the final destination for many slaves. \n\nDebtar is able to create thousands of different environments via solid projections, one day you\u2019ll be fighting large two-headed giants in the deep jungle, then the next day (if you survived) you\u2019d be fighting an Earth Yeti in the cold mountains. \n\nHere\u2019s where are subsequent heroes are located, the bottom most floor, underground being held in separate cages, waiting to be thrown into the fray, may Vakia have mercy on these lost souls.\n\n\nHello! I hope you enjoyed that beginning segment to my RP idea, \u201cA Tin Spider and a 4 Headed Mutant from beneath.\u201d (That is what he title is, yes). This is the first time I\u2019m attempting something of this caliber, so if you\u2019ll have me, I\u2019ll explain my idea.\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to always be a dungeon or game master, controlling everything that my group encounters, and I thought to why not do it now. I will be everything you encounter in Vakia, from a street beggar to the king himself. \n\nThe way combat would work is simply based off of RP, no stats. (This is definitely subject to change, if I can figure it out.) You\u2019ll have to work together and use your brains and not just your brawn. (Obviously, you can\u2019t one hit these monsters.)\n\nI\u2019m asking for 2 literate Roleplayers to join, as I have already two others. I will make an edit to this post if or when it\u2019s filled.  DM me with a short example of your rp ability, and any questions you have. After that I\u2019ll give you a character sheet, and I\u2019ll get you into the discord server!\n\nIf you have any ideas to how I can improve as a DM, then please comment or DM, I\u2019m open to all ideas and criticism. \n\nI hope to see you in Vakia, goodbye!\n\n",

Things like automotive purchases, and real estate will be added later. It has a welcoming staff team and a strict set of rules to ensure the user is put above the administrative staff, and to ensure quality is maintained. Anyone is welcome, be it new RPers, or veteran RPers, as long as they follow the rules. \n\nIt is 1969.\n\nThe United States is now heavily, and publicly involved in the Vietnam War. Many seek for fame, for a way to avoid the draft, and for drugs. Others, however, profit off of these individuals. Times have been getting better since the Second World War, but this is beginning to be like a fantasy to some. Most seek drugs, something that the Mafia's are beginning to profit on. A year has passed since a black man known as 'Lincoln Clay,' has taken over New Bordeaux. A Southern city that was originally controlled by the Italian Mafia, is now controlled by the Black Mob. The City has become a haven since, with Lincoln beginning to aid every other black individuals attempt to gain proper, equal Civil Rights. Further in the West however, this is not the case. For the last ten years the Italian Mafia, the 'Scorelli Family,' has controlled all of Los Angeles with little opposition. Lately though, gangs consisting of primarily African Americans have been challenging the Family's rain over Los Angeles. The \"Crips,\" gang, and a southern white supremacist mob from New Bordeaux. These two gangs are at war with each other, yet remain to challenge the Scorelli's.\n\nThe LAPD have also begun an investigation into the Family Don, Luca Scorelli. A man that immigrated to the United States in the late fifties, with little knowledge prior to this existing. Riots are forming every so often from the African Americans who wish for their civil rights, while the Hippies fund the Scorelli's by purchasing their drugs. But with the two, foreign threats to the region, alongside the LAPD threat, the Scorelli's are beginning to face a time of Hardship. Where they must now get every citizens final dollar, just to ensure they can continue to fight against their enemies.\n\nWant to be a member of the Scorelli Family? \n\nPerhaps a Citizen suffering from their tyranical reign?\n\nOR perhaps a member of the LAPD investigating the Scorelli's?\n\nIf so, PM me for information on how to join.\n\n*More playable factions will be added at a later date.*",

I'm really interested in roleplaying in general, i have a few specific interests but overall I'm pretty flexible and I am up for trying a little bit of everything. I am really into video games and have been thinking about overwatch rp a lot recently but that isn't my only interest at all. \nA little about me:\nMy name is Rosie and i am 22 years old from England. English is my first and only language unfortunately, apart from the occasional word or phrase in other languages. I studied English Literature and Language for 4 years so i am always up for talking about books, poetry etc. I read a lot of manga and watch (probably too much) anime. I work in the day time but fortunately i am usually able to message while working so i am flexible in that sense. \nAnyway, i am looking for someone completely new to the scene like myself, or someone who has a bit more experience and wouldn't mind showing me the ropes. \nI don't mind where we send messages, as i have discord, WhatsApp etc. I can always download kik is needed. \nIf you're interested or want to know more, please send me a message and we can chat! Thanks :)",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm on the RP prowl. Thought I'd give reddit a shot.\n\nAre you looking\u2026\n1. ...to write and receive multi-paragraph posts with a focus on rich atmosphere, lively dialogue, and complex character relationships?\n2. ...for emotionally-charged, character-driven stories?\n3. ...to write in original, historically-flavored medieval fantasy settings? No sci-fi or modern at this time, please, but fantasy races\u2014and a little magic to spice things up\u2014are welcome.\n\nSome more about me and my writing:\n\n* **Original settings, designed by combining elements of your worlds and mine, are my dream!** My characters do come with fairly fleshed-out worlds behind/around them, but these characters are also designed to be flexible\u2014to export painlessly into other roleplayers\u2019 worlds. I\u2019m happy to stage our story in one of my predesigned medieval fantasy worlds if you prefer to start with an established setting. I am also more than happy to tweak my characters to fit your own predesigned world.\n* **Character-driven stories.** I tend to write characters with BIG personalities\u2014people who are highly interactive and opinionated, but who take an investment to know on an intimate level. Because of this, I appreciate behind-the-scenes plotting with my roleplay partner, but I\u2019m not one to tell you everything about my characters before we start; it kills the fun of surprise and discovery! **I try for a fair balance: some planned plot points, but naturally-unfolding character relationships and back-story reveals.** \n* **Romantic plots are welcome, though not necessary.** I prefer organic, relatively unplanned romance development between characters. All gender pairings are welcome, too\u2014though, of course, your characters\u2019 partner preferences/orientation may not always be a match for my characters\u2019 partner preferences/orientation.\n\nBoring Rules Stuff:\n\n* Please note: I only do private 1x1 roleplay, but I am open to using messenger and/or e-mail services. I personally prefer Google Docs.\n* I am happy to roleplay with people of any identity, regardless of your characters' identities. I often write for characters whose identities do not match my own. That said, I frequently include mature themes in my plots and may describe violence; in the interest of everybody\u2019s emotional health, I\u2019m looking to write with **adults (20+) only.** \n* Slow post turn-around or break periods are no problem. We all have lives and shifting responsibilities. I promise to always be respectful of your time constraints, and ask that you are with mine, too.\n* I am looking exclusively for multi-paragraph advanced lit. roleplay, but I understand length should suit the situation. If a situation calls for a tiny little post, it\u2019s fine by me; similarly, if a post needs ten pages, go for it! That in mind, I have no hard length demands, but I tend to average 500 words a post; if you fall anywhere around that general zone, we should be a cozy fit. \n\n**Final Note:** Quality writing is a big deal to me. That said, RP is play, and everybody goofs or goes flat from time to time. As long as we both honestly care about our writing and our story, it's gold.\n\nIf this sounds at all like you, don\u2019t be shy! I can't wait to hear all about your OCs.",

As the title suggests, I've recently been getting some serious hankerings for some different themes of roleplay, and I'd just love to have your help in satisfying them! Of course, I'd be happy to be happy to return the favor, and we can both find something that we enjoy and settle on a story that we'll both love. \n\nAnyway! Most rude of me, I haven't introduced myself! The name is Lee! I'm a male, 22 years of age, currently residing in the Eastern Time zone! I've been writing and roleplaying for nearly 11 years now, collectively, and consider myself to be at least fairly gifted at both! I don't ask that you be the same, but I do ask that you PLEASE be at least literate and over the age of 18! Moving on!\n\nMy cravings. Now these aren't in any particular order of favoritism, but my biggest cravings will be marked with a \"*\" Take note that, yes, some of these are video game based, but that doesn't mean we can turn it around and make our own twist!\n\n-Fallout***\n-Kingdom Come, TES or any fantasy element roleplay\n-Pirates*\n-Western (Cowboy's and Yeehaws)\n-Sci-Fi\n-Horror\n\nAlright! Now! If any of that's snagged your attention, great! Just a few little footnotes..\n\nI tend to write one to three paragraphs, perhaps more if the situation calls for it. While I don't ask you do the same, I do ask that you please refrain from one line responses! \n\nI definitely don't demand your every day attention! Life happens, you have things to do and so do I! I won't come knocking down your door if you don't reply soon.. but please please pleaaaaaaaaase don't just ghost on me, never to return. Just lemme know if you lose interest or have to go and I promise I'll understand.\n\nSmut! I love it! That said, I don't often fade to black, but I will make exceptions if you need it! I won't call for smut without reason, of course, unless it is necessary. On the down low, though, if you just really want smut and want a purely smut roleplay (which is fine!) Just please let me know!\n\nI think... That about wraps it up! If I've somehow held your interest to this point, feel free to shoot me a message here or leave a comment and we can sort things out! I look forward to hearing from you! ",

With the capability to create a wormhole that would allow traversing great distances in space in mere seconds. Another step to mankind exploring the stars and witnessing how galaxies are born.*\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEverything had been a success with the Pistis project. From the launch, to creating and dismantling wormholes. A minimum crew of eight thousand were proud and excited to be apart of making history. Spirits had been high along with anticipation as they began the procedure to make the jump through the wormhole. Needless to say, the jump had been a success from opening the wormhole and navigating through it. People of Earth eagerly waited for their return. A return that did not happen.\nThe sound of cheering bounced around the prototype\u2019s hull as everyone celebrated their leap for humanity. Their names would be written in history and hailed as heroes upon their safe return. That would be the case until the sound of celebration quickly began blend into the sound of sheer terror and pain.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCrewmembers began to claw at their skin, gouging and lacerating themselves while others hauled their eyeballs from their sockets. Flaying their skin as they cried out in some language that no one could truly understand with all the confusion. Those that were unaffected tried to help only to be beaten, dismembered or even flayed themselves. Some were even impaled and erected in a barbaric fashion. What happened to the crew? What transpired through the jump? Had they travelled to Hell? Who could save them now?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n*A roleplay inspired from the movie Event Horizon with elements from Dead Space; a survival horror.*\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n*Several days had passed since the jump, though it had felt like eternity. Lights constantly dimmed along with the safe humming sound of the engines at random intervals. The shrieking sounds of pain and smell of death continued to linger, a constant reminder of what\u2019s to come. Eli sat in the corner of a storage room gripping onto the wrench that he had found while running for his life. His knuckles were white along with his face as he struggled to catch his breath through the sheer panic and hysteria of what he had witnessed. Those pale blue eyes with cracks of crimson lightning in the whites stared intently at the door he had managed to barricade, petrified that it would eventually give way. And though he knew he could travel through the airducts, it was the furthest thing upon his mind as he struggled to control his breathing.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n*From time to time the P.A. of the ship would kick in and the sound of a guttering demonic language would bark noises that Eli could not decipher. Each time made him jump, and he could feel his stomach lurch and his heart threatening to leave his chest through his throat if he couldn\u2019t get himself together. How could this happen? It was supposed to be a leap for mankind. It was a leap alright but straight into the bowels of hell.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEli Kochekov\n\nTwentyeight\n\nSix feet two centimetres\n\nOne hundred and sixty four pounds\n\nAverage build\n\nMale\n\nWormhole Generator Specialist\n\nPale blue eyes with dark hair, an average looking guy that tends to keep to himself. A bit of a loner with slight social awkwardness. A small scar below his left due to failed experiment. \n\n---\n\n**OOC**\n\nHey! So, I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite some time but took a bit of a break. I\u2019m really rusty but I\u2019d love to get back into it. If something like this interest you, please don\u2019t hesitate to send me a message. I can Discord, Emails, Skype or whatever may be convenient for yourself.

Hello, my name is Anthony and I am an 18\\-year\\-old college student and I have been in the mood to create an exciting original fantasy world.\n\nII. Traelnes is a hard place to grow up in, a shell of its former self. A sprawling mature town with a walled off inner\\-city called The District to differentiate the upper classes from the common rabble. The burg is known for its vigorous knight training programs that churn out elite warriors and military personnel, which is in the inner\\-city. Outside of the District is a place where the farmers, smiths, and laborers reside. The youth of these commoners clamor to be let in the District to enroll into the programs, which they are allowed. But not everyone is able to pass and consequentially they are kicked out. Some become adventurers and use their skills to make a name for themselves, while others apply it to banditry and harass the local populace.\n\nIII. For the story I have left some parts grey because I want us to fill in those areas together. But I do have a map setting and we can fill in the history and the nitty gritty details together later https://imgur.com/a/x3dMWte. The kingdom's name in which we will be starting is Austrand and we will start in the burg of Traelnes. This universe will have magic, dragons, and well known mythical creatures. We might change their mannerisms to fit our universe. For our characters we will brainstorm together, we can be nobles, adventurers, or maybe even bandits. If you have anything to contribute please let me know! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nIV. For writing, just write to your heart\u2019s content. I trust that you will write meaningfully, and it should come around to a paragraph or two, maybe less or more depending on the occasion. I\u2019d like to write in third person and have multi\\-characters in the future. But when we start we will have 2 characters so we can start small and expand as our story goes on.\n\nV. I have some ample free time, I can probably churn out 1 or 2 responses a day depending on my schedule. I live in the West Coast of the United States \\(Pacific Daylight Time\\). If I can\u2019t for whatever reason I will let you know and I will expect the same, please. I am acquainted with multiple platforms like discord, skype, PM, etc. Just tell me what you\u2019re comfortable with and I\u2019ll most likely go with that. We\u2019ll have 2 channels, one for the actual roleplaying and the other for out\\-of\\-character chat for everything else.\n\nVII. For your response please include: your schedule, time\\-zone, questions/proposals regarding to me or the role\\-play, brief character story &amp; background, and contact information. If I forgot any other important details don\u2019t hesitate to include that. I hope we share the same interests and can delve in a magical world together.",

            "selftext": "\"My skin has turned to porcelain, to ivory, to steel.\"\n\nHello! Thanks for dropping by.\n\nI'm looking for male canon characters from the Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire universe to pair with Sansa Stark in a long-term one-on-one roleplay over Reddit PMs, email, Google Docs, or Discord. This story will be a romance at heart, focusing on the relationship between our two characters, but an overarching plot full of action and adventure will also be present. Please note that Sansa will be written 18+ to deal with the very mature and dark themes that will likely take place throughout the story. With that said, I would prefer that any prospective roleplay partners be at least 21+ as I am in my mid-twenties.\n\nThe following characters are who I am open to pairing Sansa with: Sandor Clegane, Tyrion Lannister, Petyr Baelish, Jon Snow, or Jaime Lannister. (Also Brienne of Tarth, though she is my sole F/F interest.) If there is anyone you'd like to write that's not listed just let me know! Perhaps you can shine the light on a new pairing for me.\n\nI want to point out that I am more familiar with the show than the books, though I am diligently working my way through the series. However, I'm happy to read up on the wiki and do my research to make a more book-centered storyline work.\n\nSend me a PM if anything about this post caught your eye. Looking forward to hearing from you!",

I\u2019ve spent a a few days (spaced out, not in a row) just laying on my couch and playing the entire day even when people aren\u2019t that active. I have the need to keep checking in on it or trying to do something in it even if nothing is going on. It doesn\u2019t help that I struggle with depression so I know this is most likely becoming an outlet for avoidance. At the same time I can\u2019t muster the willpower to really stop, nor do I have a desire to. It\u2019s very conflicting. I was wondering if anyone who has had similar experience could potentially provide some kind of advice?",

Not starting with devil fruits, haki, and 300 million beri bounties.\nThat's just about it, I don't mind NSFW, but let's keep it SFW for this post, so just dm me for more information on that. \n\nWe can discuss the plot and setting we want to do once we've contacted each other. I hope to build a great character with you, whoever you may be. Please take this RP into consideration. I've been wanting to do this for a long time now. I hope I'm not alone out there in my aspiration, but I feel like I'm probably not. :) \n\nI prefer to use discord, but I'm flexible as far as our communication medium goes, so hit me up!\n\nI look forward to working with all of you. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully I'll find someone who'd like to RP.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Snow fell softly onto the many drifts that had begun to form on the roads and against the houses. It had started in the night and had not let up since, but the town of Jov\u2019Leck had planned for it, just as they did every winter before that. The women took in the smoked meat and stored the wheat in medal pails so that the house mice were unable to get to it. The men who went on monthly trips for wood returned and rationed it out to every house in the village. The women knew exactly how to make all of the wood they were given last until the winter melted into spring. \n\nJust like all towns Jov\u2019Leck was no different in having classes. There were the mayors family, who ruled over the town and would report back to the king after the winter had gone. Not to mention they were fabulously wealthy. \nThen there were the generals, who, when the stars were right, set sail with their men to gather supplies and talk with foreign governments to speak of peace or of war. \nWarriors were next, they fought for the gods and the people they belonged to, bringing back gold to their wives, who really knew how to hold a home.\nMerchants and fisherman followed, they sold and bought, traded and bargained for what they wanted to sell or what they needed to survive.\nThe poor lives on The outskirts of the village, they seldom were heard from and were not seen in towns all too often.\n\nToday, the second day of winter, was the day that the warriors were to return from battle. They did so right on time. The large Viking like ship pulled into the ancient doc, the large shields on the side scratched and dented from the sea warfare that the men had fought. However, as usual, no one was there to wait for them, the women had too much to do, all expect for one.\nA small woman stood at the end of the dock, her hands clasped over her mouth as she tried her best to warm her mitten. Fur poked out from the bottom and moved with her breath. She was enclosed in a large bear skin coat, her boots almost not even visible from under it as she shuffled to keep herself from freezing. She rubbed her now heavily pregnant belly, cooing softly at her baby as she waited.\nThe ship docked and a large plank sung over the side so that the men could walk down it. She waited for the majority of the time, watching the faces as they passed before she spotted her husband. Though once she did her face lit up and she waddled as quickly as she could towards the man, \u201cMy love!\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYo yo yo,\n\nThis is a story about an almost Viking like village at the edge of the water, far away from any others and the forest a like. \n\nI\u2019d love for someone to be Clara\u2019s husband, of course you don\u2019t have to, then that would take up the romance element of this mostly horror rp. Yep it\u2019s horror.\nLet me elaborate, since this town is so remote you\u2019d almost expect that there would be monsters! It comes each year and kills many and no one has learned how to stop it. \n\nSo please reply to this prompt I\u2019m your message, just pm me and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I\u2019m physically able to!",

Disease is rampant, spreading like a curse across the continent.\n\nSomething bigger is coming, makes what we have seen look like a fluffy bunny.\n\nThat's where we come in.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! My last post got a lot of good attention so I decided to come back with another idea. This one is more of a general thing, with lots of room for my partner to add on and come up with things. Before I get into the specifics I want to give some extra background about myself.\n\nSo in my Midnight Animal prompt (you can go back and look for it in this very sub) I briefly talked about how I like playing games. I am a huge weeb and gamer having played just about every console out there, including the PC. Over the years I\u2019ve always thought about crossing random things over for the funsies, and now I\u2019ve come here to hopefully attract some partners!\n\nSo if you haven\u2019t caught on already I\u2019m looking for partners for cool one-on-one stories featuring different characters from different games! We would come up with our own unique story, either combining the games or placing our characters in a strange new world! Romance would be a huge plus, along with some cool action! I\u2019m not stranger to smut either, so I\u2019m okay with it as long as we don\u2019t rush into it or make it the whole RP. Smut isn\u2019t necessary though, so I\u2019m okay with fluffy and clean romances as well!\n\nThe idea is for us to play existing characters, so I\u2019m not really looking for something with OCs. If it\u2019s something like PUBG or Battlefield where there\u2019s no real concrete characters then that\u2019s where I\u2019m open to OCs, as long as they fit the world/classes in the game. I\u2019m also open to genderbends, so if you wanted to play like a Female or Male version of different characters that\u2019s fine too!\n\nI\u2019m looking for detailed writers, so if you can\u2019t at least provide one paragraph for your responses I\u2019m sorry but like anything below that is a major turn off for me. I\u2019m not looking for crazy overly detailed responses either, but I won\u2019t turn you down if you write like that. I usually write 1-3 paragraphs, with 1-2 being my norm consistently. So just a heads up!\n\nAnyways that\u2019s all for my caveats and requirements. If you have any other questions please mention them in your message! I don\u2019t like giving out contact info so please message (don\u2019t comment) through here! Also to prove that you read this much in your message rate on a 1-10 how cool is Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil series! I\u2019m going to put a huge list of stuff I\u2019m willing to crossover right under here so take a look and remember, you can suggest anything that isn\u2019t on the list as well. Looking forward to getting your guys\u2019 and gals\u2019 messages!\n\nList of Games/Series: Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Metal Gear Solid, House of the Dead, Time Crisis, Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, Final Fantasy, Dark Souls, Nioh, PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battleground, Fortnite, Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, Left 4 Dead, Dragon\u2019s Dogma, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Counterstrike, Rainbow Six, NieR Automata, Metroid, Fire Emblem, Overwatch, Life is Strange\n\nI tried to make the list as varied as possible to show you that you can suggest just about anything to me, so don\u2019t be scared!",

            "selftext": "Mafia RP 1969, Los Angeles is a text Roleplay on the Discord platform. \n\nThe RP group contains some RPG\\-like elements such as a finance system, and the ability to purchase guns. Things like automotive purchases, and real estate will be added later. It has a welcoming staff team and a strict set of rules to ensure the user is put above the administrative staff, and to ensure quality is maintained. Anyone is welcome, be it new RPers, or veteran RPers, as long as they follow the rules. \n\nIt is 1969.\n\nThe United States is now heavily, and publicly involved in the Vietnam War. Many seek for fame, for a way to avoid the draft, and for drugs. Others, however, profit off of these individuals. Times have been getting better since the Second World War, but this is beginning to be like a fantasy to some. Most seek drugs, something that the Mafia's are beginning to profit on. A year has passed since a black man known as 'Lincoln Clay,' has taken over New Bordeaux. A Southern city that was originally controlled by the Italian Mafia, is now controlled by the Black Mob. The City has become a haven since, with Lincoln beginning to aid every other black individuals attempt to gain proper, equal Civil Rights. Further in the West however, this is not the case. For the last ten years the Italian Mafia, the 'Scorelli Family,' has controlled all of Los Angeles with little opposition. Lately though, gangs consisting of primarily African Americans have been challenging the Family's rain over Los Angeles. The \"Crips,\" gang, and a southern white supremacist mob from New Bordeaux. These two gangs are at war with each other, yet remain to challenge the Scorelli's.\n\nThe LAPD have also begun an investigation into the Family Don, Luca Scorelli. A man that immigrated to the United States in the late fifties, with little knowledge prior to this existing. Riots are forming every so often from the African Americans who wish for their civil rights, while the Hippies fund the Scorelli's by purchasing their drugs. But with the two, foreign threats to the region, alongside the LAPD threat, the Scorelli's are beginning to face a time of Hardship. Where they must now get every citizens final dollar, just to ensure they can continue to fight against their enemies.\n\nWant to be a member of the Scorelli Family? \n\nPerhaps a Citizen suffering from their tyranical reign?\n\nOR perhaps a member of the LAPD investigating the Scorelli's?\n\nIf so, contact me for information on how to join\n\n*More playable factions will be added at a later date.*",

Twitter is preferable, but Discord is also doable!\n\nI like to think I\u2019m skilled enough. I\u2019ll be offering an excerpt of my writing at the end of this post.\n\nFor reference, I am 24, female, and I vastly prefer handling male muses as opposed to female ones. I do not write smut, so don\u2019t ask. \n\nI am very ship driven, meaning I rp mainly for the sake of shipping and concocting new storylines with our muses. I\u2019m also very much into angst and the \u201cforbidden love\u201d trope.\n\nNow, without further ado...\n\n*FANDOMS*\n\n**\u2014Inuyasha**\n\nYes, I\u2019m aware the fandom is essentially dead. However, this fandom is the one that I\u2019m mainly invested in at the moment.\n\nMy main ship for Inuyasha is Sesshomaru x Adult!Rin, though I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to Sesshomaru x Kagura or even Sesshomaru x Kagome. \n\nMy muse is Sesshomaru, just in case it wasn\u2019t clear.\n\n**\u2014Persona 5**\n\nMy muse here is Yusuke Kitagawa.\n\nI\u2019m not picky with my ships for Yusuke, but keep in mind that Ann Takamaki is my favourite shipping partner for him.\n\nI don\u2019t shy away from dark topics, and as long as we explore them with respect, then I\u2019m more then happy to. It\u2019s no secret that the Phantom Thieves each went through traumatic events, so it\u2019d be fun to explore the aftermath of it all.\n\nI\u2019ll ship him with any of the female Phantom Thieves, even Hifumi. Really, as I said, I\u2019m not picky provided we build them up.\n\n**\u2014Fire Emblem Fates/Awakening.**\n\nMy muse in Fates is Xander and my muse in Awakening is Gaius. Please keep in mind that I prefer to rp Gaius, as I feel his character resonates with me more.\n\nMy preferred ship with Xander is female Corrin.\n\nMy preferred ship with Gaius is either Sumia or Maribelle.\n\nHowever, again, I am not opposed to trying other ships with these two. I also have a soft spot for Gaius x Cordelia.\n\n**\u2014Legend Of Zelda**\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I haven\u2019t roleplayed Zelda in ages. For this fandom, I\u2019m fine playing TP Link, Midna, or TP Zelda.\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t object to BOTW Zelda x Link.\n\nMy ships are:\n\n\u2014TP Zelda x Link\n\n\u2014Midna x Link\n\n\u2014 BOTW Zelda x Link\n\n**Excerpt of my writing:**\n\nFeel free to browse my Sesshomaru RP account, as I show you a glimpse of what I\u2019m capable of. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/refinedconceit/status/999829872196268032?s=21\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

That being said 95&amp;#37; of the time I reply pretty quickly.\n\n\\* I tend to post OOC stuff and thoughts on the RP all the time and am generally chatty so even if the other person is not around I might have several posts and make several edits to my post\n\n\\* I am a semi\\-literate to literate RPer. My post length varies based on that of my partner usually I can match pretty well whatever the person I am doing the RP with is writing. Also if you want me to change something \n\n\\* Partners must be 18\\+ but I prefer them be at least 20 I never aim for anything intentionally that would require it but if the RP goes that direction I don't want to worry about it. Also if I get a PM I will almost always ask again just to make sure you read the rule and are 18\\+ because it is better safe than sorry in my opinion\n\n\\* I prefer modern realistic RPs although I don't mind somewhat recent historical pretty much 1900\\-present I can maybe do\n\n\\* Major interests as far as material: medical \\(my favorite\\), sports, war \\(more as a setting\\), combat \\(I really like RPing fights as well as the aftermath from it\\), romance, drama, slice of life and angst\n\n\\* I do ask that anybody I am playing with if you want me to change something or have suggestions for me to improve please do give them, I don't want someone silently steaming at me because I am doing something minor that can be easily corrected\n\n\\* I prefer discord or PM\n\n\\* I can play either gender and am fine with any gender pairing \n\n\\* I can also play multiple characters\n\n\\* I also had an idea for an RP of some major event which is 1 on 1 but with each person playing many different characters\n\n\\* I need all main characters to be 18\\+ as well\n\n\\* I am open to plot suggestions and also feel free to look at my old prompts\n\n\\* I am a little weird also if you decide after a little while that your not interested in the RP just let me know that is fine but please don't just disappear.\n\n\\* If you message me tell me a little about yourself or your thoughts about my prompt or ideas don't just give me a discord handle or ask for mine put a little effort in.\n\nNow the prompts I like right now. I don't have particular genders in mind for the character's but for some of them I am writing them with certain genders as placeholders for what I think would work best but feel free to change them.\n\n\\*\\*Meeting Again\\*\\*\n\n\\(Already doing this prompt with others but I really enjoy it and would love to do it with more people if your willing to put your twist on it.\\) Muse A and B had been dating since the start of their sophomore year of college and now having just graduated were beginning to contemplate taking the next step in their relationship when the accident happened severely injuring B. Her family blamed Muse A for what had happened and told him that she never wanted to see him again despite the fact that she still loved him and needed him more than ever. Over the next few years neither of them could find someone else when chance would bring them back together although things were not the same as they were before.\n\n\\*\\*Making the most of it\\*\\*\n\nMuse A and Muse B are stuck as roommates for a long time in the hospital, a rehabilitation center, or a long term care facility or something similar. With nothing to do but talk for hours on end and being able to relate to one another cause something to develop.\n\n\\*\\*Love in the most trying of times\\*\\*\n\nI was thinking the plot from Meeting Again but continuing after the accident if they aren't broken up and dealing with all the changes and circumstances that result.\n\nI also have a few more out their ideas that I am willing to share in PM if you think our styles might mesh but don't like my prompts. I am also open to your ideas as well.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Bailey and I\u2019m in need of some new partners, as my previous ones failed to respond or weren\u2019t doing it for me. I use kik or reddit for my role plays, and absolutely do not like discord, and refuse to use it. I don\u2019t know why, but it never rolled with me. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI\u2019ve never been good at describing fight scenes or action, but do like to incorporate it into my scenes. Some of my favorite roleplays I have done have included vampires, rich people, some fandoms, (I\u2019m also picky on those,) crime, reality, drama, romance, high school, trauma, and the list could go on forever. I know there\u2019s so many more, but these are the only things I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but am more than fine with smut if it fits into the story. Also. as for pairings, I prefer MxF, with me as F, but I can dabble in FxF if it is necessary. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where lots of words are necessary. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey. ",

            "selftext": "**Edit: most people seem to feel sceptical about the \"varying genders and orientations\" and \"multiple characters\" restrictions below. If that's the only thing you don't like, please contact me regardless. We can work something out, and maybe I need to adjust my criteria a bit. :)**\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

I do NSFW but I won't do NSFW with minors, so keep that in mind. \n\nHere's a link to my roleplaygateaway if anyone is interested! \n[profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/6sjjgg/slimyguts/?st=jhqs857l&amp;sh=5c4330e3)\n\nHope to talk to you guys soon!

            "selftext": "\\*\\*Hey my fellow RPers!\\*\\*\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\\*\\*Posting Quality/Quantity\\*\\*\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n\\*\\*Short/Medium/Long\\-term\\*\\*\n\n I don't mind doing short and medium\\-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long\\-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium\\-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long\\-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n\\*\\*Platforms\\*\\*\n\n When it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n\\*\\*Posting Speed\\*\\*\n\n Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n\\*\\*Genres\\*\\*\n\n\\*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.\\*\n\n\\* High Fantasy\n\n\\* Low Fantasy \n\n\\* Alternate Fantasy \\(Not Urban Fantasy. \\*\\*Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.\\*\\*\\)\n\n\\* Modern \\(If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.\\)\n\n\\* Post\\-Apocalyptic \\(But not zombies.\\) \\(I do have a list of choices for this one\\)\n\n\\* Romance \\(Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre\\)\n\n\\* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n\n\\* Sci\\-Fi\n\n\\* Horror\n\n\\* Historical Fiction \\(In rare cases\\)\n\n\\* Medieval/Pre\\-modern\n\n\\* Fandoms \\(In some cases, explained in another part.\\)\n\n\\* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n\\*As for a few I'm not for:\\*\n\n\\* Urban Fantasy\n\n\\* Historical \\(Realistic\\)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n\\*\\*Fandoms\\*\\*\n\n This is just a list of some of the pre\\-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n\\* The Elder Scrolls\n\n\\* Warcraft\n\n\\* DC Universe\n\n\\* Marvel Universe\n\n\\* Assassin's Creed\n\n\\* Borderlands\n\n\\* Dishonored\n\n\\* The Maze Runner\n\n\\*\\*World Building\\*\\*\n\n I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n\\*\\*The Conclusion\\*\\*\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n\n\\*\\*To previous users who know me!\\*\\*\n\nI currently lost all my discord chats and chat history, If we have an unfinished RP please message me and I can get back to you!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm currently looking for partners for a wide variety of plots I would like to do! Without further ado, I'll dive right into it!\u00a0\n\nA little bit about me:\u00a0I have been roleplaying for nearly four years. I'm usually available afternoons on most weekdays, and free on the weekends! I'll do my best to alert you if I am aware I'll be gone for an extended period of time.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n-\u00a0Someone who is detailed.\u00a0I'm looking for someone who puts detail and effort into the replies they send. I don't mind the occasional grammar error, I'm not too much of a stickler when it comes to it. I don't expect massive walls of text every reply, as long as you aren't constantly spitting out one line responses, I'll be happy! I tend to write two to three paragraphs per response, although I will do my best to match the length of what you send.\n\n-\u00a0Someone who doesn't mind playing multiple characters.\u00a0This one isn't too much a requirement as it is a preference. If you like playing several characters, cool! Otherwise, it's not a deal breaker for me!\n\nPlots I'm interested in.\n\nAlright, so here is the list of plots I would like to do. It's kinda long, so I've divided it into two categories.\u00a0Fandom and Non-fandom.\n\nNote: Anything marked with a '[!]' next to it means I especially want to do that one!\n\nFANDOM\n\nNote: I'm not to big on OCs, I greatly prefer if you play only cannon characters.\n\n[!] RWBY:\n\n- My character would be a teenager, running around Vale as a thief. Eventually caught, but instead of being sent to a detention center, the headmaster of Beacon Academy has a better idea. He would be put under the watch of one of the teams of the academy. It could be team RWBY, JNPR, CFVY, Cinder's \"team\". Heck, I'd even be willing to give a team STQR approach. (They would be a bit younger, of course.) Maybe of unique team, composed of various different characters?\n\n- Same character as above, different scenario. What if all of the main cast of the show were put in one large house? Chaos would ensure, definitely. Chaos that my character would be thrown into. I'm pretty open to any character roster for this!\n\n- My character would be a new student to Atlas Academy. A bit of a troublemaker, until an dust incident results in him being put under the watch of Winter, much to his dismay. (Winter could be swapped out with Pyrrah, or even Glenda for this one!)\n\n[!] Overwatch:\n\n- My character would be a teenager who ran away from home, sneaking aboard a cargo ship. For the last 6 months, I've been traveling the world this way, before accidentally coming across Watchpoint: Gibraltar\n\nAlternatively, he could be kidnapped by Talon.\n\nBorderlands:\n\n- My character would be a teenager, the heir of a massive mining company. After a rebellious act of running away, he would crash land on Pandora, before being found by Lilith or Maya. This would take place after the main campaign of BL2 is done!\n\n- Or, my character could be a lowly thief on Pandora, before making the grave mistake of trying to rob Lilith/Maya/Athena.\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club:\n\n- A mysterious event brings the characters of the game into the 'real' world, leaving a destructive rift behind in their wake. Chaos ensures, especially now that Monika has access to the object she desires most\u2026\n\nOther characters I'm interested in my partner playing, but don't really have a plot for:\n\n\n- Samus (Metroid) [!]\n- Elizabeth (BioShock) [!]\n- Monika (DDLC)\n- Cynthia (Pokemon)\n- Lusamine (Pokemon)\n- 2B (Neir: Automata) [!]\n- Cortana (Halo)\n- IQ (R6)\n- Any girl from Pokemon, really. \n- Piper (Fallout)\n- Cammy (Street Fighter) [!]\n\nNON-FANDOM\n\nSo, I have a lot of non-fandom ideas. So I've simply listed roles I would be interested in my partner playing! If you would like to play any of these roles, just tell me which one and we can work a plot out!\n\n- Soilder/other high military officer.\n- Teacher/principal.\n- Cop/security guard.\n- Assassin\n- Slime girl/other monster girl.\n- Classmate\n- Android (Like 2B from Neir)\n- Kidnapper.\n- Serial Killer.\n- Criminal.\n- Former Actress\n- Famous YouTuber\n\n\n\nIf your interested in any of the plots or roles, pm me or leave a comment!\n",

            "selftext": "This story takes place seven years before the events depicted in Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope, a year commonly referred to as 7 BBY. The Galactic Empire has been established for twelve years, casting its ominous shadow throughout the galaxy by tightening its grip of power from world to world.\n\nThe same applies to the once crime-riddled planet Florrum. Having been colonized by the Empire following its rise, the Outer Rim planet did not take long to return to its roots of crime and corruption. In the midst of the crime, however, two veterans of the Clone Wars, Amitikkes Porel, and Rie-Rie Tuedro, now freedom fighters, have risked everything to develop a rebel cell, to fight the Empire on Florrum and its connecting systems. And thus, Kyber Squadron was born.\n\nWhile the early years of Kyber Squadron were poorly countered by the Empire, reports of growing rebel activity and overall lawlessness in the region meant the sector had attracted the attention of the larger Empire. Following a troubling series of reports, Emperor Palpatine personally ordered Grand Admiral Jaren to clamp down on the area and fully restore the Empire\u2019s control. Receiving his orders, Grand Admiral Jaren spent weeks preparing and for a full-scale occupation of the Sertar Sector. During the Imperial Occupation of Florrum, its governor, Tovar Uvsaw, was informally removed from power after a thorough investigation of his misdeeds was ordered by the Grand Admiral himself. Now under strong Imperial occupation and a constant state of martial law, Jaren has full control of the sector and it\u2019s populace, without oversight, until such a time as he declares it to be both crime and rebel-free. Using his newfound power, the Admiral has set up forced labor camps across the sector assist in a grander scheme of his...\n\nThe Occupation of Florrum and the mass influx of Imperial Forces from Jaren\u2019s Twelfth Fleet caught Kyber Squadron off-guard, leading to the destruction of six out of the cell\u2019s initial ten ships. But this was nothing compared to the successful assassination of Rie-Rie Tuedro, the founder, and figurehead of the cell, at the hands of Imperial Assassin Meydis Laralen.\n\nAs a response to that crippling defeat, Kyber Squadron\u2019s fight seemed over. It was only after weeks of hiding that Amitikkes Porel, the leader of the cell, called together the remaining Kyber Cell forces in an effort to dive back into the fight against the Empire. The size of their fleet now reduced drastically, things seem dire for Kyber Cell.\n\nKyber-Home, Kyber Squadron\u2019s flagship, a heavily modified and currently understaffed Nebulon-B Frigate. A Frankenstein-like amalgamation of two Nebulon-B Frigates, Kyber-Home is currently Kyber Cell\u2019s largest asset and base of operations.\n\nThe Remembrance, an improved Hammerhead Corvette, the oldest ship within the cell, renamed as a tribute to Rie-Rie Tuedro\u2019s death. She was formerly known as the Firebrand, prior to the Imperial Occupation. Captained by Tind Brakdis, the Remembrance has taken charge of the Kyber Squadron\u2019s asset requisition and humanitarian missions.\n\nThe Go-Between, a modified CR90 Corvette, a much larger hangar was installed to give to the initial ship some fighter carrying capacity. Captained by Tri-Nought, the Go-Between has become the center of the rebel cell\u2019s intelligence network.\n\nThe Mediator, a Consular-class cruiser [Charger C70 Retrofit], modified to replace most of its cargo capacity with a small but capable hangar. Captained by Karitia Nekrii, the Mediator\u2019s name was chosen somewhat ironically, as it is the home to the most capable infantry soldiers within Kyber Cell. All of which are ready to be deployed in the heat of the battle at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nBesides the remaining ships, some ground forces and a handful of fighters, you, the players, will essentially be building, or rebuilding, Kyber Squadron from ashes. You will be able to create your own character to fight back against the Empire and their iron grip as a member of Kyber Cell!\n\nSave Kyber Squadron! Save the dream!\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/FvU2fxV",

            "selftext": "Hello, I enjoy writing in my spare time, and have been a writer for many years. I roleplayed a lot in the past, but haven't really done it too much recently--so I'd like to change that!\n\nIt would be great if I could find a partner (or two) here to create a new story (or two?!) with. I am looking for something pretty casual but at least semi-literate (don't worry about typos or misspellings or grammar errors or whatever, you know, jst dnt typ lek dis, with posts that are at least 2 paragraphs, please! I'd like to come up with a plot together, share characters, world-build etc. preferably through Discord/Google Docs.\n\nI love Fantasy/Romance stories, but I'm open to combining it with Sci-Fi or other genres, though I'm not a fan of Horror. I may be all right with +18 content, but that would be something to be discussed later on, and it depends on how the story goes and other elements, but this would be something I'd prefer to be a secondary element to the story, not what drives the plot--in other words, it may or may not come up in the story.\n\nAnyways, I also might be open to fandom RPs or crossovers, putting OCs into canon worlds, etc. I'm pretty flexible, so I'm sure we could work something out.\n\nJust a note that I like to write often, although I work 5 days a week afternoon-night shift and will usually be online at night after dark. (around 11PM-6AM EST) I would prefer to have at least one post a day, though more would be awesome too, if possible. Like I said, I'm flexible, so whatever works for both of us!\n\nI'd like to be friends outside of the RP as well, and talk on Discord/discuss our story there; for writing the story itself, I'd prefer to use Google Docs!\n\nI've never posted on here before so I hope I did this right! If you're interested, please PM me your Discord name and I'll add you when I can. :) I'd love to make some new friends/RP partners here! \n\nThanks for your time.",

            "selftext": "Jeff sat at his computer, balancing a bag of ice on his knee, and was checking Google alerts for his alter ego, The Merryman. By night, Jeff Jensen was a popular (in the mildest sense of the word) local (limited to the chicken restaurant that hosted open mics on a nightly basis) stand up comedian. Also by night, he was The Merryman, a vigilante armed with a bow. He was a great shot, and though he had no real superpowers, an incident at the dentist had left him with a filling that allowed him to pick up radio signals, from time to time.\n\nHaving gotten back from a night of fighting crime, in which he had managed to stop two muggings, the latter of which he was rewarded with a cane to his knee when he returned the near-sighted old woman's purse to her, he was disappointed by seeing no reports of his good deeds. He did find that he had made it onto *Freedom City's Top 400 Heroes* list. #398! He smiled to himself, until he realized that they had misspelled his name. \"*The Merry Man*? It's The Merryman!\" He sighed. At least it was something.\n\nHe tapped his chin, wondering how he could go higher in the rankings. He might even get a sponsorship deal if he cracked the Top 200. Then he could finally afford a new apartment, and perhaps a car. He loved his electric scooter, of course. It was good for the environment. It just didn't impress people the way a roaring engine did. He looked at some of the names higher up on the list, and it finally came to him. Those heroes belonged to groups, or had sidekicks. \"That's what I need! A sidekick!\" He smiled, and went to Freedom City's craigslist page. The personals ads were gone, a reminder that he had to make a Tinder profile. Maybe Grindr, for when the mood struck... \"Focus!\" He settled on *volunteers*. Anyone wanting to fight crime needed to be a nice person, and who is nicer than someone who volunteers for something? Plus, it reflected what he'd be able to pay them. \n\nJeff stared at the screen for a moment as he pondered on how to compose the ad, then started typing. \"*Costumed bowman seeks sidekick to help fight crime in The Fens. You must provide your own costume and equipment. No starting salary, but a good deed is it's own reward! Contact The Merryman for details. The Merryman.*\"\n\nJeff nodded, satisfied with the posting, and checked the time. Just past 6am. Time for sleep. He turned off the computer, and went to his futon. \"When I get sponsorship, the first thing I'm gonna get is a real bed,\" he grumbled to himself, and went to sleep. His last thought before drifting off made him smile. When he woke up, he'd surely have a new sidekick!\n\n((Hello, fellow role players. I'm looking for someone to play a low-leveled hero. Think *Kick Ass*, or *Mystery Men*. Batmen or Supermen need not apply.\n\nPlease be alright with adult themes. There'll be violence mixed in with the comedy, and who doesn't like a good sex scene after fighting crime! Also, it doesn't matter if you're a male or female, nor does it matter with your character. Though I'd prefer a gal, I'm good with the guys, too. I'm pretty open about a lot of things.\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to contact me.))",

            "selftext": "The title says it all really. I'm driven largely on adventure-driven stories revolved around a singular character that acts as the proto-protagonist as they muck about in another person's Medieval Fantasy world whose story encompasses violence, exploration of the unique cultures, races, nations, forgotten places left in mountains and holes in the ground, as well as discovering new monsters, magics, etc. In a way, I sort of enjoy being able to describe it as a universe similar to the Witcher. A bitter, unpleasant world that's coming to a new age as fantasy and the harshness of reality bleed together to create a profoundly dark world that drafts real concepts from reality like economics, geopolitics, causes for conflicts amongst rulers where they use casus belis to flimsily give themselves cause to push for their real ambitions...so on and so on. If it's a world that can manage to make me uncomfortable, then you're probably doing something right with it.\n\nI don't care about the gender of my partner or any other circumstances related to them. It's not my business unless you care to make it; that being said, I've been at this long enough that if you're someone who self-describes themselves as a 'detailed writer,' then ninety-percent of the time ti doesn't actually mean anything. If you know how to structure a paragraph and can convey the feelings you want to get across, then that's more than enough for me. I'll provide a writing sample further down. Obligation has me say that I have no trouble with smut whatsoever, though the character I had in mind was a female with a favortism shown towards the same sex, which may very well come into conflict with the societal norms of the world, or be something entirely ignored. Either works for me, and, indeed, having sexuality be a point of tension can be quite fun if designed and plotted out well.\n\nI use Discord, Skype, as well as GMail/GDocs; message me for contact details for that.\n\nThanks to Kevin for giving the chance for this piece.\n\n&gt; His attire was the usual of his imperious self, a simple pair of pressed trousers above polished leather boots. Over his shoulders was draped a collared shirt, and a light leather jacket above it; an odd choice in the hellish waste which was the Prestor's hold. Still, the man wasn't even sweating as he stepped forward, his limp obvious, while his hazel eyes gazed down at the girl with a thousand emotions flowing through, making a single indiscernible amalgamation. Her gaze met his, and she felt just as many, the strangest among them, among the fear, the anger, the respect, was the love. Not of a woman to her man, but of a daughter to her father. The man, for his part, did not look older than thirty, making it rather strange in the looks, but she had spent centuries with him... And while she felt nothing so strong as for the princess of her dreams, it was still enough to stop her strangling him until he inevitably forced her away. Instead, she just keeps a grim, determined look, causing him to sigh, and set the cane against the table, before pulling the chair on his side out, to sit down, with some struggle, due to the weak leg.\n\n&gt; When he has situated himself in the chair, Saria's eyes following him coldly as he does, he pulls it in, resting his arms on the table as the weak leg splays out for better comfort, before his eyes finally rest on her once more. The man seems unwilling, or at least unable, to say anything, wordlessly watching her in a mutual contest of whom could maintain poise longer. And Saria wasn't willing to play, yawning fakely to break the manufactured tension in the room, before leaning forward in turn; keeping her back straight and hands held perfectly, as she finally says, her first words since she'd talked to Raven's graving into the bedside, \u201cWell. You look good. Is that a new hair style you have?\u201d Daas, despite having not cut his hair in weeks, instinctively put a hand on his head to see what she was talking about, before casting an annoyed gaze at her and sighing. \u201cCan you take nothing seriously?\u201d He asks that, after a moment, his tone matching the gaze as his hand returns to the table, which causes her to shrug her shoulders, indifferent.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhen it's worth taking seriously, yes. But unfortunately for you, you aren't worth taking seriously.\u201d His gaze hardens again, his jaw set in a manner to indicate her words had bitten as harshly at she'd expected. There was a primal pleasure in tearing down those you hated; at least to her, and there was no one she hated more. Part of her disliked that pleasure she received, but she didn't care to listen to that; not here, not now. Her mental tangent is broken by Daas' words causing her to jolt; breaking her from the trance she'd already fallen into. \u201cSaria. Are you ever going to stop acting like a child, or am I going to have to treat you like one?\u201d Her gaze casts over him for a moment, coming up with a response which he immediately understands will be sarcastic, causing him to just cradle his head in a hand as she replies with, \u201cWell, I don't know. Children don't have to think, and they get to (Whoops, censored!) until they're nice and happy. Being treated like a child sounds like a dream.\u201d\n\n&gt; Daas' eyes glare her down, indicating she had gone a step too far in the wrong direction. She felt no remorse for the man's annoyance, however, shaking her head as she cuts in, before the man has a chance to criticize, \u201cYou're the one who forced me into this god-forsaken tower. Don't you fucking dare tell me to treat you with dignity or respect; you traded yours a long time ago.\u201d Rather than further annoyance, Daas' expression turns to that of a bemused smile, somewhat forced, as he chose to simply come to her side of thought, for now, if only to warm her up for the questions he had planned. \u201cYou did, too, you know. So I suppose that makes two of us, just pigs, rolling in the mud.\u201d Saria's eyes glance at the man, finding some anger at what he'd said, at the mention of her having given in her dignity. \u201cI didn't really have a choice in the matter,\u201d her tone is far more pressed, now, and her eyes slant. \u201cYou took my dignity... Though, if we're pigs, then I suppose that one of us is magical and the other's a murderer. Sounds like an excellent story for the ages. Maybe one of these days you can say that story to the next woman you kidnap and hold here.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI'll keep that in mind,\u201d He says, softly, before leaning forward, thinking on her remark on dignity. \u201cBut you say that as if you didn't enjoy it. You enjoyed every moment, every kill, every hunt. The difference between you and I is that I don't enjoy my atrocities; and you do, Saria.\u201d The man has barely finished speaking before Saria's chair is thrown into the wall behind her, chipping away the stones behind her as she stands, glaring down at Daas, who shows no chance in composure as he watches her staring down at him with barely-contained fury from his words. \u201cYou...\u201d She says, voice shaking in the same manner as her quivering arms, \u201cYou...\u201d Nothing more came. It was true; what he said, at least about her. But the fact he'd said it, and the way he'd done it, made her want to burn the man down. But she didn't. And slowly, his arm raised, as she saw the familiar deathly black energy running along it, powered from it, as he gestures to the thrown chair. \u201cPick it up,\u201d he says, calmly, \u201cAnd sit down.\u201d",

            "selftext": "After world war three and the accompanying reparations and rebuilding of all involved parties home turfs, they came together to decide that war was no longer an option anywhere. With the invention of nuclear warfare, it was too big of a risk to take, for any reasons. The world leaders (of both nations and all major corporations) came together to decide how this new rule would be handled.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld war one (and two) and the American-Syrian of 2025, when left alone other countries clearly couldn't follow the previous 'rules\u2019 they had tried to set before. They needed a new approach. When push to came to shove, honor codes were nothing but a few fancy words and a promise. \n\n\n\n\nAnd at that meeting of all the big shots of the modern world, then dubbed \u2019Hopes Nursery.\u2019 it was decided that only the extreme could be done to stop extremes. On top of every country's individual government, there was now a government even above federal.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meeting has a second name. One that everyone knows it by now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHopes Funeral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes were subtle. And all these changes were in the name of one word that nobody could argue with.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Certain concepts were deemed unpeaceful, and that was\u2026 reasonable. Then certain books and writings, and who cared? They weren't any books we cared about. We were all busy looking down at our phones, playing the newest games pushed out by the conglomerates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen it was clothes, and people tried to start calling attention it all, but we were all busy with our lives. So unless you were related to those 'Peace-Defectors\u2019 you didn't notice if they went missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen people were deemed unpeaceful. By then it was too late. The world had fallen too far, all in the name of peace.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am one of the newest generation, born into this world of Peace. No wars in over 500 years, and the human race has been making scientific breakthrough after scientific breakthrough since. There is no longer single countries, instead one giant nation. It's purpose? Peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever. There is a new war brewing. An inevitable war. The final war. One that was destined to be as soon as the 'Hopes Nursery Summit\u2019 held its first meeting.\n\n\n\nDo you know what they'll call this one? It has many names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe death of all Peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final resting place of Hope.\n\n\n\n\nThe Birth of Despair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know my *personal* favorite name for it?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe End of the World.\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\nPlease message me! Let's talk. Also, have Skype!\n",

I have a few ideas, however I\u2019m open to suggestions and I\u2019m open to new ideas on a romance roleplay. Im also open to slice of life. I would be happy to incorporate your ideas and build open my own, as they are vague. \n\n1. We set up a first date and meet, we have a very memorable first date and we decide to continue and our relationship carries on \n\n2. We are married (doesn\u2019t matter how many years) and decided we want to start a family and are trying for a child and we go through and raise the child, and decide if we want more\n\n3. It\u2019s days before we are due to be married\n\n4. We are long time friends and are now house sharing, and you come back home straight after a breakup, I comfort you and we develop feelings and start a relationship \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m free to roleplay on Kik and discord, so just PM me with your preferred platform and I\u2019ll be sure to get back!\n\n\n",

I highly recommend seeing if it piques your interest!*\n\nFor as long as Conludia's 8 kingdoms have stood, the tradition of Guardianship has continued. As a powered human, devoting your life in service to your liege was considered the ultimate honour - or at least, that was tradition.\n\nNowadays, perceptions can vary from contempt to fear. It is no longer customary for every royal to appoint Guardians upon ascending the throne. That is, until a series of suspect Guardian disappearances was recently uncovered. In the wake of this revelation, that something could be taking out some of the most powerful individuals known to man, each kingdom has rushed to appoint more Guardians to allay their panic. \n\nBut will these new Guardians be any more successful than their predecessors? And what of the courts, who stop their plotting for no one?\n\n###HIGHLIGHTS\n* **Leave a legacy**: Brand new roleplay means that you get to shape the world and direction of the plot!\n* **Flexible &amp; Inclusive**: Play however you like. Want dice rolls? Only enjoy small threads? All (rule-abiding) styles are welcome, and the mod team would love to help facilitate your particular style.\n* **Literate roleplayers**: However, the RP is semi-literate, based off quality standards not word minimums\n* **Beginner-friendly**: As Admin, I want to make it simple for anyone to join and have fun! There are [clear guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/royalguardianrp/wiki/beginners_guide) and you can take as long or as little as you like when it comes to character creation or plotting. Want to jump right in? Both pre-made and original characters are available! Check out [our wanted characters here](https://www.reddit.com/r/royalguardianrp/wiki/wanted)\n\n###MORE INFO\n* Not an 18+ roleplay; mature subject matter (explicit sexual content, detailed gore) must be marked NSFW or taken to PMs\n* Application must be accepted prior to role-playing\n* Private threads and plotting is encouraged to increase intrigue\n* [OOC sub](/r/royalguardianooc) used to help structure the RP, make suggestions\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/ap57AqY) for quickplay and to shoot the breeze\n* **[Looking for staff!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyalGuardianOOC/comments/8lpjh3/helping_hands_wanted_staff_search/)**\n\nSince we have newly revived the roleplay, now is the perfect time to jump into /r/RoyalGuardianRP and make your mark on both Conludia and its meta!\n\n&gt; ##go forth and become legend.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! Here I am back again, sadly a lot of roleplays fell through so I'm still looking! \n\nA little bit about me: I go by my nickname Hime. I\u2019m 23 years old and have been roleplaying for 12 years now. I\u2019m part of the LGBTQ+ community and will try to incorporate that in all my works. I work as psychologist while studying to become psychiatrist. This means that I do spend a lot of time out and about. And roleplaying is used as an outlet to let me relax. I am able to reply several times per day and prefer Discord first and Google Docs second.\n\nI am looking for a partner who can write a bit of text. Single lines turn me off from writing but you don\u2019t have to be an amazingly detailed writer either. English is far from my first Language so I can\u2019t ask you to do something I am barely capable of doing myself. I prefer writing in 3RD person but I can first as well. In terms of Romance I don\u2019t like shipping hetero ships and am incapable of roleplaying male characters, everything else goes. LGBTQ+ is a must for romantic plot lines.\n\n[Note NSFW will not be done unless partner is 18+ NSFW also includes things like gore, severe abuse, traumas and so on, not just smut.]\n\nGenres I like are: - Fantasy (High, Low, Dark) - Isekai - Sci-Fi (Steampunk or Futuristic) - Romance (LGBTQ+ only)\n- Slice of Life (From Office to High school) - Apocalypse/Posts-Apocalypse - Horror - Mystery\n\nI have plots in mind for all of them but I\u2019m always willing to do something new or different and I\u2019d like to bounce idea\u2019s back and forth before settling into anything. Humor/Angst/Adventure are almost always part of these genres.\n\nFandoms: - Fallout - The Elder Scrolls - Kingdom Hearts - League of Legends - Mass Effect - Dragon Age - Call of Duty - Halo - BlazBlue - Persona - Fortnite: Save the world - Bioshock - Fire Emblem - Dark Souls - BloodBorne - Blue Reflection - Monster Hunter - And too many anime to name\u2026\n\nI do roleplay a few canon characters for these fandoms but mostly prefer OC content, though I can be persuaded if you\u2019re really interested.\n\nThanks for reading and if you\u2019re interested in anything or have this super cool OC you wanna bounce past me, just send me a PM! I always enjoy hearing people their thoughts and creative processes. Hope we can get along!\n",

Well then, I think I have a place just for you fellow adventurer. Tale of Hope &amp; War, a place where you can make your own story. Hello! my name is Xeno, co-founder and developer of a dice-based roleplay called Tale of Hope &amp; War. Tale of Hope &amp; War is a roleplay set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world, where only a few cities have survived and mobilized the cities themselves. We offer a unique system that consists of traits, skilltrees and items with unique abilities. Lore-wise the world of Tale of Hope &amp; War is riddled with corruption from the gods, who have tried to invade the corporeal plane to obtain artifacts left behind by the elder gods, objects of immense power. Sadly these artifacts are also what keeps the world alive. So in order to survive mankind and other species have to become strong, strong enough to fend off the avatars of gods and perhaps the very gods themselves. For a god stepping into the corporeal plane is the cause of cataclysm. If you wish to join us please feel free to take a look, we're always happy for new players to join! Come on down and join us as we tell you a Tale of Hope &amp; War! https://discord.gg/uUx6Q7Y",

This same concept would apply for the other fandoms as I think building our own story with OCs is more fun.\n\nSo if this is something that appeals to you just send me a message and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as.

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nThanks for stopping by to check out my new ad, I really appreciate it! I\u2019m going to try my best and not make this as long as my previous ads, but no promises! I\u2019ll be providing as much detailed information about my availability, my RP style, and what I\u2019m looking for in both RP and a potential partner below. If you have any questions, please feel free to send me a private message and I\u2019ll respond as quickly as my schedule allows.\n\nPersonal Info &amp; Availability:\n\nA little about me, I\u2019m in my early 20\u2019s, a full-time student, and am currently living in the PST. I have about 2-3 years of RP experience and I\u2019m still learning a lot! I do my best to use spell check and read over my posts, but I am human and do make mistakes. I do have many other hobbies and activities that I participate in, so please do take that into consideration.\n\nSchool is officially over for me until late August! I am however in the process of interviewing for internships and summer jobs, so at some point I will be working part-time. For now, my schedule is pretty wide open, when it changes I will be happy to provide my new availability to any potential/future partners. I tend to favor late mornings and evenings for RP, brainstorming, or just chatting. If I am free, I can usually make at least two posts a day, possibly more depending on what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m looking for a partner that can post a minimum of once a day.\n\nMy RP style:\n\nFormat &amp; Post Length: I prefer to RP in the third person format, posting anywhere between two to four detailed paragraphs depending on the situation. If you can match that awesome, if not, that\u2019s fine too. If your posts are quality and are contributing towards the growth and development of the story and characters, I\u2019m happy!\n\nCharacter &amp; Pairing Preference: For this ad I will be looking to create and play with original characters only. Please understand that this process, at least for me, takes at least a day or two as I tend to put a lot of time and energy into my characters. I also like to spend at least my first meeting or interaction with a potential partner chatting about the RP and just generally making sure we\u2019re on the same page. As for pairings, I am currently looking for FxF only. I do not care what your RL gender is, only that you play a female original character.\n\nRP Themes:\n\nMain Plot: What I\u2019m looking for is a spicier take on a slice of life RP. It would focus on two young women falling for each other rather fast. However, before things get too intimate it is revealed to my character that the other woman is in an open relationship. My character would have no experience in open relationships and may even be unfamiliar with the same sex at this point in her life.\n\nRomance: This would obviously be the major theme of the RP. Having fallen hard for one another, each woman feels very strongly about their views and values regarding relationships and try to get one another to see things from their point of view. I would like there to be NSFW elements intertwined with the romance, however I would like this ad to remain SFW. So, any questions or discussion about those elements can be discussed in private.\n\nDrama: I feel as if drama is a key ingredient to having a well-rounded romantic RP. Things can\u2019t always be perfect, that would be no fun! For starters, the mixture of the excitement, inexperience, and possibly conflicting relationship views and values makes for a wonderful setup for a romantic, yet dramatic story in my eyes. Though this usually requires some planning between partners, and some people like to just play things by ear.\n\nMultiple Characters: I\u2019m not necessarily sure if this would be classified as a theme of RP or not, but I would eventually like to see the addition of other major characters to the RP. I have no problem playing more than one character at time, or even in the same post. This can be discussed further in private messages, but the obvious candidate for consideration here is the other woman in the open relationship.\n\nSettings:\n\nCollege: This is the first setting that comes to mind for me. College is a fun, yet often stressful environment which I feel can add a lot of interesting elements to the RP. Despite their differing views on romance and relationships, maybe these two young women share some similar interest, or even a major? I am somewhat new to slice of life RP but this option definitely seems like a fun one!\n\nOffice/Workplace: Thinking on this plot a bit more, I thought it might be fun to play out an office or workplace romance! I personally have formed wonderful friendships in the workplace and think it can also be the start of something more if the chemistry is right. There are a lot of possibilities here that can be explored, and I would love to sit down and discuss some with potential partners. Just a friendly heads up though, this setting would be new territory for me, but I\u2019m definitely up for giving it a try!\n\nOthers: I have a few other ideas floating around, however an RP based in a college setting by far my favorite. If you happen to have another setting you\u2019d prefer or would like to discuss, I\u2019m all ears!\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\nOk, almost done, I promise! I think the most important thing to me in a potential partner is the ability and willingness to communicate. I\u2019m not talking about OOC chit chat, but being able to openly talk about ideas, stories, and characters in a creative and constructive way. This is a collaboration after all, I value my partner\u2019s thoughts and inputs into the story that we are creating together, so please if you\u2019re looking for one person alone to take the reins, please look elsewhere. Lastly, I need someone that is understanding of the pressures of life, and that I may not be available all the time to post or play. We all have our own stuff going on, and I do my best to be understanding and patient with partners and hope they will do the same for me.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOk.. soo.. that was kinda long, but you made it to the end! Thanks so much for sticking it through, I really appreciate it! I know that this ad is probably a huge longshot as the preface is pretty specific, but I\u2019m hoping to find at least one person out there as excited as I am to try this out! If you happened to be interested, please don\u2019t hesitate to send me a message. I hope you all have a wonderful day!\n\n",

He wasn\u2019t looking for a girl that night unless someone really special walked in. He was tall and muscular. Wearing a bartenders uniform. It was black slacks with a white shirt tucked in. His was a band collar shirt that hugged his neck in a way that made him look good enough to eat. He wore a black bow tie and a green vest that showed he was a bartender.   \nHe\u2019d wipe down the bar as someone stumbled away drunk. He sighed as he checked his watch. He had about 15 minutes till his hour brake.\n\nAndreas wasn\u2019t like the ritzy and expensive people he served. He was poor, quite poor in fact. He survived by odd jobs and being furgle. He only had the fancy clothes because he inherited them from his brother and the green vest he was given at the start of the night. He was an amazingly kind and gentle man for his obvious strength. He had washed up here in Korea a handful of years ago. He hasn\u2019t been able to leave for various reasons.   \n\nThe sexy male would fix his collar as he waited around. A lot of girls were looking at him, and some boys. The left side of his head was shaved, his white hair was a little long and combed over. He had amazing orange eyes.\n\n Anyone here read I Love Yoo on Webtoons? If so want to do a RP of  \nIt? You playing Yoo and me an OC.  \n\nReddit only please, open a chat or message me if you're interested. \n\nSemi\\-Lit to Lit\n\nI'm working most of the day so please understand I can't snap out responses all the time. \n\nI was thinking that we would share the load of playing the brothers and their friends and family when they are in the same scene as our characters. \n\nThemes include: Some smut but not all the time, darker themes, fluff, romance, slice of life, drama, action. \n\nI was thinking we set this at the end of chapter 53 or on the last chapter posted. Will start during the party. I also have a optional starter if you can't think of one.\n\nHope you're interested, thank you!\n\n\\-CivilDefenseWarden",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs\n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

I'm a huge Imperium fan and really love the 'low fantasy' settings that surround the hive cities, imperial ships, trenches and the likes.\n\nWhile I'm happy to play out most aspects of the 40k universe, I've always prefered seeing the setting through the eyes of a lowly guardsman or overworked Arbites officer, rather than some superhuman chaos entity or all knowing all seeing Eldar.\n\nI won't ramble about a particular setting for RP here, though if your interested in this side of the 40k universe then please feel free to drop me a message and we can work something out.\n\nAs for me. I'm in the UK but honestly, I'm awake at all sorts of times. I have a good few years of RP experience on various platforms and look for quality over quantity. If the RP's flowing quite quickly, a few lines beats paragraphs of aimless rambling.\n\nIf by some miracle this gets the interest of a few people, I'm more than happy to play with the idea of creating a small bit of group RP as well, something on the lines of a small squad or unit with a particular goal in mind.\n\nSo, thats that!

We run what is basically a science fantasy slice of life adventure group. Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe world is alive with tons of lore and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso we just these past few days moved to discord so if things seem slow or unorganized, the move is to blame. ",

            "selftext": "// Based on Ghost Recon: Wildlands. Y/C can be a rebel, a soldier or a doctor. \n\nWanderer was his code name, he was a lone SOCOM operative in Bolivia. His task was to gather intel and to disrupt the operations of the Santa Blanca cartel. And hopefully capture El Sue\u00f1o, the horrific leader of the cartel who has claimed all of Bolivia under their rule. The Bolivian military, Unidad, has an uneasy peace with Santa Blanca. The cartel paying them off to ignore their crimes. \n\nWayfarer was a \u201cGhost.\u201d He was part of the elite USSCOM. A highly trained and effective killer. But, because of the many layers of security, no one knew the agents' real name. He was a tall, muscular man. He had brown hair that was shaved on one side, showing a recent scar he got from a knife fight. He shaved to be able to stitch the wound. Because of this, his handler, Bowman. Requested he gets a teammate. That teammate is Y/C.\n\nBowman\u2019s voice came over the radio of Y/C\u2019s helicopter.  \u201cYou\u2019re meeting a man we call Wayfarer. He\u2019s an ice-cold son-of-a-bitch, and he won\u2019t take to warm to you till you two start to really work together. He\u2019s wearing a Multicam uniform with a green brimmed hat. He has a revolver strapped to his chest and an MK14 on his back. Oh, and the razor slash on the side of his head. Can\u2019t miss him. Connect with him by his hideout in Villa Verde, he might meet up with you before then. Good luck, I\u2019ll radio when you two meet.\u201d She said. The helicopter descended and landed in the upper part of Villa Verde, if the maps are correct, Wayfarer ought to be hiding near the southern part of the providence. \n\n// So, based heavily on Ghost Recon Wildlands. If you don\u2019t know the story I can give you a condensed version but you could easily find a video on YouTube. So, very tactical and military based RP. But with Smut, fluff and stuff like that. Long-term! Lots of details and such. Really hope you join! BxG only! Will be on Reddit only, send me a message if you like this!\n",

Character A (mine) and Character B (yours) are going to college in the same university - either getting the same or different degrees. They meet in class/at a party/ where one of them is working to pay for classes, or wherever else, and hit it off right away. Things would be perfect if it wasn't for a tiny detail: A's dad is a criminal, and B's dad is a police officer - who is currently investigating A's dad. Of course, they don't know that at first, and A may not even know her dad is a big time criminal (she's probably been sheltered from all of this). They will eventually figure it out, but once only they're already involved. I'm writing a female as a character. Yours can be either gender, your choice. \n\nNow, here's the catch: I write through e-mail (yes, only), and post once a day or every other day, so I'm not the best person out there for the more impatient ones of the bunch. My job keeps me very busy during the day, so I'm not online on any messengers while I'm at work, which's why e-mails are the best way for me to roleplay. Sorry if that's a deal breaker.\n\nAnd thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "**About me and what I'm looking for:** \n\n- I'm in college so posting won't be rapid. I will try to give my partner at least one to three posts a week but again, I'm in my 20s so it's tough to really nail down exact posting habits. What it boils down to is that I don't want someone to demand I post, but to be patient and understanding that life comes first. In the same regard, I won't nag someone to post unless it's been over a week.\n\n- I give about three to five paragraphs. Generally my posts stick to the 500-1000 words range but I can give more or less, it just depends. I'm looking for someone who enjoys a lengthy post (and doesn't mind waiting). \n\n- I want us to use canon characters. In some special circumstances, I'll deal with canons but it's a very rare occurrence and does require us to both double as a canon and an OC and to make sure we're not overly favorable towards just our OC. That's not fair.\n\n- I stick to third person, past tense. It's important for me to distinguish myself from who I write as and I hope my partner can respect that and not confuse the two.\n\n- I will say Reddit is my first choice, followed by Discord, followed by Google Docs and lastly, email. I do not use kik or skype. \n\n- It's important we keep in touch to plot and stay on the same page. My partner should be happy and eager to post and that means voicing what we both want to happen. I love chatting with my partners. I also like knowing if any delay is gonna happen, if you need to wait a couple weeks, that's cool. I'm a patient person. I try to stay chill but please try not to keep me on the hook for too long. Generally speaking if we need a break, I'm fine as long as I'm not kept in the dark about it.\n\n- Mature content is okay with me but I don't like it creeping into the RP frequently. My focus is on storytelling, not ripping off one another's clothes or seeing who can create the music epic combat scenes. Also any characters who might be under 18 will be aged up to be 18 for romantic plots. I'd also love it if partners were also over 18 for more obvious, legal reasons.\n\n- Lastly the general tone of my RPs tend to be light and focused on slice of life stuff. I don't need tons of action or dramatics happening all the time because it's just going to drain my motivation to post. To me writing is about escape and life is too dramatic to have it being written about as well.\n\n**Fandoms:** Okay so below are a collection of canons I can play and ones I am seeking for someone to play for me. I am open for doubling and sharing roles. Please PM me to talk about plot and pairs. Before we move to another platform, I do want to talk via Reddit PM so I know we're on the same page. I'm also open to other fandoms and maybe even crossovers.

I'm the owner of a newly created One Piece Roleplay which is in need of descriptive, creative roleplayers that can be active and supportive of the roleplay's success. The roleplay has a wiki page which is located inside the discord server, consisting of: character sheets, systematic inquiries, and pages revolving around various island lores\u2014just to name a few of many things available there.\n\nThe roleplay consists of various systems, which helps the roleplay flow consistently without much question in \"why something is happening\", or \"why we handled something a certain way\". This is to keep everything answerable and for arguments on the topic to cease by simply referencing the material provided.\n\nThis One Piece Roleplay is open-world, but has plenty of interactions and events. Events are always plot-based, whether it be individual plot\u2014that you can provide\u2014or universal plot that has been established.\n\n\nWe are looking for experienced roleplayers that can work as moderators and help develop the plot through their intended effort. This is our main concern currently, but if you'd like to join just for the ride, that is fine too.\n\nIf you're interested in joining this new establishment, please refer to this discord link provided below:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/5CKXMV4",

The night hunt is over, the beast have thinned, now the city must breathe once more.\n\nNow, sign here with your blood and try not to lose yourself to the beast.

I'm looking to do a RP base on this but in a setting after the hunt is over but within the same city of Yarnham. This RP will be vastly different from any rp on here as I expect our characters to die... a lot throughout their journey. That said, no character will be over power from the start and said power will be increase as we venture further and further into the daydream of the city.\n\nIf you have any question about the world, lore or RP feel free to ask and I will answer the best I can.

            "selftext": "About Me: I'm well over 21+, bordering on thirty at this point. I'm located in the central standard timezone. I've been roleplaying for well over fourteen years, writing is my favorite free hobby. I'm pretty chatty, so it's easiest if anyone just jumps into talking to me like we've been friends for a decade.\u00a0\n\nStyle: I\u00a0usually write in third person, past tense format, but I can adapt to present tense. I'd rather not, though. I usually try to shell out 2-8 paragraphs, all depending on what's going on in the roleplay, of course. I would appreciate it if I had a partner that would try to match that. I try to stay simple and enjoyable as far as vocabulary goes, if you're looking for someone to purple prose with, keep looking.\n\nTime:\u00a0 I'm never in a huge hurry, if you can reply to me once or twice a week I'll be pretty happy. I also enjoy if we're both free and up for it a few posts a night, either is fine.\u00a0\n\nAvailability:\u00a0I work pretty basic hours, Monday through Friday and I never get off later than six pm central standard. I'm mostly on during the evening, but I drop in on mobile through the day.\u00a0\n\nPreferences:\u00a0Seeing as how I'm older than a lot of people on here, I do usually like writing with someone that's at least 21+. I enjoy writing through email, docs or on discord.\u00a0 I prefer to write canon characters, but I don't mind creating an OC, or even writing canon against an OC. I also don't mind crossovers and often find them enjoyable af.\u00a0\n\nOriginal: When it comes to original content I'm most interested in fantasy, history or mythology (think American gods). Scifi, I do love a good space adventure. I also enjoy history based things, primarily around WWII or Vietnam war. I have a ton of ideas for these ideas as well so if you're interested just let me know.\n\nFandoms/Characters\n\nMarvel\u00a0\nEveryone's in a marvel mood, I'm digging it. I'm someone who's familiar with the comics and is up to date on MCU.

I am looking for someone to play Artemis Fowl or Holly short.\n\nAnyway I have afew rules I would like to go over before I say the plot.\n\n1: Be literate. I will not deal with people using text talk for the Role Play.\n2: Be able to play multiple characters. I\u2019m not a dungeon master, I won\u2019t play everyone. But I don\u2019t expect you to be one either as I will Play other characters aswell.\n3: Don\u2019t Play my character. This is a huge one for me, you will get one warning.\n4: Don\u2019t be a dick. This goes without saying but still.\n\nAnyway my idea for the Role Play is my character would be a human who comes to Artemis Fowl looking for help to capture Opal coboy. This will take place between the last guardian and the Atlantis complex. I hope you have read the books, as it will be helpful for understanding the story. Anyway, Pm me for either my discord or my Kik. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Where did it all go wrong? Was it the mistake of trusting the vampires as they started surfacing and living with the humans? At first they were peaceful with a few incidents here and there that would have been a cause for concern. They had evolved to be able to withstand sun light which made it easier for them to live amongst humans and lead relatively normal lives and they would buy blood from slaughter houses and blood banks which sold blood that was about to expire. Or was it when the humans tried to fight back as they tried to peacefully take control, instead we aggressively denied them control and quickly learned that there were many young uncivilized just waiting for the command to flood the surface and barbarically ransack towns and cities draining all of the blood that they could. For the most part the human race was decimated, those that surrendered or were captured were herded and bred like cattle in blood factories as they supplied the new world full of vampires fresh food. The top 10% of vampires even had their own personal humans to feed off of getting the freshest and purest blood that they could.\n\nI was one of the lucky ones at first, I fled the cities and stayed in small towns that were virtually ignored after the lesser and younger ones were released, the vast majority of them dying off the next day in the sunlight. It wasn't a bad life, just lonely. They left most of the stores alone, full of supplies which made it easy to hide and live in. Months after the initial invasion I was still on my own, living a comfortable, but lonely life. I didn't mind though, aside from a few encounters with the lesser kind still lurking in buildings I was safe, or so I thought. I had grown comfortable and lazy. Ignoring any danger signs and lazily sleeping on the open floor in any given building. I hadn't realized how close I was to a nearby manor owned by a wealthy and powerful vampiress that had been crowned the archduke of Washington. Despite the modern times the vampires still relied on a medieval hierarchy based on age and contribution to the race, these titles were also passed down through their blood lines much like the medieval eras royalty. I couldn't blame anyone but myself for getting caught. I heard the convoy of vehicles pass by multiple times and still decided to sleep not waking up to the slamming of car doors or footsteps as they investigated the only building with lights on and signs of it being a dwelling. \n\nI woke up to violent sets of hand restraining me as I was roughly dragged out of the store cuffed and gagged before being tossed in the trunk of a car. The next days and nights were a blur of medical tests and evaluations. My blood was drawn twice, I didn't make it easy though with all of my thrashing I had been strapped down on a gurney for the duration of the testing. I finally was given a slight reprieve from the barrage of tests when I was tossed into a room and chained to\u00a0 the wall with a heavy metal collar and chain. I had just enough slack to sit at the small table that had various foods and water decorating its surface. Despite the violent and barbaric way they had seized power they were by no means heathens and royalty only got the best of blood, disease free as well as type O-. Something that was highly sought after as the purest and best tasting. I don't know how long I sat in the windowless room before I heard the clacking of heels walking closer to the door and the heavy deadbolt thud back into the door before the handle turned and the door began to open with a creak...\n",

I just don\u2019t expect to write in cheating and things like that because I want our couple to be \u2018It\u2019 for each other and for them to be the fun part to whatever is happening around them whether it\u2019s apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, something historical or whatever. I do want adult themes so I ask that you be 18 and over like myself. Please feel free to talk to me about our RP and whatever is on your mind or happening in your day, if you want to. The better our relationship, the better our RP, I believe.\n\nPlease have free time available if you reply to my post. I need someone who will be into our story and able to reply daily, the more replies in a day, the better. Lol I\u2019d like us to both be excited. If you like doing playlists and other things for our characters, that\u2019s great too. I\u2019ve done this with one of my RPs. I RP in 3rd POV along with dialogue as needed. I love details, as much as you want to give.\n\nI like to use real life face claims. If you prefer not to, then we can do descriptions. I would like to discuss plot, settings and preferences privately.\nSummary:\nGenre: Romance, Slice of Life, Apocalyptic, Post-Apocalyptic, Historical, etc.\nPairings: F/F (For years, I\u2019ve done M/F, now am bored of it)\nFrequency of responses: Rapid Fire, Multiple a day; Once a day (Once we start if something comes up and you need to slow down for a while, just communicate please)\n",

Think Elves, Orcs, trolls, etc, but in a Dues ex, or blade runner world. \n\nThe story would revolve around a main plot but little adventures would occur during this. There is an ultimate evil of course, but I would prefer to discuss that in PM or Discord about what that is. \n\nIf this sounds like something you would like to take part in, send me a PM and we can go from there, thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nYou can call me Alex and I\u2019m 26 and looking for a role play partner. I have been writing and role playing on and off since a little site called Neopets. Yeah, crazy! Anyway I have a full time job/life so I will be straight forward that I will not be on 24/7 like back in the good old days, but what I will provided will be at least a post that is detailed and moving the story forward. I\u2019m not looking for a novel, but I am looking for details and matching each other\u2019s post(within reason). I don\u2019t care if your grammar isn\u2019t spot on or if you spell a word wrong, as long as I get where you are going I am a happy camper. I typically write anywhere from 3-5 paragraphs per post.\n\nI love gore, sex and drugs when it is called for, don\u2019t randomly have your character go \u201cAlien\u201d with a alien popping out of his chest when you are supposed to be Spanish pirates. \n\nOnly things I ask is that my partner helps to push the plot forward and that they are older than 18+. The later I have no way of enforcing and have broken that rule so often before, but it makes me sleep better at night. \n\nWait, another \u201crule\u201d my partner has to be able to play more than one person. The world doesn\u2019t have just two people in it. I am completely fine with two main characters, but there needs to be supporting cast and crew. I find it sad that this has to be addressed so often.\n\nNow the good stuff. What do I will to role play. \n\n-Anything historical, anytime period any culture, I am your girl. I have several plots for these as well. (This is what I honestly want to role play) Mafia, Roman/Greek, Tudor, Victorian, Shogun. \n\n\n-Fantasy and sci-fi: would love to do an adventure plot or high stakes mystery. Very open to creating a world with some one\n\n-Not a fan of fandoms, but I would be open to doing OC in the world of the fandom. \n\nI will play any gender, I might have a peference once we have come up with ideas but I can do anything. I prefer f/m or f/f but would be open to m/m(never have done it, but can).\n\nPM me for my email or for discord info, I will do either, but prefer email. Thanks for stopping by!\n",

I can also use Hangouts, Discord, or Email. I can use PM, but it is honestly my least favorite way to role play. I don\u2019t expect anyone to write novels, but I would appreciate more than a few words. On occasion it is fine, but not consistently. I also ask that you have proper grammar.

Now imagine for once that society managed to advance past the dark ages for once. Paradigm is that world, with opportunity to be whatever you want you are free to carve your own story with the inhabitants of paradigm. Do you want to be the Orcish space pirate, knocking down merchant ships in the depths of space? Go right ahead! What about an elvish aristocrat heading a successful business? Go for it! Or maybe you are a magic using soldier for one of the 4 major factions in the world. Nothing is stopping you!\n\nOn the topic of the four factions, why don't I tell you about them so you can get a bit more of a feel for the world.\n\n**The Republic Of Icarus**\n\nThe republic of Icarus is a lavish aristocratic faction striving to do nothing but accrue wealth and power in their quest to take over the galaxy. With the strongest economy of any factions and one of the most advanced militaries to ever be deployed they have always been a force to be reckoned with. Planet by planet they appropriate the galaxy for their own, conquering in the name of advancing Icarus. \n\n**The War Clans Of Ka'Esk**\n\nA miracle of sociological science with beyond a billion to one chance has led to the embodiment of civil war being the next largest faction, even rivalling that of the republic of icarus. Named after the home planet of the clans 'Ka'esk' the faction is comprised of 4 clans that all hold the same planets as eachother. Every single planet owned by the clans has one stark similarity however, no matter where you go within the faction, all 4 clans are at war. The cunning and sly Fiel clan sneak and steal from the other three. The smart and advanced Drall clan fortify their settlements and lock themselves away in mega cities of scientific development and technological advancement, developing new means to get the edge on their sibling clans. The Wise and nomadic Su'tum are masters of the magical arts, devoting their lives to ritual and study yet only lashing out in an act of war when the situation demands, neither pacifists nor warlords in their ways. And the brash and dangerous Krass clan live in a mad max like hellscape of anarchy and violence, sending war parties charging across the planets to command their territory, numbers over tactics. \n\n**The United Federation**\n\nA conglomerate of planets and solar systems in constant political dispute, all banding together for one reason. The safety from invasion. Every world leader has their own view on how the federation should be run, where the funding should go, what should be done with the military. In a community of such cultural and planetary difference everyone can find their place.\n\n**The Tressen Empire**\n\nThe studious and devoted faction of the Tressen Empire has one goal in their assistance. They are to find the technology of the old world so that they may reverse engineer it for their own use. They must protect the relics of old from the rest of the universe that they deem unworthy. The youngest faction of the four but the most formidable, with few to no military defeats, they pose more and more of a threat by the day. \n\nJoin up now and get ready to explore this wonderful world\n\n[https://discord.gg/VTmgzsF](https://discord.gg/VTmgzsF)\n\nIf you would like to look into the lore of the community we have documentation on the whole universe it takes place in.

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\n\nLooking to play out an idea for a medieval fantasy setting. I have a general draft for the world and will go into more detail if asked. And of course, you're welcome to help with the world building. You are free to design your own OC as you see fit of course. I do plan on this being a long-term thing but with the story having an end-goal. Send me a message of what kind of character you have in mind and if you're interested in the crafting the world. Also, if you have an idea that's somewhat similar to the one I described, run it by me. I'm generally game for anything that's interesting.\n\n\nOnly requirement is that you be 18+ and write in third person.\n\n\n**Writing Style and Length:** I write in the third person and length in average is around three to four paragraphs. Might be more or less depending on the required response. I enjoy writing a mixture of plot-based and character-based adventure roleplays with dialogue heavy banter between the main two characters. I can provide a sample of my old writing if asked for one.\n\n\n**Frequency and Medium:** I am generally good for at least one response per day at the very least. If I have free time, I might respond more. If for any reason, I'm unable to write for a couple of days, I'll let you know beforehand. As for medium, I prefer email but am open to using anything that is not mobile based. As for OOC chat, I use discord but not for the story itself.\n\n\n**Mature themes:** I'm okay with blood, gore and sex but only if it applies to the setting and the plot. If it needs to be forced, then probably not worth it.\n\n\n**Romance**: Added this section in because this comes up a lot. I do enjoy writing romance but not as the main driving force of the story. That gets boring really fast. I like having it as a sub-plot provided it makes sense between the characters. Again, if it needs to be forced into the story, not worth doing it.\n\n\nSo if you feel you're interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you guys soon.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nDevoid",

            "selftext": "Hello all, I'm Cassie, 27 years old! I'm looking for some lady friends to roleplay both fandom-based and original storylines with, namely of the speculative fiction variety, with some romance alongside. \n\nI've been roleplaying for almost a decade, now! That being said, I'm a writer by profession and tend to put a lot of my creative energy into my own projects, so I tend to be a more concise roleplayer. However, I love bouncing ideas and being creative when it comes to the actual storyline!\n\nFor RPs with romance, I would especially like someone to do polyamorous romances with, but this isn't a requirement. If you would like to do a poly RP with me, please note that I do NOT like jealousy and cheating plotlines. I have dealt with or witnessed these things in real life (as I'm poly IRL) and they are not fun for me. Other than that, I'm alright with anything, and open to going into NSFW realms if you are over 18.\n\nI'm also looking for new female friends and would love to get to know you!\n\n**Original Genres**\n\nFor original, I'm pretty content with most things, though I think an adventure or urban fantasy RP would be fun. Mostly, I like original to stretch my writing muscles and keep the inspiration coming for my own writing projects.\n\n* Fantasy/soft or pseudo sci-fi \n* Romance (especially LGBTQ+ and polyamoury)\n* Adventure/epic\n* Post-apocalyptic\n* Slice of life\n* Tragedy\n* Historical\n\n**Fandom**\n\nWhen it comes to fandom RP, I like a nice balance between adventure and romance, and I like to see my ships be together as they go through the challenges of their adventure. I ship quite a lot of polyamoury, OT3s are kind of my thing! I've listed my primary ships beside each entry.\n\n* Akatsuki no Yona/Yona of the Dawn (YonaxHak)\n* Angel Beats! (YuzuruxKanade, YuixHinata)\n* Bungou Stray Dogs (AtsushixKyouka)\n* Death Note (MisaxL)\n* Free! Iwatobi Swim Club (ReixNagisa, HaruxMakoto)\n* Guilty Crown (ShuxInori)\n* Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? (BellxHestia)\n* K Project (ShiroxKuroxNeko)\n* Kuroshitsuji/Black Butler (ElizabethxCiel/SebastianxCiel)\n* Neon Genesis Evangelion (KaworuxShinji, AsukaxRei)\n* Noragami (HiyorixYatoxYukine)\n* Owari no Seraph/Seraph of the End (YuxShinoaxMika)\n* Pandora Hearts (OzxAlicexGil)\n* Persona 3 (MinatoxYukari)\n* Persona 4 (YuxRisexYosuke, NaotoxKanji)\n* Persona 5 (I ship a lot of poly in this so . . . I would need to send you a diagram)\n* Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack on Titan (ArminxEren/ArminxMikasa)\n* Soul Eater (this was my first fandom so honestly, anything goes)\n* Sword Art Online (AsunaxKiritoxSinon)\n* Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle (FaixKurogane, SyaoranxSakura)\n* Voltron: Legendary Defender (LancexKeith, ShiroxAllura)\n* Yuri!!! On Ice (YurixViktor)\n\nIf you're interested, please send me a PM~!",

            "selftext": "Time Zone: GMT-04:00 Eastern Daylight\n\nI am currently looking for a couple new rp partners. I have a couple of rps I am currently involved in but as they are more slow paced I am looking to add to my ranks. I have been rping for ehh I'd say about 10-11 years so I have some experience under my belt. As I have always loved to write I suppose that is why I enjoy rping so much for it is the same but you never know what is to come next for there is another person to account for now. I do work 6 days a week so I understand how life can get in the way of rping so no worries on that part if you are being as active as life allows. Now on to the gritty details!\n\n\n~As stated above I am looking for a rp partner but I am looking for this partnership to be long term. I like long drawn out rps and not short little clips. So please know that I am looking for a rp to span over a good period of time.\n\n\n1: Please, Please! Be 18 or older for I myself am 24 and if certain situations occur in rp I would like it to also be an adult typing. Whether it be violence or other things it is just preferred.\n\n2: I am looking for original rps. Yes I am part of many fandoms and a true nerd at heart I just simply have no interest in playing out a character from anything. I think it is much more fun to flesh out a character of your own creation than try to get into the mind of someone else character. I like the deep and wide array of thought put into OC so that is what I am looking for. Not only do I like to make awesome and diverse characters but I like to build a world of my own making. Every day life can be a drag sometimes and to dive into a world that exist in your mind/dreams well that is what rp is all about right? \n\n\n3: I know certain things may occur in rp if it feels appropriate but I will not have that the main focus of the rp. I am more plot driven so please keep that in mind. The plot is first and foremost the most important part of the rp now if it should fit into the development of it or the characters then so be it. I do have certain things I will not participate in but such things can be discussed once contacted.\n\n\n4: I am specifically looking for FxM and MxF. Know I have characters I play of either gender but I will not always play one sided. I rp both so having someone that does the same would be spectacular! :) I would also like it if you rped multiple characters in a rp for I think it keeps things interesting and adds depth to the plot line. If you multi chara for me I will do the same for you. As well as if a male is played against a female I will also do the same for you if/when more characters are thrown in.\n\n\n5: I prefer medieval themed rps for I have done that for many, many years but I am certainly open-minded. So with that being said feel free to share your ideas with me and perhaps we can try something new and exciting. I want a good rp experience for both of us so please do not be shy with your ideas.\n\n\n6: I myself do para/novella style rping which happens in third person so that is what I am looking for. Now you do not have to write a 5 page essay for me in every post but please give me more than 2-3 lines to work with. I enjoy the detail in the post and if there is not much to work with well I can not give an adequate response. You do not have to be the worlds best speller because by no means am I but some effort is always enjoyed. We all make mistakes so I will not bite anyone's head off. Though if you are set on only a couple of lined post then I do not think I am the partner for you.\n\n\n~ I rp over Discord. I would prefer to rp over as it is easy to navigate as well as have different rooms for OOC chatting and the different channel set up if offers.\n\n**Thank you for reading and if this post interested you please feel free to pm me to start a discussion on what is to come next!**",

            "selftext": "Hello, and good tidings to all of you lovely role players from \u2018round the world! I\u2019m back to look for a friendly someone who is willing to plot manically with me. Some deets to know about myself is that I\u2019ve been in the role play game 10\\+ years now and consider myself a bit of a veteran. But of course; this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m perfect. I\u2019m always looking to up my game and learn! Currently I have a pretty open and weird schedule. I usually work mornings and have dogs to look after when I\u2019m not working the day, but I like to rapid fire post as often as possible. To be completely honest; I\u2019ve had a hectic life the past year and am looking to get out all my built up ideas out ASAP! Outlet, of sorts, you know.\n\nWhat genres I\u2019m good with:\n\n* Supernatural\n* Sci\\-fi\n* Fandom\n* Horror/Thriller\n* Mature\n* NSFW\n* Modern\n* Victorian\n* Slice of life \\(Long as it\u2019s not too dramatic/boring\\)\n\nWhat I\u2019m currently itching to do:\n\n* Overwatch \\(PLS FOR THE LUV OF GAWD.\\)\n* World of Warcraft \\(NEW EXPANSION AHHHH.\\)\n* Marvel \\(I do anything from Avengers to X\\-Men and more.\\)\n* Supernatural \\(Plotting will commence\\)\n* SUGGESTIONS!\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\n* When I do fandoms, I tend to play OCs first, and do canon characters on the side. With Overwatch, I\u2019m looking for someone who can play mainly as Reaper/Gabriel Reyes.\n* World of Warcraft has been my bae for a loooong time and I have many characters I\u2019ve developed. I\u2019m willing to work with yours but if I don\u2019t like them, I will voice it!\n* With that being said; I need you to know that for any reason, if I begin to feel that I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to work, I will voice it as well. Sometimes people are awesome as friends but with Role Playing, it just doesn\u2019t work! And please let me know if it's not working from your end either. It's really annoying when we seem to be hitting it off and then I won't hear from you for a few days and I log on one morning to find you blocked me.\n* Please, please, please! Basic High School \\- College level grammar and spelling, and lots of juicy details! I get bored easily!\n* I will match your post as much as possible. If we are in a lull, you\u2019ll know it by the amount I post. I try to keep my paragraphs thick! \\(Giggity.\\)\n\nAnything else, we can talk about over discussion! Send me a PM! I\u2019ll be waiting! Thanks for reading over this c: And I\u2019m open to more than just what I\u2019ve listed! Throw ideas at me, do it!",

            "selftext": "About Me: I'm well over 21+, bordering on thirty at this point. I'm located in the central standard timezone. I've been roleplaying for well over fourteen years, writing is my favorite free hobby. I'm pretty chatty, so it's easiest if anyone just jumps into talking to me like we've been friends for a decade.\u00a0\n\nStyle: I\u00a0usually write in third person, past tense format, but I can adapt to present tense. I'd rather not, though. I usually try to shell out 2-8 paragraphs, all depending on what's going on in the roleplay, of course. I would appreciate it if I had a partner that would try to match that. I try to stay simple and enjoyable as far as vocabulary goes, if you're looking for someone to purple prose with, keep looking.\n\nTime:\u00a0 I'm never in a huge hurry, if you can reply to me once or twice a week I'll be pretty happy. I also enjoy if we're both free and up for it a few posts a night, either is fine.\u00a0\n\nAvailability:\u00a0I work pretty basic hours, Monday through Friday and I never get off later than six pm central standard. I'm mostly on during the evening, but I drop in on mobile through the day.\u00a0\n\nPreferences:\u00a0Seeing as how I'm older than a lot of people on here, I do usually like writing with someone that's at least 21+. I enjoy writing through email, docs or on discord.\u00a0 I prefer to write canon characters, but I don't mind creating an OC, or even writing canon against an OC. I also don't mind crossovers and often find them enjoyable af.\u00a0\n\nOriginal: When it comes to original content I'm most interested in fantasy, history or mythology (think American gods). Scifi, I do love a good space adventure. I also enjoy history based things, primarily around WWII or Vietnam war. I have a ton of ideas for these ideas as well so if you're interested just let me know.\n\nFandoms/Characters\n\nMarvel\u00a0\nEveryone's in a marvel mood, I'm digging it. I'm someone who's familiar with the comics and is up to date on MCU. I'm a huge fan of netflix marvel as well and would love to make the two cross paths.\u00a0\n\nCharacters I write:\u00a0\u00a0Steve Rogers, Bucky Barnes, Sam Wilson, Peter Quil, Peter Parker, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Claire Temple, Matthew Murdock, Frank Castle, Billy Russo, Gamora, Rocket, and I'm open to suggestions.\u00a0\n\nDC (Mostly comic based, open to interacting with anyone who only knows of movies, etc).\u00a0\n\nCharacters I write:\u00a0Jason Todd, Damian Wayne, Harley Quinn, Dinah Lance, Barbara Gordon, Starfire, Raven, Stephanie Brown, Cassandra Cain, Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Diana Prince, and I'm open to suggestions or requests here as well.\n\n\u00a0Star wars\nCharacters I write:\u00a0Kylo Ren, Rey, Finn, Obi-Wan, Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor,\u00a0 Han Solo, Luke Skywalker\nNote: I absolutely do not and refuse to ship Reylo, take it somewhere else.\u00a0\n\nA song of ice and fire (Game of thrones, I am mostly book based)\n\nCharacters I write:\u00a0Arya Stark, Robb Stark, Sansa Stark, Theon Greyjoy, Asha Greyjoy, Oberyn Martell\n\nThe 100\n\nCharacters I write: Bellamy, Lexa, Octavia, Lincoln, Raven\n\nStranger things\n\nCharacters I write: \nEleven, Johnathan Byers, Steve Harrington, Nancy Wheeler \n\nLegend of Korra/Avatar the last Airbender\nCharacters I write:\u00a0 Korra, Asami, Sokka, Zuko, Katara, Toph\n\nShips:\u00a0When it comes to ships I love them like almost anyone else and I'm open to almost anything, if you've been craving something, come at me and we'll see what we can work out. As long as the chemistry is there I likely won't be against writing it and seeing how it develops. I do have preferences and the following have a special place in my heart, though. If you have a well developed oc I'm also not against canon x oc.\n\nPeter Quil X Gamora\nLuke Cage X Claire\nSteve x Sam\nSteve x anyone cos he's a puppy\nHarley Quinn X Ivy\nHarley X anyone that's not going to treat her like trash\nRey X Finn\nRey X Poe\nJyn X Cassian\u00a0\nHan X Leia\u00a0\nArya X Gendry\nSansa X Theon (Arranged marriage plot ideas)\nArya x Theon (Arranged marriage plot ideas)\nRobb x Theon\nBellamy x Clarke \nRaven x Bellamy\nOctavia x Lincoln \nRaven x Kyle\n\nRules:\u00a0All the basics, lets be nice to each other, don't control my character and I won't control yours.\u00a0\nContact:\u00a0 Send me a message, please let me know what you would be interested in. I'll give you my discord.\n\n",

            "selftext": "**Edit: most people seem to feel sceptical about the \"varying genders and orientations\" and \"multiple characters\" restrictions below. If that's the only thing you don't like, please contact me regardless. We can work something out, and maybe I need to adjust my criteria a bit. :)**\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",
