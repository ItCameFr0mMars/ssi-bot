            "selftext": "  Hey y'all! I'm a longtime roleplayer (12+ years!) and freelance artist that wants to start roleplaying again, so I can be inspired to draw humans more and scratch that worldbuilding itch. I used to do both a lot when I was younger but stopped because I went to college. Since I graduated last year, I've got a lot more free time. :) \n\nAbout me:\n\n- I\u2019m a girl but I\u2019m not searching for anyone of a particular gender.\n- I work full-time from home as a freelancer. That means I have a lot of free time. I'm mostly active online from 4AM CST to 10PM CST. \n- I'm 24, therefore I'd really rather only interact with others 18+!\n- I\u2019m part of the LGBT community and have a loving partner of 7 years.\n- I\u2019m on Discord 24/7 thanks to my job, so that\u2019s where I\u2019d prefer to write but I can also do google drive or email if you\u2019d prefer!\n\nWriting stuff:\n\n- I\u2019m good with lit/semi-lit roleplays but my grammar has suffered a little bit since college. My replies are at least 1-2 paragraphs each, but emphasis is placed much more on quality than quantity!\n- I\u2019m a big fan of fantasy, horror, and slice of life. I can basically write anything as long as it\u2019s fun and interesting. \n- I love romance and intimacy, as long as it\u2019s natural and not forced. I won\u2019t make a character just to date yours, and I won\u2019t expect you to do that for me, either.\n-  I\u2019m a huge fan of realistic apocalypse/Fallout kinds of stories but not really too into fandom roleplays outside of that.\n- I write third person, past tense. \n- I get very emotionally involved with a roleplay and have had some stories last 5+ years.\n- I have a few pre-made characters with lots of fun lore and backstories, but I don\u2019t have a problem making a character based on a storyline or setting that you have in mind as long as I can find the inspiration to do so.\n- I have very few triggers/\u201dwill not do\u2019s\u201d and most of them revolve around topics that are already very bad/controversial/taboos.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested or have any questions, feel free to send me a PM or comment! Thank you for reading!",

Recently I have not been able to come on here or anything at all since I have been doing a lot of college work, but now I\u2019ve gone into summer break and need somewhere/someone who I can create/explore with.\n \nWhat am I looking for in a partner? \n- Experience, I like someone who can be literate and stick to a good cohesive plot.  \n- Someone who can be open minded to most things. ( I like to get pretty dark sometimes )\n- Someone who is 18 or older! \n- Someone with a lot of ideas to share.\n- Someone who can be active most times of the day and be able to reply at least once within a day. \n\nRoleplay wise I am into more modern based or realism. Though if we can make something interesting enough I would be open to exploring other genres. \n\nEven though I am open to darker themes i\u2019m not here to cater to your fantasies. Please make sure they don\u2019t take over the whole rp. Also no asking for pictures/calls, If you do so you\u2019ll be quickly blocked.\n\nIf anyone is interested, hit up my dms! We can share ideas and contact details there! \n\n\n\n\n ",

            "selftext": "### Realm of Angarak\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What is Angarak?\n---\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What makes it unique?\n---\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What are the 'requirements'?\n---\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### Tl;Dr\n----\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj",

Every night there are the distant howls of beasts and new corpses on the street. Twin plagues ravage the city. One that causes painful boils across the body and poisons the victim from the inside, another that is far worse. Lycantropy. Nobody knows what has caused this outbreak as some people with no contact at all with werewolves spontaneously transform at night, kill those closes to them and rampage across the city before being put down, or forced to hide in the sewers by the city's hunters. An organization of former soldiers, vigilantes hired by the city council and fanatics spurred on by the church. \n\nWithin this city lives a humble doctor and his assistant, working day and night to find some solution to these problems. At night they join the hunt, not to kill but to procure specimines. By day they work in the lab into the evening till late at night where again they join the hunt. A constant cycle that seems to be without end. Naturally there is more to this. Powers greater than any previous reckonings spread these plagues, and as the pair get closer to the truth, the closer these forces converge around them. They control the council, the church and their affiliated organizations. \n\nWill you join me? Send me a PM if interrested  ",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm currently looking for partners for a wide variety of plots I would like to do! Without further ado, I'll dive right into it!\u00a0\n\nA little bit about me:\u00a0I have been roleplaying for nearly four years. I'm usually available afternoons on most weekdays, and free on the weekends! I'll do my best to alert you if I am aware I'll be gone for an extended period of time.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n-\u00a0Someone who is detailed.\u00a0I'm looking for someone who puts detail and effort into the replies they send. I don't mind the occasional grammar error, I'm not too much of a stickler when it comes to it. I don't expect massive walls of text every reply, as long as you aren't constantly spitting out one line responses, I'll be happy! I tend to write two to three paragraphs per response, although I will do my best to match the length of what you send.\n\n-\u00a0Someone who doesn't mind playing multiple characters.\u00a0This one isn't too much a requirement as it is a preference. If you like playing several characters, cool! Otherwise, it's not a deal breaker for me!\n\nPlots I'm interested in.\n\nAlright, so here is the list of plots I would like to do. It's kinda long, so I've divided it into two categories.\u00a0Fandom and Non-fandom.\n\nNote: Anything marked with a '[!]' next to it means I especially want to do that one!\n\nFANDOM\n\nNote: I'm not to big on OCs, I greatly prefer if you play only cannon characters.\n\n[!] RWBY:\n\n- My character would be a teenager, running around Vale as a thief. Eventually caught, but instead of being sent to a detention center, the headmaster of Beacon Academy has a better idea. He would be put under the watch of one of the teams of the academy. It could be team RWBY, JNPR, CFVY, Cinder's \"team\". Heck, I'd even be willing to give a team STQR approach. (They would be a bit younger, of course.) Maybe of unique team, composed of various different characters?\n\n- Same character as above, different scenario. What if all of the main cast of the show were put in one large house? Chaos would ensure, definitely. Chaos that my character would be thrown into. I'm pretty open to any character roster for this!\n\n- My character would be a new student to Atlas Academy. A bit of a troublemaker, until an dust incident results in him being put under the watch of Winter, much to his dismay. (Winter could be swapped out with Pyrrah, or even Glenda for this one!)\n\n[!] Overwatch:\n\n- My character would be a teenager who ran away from home, sneaking aboard a cargo ship. For the last 6 months, I've been traveling the world this way, before accidentally coming across Watchpoint: Gibraltar\n\nAlternatively, he could be kidnapped by Talon.\n\nBorderlands:\n\n- My character would be a teenager, the heir of a massive mining company. After a rebellious act of running away, he would crash land on Pandora, before being found by Lilith or Maya. This would take place after the main campaign of BL2 is done!\n\n- Or, my character could be a lowly thief on Pandora, before making the grave mistake of trying to rob Lilith/Maya/Athena.\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club:\n\n- A mysterious event brings the characters of the game into the 'real' world, leaving a destructive rift behind in their wake. Chaos ensures, especially now that Monika has access to the object she desires most\u2026\n\nOther characters I'm interested in my partner playing, but don't really have a plot for:\n\n\n- Samus (Metroid) [!]\n- Elizabeth (BioShock) [!]\n- Monika (DDLC)\n- Cynthia (Pokemon)\n- Lusamine (Pokemon)\n- 2B (Neir: Automata) [!]\n- Cortana (Halo)\n- IQ (R6)\n- Any girl from Pokemon, really. \n- Piper (Fallout)\n- Cammy (Street Fighter) [!]\n\nNON-FANDOM\n\nSo, I have a lot of non-fandom ideas. So I've simply listed roles I would be interested in my partner playing! If you would like to play any of these roles, just tell me which one and we can work a plot out!\n\n- Soilder/other high military officer.\n- Teacher/principal.\n- Cop/security guard.\n- Assassin\n- Slime girl/other monster girl.\n- Classmate\n- Android (Like 2B from Neir)\n- Kidnapper.\n- Serial Killer.\n- Criminal.\n- Former Actress\n- Famous YouTuber\n\n\n\nIf your interested in any of the plots or roles, pm me or leave a comment!\n",

Do all people create their own character, based on time and place etc and then just say what they want to do? Is there someone like in pen and paper who also takes the lead and says what is going on? What are the different type of roleplay?

Not really fussed about age but if you want it to be 18\\+, it would probably be best if you are.\n\nI usually like to build original worlds and characters with whoever I'm roleplaying with but I don't mind some fandom stuff, the only fandoms I really know at all well are Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Game of Thrones, RWBY, DC and Marvel. So if you want to do any of those I'm down.

            "selftext": "(Adult female seeking adult male.)\n\n\n* Reddit messages only, no other apps.\n\n* Long term! Building our world together. This starts in the here and now, real world. Treating this story like this is completely real and happening to you. \n\n* Looking for male that is mid forties through mid fifties.\n\n* This is pure fantasy with a realistic world, story and background. Religious connections as well as conspiracy type subject matter will be used for realism. \n\n* Fun, adventure and adult situations. \n\n* I play central time USA, early morning until late in the afternoon weekdays and weekends. I would  like someone that can do this as well. (Giving notice to each other of delays or time away is expected.)\n\n* Going to give a little background info for your character just to set the story in motion. After that, your physical description and personality are yours to play. I want a normal man in the age range I suggested. I would like a fun man, Dad bod...Normal attributes. Dad jokes and humor are a plus. You have freewill, anything in the story depends on what you add or reply. Nothing is predetermined until I read your reply. If you have a different idea than what my characters suggest or want things to take a different turn you have the power to add it in.\n\n* If you have any issues after the story starts, they can be worked out. (Break in, let me know what is wrong.)\n\n* Will need to know your hard limits. This is a story with Vampires, I will not be graphic with violence or add gore. This is intended to be fun, romantic, sexy and a really good story.\n\n* See if this setup speaks to your imagination.\n_______________________________________\n\nYou are a decent guy, always played by the *'rules of life'*. Married young, had kids, they are grown now, moved away with lives of their own. Your stale marriage just ended. The only hard feelings you have about your now ex-wife is that you have to sell your classic car. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/qEinlsZ\n\nIt was your Dad's at one time, was your first car, black with white stripes 1970 Chevelle SS. You restored it, it is like a piece of you but the divorce means it has to be sold. You placed an ad in a local auto trader magazine and a couple online, overpriced at $40,000 but you are hoping the sale will take longer, maybe something will come up...Maybe you can get some money together.\n\nEarlier today you got the dreaded call. Someone is interested in your baby. A young woman's voice asked if you still had it. Reality crashed around you. You said that you did, the words were painful to say. She asked if it would be alright if she came by around 9pm tonight.\n\nIt is the weekend, you are staying at your brother's house., the ex got the house too. Your brother will be gone until late with his wife, You agree to the late hour and wait. \n\nAt 9pm sharp there is a soft knock on your door. An attractive blonde in her late 40s is at the door. 5'5, blue eyes and about 127 lbs. Wearing a denim skirt, print top with thin straps. \"We are here about the car.\" In a soft pleasant voice.\n\nOver her shoulder you can see two young females in the driveway that is well lit by a security light... 18 or 19ish looking over your car closely, laughing and talking about how loud they hope the stereo can play. One is just a younger version of the woman in front of you, Blonde, 5'4 and a half, around 100 lbs soaking wet. Wearing a floral top not much more than a bikini, black yoga pants and white sneakers.  \n\nThe other, dark hair and eyes, skinny as a rail with a little goth look about her. 5'4, about 97 lbs wearing a little black dress that barely covers her bottom and black leather boots that stop at her knees.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nWould like to take it from there, you get to fully meet, get more descriptions and get to know all three as we go on. Talk to the characters, ask them things, treat them like they are real people that showed up to buy your car. They don't know you, you don't know them...YET!\n\nI don't expect huge replies. I am not formal in any way. I want this to be long term and fill our days with good times! There will be lots of twist and surprises. I typo at times, not expecting perfection from you either, just someone that loves a good story, addicted to this type of thing as much as I am.\n\n*Do you want to try to get the girls and keep the car?* Please mention a US city or state you are in so we can start from there. This will start off as a road trip in your classic car. Will need a description or image of your looks so my characters can notice and mention things about you.\n\nAny NSFW questions answered privately. \n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello party people. My name is Oreo and I'm here to sell you the swankiest group around. Our group is a bit small but it's full of creativity. We run what is basically a science fantasy slice of life adventure group. Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nThe world is alive with tons of lore and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso to clarify as there have been some misunderstandigns. This world contains both magic and science in equal mixes. Neither is hard, so don't ask for the molecular structure of arcane. You can get very powerful with both arcane and tech, it just takes time as power comes from time spent active. That means if you spend every day working on things and do that for a month, you beat out the guy who does nothing for six months. As well, we move in real time. That may be a drag but we do it so that characters don't become locked in interactions with people who show up more rarely. One member bless her heart is a Paramedic. Valuable as that is, if you talk to her and had to wait, you would be trapped as she shows up for only a few minutes every couple days due to her work. That means when you leave if the scene goes on, your character will auto pilot to whatever it is you want them to do. Training, research, sleeping, eating, whatever. Please know that it may feel strange or bad, but we have lasted tha is long so something is working. It's like some games, the start sucks the most, but get past that and it becomes a lot more fun. Like Warframe. Or getting addicted to League of Legends.",

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nI'm an experienced roleplayer (have been doing it for years) and am in the process of doing different play-by-post longform roleplays and tabletop roleplays. It's something I've always really enjoyed and I have a lot of fun doing all types of RP. Met so many friends and important people in my life through RP that I just can't get enough of it and would love an additional roleplay to bury myself in. I love that feeling of waking up to a post or waiting for one all day, reading it, and hurriedly replying and want some more of that!\n\n* I roleplay in third person, past tense. I generally stick to longform roleplays. Posts don't necessarily need to be super long, but they should advance the plot to some degree. I love detail in my posts!\n* I encourage OOC chat as I think it allows for good roleplay if you enjoy the company you're with.\n* If you'd like to incorporate some tabletop elements / gaming-based elements, I'm all for it.\n* I'd prefer a long term roleplaying partner(s), I'm open to a group, so please be able to write semi-regularly. I understand real life gets in the way of this type of thing sometimes.\n* We should both have equal say in the plot so let's make sure to plan it together! Twists and turns, awesome action, cool shit, all that goodness. \n* **Genre(s)**:\n * Action-Adventure\n * Slice-of-Life\n * Comedy\n * Angst\n * Science Fiction\n * Fantasy\n * Romance\n * Historical\n * Superhero\n* **Fandom(s)**: (There are more, I'm just craving these)\n * Marvel Comics / Movies\n * Godzilla / Kaiju Fiction\n * Professional Wrestling\n * God of War Universe\n * My Hero Academia\n * Metal Gear Solid\n * Street Fighter\n * Fire Emblem\n * Overwatch\n * Persona\n\nThanks! Hope to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nYou can call me Alex and I\u2019m 26 and looking for a role play partner. I have been writing and role playing on and off since a little site called Neopets. Yeah, crazy! Anyway I have a full time job/life so I will be straight forward that I will not be on 24/7 like back in the good old days, but what I will provided will be at least a post that is detailed and moving the story forward. I\u2019m not looking for a novel, but I am looking for details and matching each other\u2019s post(within reason). I don\u2019t care if your grammar isn\u2019t spot on or if you spell a word wrong, as long as I get where you are going I am a happy camper. I typically write anywhere from 3-5 paragraphs per post.\n\nI love gore, sex and drugs when it is called for, don\u2019t randomly have your character go \u201cAlien\u201d with a alien popping out of his chest when you are supposed to be Spanish pirates.\n\nOnly things I ask is that my partner helps to push the plot forward and that they are older than 18+. The later I have no way of enforcing and have broken that rule so often before, but it makes me sleep better at night.\n\nWait, another \u201crule\u201d my partner has to be able to play more than one person. The world doesn\u2019t have just two people in it. I am completely fine with two main characters, but there needs to be supporting cast and crew. I prefer not to double because I always end up focusing on one that I really like to write.\n\nNow the good stuff. What do I will to role play.\n\n-Anything historical, anytime period any culture, I am your girl. I have several plots for these as well. (This is what I honestly want to role play) Mafia, Roman/Greek, Tudor, Victorian, Shogun-whatever!\n\n-slice of life: this is normally with a pairing and I am fine to do that, but there needs to be some direction. I would love to do a one with a actress/actor and someone that is coaching them or teaching them for a role in a movie or show. \n\n-Fantasy and sci-fi: would love to do an adventure plot or high stakes mystery. Very open to creating a world with some one. \n\n-Not a fan of fandoms, but I would be open to doing OC in the world of the fandom.\n\nI will play any gender, I might have a peference once we have come up with ideas but I can do anything. I prefer f/m or f/f but would be open to m/m(never have done it, but can).\n\nPM me for my email or for discord info, I will do either, but prefer email. Thanks for stopping by!",

I use kik or reddit for my role plays, and absolutely do not like discord, and refuse to use it. I don\u2019t know why, but it never rolled with me. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI\u2019ve never been good at describing fight scenes or action, but do like to incorporate it into my scenes. Some of my favorite roleplays I have done have included vampires, rich people, some fandoms, (I\u2019m also picky on those,) crime, reality, drama, romance, high school, trauma, and the list could go on forever. I know there\u2019s so many more, but these are the only things I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but am more than fine with smut if it fits into the story. Also. as for pairings, I prefer MxF, with me as F, but I can dabble in FxF if it is necessary. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where lots of words are necessary. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey. ",

            "selftext": "Hey there! \n\n   I'm looking for a partner to fill a role in a romantic/fantasy rp I'm wanting to play. Below is the detailed description of the universe and a little bit of set up. \n\n   The story takes place in a land where two kingdoms who once were at peace have started war over a stolen magical artifact called the Prism which has the ability to control the emotions and motivations of whomever the holder of the Prism desires. The Prism was originally in the possession of YC's kingdom, your kingdom blames the kingdom of my character, Adornia; and has declared war between the kingdoms. This ruins the budding friendship of the two heirs to the kingdom Princess Serena of Adornia, and Prince [YC] of [your kingdom]. \n   [YC] is raised to have a seething hatred towards the kingdom of Adornia and a bloodlust for the royalty's heads. He trains for most of his childhood to become an extremely gifted swordsman and leads the army of [your kingdom] with great pride. He is respected by his men and subjects but can never gain the approval of his father. Meanwhile in Adornia, Princess Serena has dedicated her life to her studies and has decided the war is useless because she assumes the Prism was never stolen by her father or anyone from Adornia, but rather was either stolen by someone from [your kingdom], or has been kept by [YC]'s father in secret. \n   After 12 years the princess and prince are destined to finally meet again when [YC] leads a raid on one of Adornia's outlying cities which Serena and several other are traveling on business. [YC] and his men do some damage to the group before [YC] opens the carriage and pulls Serena out, as he lifts his sword to kill her they lock eyes and [YC] hesitates a moment to long, shocked to see her his childhood best friend, and is wounded and captured by Serena's remaining guards. \n   Serena seeing an opportunity does everything she can to stop her father from having [YC] executed and frequently visits his holding cell trying to make friends with him again but she is met with [YC]'s harshness for whatever reason you decide and is unsuccessful at making peace with him. Serena finally convinces her father to put [YC]'s skills at use and let him join the army of Adornia or face death. \n   Another several years go by and [YC] has begrudgingly worked his way through the ranks of the army and has become a high officer. While he hates what he has become, a traitor to his country, he would rather fight than rot in a cell. Eventually he is presented with the post of personal guard to Princess Serena, whom he has avoided and refused to play nice with since his capture. \n   I'd like the RP to pick up there, but I'd also be willing to play any parts mentioned in the set up for character development if you'd like. If you're interested please PM me! Looking forward to it!  ",

            "selftext": "\\*\\*Hey my fellow RPers!\\*\\*\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\\*\\*Posting Quality/Quantity\\*\\*\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n\\*\\*Short/Medium/Long\\-term\\*\\*\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium\\-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long\\-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium\\-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long\\-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n\\*\\*Platforms\\*\\*\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n\\*\\*Posting Speed\\*\\*\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n\\*\\*Genres\\*\\*\n\n\\*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.\\*\n\n\\* High Fantasy\n\n\\* Low Fantasy\n\n\\* Alternate Fantasy \\(Not Urban Fantasy. \\*\\*Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.\\*\\*\\)\n\n\\* Modern \\(If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.\\)\n\n\\* Post\\-Apocalyptic \\(But not zombies.\\) \\(I do have a list of choices for this one\\)\n\n\\* Romance \\(Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre\\)\n\n\\* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n\n\\* Sci\\-Fi\n\n\\* Horror\n\n\\* Historical Fiction \\(In rare cases\\)\n\n\\* Medieval/Pre\\-modern\n\n\\* Fandoms \\(In some cases, explained in another part.\\)\n\n\\* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n\\*As for a few I'm not for:\\*\n\n\\* Urban Fantasy\n\n\\* Historical \\(Realistic\\)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n\\*\\*Fandoms\\*\\*\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre\\-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n\\* The Elder Scrolls\n\n\\* Warcraft\n\n\\* DC Universe\n\n\\* Marvel Universe\n\n\\* Assassin's Creed\n\n\\* Borderlands\n\n\\* Dishonored\n\n\\* The Maze Runner\n\n\\*\\*World Building\\*\\*\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n\\*\\*The Conclusion\\*\\*\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n\n\\*\\*To previous users who know me!\\*\\*\n\nI currently lost all my discord chats and chat history, If we have an unfinished RP please message me and I can get back to you!  \n\n\n\\*\\*DO NOT POST GROUP RP ADVERTISEMENTS IN REPLY\\*\\*",

            "selftext": "Hey there!  I've been roleplaying and writing stories on and off for at least fifteen years.  I'm hoping to find a new roleplaying partner-in-crime!\n\n**About me:**\nI'm 30F, and am currently trying to wrap up a doctorate.  However, I always make time for my creative outlets, and summers tend to be a bit lighter anyway, so I am confident I have time to put toward a new writing endeavor.  Plus, I get invested in the stories I roleplay.  For the sake of coordination, I live in the Eastern time zone.  \n\n**What I'm looking for in a roleplaying partner:**\nIdeally, I'd like someone who is at least 25 years old, and who gets excited about and invested in their stories and is has good command over their writing.  I'd also like to write with someone who is comfortable playing either males or females, and who would be willing to play additional side characters, as well, if the plot calls for it.  Ultimately, I'd love to think that we can come to be friends outside of our roleplay, chatting about the stories we dream up and other things as well.\n\n**Writing-related:**\n- I prefer to write in 3rd person, past tense.\n- My posts tend to average around 3-5 paragraphs.  Ultimately, it depends on what is happening in the moment and what my partner gives me to work with.  It's more about the quality than the quantity.  I like to give detail to what is happening around my character and explore their reactions, and I expect my partner to do the same.  However, in the thick of a conversation, I tend to enjoy writing shorter posts to create more of a sense of immediacy.\n- I tend to prefer posting on Google Docs so that we can keep everything compiled and easy to reread, but I could be swayed.  I'd love to have a way of chatting more directly, as well.  Say, Discord?  Again, I could be swayed.\n- I especially enjoy writing roleplays that involve romance (I just love writing the tension and the gradual process of coming together!), although I don't like it to be the only thing driving the plot.  I'd rather it complement some larger plot, and it's got to be natural.  I'd rather write a MxF pairing, and I am personally comfortable playing either the male or the female -- that is something we can discuss together later.  As far as writing sex goes, I'm all for it.  I can also fade to black if you are more comfortable with that, or something in between.\n- I'm cool with writing violence and grittiness.  I think they can make the stakes seem higher, but they don't always need to be there.  If it doesn't make sense for the sake of our world and plot, I don't see as much of a point.\n- As far as genres and whatnot, I'm always a fan of fantasy (especially medieval era).  I'd also really enjoy writing something from a historical period (personally I think writing about the Scottish highlands could be really fun!), post-apocalyptic, dystopian... I'd like to think that as long as there is a compelling story with characters who are well developed and mesh well, I could be on board.\n\nThink we might be a good match?  I'd love to hear from you!  Tell me a bit about yourself, and if it looks like we could have a good partnership, we can connect and get chatting!\n",

This ad is for serious inquiries only. \n\nThe kingdom of Atmora has been at arms with the neighboring kingdom, {insert name here} for almost a decade. It is finally the time that both the prince and princess of each kingdom have finally come of age, which gives the opportunity of peace. The prince's {your character} kingdom suggests that their feud may end, but only if their prince may wed the princess of Atmora. Of course, the king of Atmora gleefully accepts, as he is eager to rid of his daughter. However, the princess holds a secret held only by her and her parents. \n\nThe princess is quite against the marriage, and she stops at nothing to escape marrying someone she's never even met. Still, the day at the altar will continue to arrive. She will have to learn to live with her new husband. Will he be just as angered with the situation as she is? \n\nRules: Please remember that this is for serious inquiries only.

            "selftext": "Hello people!\n\nMy name is [redacted]. I am in my thirties. I work a full time job and have a child. I've been roleplaying since the mid-90's. I have a really good grasp on character development and it's one of my favorite things to see in roleplay. I love to see a fresh start and then a long time later, look back and think, wow, they've come a long way. \n\nThat being said, I really suck at creating my own storylines. I'm more of what I'd call a reactive roleplayer as opposed to creative. I encourage plots and twists but I don't often come up with my own scheme. I usually play with what others come up with and work to add depth to it through my characters. \n\nI enjoy a variety of genres. I like to have a mix of things, not just straight one way or the other. Romance? Sure, but let's make sure there's plenty of action too. I do tend to get uninspired pretty quickly if it's all just talking, slice of life type stuff. \n\nI enjoy drama, action and suspense. I absolutely love surprises. Often I'll tell people I'm roleplaying with not to give anything away so I can see what happens. \n\nI do prefer settings with some kind of supernatural or unusual twist. Powers, altered worlds, etc. Something that's not just the usual fare. I see the usual, normal modern world everyday. I want to explore something new and exciting!\n\nI can play a variety of characters. My favorites are the tougher, colder hearted types. Not really villains, but not the typical hero either. I will only play females. Every now and then once I'm comfortable with a setting and story I'll think about creating a villain. \n\nHm. What else. Third person only please. It's hard to keep submersion when I'm reading you and I in the posts. My posts tend to range from short, single line sentences to paragraphs. It really just depends on what's happening. I like to think I have a good quality with them, though. I've never been told otherwise. \n\nI'm pretty open minded. I don't mind darker themes at all, in fact I rather enjoy them. Tactics and manipulations and schemes. All have almost always been great fun. \n\nHm. Can't think of anything else. I would order roleplaying over discord. I might be convinced to try other mediums like email or Google docs, but discord is my default go to and the one I'm most interested in. \n\nAnyway! If you're interested, or you have a group you think I could contribute to, please shoot me a message. :) I have no idea what I'm looking for, so throw all the ideas at me!",

            "selftext": "The Paradigm universe is one like no other. Imagine that fantasy world full of castles, magic, and elves. Now imagine for once that society managed to advance past the dark ages for once. Paradigm is that world, with opportunity to be whatever you want you are free to carve your own story with the inhabitants of paradigm. Do you want to be the Orcish space pirate, knocking down merchant ships in the depths of space? Go right ahead! What about an elvish aristocrat heading a successful business? Go for it! Or maybe you are a magic using soldier for one of the 4 major factions in the world. Nothing is stopping you!\n\nOn the topic of the four factions, why don't I tell you about them so you can get a bit more of a feel for the world.\n\n**The Republic Of Icarus**\n\nThe republic of Icarus is a lavish aristocratic faction striving to do nothing but accrue wealth and power in their quest to take over the galaxy. With the strongest economy of any factions and one of the most advanced militaries to ever be deployed they have always been a force to be reckoned with. Planet by planet they appropriate the galaxy for their own, conquering in the name of advancing Icarus.\n\n**The War Clans Of Ka'Esk**\n\nA miracle of sociological science with beyond a billion to one chance has led to the embodiment of civil war being the next largest faction, even rivalling that of the republic of icarus. Named after the home planet of the clans 'Ka'esk' the faction is comprised of 4 clans that all hold the same planets as eachother. Every single planet owned by the clans has one stark similarity however, no matter where you go within the faction, all 4 clans are at war. The cunning and sly Fiel clan sneak and steal from the other three. The smart and advanced Drall clan fortify their settlements and lock themselves away in mega cities of scientific development and technological advancement, developing new means to get the edge on their sibling clans. The Wise and nomadic Su'tum are masters of the magical arts, devoting their lives to ritual and study yet only lashing out in an act of war when the situation demands, neither pacifists nor warlords in their ways. And the brash and dangerous Krass clan live in a mad max like hellscape of anarchy and violence, sending war parties charging across the planets to command their territory, numbers over tactics.\n\n**The United Federation**\n\nA conglomerate of planets and solar systems in constant political dispute, all banding together for one reason. The safety from invasion. Every world leader has their own view on how the federation should be run, where the funding should go, what should be done with the military. In a community of such cultural and planetary difference everyone can find their place.\n\n**The Tressen Empire**\n\nThe studious and devoted faction of the Tressen Empire has one goal in their assistance. They are to find the technology of the old world so that they may reverse engineer it for their own use. They must protect the relics of old from the rest of the universe that they deem unworthy. The youngest faction of the four but the most formidable, with few to no military defeats, they pose more and more of a threat by the day.\n\nJoin up now and get ready to explore this wonderful world\n\n[https://discord.gg/VTmgzsF](https://discord.gg/VTmgzsF)\n\nIf you would like to look into the lore of the community we have documentation on the whole universe it takes place in.

            "selftext": "Hello, everyone! It's been a year since I last did a GoT/ASOIAF based roleplay, but now I'm craving the political madness from that realm. So as the title suggests, I am currently searching for a writers that are interested in writing in the Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire universe. \n\nFirst, a few requirements. I do require you to be 18+ in case of any adult content in our stories. I also ask that you can write multi-paragraph form. Quality is always above quantity, and I will never ask you to match me if I decide to go off on a literary spew. However, I ask that you put effort into your replies, and I promise you nothing less than quality replies back.\n\nNow, in case you were curious about me. I am well above the legal age limit (let\u2019s just leave it at that) and I have been role playing on and off for about fourteen years. I write in third person, past tense, and consider myself a literate writer. On good days, I can fire replies back and forth.\n\nAs for my cravings, I am looking for action, romance, angst, etc. in the plots. I am a fan of both the books and the shows. The characters I am itching to play are: Margaery Tyrell (especially for a Margaery Tyrell/Robb Stark plot), Arianne Martell, Daenerys Targaryen, Sansa Stark\n\nThis is by no means a list of all the characters I am willing to play both on the side and as mains. I appreciate a wide cast of characters for plot purposes and am willing to play anyone whom furthers the plot. I am very open as to pairings and plot, so please feel free to shoot me a message with any ideas that you have! If you have but a vague idea, I would be happy to brainstorm with you! I do like to write over e-mail and/or Google docs, but I have no problem with Skype or Reddit messenger. If this is not your cup of tea, then I hope you have a wonderful day!",

As the conflict and tensions grow between countrymen, roll the dice for a successful rebellion. Or attempt to explore the hidden secrets of Alkebu, or invent new technologies to improve the world.

I am looking for someone to play Artemis Fowl or Holly short.\n\nAnyway I have afew rules I would like to go over before I say the plot.\n\n1: Be literate. I will not deal with people using text talk for the Role Play.\n2: Be able to play multiple characters. I\u2019m not a dungeon master, I won\u2019t play everyone. But I don\u2019t expect you to be one either as I will Play other characters aswell.\n3: Don\u2019t Play my character. This is a huge one for me, you will get one warning.\n4: Don\u2019t be a dick. This goes without saying but still.\n\nAnyway my idea for the Role Play is my character would be a human who comes to Artemis Fowl looking for help to capture Opal coboy. This will take place between the last guardian and the Atlantis complex. I hope you have read the books, as it will be helpful for understanding the story. Anyway, Pm me for either my discord or my Kik. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "(You can ignore the following crappy poem. I just wrote it as a supplement to the plot starter in order to get featured on an app I use.)\nFrom atop a hill I can see,\nall of the pain, suffering, and misery.\nAnd even after all is lost and dead,\nthe nightmare continues in my head.\n\nFrom atop a hill the voices cry,\nin sorrow and anguish as loved ones die.\nThe world afire as ashes fall,\nAnd out rings the cry of a warrior's call.\n\nAs the day turns into night, \nas the ashes settle, and we scream our plight.\nOur words fall upon nothing but dead ears,\nfor our unheard suffering will go on for years.\n\nFor this is the end of us,\nin so many, we had placed our trust.\nAs trust is betrayed and blood is spilled,\nwe've come to realize, it is time for our debts to be filled.\n\nBetrayed by the ones in which we have trusted to keep the world safe, we watch from our cabin as the world outside is slowly burned, blasted, and torn to the ground. The cabin is on top of a wooded hill, there is about 10 miles of forest before the outskirts of a city start. We went up into the cabin after our college graduation party to celebrate, get drunk, and get high. But things took a catastrophic turn after we saw the giant columns of smoke rising into the sky. The city is a war zone, filled with firefights, bombings, and a lot of other things where it is easy to die. (I swear to god I wasn't trying to rhyme those last three sentences.)\n\nWe all drove up to the cabin in the woods just after the graduation party, we did not bring much other than drugs and alcohol. Some of us brought pocket knives, but being college students none of us have car guns or anything like that, a can of pepper spray maybe.\n\nWe brought a few coolers, some instant coffee mix, and some of us had a can of food or two left in our trucks and cars, maybe even a bag of jerky. We spent two days in the cabin until we noticed the smoke rising into the sky above the city. We turned of one of the radios of our cars and listened to the horrific stories and sightings of carnage and mayhem in the city and surrounding towns. The roads are very unsafe, and most vehicles that go over the main roads get jumped and looted.\n\nThe cabin is pretty out of the way. It is 3 miles of rough dirt paths and hiking trails just barely able to have vehicles go through before you can get to the cabin from the main road. It is another 3 miles to the nearest town and 4 miles from the city from the nearest town. The city is about 10-11 miles from the outskirts of the city, with very dense forest in between.\n\nThe cabin used to be a lumber yard and saw mill, ran by the nearby river, but it shut down in the 1970's and was sold to my family as a summer home. There are quite a lot of wooden boards and planks, and even a few mechanical and metal parts, but not many. The cabin does not have running water or power, with only a propane stove in the kitchen, and a brick fireplace in the main room. The surrounding forest is rich with life, and hundreds of garter snakes are around the cabin property. Squirrels are not uncommon, and small fish are in abundance at the nearby river.\n\nThe first night when we found out about what was going on, we all just kind of went quiet. We retreated into the cabin or into our vehicles to get so drunk or high, that we couldn't think about or even remember what was going on.\n\n\"Requirements\":\n-Use \"\", not **\n-16 or older is preferable\n-Replies are relatively quick (I want to get at least 5 entries in each day at least)\n-Open-mindedness is always a plus\n\nSpecifications:\n- I typically use furry characters for my roleplays, but using a human is totally fine to me. We can decide that together.\n- Smut is a possibility, but it is not entitled.\n- This is a realistic to semi-realistic sceneario. No supernatural characters. This can also be argued and later decided.\n- I don't care about entry length, just as long as I can tell what is being said.\n\nPM me if you are interested, and I look forward to the roleplay! Thank you for your time!",

Their father's were in the service together . they were both trained together by Charlie .\nOn a non- disclosed mission to assassinate a foreign dictator , they botched their mission . The supposed Illuminati sought revenge on the entire unit sent to snuff out his life by taking their children. Long story short Guile and Charlie managed to avoid this fate but Sophia along with three other children were captured and subjected to various physical and mental tortures and experimentation over the course of 5 years . Her father along with his comrades finally sought them out , but she was the only child to survive .\nTwisted from the experience showed telling signs of a sadistic personality in the year after , she was forced into boot camps until the age she could join the service herself to try and put focus and discipline as a secure structure to her life . seemingly working for several years until Guile , Charlie and herself were sent on a non- disclosed mission of their own .

Always over analyzing weaknesses to make sure she holds the upper hand , especially when it comes to that of her old friends . And will oddly freak out at the sight of bugs .",

            "selftext": " Has anyone ever wondered what would happen if a soldier wound up in a fantasy world with his weapons? I have. Granted that soldier wouldn't have unlimited ammunition but they would quickly be recognized as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe idea I had was one where the fantasy world has the usual fighting going on between allied races of humans, elves, dwarves, and other (thinking orcs would be seen as a lesser race, but would be included in the alliance.) Against some sinister forces like goblins, undead, grotesque creatures, things of that nature. Well the dark side had managed to unearth an ancient incomplete summoning spell to pull demons from another dimension. They rush the spell into use during a large scale battled but instead summon a soldier (or mercenary) from our world who is loaded to the teeth. Instead of fighting for the darkness he freaks out a bit and starts obliterating them with weapons that make their armor useless and their magic cant stop. The forces of darkness are routed for a bit and he is captured by the alliance because they are suspicious of him, especially because his armor makes him look inhuman and his weapons are unlike anything theyve seen.\n\nIf this idea interests you message me for my Kik, Telegram or Discord tag. Please include more than just \"hi\" or \"wanna rp?\". I write in 3rd person narrative form and strive for at least small paragraphs, though one liners may occur if I get super busy but I try to avoid them as much as possible. And dont be discouraged if I dont respond right away, my messengers dont seem to inform me of new messages right when they happen. I look forward to roleplaying with yall.",

            "selftext": "Let me start by saying I'm probably not very good at this as I dont have much experience so I would appreciate you being easy on me or guiding me along the way.  Also, actual science terminology is not needed as long as you can BS it.\n\nWe are on a failed space mission to planet Armitron which is located in a galaxy thousands of light years away from our own.  The hope was to research the planet first hand after initial satellite research and tests deem the planet habitable.  Several hundred male and female scientists were on the mission with hopes to set up camp and eventually populate the planet.\n\nThanks to the latest spaceship technology the trip will only take 1 year while in warp mode.  The problem is, due to an error with the ships hyperdrive unit we came out of light speed only 75% of the way to our destination which leaves us with hundreds of years until we reach our destination.  Me, the captain of the ship, and you, my co-captain are awaken out of our deep sleep state before the rest of the crew for any emergencies.  \n\nWe awake from our deep sleep and run diagnostics on the ship.  The good news is that the ship is still fully functional without the hyperdrive, but the bad news is that the hyperdrive is not repairable.  There is no way we will be making it to our destination alive.  We have approximately 3 years worth of food for the entire crew, or we would have 150 years worth of food for just the 2 of us.  150 years still wouldnt get us to Armitron, but it might just give us time to figure something out.\n\nWe are stuck with a difficult situation.  Do we wake the crew to give them the bad news and give us all 3 years to live on the ship, or do we pull the plug on the deep sleep chamber, killing off the entire crew and giving ourselves extra time to live and try to figure out a plan?\n\nI decide to make an executive decision and just as I go to start the shut down process for the deep sleep chamber, you come running to me...\n\nPM me what you have to say (whether you agree with me or try to stop me) and if you want to continue on kik PM me your kik.",

            "selftext": "Hello, r/roleplay! I have a plot to try and get a partner for!\n\nFor this plot, I\u2019m looking for someone to take the mantle of Jack, the Ripper, as a man who keeps a regular life by day - probably as a loving family man - and another, darker, one at night, when he goes out to kill prostitutes. Basically, I want to explore the duality, his reasons, and what happens with his wife. Does she know it? Does she eventually find out? Does he kill her, die, change his life around? I have some ideas - such as him actually wanting to kill ONE person, but kill others as a cover, but we can work this out together.\n\nNow, here's the catch: I write through e-mail (yes, only), and post once a day or every other day, so I'm not the best person out there for the more impatient ones of the bunch. My job keeps me very busy during the day, so I'm not online on any messengers while I'm at work, which's why e-mails are the best way for me to roleplay. Sorry if that's a deal breaker. Reply here or PM me, as you prefer, to get this ball rolling!\n\nThanks for reading, and happy roleplaying!",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone!  I've recently gotten back into the Naruto fandom and I've always loved all of the Akatsuki pairings. One of my favorites is in the title--Itachi and Kisame.  I am really wanting to do an rp with a bit of a slow build.   I would like for there to eventually be a bit of romance, but I would be okay with just a friendship if that's all you're wanting. I do plan for their to still be the fighting and action and we can add scenes from canon, too if you would like\n\nI would prefer to play Itachi.   I rp in the 3rd person and past tense.  I typically write between a paragraph to three paragraphs as I prefer to have some detail, but still progress the story along.  For the rp, I usually use discord.  \n\nIf you're at all interested, PM me and we can talk more in detail",

I'm friendly and an easy\\-going person. Just talk to me about whatever!\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\nSomeone to play as a TF2 character for me! \\(Scout and Spy are adored but more than welcome to the other mercs.\\)\n\nSomeone that can keep a plot going and stay excited even in the less active sequences. \\(Slice of life stuff or just fluff.\\)\n\nBeing able to stay diligent, communicate with me and be a pal! If we're going to be RP partners then we gotta be able to talk and be friends.\n\nKNOW about TF2/ Play the game \\- if you don't know anything about TF2 or play it then.. why would you wanna RP it?\n\nKnow about the story and the character backgrounds. Basic stuff.\n\nAbility to write paragraphs. Detailed stuff that also advances the plot, not just a lot of fluff and expect me to take the wheel all the time. Which brings to *taking initiative.* Keep the story going.\n\nHave discord.\n\nAnd just have a good time. We both wanna have fun and all that!\n\n**What I'm offering:**\n\nAn RP partner that is eager to please and be a buddy.\n\nAn OC with custom art and is definitely a babe.\n\nFlexibility to your wants/needs.\n\nSomebody that loves the heck out of TF2.\n\n**Send me an message if you're interested!

Technology controlled every element in homes, giving citizens full personalisation from just their phone or other device. Drones keep down crime, and the city itself is managed by both androids and humans alike.\n\nFast forward ten years, however, and power-hungry individuals in the government decided they wanted more. The technological advancements made this easy - making bad purchases even with cash led to your credit score dropping, the crime-fighting drones mysteriously stopped hunting when the government were bribed by certain criminals, and those who plotted against the government are somehow discovered, and brought to be executed.\n\nThe corruption has been spreading for 22 years now.

When she was 17, the family decided to take a Christmas vacation, but a while after they got on the road, a drunk driver t-boned the car, killing her mother and sister. \nUnable to deal with the terrible loss, Riley resorted to not speaking. It was her way of bottling up her emotions and not letting others in. Her father became an alcoholic, and was eventually put in jail for abusing her when she was 19. Riley decided to move out of Virginia and up to New York for a fresh start. \n\n (Your character will be a male close to my character's age who lives in the apartment building mine is moving into.

I am looking for a partner whom in which is passionate about writing like I am, eager to come up with story lines and turns the roleplay can take. In the past I have had people solely depend on me to take the story somewhere, I\u2019d rather have a even vary of us both taking the roleplay somewhere. Before the roleplay I like to discuss the setting, our characters (I much prefer written descriptions rather than images, it makes the imagination part more prominent for me.), ideas as to what can happen briefly etc. It just makes it more original if everything\u2019s planned; obviously all the ideas that the roleplay could lead to don\u2019t need to be discussed in huge detail as it will ruin the anticipation of the story. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in roleplaying with me, please private message me with some information about you and past roleplays you\u2019ve enjoyed, (you don\u2019t need to discuss ideas for the one we will do; I would rather get to know you first and all your writing preferences.) \n\nThank you for reading.

I have been RPing for a long while, but I'm far from being good.\n\nI mean... I think I can RP fine, but I'm horrible with OCs. So I'd be looking for people that would like to play either their OCs or other canon characters with me playing canon. Simple as that. You can bring any OC you have if you like, and I'm sure we'd figure out some sort of fit for them. The story itself would greatly depend on the universe we'd be setting that on, but just for the sake of orientation, I tend to like sad and tragic stories, though I'd do anything from that to fluffy slice of life if there is a good idea behind it.\n\nBut before I start listing stuff, a few things I should make you aware of from the start:\n**-** Any age/experience level would be welcome, unless you intend to smut, in which case you do have to be over 18 (I am 18+ myself);\n**-** If you're extremely against some kind of theme (like death or too much blood), please tell me from the start. We might plan beforehand, but if we don't, I might spring some heavy stuff unexpectedly, and I don't want to hurt anyone by doing it.\n**-** Romance/smut is quite fine: I have a big preference for either f/f or m/m. Yet I will do m/f if you really want me to.\n**-** I like to have at least a paragraph of a response to work with. But so long as we're moving the story forward, you can't go wrong with any length. It IS enjoyable to read a bit more rather than less, however.\n**-** I don't demand that we are partners for long: just that we do our best to make the experience satisfying. As such, if anything grows dull or you wanna shift gears, keep in contact with me about it.\n**-** I fully intend to listen to your request of who you might want me to play out of the canon characters once the universe is decided: just keep in mind that I can't promise to properly depict every single character. I'll usually at least make an attempt, though.\n\nHopefully that's not much? Anyway... I have a lot of fandoms, but they're mostly games. I know a few anime, but not much. Same with movies and series, I'm afraid. But don't let that dissuade you from asking me about a particular franchise you're interested in. Feel free to throw me a PM in that regard if you can't find something of interest here.\n\nSo what I was mostly interested in is, in no particular order:\n\n* Fire Emblem (mostly anything between and including Blazing Sword and Awakening; also Heroes);\n* Persona (especially 3 &amp; 4);\n* Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney;\n* Hyperdimension Neptunia;\n* Pillars of Eternity;\n* Tales of (Graces, mostly);\n* Kingdom Hearts;\n* Touhou Project;\n* Kid Icarus;\n* Grand Chase;\n* Odin Sphere;\n... and there is a bunch more, but those are the ones that come more prominently.\n\nAnime-wise, I have a soft spot for card game anime (like Yu-Gi-Oh, especially GX, and ones with more depressing tones like selector infected WIXOSS), and for magical girl anime that are also kind of depressing (like Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Magical Girl Raising Project). So you could definitely ask for anything like that too. But at this point, I've rambled too much already.\n\nPM me if you're interested, or if you just want to check the availability of a certain franchise! As said on the top, I rather RP through Discord. Well, thank you and have a good day!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I am a 21 year old male and am looking for more RP partners. I already have a few partners who I am loving roleplaying with but figured I'd see if I could find some more people to make the magic happen with.  A little about me and my roleplaying.\n\n\\* I am in college so usually am pretty quick about replying but sometimes there will be days when I am super busy or doing stuff with friends and won't reply. Also I sometimes go through stretches where I feel super down and might not reply. That being said 95&amp;#37; of the time I reply pretty quickly.\n\n\\* I tend to post OOC stuff and thoughts on the RP all the time and am generally chatty so even if the other person is not around I might have several posts and make several edits to my post\n\n\\* I am a semi\\-literate to literate RPer. My post length varies based on that of my partner usually I can match pretty well whatever the person I am doing the RP with is writing. Also if you want me to change something\n\n\\* Partners must be 18\\+ but I prefer them be at least 20 I never aim for anything intentionally that would require it but if the RP goes that direction I don't want to worry about it. Also if I get a PM I will almost always ask again just to make sure you read the rule and are 18\\+ because it is better safe than sorry in my opinion\n\n\\* I prefer modern realistic RPs although I don't mind somewhat recent historical pretty much 1900\\-present I can maybe do\n\n\\* Major interests as far as material: medical (my favorite), sports, war (more as a setting), combat (I really like RPing fights as well as the aftermath from it), romance, drama, slice of life and angst\n\n\\* I do ask that anybody I am playing with if you want me to change something or have suggestions for me to improve please do give them, I don't want someone silently steaming at me because I am doing something minor that can be easily corrected\n\n\\* I prefer discord or PM\n\n\\* I can play either gender and am fine with any gender pairing\n\n\\* I can also play multiple characters\n\n\\* I also had an idea for an RP of some major event which is 1 on 1 but with each person playing many different characters\n\n\\* I need all main characters to be 18\\+ as well\n\n\\* I am open to plot suggestions and also feel free to look at my old prompts\n\n\\* I am a little weird also if you decide after a little while that your not interested in the RP just let me know that is fine but please don't just disappear.\n\n\\* If you message me tell me a little about yourself or your thoughts about my prompt or ideas don't just give me a discord handle or ask for mine put a little effort in.\n\nNow the prompts I like right now. I don't have particular genders in mind for the character's but for some of them I am writing them with certain genders as placeholders for what I think would work best but feel free to change them.\n\n\\*\\*Meeting Again\\*\\*\n\n(Already doing this prompt with others but I really enjoy it and would love to do it with more people if your willing to put your twist on it.) Muse A and B had been dating since the start of their sophomore year of college and now having just graduated were beginning to contemplate taking the next step in their relationship when the accident happened severely injuring B. Her family blamed Muse A for what had happened and told him that she never wanted to see him again despite the fact that she still loved him and needed him more than ever. Over the next few years neither of them could find someone else when chance would bring them back together although things were not the same as they were before.\n\n\\*\\*Making the most of it\\*\\*\n\nMuse A and Muse B are stuck as roommates for a long time in the hospital, a rehabilitation center, or a long term care facility or something similar. With nothing to do but talk for hours on end and being able to relate to one another cause something to develop.\n\n\\*\\*Love in the most trying of times\\*\\*\n\nI was thinking the plot from Meeting Again but continuing after the accident if they aren't broken up and dealing with all the changes and circumstances that result.\n\nI also have a few more out their ideas that I am willing to share in PM if you think our styles might mesh but don't like my prompts. I am also open to your ideas as well.",

            "selftext": "By the end of the first day, it was already over. The world as humanity knew it, gone in the blink of an eye. No one knows where it started, how they got here. Many refuse to believe that their society fell to demons at all. The few pockets of survivors floundered in the wake of the demons' arrival. How can they hope to stand against a threat of this magnitude? There is no one to save them. And some believe that it is only a matter of time, that they are already too late to save themselves.\n\nThe southern dorms fell to the demonic hordes first. It'd happened so fast, been over so quickly, none of them stood a chance at getting out alive. But their sacrifice gave their fellows time, a chance to grab what little they could and flee before the demons came for them. But as they stood, miles from their fallen home, the other witches realized that this newfound safety was only temporary. The demons would move on. They would be found again. For now, though, all they could do was wait, and prepare for the inevitable. They would find a way to destroy the evil that took their home - or they would die trying.\n\nThey'd heard it on the news, before the station was overrun and the city went dark. In the confusion that followed, the pack found themselves venturing north. Their alpha claimed that demons couldn't be used to the bitter winds and harsh winters the land would subject them to, that they would be safer there. The werewolves would be safe - they had fur, after all, and were more accustomed to the climate. But there were whispers of uncertainty, some doubting that they would make it to safety before the demons caught up to them. Even if they were to make it...how did their alpha plan to survive?\n\nHe'd long since ceased his pacing around the room like a caged tiger. There was nothing for it - the sun was still up, and like it or not, he was stuck here in this godforsaken room until night fell. Not that he was worried, of course. Unlike the sorry saps that had woken him up with their screaming, he was capable of holding his own against the hellish nightmare that had all but destroyed the city. Well, long enough for him to flee, at least. Immortal or not, he didn't plan to stick around once the sun set.\n\nEverywhere he turned, fires burned and rubble littered the street. There were bodies, of course. Far too many to count, if he'd cared to do so. Humans dropped like flies all the time - they were so terribly fragile it was almost laughable. He'd witnessed a entire squad of police officers ravaged by a hell hound, of all things! Still, the situation as it was now could not stand. They could not afford to have the riff-raff running amok and killing indiscriminately. Not without the Queen's permission, at least. The demonic scout grimaced as the screams of several survivors started up once again. Such a distasteful noise - one he would be glad to be rid of. He had a report to make to the Queen, and, thankfully, an excuse to return to Hell without further interference.\n\n~~~\n\nHello, hello!\n\nAs you read, demons have escaped from the Negative Plane and are running wild across our plane! You would be playing one of the few survivors/fighters. You can be any one of the species I have described above in this RP (even a demon!). I have set up lore for each other them, but I'm open to suggestions on changes!\n\nThere is a plot I have in mind, but I want each character to still have motivation to keep living without my plot. I want to keep this RP driven, but give everyone room to be able to do something they love with their character.\n\nThis is a detailed RP, so we expect 2-4 paragraphs per reply (exceptions do apply). I hope this will encourage people of all schedules to join in! I intend to do my best to keep everyone involved no matter what time you wake up or go to bed! We also expect that players who join will be proactive with their characters. We wish to build a story together, but sometimes time constraints come up, so having other plots to follow will keep things going.\n\nHere is the link to the server:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/sj6nWZg\n\nI look forward to preparing you for the end of the world!",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s been like 5 years since it started. The outbreak started off slow, small incidents appearing all over. People quickly began to panic as rumours spread that the dead were coming back and feasting on the living, creating more dead. The world quickly plummeted into chaos and now zombies reign supreme.\n\nHonestly it doesn\u2019t bother me, I\u2019m quite good at this whole surviving thing so it\u2019s no skin off my nose. My only issue is that I haven\u2019t had sex in 5 years and some of these zombie chicks are beginning to look good. I saw one who was completely intact, only a small bite on her ankle. I must say, she\u2019s got quite the body though and that chest of hers is beginning to drive me crazy. She wanders around my little camp all day as if to tease me and today is the day that I have sex once again. I\u2019ve set up a trap to lure her into so I then can have control of her body. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m putting my genitals near her mouth.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHi this prompt is set out to be a sexual one. At least when I first wrote it. Now I\u2019m looking to change it slightly and turn it into more of a love roleplay which means it most likely be long term.\nI\u2019d love to see any ideas you have to help build on this story.\nJust pm if your interested.",

And that is a Dangan Ronpa story that'll play out as fabulously and fantastically as they always do. I'm looking for someone to Dungeon Master the school and our soon-to-be Murderous cast of characters, however the premise this time around will be different.\n\n\n\n\nIt's been around 30-50 years since the last remnants of Despair has been crushed, and all around the world hundreds of different Hope's Peak Highschools exist, shaping the Future Leaders of this still struggling world. All our favorite characters from the games (who survived) and the Animes have become Headmasters for these schools, one (or sometimes two) running these pinnacles of hope. One by one, Master Pupils of each school/Headmaster disappear, searched for for months.\n\n\n\n\nUntil they are found, all at once, a new killing game being broadcast out to the public.\n\n\n\n\u2018Why?\u2019 you say. With Junko dead, why would anyone want to start this hell over again.\n\n\n\n\nEverlasting Hope, eventually gets really, really, *really* boring.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease please please message me ideas! We will use Skype as a messaging platform. 18+ because this will involve sex, violence, and all other topics that are expected with a Dangan game.\n",

Dark fantasy revolves around the gritty things : thievery, crime, small villages ransacked, bandits, things like that. I enjoy the feel of that instead of a bright fantasy world, the creatures will be disgusting creatures that are completely repulsive. Just pm me your discord and I\u2019ll be sure to contact you and even if you don\u2019t quite like my idea, we can sort something out! My time zone is EST, by the way. Maybe more people could be involved, I haven\u2019t decided yet. ",

Small server just getting it's start!  \n\nMore than two centuries ago, at the end of the 21st Century, Terra, the cradle and, at that time, only home of the human race, was collapsing in a series of escalating environmental disasters. A nearly constant barrage of storms, flood tides, and wildfires had killed billions, forced mankind to abandon most of its coastal cities, and reduced the sum of human industry to a desperate attempt to stave off the end just one more day. Hope had been all but lost.  \n\nA scant dozen starships, hastily constructed by individuals, companies, and governments, launched in desperate attempts to give the human race one more opportunity to survive. Most had only vague information about their destinations, without any certainty they would reach those planets, or that they could be made habitable if they did. The journey would take decades; even if things went perfectly, most who set out would not live to see a new homeworld for humanity, instead hoping to create it for their children.\\(edited\\) You are the descendants of the crew of one of those ships. So far as we know, we are the only remnant of humanity. Terra is silent now, and our signals sent towards the expected locations of the other ships have never been answered.  \n\nThis year marks the 200th anniversary of that day of jubilation, the founding of the new, and only, home of humanity. Survival on Novaspace still challenges us, and our foothold is small. We are still pioneers of a wild frontier that we shape more into humanity's home with every day. But it is the only home of the human race. Raise your spirits to the stars and drink deep of the air. You hold our fate within your fragile hands. ",

            "selftext": "Hey fellow redditors, thanks for dropping by, I appreciate it. I\u2019ve been lurking here for a few weeks now and have finally decided it was time to make an ad of my own. First things first, I have under a year of inconsistent roleplay experience so if that is a deal breaker, it\u2019s probably best you stop reading now.\n\nA little about me, I\u2019m in my late 20\u2019s, have a career, and participate in a handful of other extracurricular activities. My work schedule is a bit sporadic, but I can usually find blocks of times available to chat or write with a partner if you\u2019re not looking to play by post. I tend to post rather long, detailed posts anywhere between two to five paragraphs in the third person perspective. It would be ideal if I could find a partner that can match this, but if you feel you can progress or develop the story or situation with less I\u2019d be up for giving it a go. For this ad I\u2019ll only be using Discord to roleplay as I find it to be quite convenient and easy to use. Finally, I live in the Pacific Time Zone and am mostly available in the late evening, generally after 8 PM is a safe bet.\n\nOk, now to the good part, what I\u2019m looking for! I have two plot ideas that revolve around playing OC mutant characters. While I do want both our characters to be original characters, I would like the roleplay itself to be set in Xavier\u2019s School for Gifted Youngsters. I prefer a mix of action, drama, and romance to be involved in the plots I roleplay. I am open to having NSFW scenes or themes involved, but not right away or as major themes or components of the roleplay. \n\n The first idea involves me playing a young male mutant that just so happened was captured at an early age and was manipulated and molded into becoming a villain. After a run in with the X-men or any other super-team, he would be apprehended and given a choice for a fresh start at life. Though this offer comes with stipulations such as mandatory therapy, education, and community service to be served at Xavier\u2019s School. I believe this premise opens a wide range of character types for any potential partner to play. If you need suggestions, I\u2019d be happy to provide more than a few for you.\n\nThe second idea is much more ambitious and would require both myself and any potential partner to play at least two characters total. I\u2019d like to create a small group of mutant students with a partner that would be trained to be a youthful extension of the X-men. (Think Generation X or New Mutants.) These new OC mutant students would all arrive at the school together and be trained and educated together. This idea would take some time to plan, coordinate, and write out once we were prepared. If this is something you\u2019re interested in, please understand that this will be quite a lengthy process and it may be some time before we even begin to roleplay.\n\nWell that about wraps up my ad, thanks for making it all the way through. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions feel free to leave me a private message.\n",

It seems to be a fashion statment among some of the town's members to wear a rather unique pendant, and this is even more popular with members of the local church. It's much like a normal cross, but the bottom extends into an arrow shape, and looks to be peircing a skull with vampire teeth and a pentagram on the forehead. When asked about what it means, anyone wearing it will usually say something about it being a fashon statment and look to change the subject.\n\nAsside from that minot quirk, life is nice down here, until one night in early December. A couple neighbors offered to give you a ride home from work, but took an odd detour into the woods away from town.\n\nThat's when things get weird, they all suddenly grab you and produce nasty looking knives, and......are those fangs they have?\n\nWhile the sight of their fangs becomes more and more clear, the knives close in and get ready to kill. But just as they're about to begin, a gunshot rings through the woods, popping the driver's head like a tomato in a drill press.\n\nThe knife weilders start to scramble as the squeel of tires can be heard, along with more gunshots and shouting. They leave the car, and start running, but not before they're all gunned down by several people in a silver hummer that drives up near you, with the same cross and skull mark pinted on the side.\n\nSeveral people who look geared to fight come out, while two stay in the truck. Most go over to the freshly shot corpses, while a large man in his mid twenties walks up to the car.\n\n\"They're gone, are you okay?\" He asks as he bends doen to open the door for you.\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nHey there, thanks for reading all that! I came up with this idea a while ago, and wondered if anyone else would enjoy it as well.\n\nIf it apeals to you at all, then feel free to hit me up on Discord and we can talk further.

            "selftext": "Good (early) morning, all. I can't sleep again and have been knocked on my butt by a really bad ear infection, so... Looking for partners again. \n\nObviously, I'm craving a good, strong Symphonia RP. I haven't had one in years, and I'm absolutely dying to end that streak, because this world has been my favorite place to let my mind live for over twelve years, and it's my port in the current storm of real life insanity. I still write my fanfictions, but it'd be nice to find another nerd who wants to write with me! \n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse.\n\n* Along similar lines, I'm not into those blue NSFW things. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories don't have gratuitous \"mature\" content, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think.\n\n* My character is Raine. I'm looking for a Regal to fulfill my OTP craving, and I'm more than willing to double as any canon of your choice in return. I would rather steer clear of OCs except as villains and side characters, until such a time comes in the story to warrant it (e.g. people have kids). \n\nI think that's everything? I hope that's everything, anyway.\n\nSo! If you're interested, I very much encourage you to PM me, so we can see if we mesh! Please note that I DO NOT respond to comment replies left here under any circumstances, so please use the PM function. ",

I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-400+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scenes don't have alot going on and therefore require less. However, I must stress the need for a good grasp of grammar, punctuation, etc. I like having long, thoughtful replies back where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm a big fan of romance and using face claims, and am looking for a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and writing as I am.\n\nI\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. Last but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, though I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to move the story along.\n\nWell these aren\u2019t really plot ideas, more like genres and pairings I love. Feel free to combine two or more and I\u2019m sure we can come up with something great!\n\nGenres:\n- anything mafia related\n- crimes in remote locations\n- small towns and supernatural happenings\n- rom-com inspired plots (the decoy bride, you\u2019ve got mail, while you were sleeping, practical magic)\n- post apocalyptic/dystopia\n- supernatural/modern fantasy (werewolf mates, monster x hunter)\n- southern/mid western gothic\n- murder mystery (small town or big city)\n- western inspired\n- modern/dark fairy tale retellings\n- sci-fi/cyberpunk\n- neo noir\n- disney personified\n- little coastal towns or little towns in the mountains\n- emotionally charged/dark and gritty\n- superpowers/gifted\n- unresolved sexual tension/slow burn\n- mythology (modern)\n\nPairings:\n- age gaps\n- friend x best friend\u2019s older sibling\n- enemies to lovers\n- cop x criminal\n- doctor x patient\n- friends turned lovers/pining\n- grumpy x sunshine\n- the broken man x the woman that becomes his light\n- fbi agents/cop partners\n- dark hearted man melting for the innocent woman\n- reunited old lovers and/or friends\n- boss x employee\n- neighbors\n- firefighter/cop x victim\n- mentor x mentee\n- spies\n- hitman x victim\n- hurt/comfort\n\nFandoms: (Will only do oc x oc/characters inspired by canon pairings with one exception)\n\nStar Wars, X Files, Haven, The Blacklist, Fringe, Zoo, Stranger Things, Heroes, Marvel, The Wolf Among Us, Harry Potter, (Marauders Era), The Walking Dead, GOT (Sansa x Sandor/Jamie x Brienne modern AU only), His Dark Materials, Mercy Thompson Series, Pacific Rim\n\nPM me if you're interested and I'd be more than happy to give you my email/discord if we click.

            "selftext": "\\*\\*Hey my fellow RPers!\\*\\*\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\\*\\*Posting Quality/Quantity\\*\\*\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n\\*\\*Short/Medium/Long\\-term\\*\\*\n\n I don't mind doing short and medium\\-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long\\-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium\\-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long\\-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n\\*\\*Platforms\\*\\*\n\n When it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n\\*\\*Posting Speed\\*\\*\n\n Personally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n\\*\\*Genres\\*\\*\n\n\\*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.\\*\n\n\\* High Fantasy\n\n\\* Low Fantasy \n\n\\* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. \\*\\*Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.\\*\\*)\n\n\\* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n\n\\* Post\\-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n\n\\* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n\n\\* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n\n\\* Sci\\-Fi\n\n\\* Horror\n\n\\* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n\n\\* Medieval/Pre\\-modern\n\n\\* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n\n\\* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n\\*As for a few I'm not for:\\*\n\n\\* Urban Fantasy\n\n\\* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n\\*\\*Fandoms\\*\\*\n\n This is just a list of some of the pre\\-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n\\* The Elder Scrolls\n\n\\* Warcraft\n\n\\* DC Universe\n\n\\* Marvel Universe\n\n\\* Assassin's Creed\n\n\\* Borderlands\n\n\\* Dishonored\n\n\\* The Maze Runner\n\n\\*\\*World Building\\*\\*\n\n I will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n\\*\\*The Conclusion\\*\\*\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n\n\\*\\*To previous users who know me!\\*\\*\n\nI currently lost all my discord chats and chat history, If we have an unfinished RP please message me and I can get back to you!",

            "selftext": "Hey there. As always, I'm looking for more partners for some great writing. Right now I'm mostly feeling my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts. (I also have the beginnings of a modern/paranormal setting inspired by the Skillet song, \"Lucy,\" if that interests anyone...)\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* Please, for the love of Cruxis, do not ask me what medium I want to use for RP. I use tags in my titles for a reason, and when people ask me questions that I've *obviously* already answered, it's a pretty big turn-off; it means, or at least looks like, you didn't bother to actually pay attention.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! (Please note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.)",

One of them is a deranged psychopath who kills the others one by one. With this I understand playing multiple well developed characters can be hard, but it would really add to the story if there was a lot of drama between the friends as well. I\u2019d prefer to play the killer, but I don\u2019t mind if you think you\u2019d be better. I\u2019m up for anything. \nI\u2019m not looking for novel long responses, but enough to keep the story moving! And please for the love of god, if you get bored once we begin tell me and we can see about coming up with something different, don\u2019t just ghost me. Pm me with your favorite horror movie as the subject and I\u2019ll semd you my discord tag. Then we can discuss further. Hope to hear from you all soon!",

I am a 21 year old male human, or at least I am pretty sure I am given mental and biological evidence and years of experience being so. \n\nI suppose I should put the fact I am going to bed soon and that I live in California out there so people know my time zone. \n\nBut, while I may be heading to bed soon I wanted to put this Roleplay idea here for who ever happens to find it and possible express their interest in it. I can do both first and third person and I enjoy detail.\n\nThe main theme around this is a Modern Fantast. A woman, your character, is either super natural or scientific-ish being (Be it alien, android, monster, ghost, or so on). But to the rest of the world (very similar to the one we actually live in) you keep up appearances as a normal human woman. But, through one way or another your character is found out by mine. Now I would have no interest in ratting you out or exposing you, rather I would be far more likely to want to study you and help you out. Oh, and if you possess some sort of power or gift that would be interesting to incorporate.\n\nI was hoping for some slice of life, maybe some romance, and if the romance goes well maybe some inter-species intimacy. Of course that last bit is easily take off the table if it is a deal breaker.\n\nAgain, I will be going to bed soon so I will nost likely reply to any messages I receive in the morning when I wake up. But, I will be unable to really Roleplay till the afternoon. I apologize for the inconvenience.",

I highly recommend seeing if it piques your interest!*\n\nFor as long as Conludia's 8 kingdoms have stood, the tradition of Guardianship has continued. As a powered human, devoting your life in service to your liege was considered the ultimate honour - or at least, that was tradition.\n\nNowadays, perceptions can vary from contempt to fear. It is no longer customary for every royal to appoint Guardians upon ascending the throne. That is, until a series of suspect Guardian disappearances was recently uncovered. In the wake of this revelation, that something could be taking out some of the most powerful individuals known to man, each kingdom has rushed to appoint more Guardians to allay their panic. \n\nBut will these new Guardians be any more successful than their predecessors? And what of the courts, who stop their plotting for no one?\n\n###HIGHLIGHTS\n* **Leave a legacy**: Brand new roleplay means that you get to shape the world and direction of the plot!\n* **Flexible &amp; Inclusive**: Play however you like. Want dice rolls? Only enjoy small threads? All (rule-abiding) styles are welcome, and the mod team would love to help facilitate your particular style.\n* **Literate roleplayers**: However, the RP is semi-literate, based off quality standards not word minimums\n* **Beginner-friendly**: As admin, I want to make it simple for anyone to join and have fun! There are [clear guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/royalguardianrp/wiki/beginners_guide) and you can take as long or as little as you like when it comes to character creation or plotting. Want to jump right in? Both pre-made and original characters are available! Check out [our wanted characters here](https://www.reddit.com/r/royalguardianrp/wiki/wanted)\n\n###MORE INFO\n* Not an 18+ roleplay; mature subject matter (explicit sexual content, detailed gore) must be marked NSFW\n* Application must be accepted prior to role-playing\n* Private threads and plotting is encouraged to increase intrigue\n* [OOC sub](/r/royalguardianooc) used to help structure the RP, make suggestions\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/ap57AqY) for quickplay and to shoot the breeze\n* **[Looking for staff!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyalGuardianOOC/comments/8lpjh3/helping_hands_wanted_staff_search/)**\n\nSince we have newly revived the roleplay, now is the perfect time to jump into /r/RoyalGuardianRP and make your mark on both Conludia and its meta!\n\n&gt; ##go forth and become legend.",

            "selftext": "Well, first things first, some of these I want to do more than others, people asking about those ones will get priority. Most of them are based around my original characters, but some of them I'd like to play against canon people and the others are up for debate. If I'm going to do romance it'll only be F//. Going to Discord would be preferable to me over staying here on Reddit. As the title says, I don't care whether you're actually a guy or not, just be willing and able to play a female character and we'll be fine. Now onto the prompts.\n\nModern day - Another morning in this run down old apartment that Cecil, or as her fans come to know her, Chrystal, finds herself waking up in. She slowly stands from the single mattress on the floor and makes her to the cramped bathroom across the small, messy room she calls an apartment. She looks herself in the mirror, finding that she's only wearing her underwear, and brushes out her light blue hair. Once she's cleaned herself up a little bit, she hears the one she shares the apartment with stirring and looks over at her much less feminine lover starting to wake up. \"About time, you're supposed to wake up first.\"\n\n*This one has my DJ and her punk girlfriend living together and trying to make ends meet. They make enough to get by, but only because their bills are so cheap. If anyone is interested, I'll go further in depth in private.*\n\nMarvel - The Avengers, the Defenders, the Fantastic four, S.H.I.E.L.D., and most of the other teams protecting the other we're doing fairly good jobs, as a team. But what about the solo heroes and anti heroes working in the shadows? Well, no one seems to care about them in the grand scheme of things. With so many Spider people running around now, the new ones really need to do their own things to stand out among the rest. Well, how about one that has no problem killing people? That seems to be the case when a small group of about three gang members were found hung by webbing from separate streetlights come one morning. The Defenders are appalled, except the Punisher, of course. People are quick to blame Spider-Man, but he never did it. Even S.H.I.E.L.D. seems baffled. But the real mystery lies in the webbing. Upon further inspection, this web appears to be he strongest out of any Spider person currently running around.\n\n*Pretty obvious. I have a Spider Woman, I want to play as her against really anyone, she's an anti hero. The Avengers may not like her, S.H.I.E.L.D. certainly doesn't, but the villains know that when they ever see her, they need to run.*\n\nSteven Universe - On Homeworld, the war against the rebellion is common knowledge. Gems are mass produced to wage this war against only a handful of gems that seemingly stand no chance. But the outcome drastically changed with one order directly from the Diamonds. They sent in one of their best secret service gems to wipe out the last of the resistance on the battlefield, the last thing they expected was exactly what happened.\n\nThe gem weaved her way through the battlefield, taking out any rebels that were unfortunate enough to get close to her. Not even limited to her own weapons, she would grab anything or simply use her hands and feet to destroy them, but once she saw Rose Quartz, her entire demeanor changed. She went from working to destroy the rebels to working towards their freedom. And when the time came for her to either guarantee their freedom or risk all of them going down together, she destroyed the warp pad behind Rose Quartz beyond repair. When she was finally detained, they put her away in a maximum security prison.\n\n*So, same character as before. I have a ton of gems, my main thing here is using Onyx. I'll listen to most any idea that people will pitch for this. My only deal breaker would be no gems.*\n\nPirates - Tales of the legendary Tide's Fury move about port towns and open waters like wildfire. The captain is the most fearless man ever to set sail. Not only has he fought the likes of the Royal Navy's finest, he's had many a run in with trading companies the world over. He speaks seven languages, has bedded women in every city the world over and several more on unmarked waters or territories. Undefeated on calm and stormy waters alike, he invites challenge and always takes one man from every ship he runs across to work for him.\n\nThese tales go around the bar as if casual conversation. Men sober and drunk weaving tales of this legendary captain and his magnificent ship, faster than the winds themselves and strong enough to sail on land. Though obviously some of these are more fiction than fact, but they never cease to amaze. The entire bar goes dead silent when one man stands up on his table and declares to all the denizens, \"The captain of the Tide's Fury is a woman!\"\n\n*My idea here is that my character is the captain of the Tide's Fury and the adventures of the crew. Maybe your character is a sailor onboard or a pirate with aspirations of greatness, or maybe just someone who gets picked up on the way.*\n\nDystopia - The entire human race works nine to five white collar jobs to make enough money to pay their bills and support their families. No more, no less. No adventure, no excitement. Near everything has been outlawed, and everyone is required to wear uniforms that make them look professional day and night. They look good, sure, but the button down shirt and tie or the dress and heels get old fast. New offices are built up instead of out, some skyscrapers reaching floors in the hundreds. \n\nOne particular worker lets out a sigh of boredom and looks out the window to the right of their cubicle, such a vied after position in the floor. Second only to corner offices with glass walls. Suddenly, across the gap between buildings, a woman with extremely baggy pants and a black tube top goes sprinting, not jogging which is the agreed upon version of public exercise, but sprinting as fast as she can. Her movements over vents, down stairs and slopes, over fences and anything else on the roof are the definition of fluid and graceful. And the guards chasing her have no hope of catching her.\n\n*This one involves your character leaving her boring office life to come live freely with mine. It won't be glamorous, but the rush from breaking the agreed upon laws of so many years is so worth it.*\n\nTreasure hunter - The life of a treasure hunter is the very definition of \"high risk, high reward\". If it's not, they're doing something wrong. That's the way Isabella Lafayette looks at her line of work. She's helped many an explorer or archeologist alike to discover grand and exciting things, to them anyway. She has a remarkable knowledge of global geography, among other more helpful things in the field. She's made several friends and vastly more enemies in her life than she even knows, but all for the right reasons.\n\n*So here I'm looking for either a bright eyed explorer who hires Isabella to lead an expedition for so sing they think will put them on the map, but all the information they have is speculation. Or another seasoned explorer who hates Isabella and tries to kill her, Uncharted style, but they eventually get to talking things out when they're both stranded and, well...*",

            "selftext": "Well hi there!\n\nI'm looking for a creative writer who is interested in playing Ralph (from the movie Wreck it Ralph) so I can ping my OC off of him! I'll settle for a similar character (a big beefy big brother/uncle type), if you think you have one that fits the archetype. Other examples include Hunk from Voltron, Maui from Moana, and Long John from Treasure Planet. \n\nI can promise story driven Rp, a reactive character and decent writing. My character is a regular girl just into her twenties. She's a living, breathing person who figured out how to get into the digital world- and she's been sort of solo adventuring there. Who wouldn't? She's been on a scavenger hunt looking for 80s era trinkets that a previous human left scattered around the games. She's got plenty of reasons to bump into Ralph. And she'd sure like to know what happened to the last person that tripped into the digital world.\n\nThat's just an idea, I'm open to winging it and seeing what happens.\n\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n* Specifically RALPH. I would consider other characters from the setting, or original characters like Ralph, but I'm looking for the big guy himself.\n* 18+ players only. Sorry y'all ;;, nothin' against the younger folks. I'm just old.\n* Someone with maximum chill OOC, who can take no for an answer.\n* Real time rp (fast turn around). Though I'll consider slow posts if we get to real time once in a while.\n* Discord Rp! I only play there.\n* Para RP. At least one paragraph per post, though I'm more interested in quality over quantity.\n\n\n**What I'm NOT looking for:**\n\n* I'm not looking for romance. I just want to do some story driven Rp with a big beefy uncle type and my spunky lady. This will be a safe for work Rp.\n* Nothing too dark and gritty. A little drama is fun, but I like humor and a happy ending.\n\n\nIf you've read all that and still think you're a match, give me a holler. If I feel like we're a fit we'll try something spontaneous and non-committal. I've been Rping for a long time, and I know what I want. I don't like to leave folks hanging, so I tend to give straight no answers if I'm not interested! \n\n-------\n**Here's a sample of my writing, to give you an idea of what to expect!**\n-------\n\nEaster Sunday seemed like a good time to jump the cemetery fence and sneak around with a cheap tape recorder. It was harmless. The most minor of misdemeanors, and she'd missed her chance on Halloween.\n\n  Jacky was ghost hunting, and by that, this writer means to say she was talking into a cassette and playing it back, asking the least scientific questions she could think of. Most of which weren't questions at all.\n  She figured, finding a ghost had to be like getting someone to look at a forum post. If you didn't make the topic interesting, they weren't gonna bother.\n\n  \"I know a lot of dead cats, but I never met a dead person.\" She tipped the recorder away from her mouth, toward the empty, dusty space around her. She was in the bell tower. It was tall, medieval looking and full of urns and marble bricks. It looked like the kind of place a spirit would hang out.\n\n  \"I know this guy. He's seven feet tall and full of yarn.\" This time, she didn't tip the recorder out. She paused and kept going, in a low, low whisper. \"I kinda like him, but he's a moron. And if I dated him I'd have like thirteen mother-in-laws.\"\n\n  Still nothing. \n  She guessed relationship drama wasn't the bait she was looking for.\n\n  She tried again.\n  \"Do you like 80s punk rock?\"",

I am 21, from NY, and have been rp\\-ing for about ten years now. I look for partners who are willing to build stories and create long lasting relationships. I am really only looking for fandom stories at the moment! \n\nI RP mostly through Discord \\( Darth Millicent #3852 \\) or on RPnation as Darth Millicent, but am open to Emails and PMs as well!\n\nRules :\n\n\u2764 Partners must be 18\\+, I'm 21 so no minors! Sorry!\n\n\u2764 Must be able to reply at least a few times each week. I don't need you to tell me your schedule or when you're going somewhere, but just need you to be able to commit to the movement of the story.\n\n\u2764 Must be literate! I don't need every reply to have multiple paragraphs \\(not that I don't love it\\) but I do expect correct grammar and at least 5\\+ sentences.\n\n\u2764 Must be nice! We don't have to be friends, but I am chatty soo...\n\n\u2764If we are going to be doing a Fandom story, please be upfront in telling me how complete your knowledge is of the subject. I like to be sort of detail oriented.\n\n\u2764 Off the bat, I don't play straight guys in romantic situations. The only time I will play a straight guy is if the character is fully needed, or romance isn't involved. Every time I try to play one, they turn into a jerk.\n\n\u2764 Playing more than one character is fine. I will also double up if you want me to play a certain character, as long as I think I can play them.\n\n\u2764 I love romance. I just do, I'm sappy like that. This being said, I don't like stories where they just automatically are in love. This has a few exceptions, but most likely won't happen unless the story idea is really good.\n\n\u2764 I like to add real life themes into my stories. This is one, because I like drama, and two, because perfect stories in perfect worlds are no fun.\n\n\u2764 My only triggers are only triggers when portrayed incorrectly. These are mental health issues, invisible diseases, and suicide. I will call you out on these things and stop the story if they are misrepresented. This is because incorrect portrayal of these things is something I have to deal with on a daily basis. I call people out in real life too. Constantly.\n\n\u2764 Speaking of the above point, I do get sick quite often. This is just more of a heads up.\n\nFandoms :\n\n\\(My characters will be italicized.\\)\n\n\\(Asterix by stories I'm craving.\\)\n\n\u2764 Star Wars\n\n\\- *OC* x OC \\*\n\n\\- *OC* x Poe \\*\n\n\\- *OC* x Hux\n\n\\- *OC* x Kylo\n\n\\- *OC*\u00a0x Anakin\n\n\\-\u00a0*Hux* x Kylo\n\n\\- *Rey*\u00a0x Kylo\n\n\\- *Jyn* x Cassian \\*\n\n\\- *Finn* x Poe\n\n\\- *Padme* x Anakin\n\n\u2764 Star Trek\\*\n\n\\- *OC* x OC\n\n\\- *OC* x Jim\n\n\\- *OC* x Bones\n\n\\- *OC* x Scotty\n\n\u2764 Harry Potter\n\n\\- *OC* x OC\n\n\\- *OC* x Newt\n\n\\- Remus X *Sirius*\\*\n\n\\- *Queenie* X Jacob\n\n\u2764 Marvel\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\- *OC* x OC\n\n\\- *OC* x Hawkeye \\(Clint or Kate\\)\n\n\\- *Hawkeye \\(Kate\\)* x OC\n\n\\- *OC*\u00a0x Doctor Strange\n\n\\- *OC* x Bucky Barnes\n\n\\- *OC* x Charles Xavier\n\n\\- *OC* x Hank McCoy\n\n\\-\u00a0*Spider\\-Man* x Deadpool\n\n\\- *OC* x Daredevil \\(Comics\\)\n\n\u2764 DC\n\nMostly just looking for BatFam stories.\n\n*OC* x Jason Todd\n\n\u2764Others\n\n\\- *Roxas* x Axel \\(KH\\)\n\nI've got some plots, but I'm also always open to just plotting together!

            "selftext": "**Edit: most people seem to feel sceptical about the \"varying genders and orientations\" and \"multiple characters\" restrictions below. If that's the only thing you don't like, please contact me regardless. We can work something out, and maybe I need to adjust my criteria a bit. :)**\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

            "selftext": "Good afternoon, all. Thanks for the click. Hopefully, it'll be worth your time.\n\nObviously, I'm craving a good, strong Voyager RP. It was one of the first things I ever did RP for when I was a kid, and it's been the love of my life since I was seven years old (take my word for it - that's a long time; it hadn't even finished airing yet), and oh, I want to write for it again.\n\nI'm only interested in Voyager; I have no desire to explore any other Treks, even in crossover fashion. We can either set this during their time meandering around the Delta Quadrant, or we could explore the happenings directly after they get home - or we could even do something twenty or so years later. I'm completely down for anything, so long as I get to play with the world and characters of the show that's been one of my favorites since I was in second grade. \n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am a professional proofreader. I'm nitpicky for a living, and it's ruined me for being a nice person. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I'm not into those blue NSFW things. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories don't have gratuitous \"mature\" content, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think.\n\n* Despite the above, I still prefer to write with other adults. I'm not comfortable with anyone under 18. There are lines, and I'm not interested in accidentally crossing any of them.\n\n* For anything set in the Delta Quadrant or directly following \"End Game,\" I will be playing Kathryn Janeway. I would very much like you to at least double as Chakotay for me (I do not support the C/7 pairing and will only accept J/C). In return, I can and will double as any canon of your choice. OCs are all right with me. Conversely, as mentioned above, I'm open to something about twenty years later - in that case, I'll be playing my own OC, J/C's spitfire, contrary rebel of a daughter.\n\n...I think that's enough word vomit.\n\nSo! If you're interested, I very much encourage you to PM me, so we can see if we mesh! Please note that I DO NOT respond to comment replies left here under any circumstances, so please use the PM function. \n\nThank you!\n\n~Kisa",

I play Levi Ackerman, and I'm most interested in finding an Erwin, although I'd be alright with Eren.\n\nDespite the super lazy post, I actually tend to post about three healthy paragraphs and have a bad habit of  breaking the Discord character limit. I've got a bio with writing samples and stuff if you wanna see it. Message me if you want the link or if you wanna get my Discord info. Here's a few final, helpful details:\n\n* It's Attack on Titan. Mature themes are pretty much impossible to get away from. Please be at least 18\\+, though 21\\+ is preferred. NSFW elements not required, but I'll certainly entertain you if that's your thing.\n* Be literate and capable of spelling and punctuating. Please. Seriously.\n* I don't really care what you identify as OOC, but please let me know if there's anything that I need to do (or avoid doing) to keep from upsetting you.\n* You don't have to have read the manga, but it would be nice if you've seen at least season 1.\n\nIn closing, no, I do not want to play with your OC. This is a canon/canon only RP request. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI\u2019m a straight female who loves a great MxM romance rp. I'm an experienced RPer and I'm open to almost any kind of plot as long as it's a good one! ;).\n\nI write in the 3rd person and hold my own in terms of length I'm typically flexible with my partner and will mirror what I get. Although I am flexible I hope that you can contribute to plot building and offer me more than one\\-liners as it's exhausting doing all the work myself!\n\n*If you love kpop you will become my new best friend!*\n\nBelow are some plots I'm very interested in playing out: *\\[MC= My Character YC= Your Character C1= Character 1 C2 = Character 2\\]*  \n\n\n**Open Up {Teacher x Student, Modern Day, Slice of Life, Forbidden Romance}**\n\nMC hates showing up to class and refuses to participate in most classes, he is very close to being kicked out of school but he doesn\u2019t really care. He comes from a family with a very strict Father who likes to take his anger out on his Son when he doesn\u2019t perform. MC doesn\u2019t mind as he thinks its a way of protecting his Mom so he often acts out in order to take the heat. YC is a hard ass teacher who has little patience for students, especially for the ones that don\u2019t give a shit about their future. YC isn\u2019t the model teacher by far and he is often given duty in detention. He takes special interest in MC because he is one of the only students that won\u2019t give into his aggressive tactics. Eventually YC finds himself lusting after MC and even though MC isn\u2019t for it at first (because he thinks he has no interest in men) he eventually gives in. Things get complicated when YC finds out more about MC\u2019s home life. Will their relationship be nothing more than a release from their current lives?\n\n**More Than That {Brothers, Modern Day, Slice of Life, Forbidden Romance}**\n\nMC is the younger brother who is more insecure and shy while YC the older brother has always been the more social and athletic one. MC has always looked up to YC and has grown to love him more than just a brother as he grew older, he feels tormented with his feelings as he knows they are wrong but as they age together it\u2019s hard to hide his attraction more and more. YC always protected MC and stood up for him when it came to anything serious but at home he likes to constantly teases him and play fights. YC has no clue of MC\u2019s true affections for him and has no idea of his sexuality. When one day MC is discovered hooking up with a guy at school YC becomes intrigued based on what he saw. Both characters are confused by their feelings and try to ignore them but when they live in such close quarters and have a tight relationship it becomes overly difficult. \n\n(this can also work as twins)",

If that\u2019s not something that interests you, but you still have an idea set in this world or with these characters, feel free to PM me or comment!! I really just want to try my hand at playing Jane Banner to get more practice playing more realistic characters. Plus, I love Elizabeth Olsen so I\u2019m always excited to try out her characters. XD \n\nInfo about me: \n- I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+\n- I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply\n- I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out \n- I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does \n- I would prefer literate partners\n\nPlease PM or comment if you\u2019re at all interested",
