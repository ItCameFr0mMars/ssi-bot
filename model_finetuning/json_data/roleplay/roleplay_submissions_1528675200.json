            "selftext": "Hello, you! I'm looking for roleplays that focus on being long-term and story-driven. Adventure, intrigue, mystery, even politics/socioeconomics and such related things are all enjoyed! Slice of life is fine -- downtime is inevitable, and is often very enjoyable! I just don't want a roleplay to be *all* about slice of life.\n\nI'm no stranger to romance or NSFW content, but the key thing here is story-driven. I'm happy to discuss how to do lewd things and make sure we're compatible, but in terms of what's actually written in-character it's probably gonna be pretty heavy on the story! Though, I'll be blunt -- I generally only do straight pairings and I prefer to play guys. I'll also note that I'm *mostly* vanilla, with some outliers, but overall I prefer to write touchy-feely 'lewd' stuff over outright smut! Most of the time. I have my moments. I can also write some pretty dark stuff, but that's largely for story purposes over lewd ones.\n\nI enjoy quite a bit setting-wise, pre-existing or homebrew! I have knowledge of a lot of canon ones, either to steal elements from, or to use as-is. Just ask after any that interest you. More picky on canon *characters,* though. I enjoy plenty of original settings and love the brainstorming involved, too! The various forms of fantasy, be they medieval, modern, victorian or elsewise. Steampunk, cyberpunk, sci-fi be it space-faring or planetary, space opera, only twenty-minutes-into-the-future, et cetera. Even sci-fantasy sorta stuff! Regardless of time period or nature of the setting, there's stuff around that can't be found in real life. It's a pretty wide range of things to cover, and too many options *can* be a bad thing. Restriction breeds creativity and all. I do tend to do 'standard fantasy' stuff most often, but certainly not limited to just that! Just expect most of my own ideas to have a bit of swords n' sorcery elements to them.\n\nI feel the whole 'be literate, able to write well in English, yada yada' goes without saying. I'm assuming some minimum level of capability, able to tell between \"your\" and \"you're\". \"they're\", \"their\", and \"there\". That kinda stuff. Typos? Everyone makes mistakes. Stylistic rule-bending? I do it plenty. Just realize the language is as important as the story it's trying to tell. I don't have a hard post size requirement, just write what feels best, but some quantity is nice to go along with the quality every now and again. Beyond that, I'm hoping to find a partner that doesn't mind taking up a GM role. A narrator or storyteller of sorts, if not without their own characters. I recognize it is asking for much. I'd like to mention I'm still quite happy to assist in worldbuilding, brainstorming plot/character ideas, and playing side-characters of my own -- I've done my own fair share of running games. I hope to alleviate concerns it'll be skewed too far. I'm not entirely certain what incentives I could offer, but hopefully I've at least got you interested. Additionally, I'm on the look out for someone who wouldn't mind running something for two to make a small group RP.\n\nBit of a vague ad, I don't have anything truly *specific* in mind that I'm *dying* to do right now. Don't expect me to sit around and nod my head dumbly, though! I've got ideas and characters ready to use of my own, and I'm not afraid to throw things at the wall until something sticks if we wanna do something completely original. Everyone has their dry periods, true, yet I don't intend to be dead weight. PM me and feel free to ask any questions you might have!",

Slice of life or another genre, I'm open to suggestions. Disability can be a plot device or merely a character trait. Feel free to PM me, anytime.\n\nJust a few potential ideas.

A new neighbor is moving in. She catches your attention, even before you see her wheelchair.\n\n2. You've been going to the same coffee shop everyday for over a year, mostly to see the cute barista, then she is suddenly gone for several months, when she finally returns, it's easy to see why, but now you want to know her even more.\n\n3. You have been trying to get the attention of a girl on the train, every morning, but she seems to ignore you. Why have you never noticed the white cane before.\n\n4. That girl at the gym always caught your eye, not just because she was attractive, or that she was an amputee.  you recognized her from somewhere, then one night a flash back to Iraq, jogs your memory. She saved your life.\n\n5. Your marriage was good, or so you thought. After catching your wife in your bed with two men, you leave, only to take solace in a local bar. The bartender gives you advice that changes your life. ( This one has several options for who my character is.)\n\n6. Almost anything else. I'm always open to ideas, and by no means stuck to one. Fantasy, sci-fi, historical, post apocolyptic stories always have a place, just no ideas yet. I prefer to over IM, email, Kik, or chatzy, but am open to others like discord.

I sortof half-assed a prompt before, but I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do with it.\n\nTo explain it properly, I would like to do a roleplay in an AU of Silent Hill 3, where [Claudia](http://i988.photobucket.com/albums/af1/gviruskisses/Silent%20Hill/Claudia/j060110.jpg) serves as an ally to [Heather](https://pre00.deviantart.net/b7c6/th/pre/i/2015/104/3/1/heather_mason___silent_hill_3_by_jeyjeymalkavian-d8gtdtw.png), instead of her main antagonist. I imagined we could swap around the roles of a few characters, primarily Leonard Wolf, who could serve as the antagonist in place of Claudia, and we could make a little divergent storyline from that.\n\nI feel like there is a lot of room for a good story, in addition to smut. Claudia was the[ best, and only,](https://i56.photobucket.com/albums/g195/ru_silenthill/fanart/Heather_ClaudiaBW.jpg) friend of Alessa, in her childhood, now Heather is technically the reborn form of her friend. Alessa\u2019s sainthood, Leonard\u2019s abusive parenting in comparison to Harry Mason\u2019s loving care, and the simple dissonance of the Ascetic Claudia to the normal, modernised Heather. \n\nWe could make modifications to the plot, the pacing, and so on, to fit what we would like to do. I\u2019m very open to discussion, and I 100% understand how niche my wanting is.\n\nHope to hear from you, I have plenty of ideas, so don\u2019t be intimidated by theorycrafting!",

            "selftext": "Hello fellow writers! Thank you for taking the time to peruse my post. I thought I would begin by giving a small introduction. I am on GMT (timezone) and am in my mid twenties. I tend to respond daily and sometimes a few times during the day, depending on how busy I am in real life. I have been roleplaying for the past twelve or so years across a variety of platforms. In the most recent years I have drifted away from the classic \"words on paper\" full imagination experience that roleplay is often associated with, and instead have been roleplaying over video games in digital spaces. While this has been a fun experience for me, having a world to interact with and such, I find myself pining for the traditional method and getting the chance to create something wholly from scratch. I'm looking for a partner who has a serious interest in developing characters, world(s) and writing collaboratively for a long amount a time. In a perfect world, I would love to write a novel with someone else (\u00e0 la Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis) but would happily settle for a story we are both proud of. If any of the above resonates with you then please read on for a few more details!\n\n**Writing Style/Genres:**\n\nI am primarily a fantasy writer. I enjoy creating my own worlds and incorporating numerous races and cultures to flesh out the landscape my characters are living in. This can lend itself to more sci-fi elements but I think many would classify my style as fantasy to high fantasy of a medieval-industrial revolution era. On average I tend to write a healthy amount of five to six paragraphs, of course this number fluctuates depending on circumstances. For instance, if it's a heavy dialogue scene then I may write less to create a better conversational flow. On the other hand, if I am writing from the perspective of a few characters then I may choose to write a bit more in order to properly flesh out their experience. I always aim to write what I would find enjoyable to read, often times I find that less is more in this regards, still.. who doesn't love a meaty portion of prose now and then?\n\n**Collaboration:**\n\nIn my experience, to properly \"worldbuild\" you need a good amount of time communicating and planning before any writing is done. Generally, I like to discuss the world our characters will be inhabiting. What is the weather like on this world, how many continents does this world have, what of fauna and flora and how does this interact with the terrain/weather, etc.? I'm a visual person, so I tend to do some preliminary sketches in this stage and use those as a bases for our joint understanding. On top of developing and creating our world, I think it is equally important to develop and create characters and understand their basic drives. I would have a preference for outlining some plot points as writing goals to work towards, but if we can at least understand our characters drives and motivations then I can agree that anchored plot points aren't as necessary. \n\nAs a separate point, I also enjoy continued conversation and planning throughout the writing process. So even though the initial worldbuilding may be complete I always welcome continued discussions. Even if it's just to drop in and check how each of us is doing in the real world!\n\n**Writing Platforms:**\n\nFor all planning (worldbuiling, character development, etc.) I prefer to do this over Discord as instant messaging really lends itself to the creative flow and process. I find exchanging e-mails or updating shared documents can really draw out an already lengthy process. For the actual writing, I prefer google documents but can be persuaded onto e-mails. I won't write over reddit PMs or IM services. \n\n\"**Limits\":**\n\nLimits, boundaries, \"no-go areas\" in writing are something that is personal to each writer. Personally, I do not have any interest in writing graphic sex scenes or producing a story that centers around sex and romance. That is not to say that these do not have a place in my writing, but they will never be the focus. Likewise, extreme gore without proper justification will be a sticking point for me. Themes around violence, abuse, mental health, etc. are welcomed in the appropriate context. \n\n**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 \\[ideally over 21\\].** As I am in my mid twenties I prefer to write and collaborate with people of a similar life experience (at least in terms of age). I also feel this opens the story to a variety of themes which I would otherwise feel uncomfortable pursuing with a younger writer. \n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.** I want to work alongside another writer as a true partner, as such, anyone interested in writing alongside me must be open to communication and collaboration. As I stated above, I'm also open for our conversations to be unrelated to our writing process. I don't have an issue with building a friendship with my partner and in fact would encourage this as I feel it enriches the writing process. \n* **Mutual respect.** We all have busy lives away from the computer and we all varying degrees of openness. I will strive to appreciate if you are unable to reply every day or are only able to reply once a week. I will be understanding if you do not feel comfortable discussing anything but our writing. Likewise, I ask any future partner to appreciate if I am unable to reply as quickly as we would both like, or if I would rather not discuss certain aspects of my personal life. \n\nIf this post has captured your attention or resonated with you in some way, then please, contact me! I would love to hear from you and know a bit about your writing background and aspirations. You can PM here on reddit to recieve my discord information so we can embark on our writing adventure!\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you!\n\n(with thanks to /u/[ZenGuruji](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZenGuruji) for this amazing ad template that I have adopted)",

If you\u2019re not able to play and enjoy any of these themes, then we\u2019re not compatible. Sorry.\n\nThe Enigma program is a secret project of the military that is based in the state of Washington. It takes very young orphans, bringing them into the program and exposing them to man created viruses that gives them abilities based off of what the virus was created with. The ultimate goal of the Enigma program? You tell me what an enemy combatant would be able to do if they saw a soldier single handedly take down a tank with his bare hands, or drop a building on their head with a thought. Exactly. They\u2019re creating super soldiers for the future, training them and sending them on small missions when they\u2019re ready. Recently though, they\u2019ve had resistance from orphanages, not being able to adopt at the pace they needed to, so they have started taking to the streets, offering troubled kids and teens a chance at a better life, then infect them with the virus, and give them a crash course before sticking them into the program. Who wouldn\u2019t take it?\n\nLance Truesdale was one of the first trainees in the program, adopted from an orphanage after his mother died from childbirth complications, causing his father to leave him at an orphanage and kill himself. At least that\u2019s what he had been told. Being one of the first, by now he has risen in rank and was appointed captain of a squad of 4. Becoming a Captain came with a cost though. Who wants to be friends with an authority figure that is required to report any out of line behavior and give them work detail? Lance told himself that it would be better for the future, but he was a lot more upset than he let himself know. He had just woken up at 8:00 like every weekday when he was told he\u2019d be getting a 5th member for Athena Squad. He sighed as he got up from his cot, grabbing his towel and heading to the gender divided bathrooms and showers. Thirty minutes later, he was in the navy blue jumpsuit with the Enigma insignia on the sleeve, waiting for the new trainee at the front of the barracks with his hands behind his back. \n\nThis Longterm RP will include action, romance, drama, and all of the above. I\u2019ll have a character sheet written up that you can fill out once we get to it. One thing I will say, is that I\u2019d like to make the story interesting by having your character have some sort of physical deformity like scars or burns. Of course it\u2019s completely optional, but tell me if you\u2019re interested.\n\nThanks for reading! If you\u2019re interested, please message me on reddit.\n\n",

            "selftext": "\\*\\*Hey my fellow RPers!\\*\\*\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n\\*\\*Posting Quality/Quantity\\*\\*\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n\\*\\*Short/Medium/Long\\-term\\*\\*\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium\\-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long\\-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium\\-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long\\-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n\\*\\*Platforms\\*\\*\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n\\*\\*Posting Speed\\*\\*\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n\\*\\*Genres\\*\\*\n\n\\*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.\\*\n\n\\* High Fantasy\n\n\\* Low Fantasy\n\n\\* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. \\*\\*Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives.

I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n\\*\\*Fandoms\\*\\*\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre\\-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n\\* The Elder Scrolls\n\n\\* Warcraft\n\n\\* DC Universe\n\n\\* Marvel Universe\n\n\\* Assassin's Creed\n\n\\* Borderlands\n\n\\* Dishonored\n\n\\* The Maze Runner\n\n\\*\\*World Building\\*\\*\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n\\*\\*The Conclusion\\*\\*\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n\n\\*\\*To previous users who know me!\\*\\*\n\nI currently lost all my discord chats and chat history, If we have an unfinished RP please message me and I can get back to you!",

I'm rather new to the roleplay reddit so please go easy on me.\n\nWhat I'm looking for a the moment is something more long-term and in third person. I'm not too picky about length but at least a paragraph to a couple of paragraphs is preferred. I'm a romance sucker as well, but it's not required by any means. That being said, I do like when it's rather organic and not immediate. \n\nAs for genres, a lot of what I'm interested in is fandom-based, but with our own OC characters. This includes;\nPersona 5\nBoku no Hero Academia\nRWBY\nMiraculous Ladybug (This would be the only one I'm willing to do either canon or ocs with)\n\nI had a few other ideas in mind as well that weren't fandom-based: \n\nOne is a rather generic arranged marriage plot between the royalty of two fighting nations as means of a peace treaty. \n\nThe second was a more modern world where everyone is born seeing black and white until they meet their soul mate, then their world floods with color. The only problem is that our two characters get off on the wrong foot. \n\nIf interested in anything feel free to message me! ^^",

I was thinking what if the next Avatar ended up being born as two twins (male and female or two females I suppose). I would take one role and have two elements and my partner would have the other twin (male or female) with the other two elements. We would then depict their live. I'm thinking maybe they're separated so they can focus on training for their respective elements. I would love to see maybe the fire nation and earth nation get a hold of each one but that is a cliche conflict so we could try two different oppositions using the twin Avatars against the other (like Fire Emblem Fates almost). \n\nI would also love for us to play another character for the other's love interest. So in total we'd have two Avatars and two friends or protectors to the Avatar who end up clashing with the other Avatar/side. I would love someone who is comfortable playing multiple roles and sharing side roles with me. I want a few posts a week and probably anywhere from three to four paragraphs per major role we have. I would like romance to be an option because I think just friendship or family can be a little dry, content/plot wise.\n\nIf any of this makes sense or intrigues you, let me know. I'd prefer to write over discord or maybe reddit...maybe make our own subreddit? ",

            "selftext": "Hello, Internet! It has been a while and I do not feel like wasting time with excessive words, so let's get right to it! I am looking for a Life is Strange RP where I play as Max paired up with Chloe. I will play side characters to help with the story and the plot, but I will not budge at all on this. I only play Maxine, and I am looking for the perfect Chloe Price. \u2764\n\nI do have some ground rules I wanna cover, so let's go over the MUST HAVES of what you need if you'd like to RP with me on this.\n\n1. Descriptive and frequent poster. I get that life gets in the way, but if I'm waiting days for a reply, then it's going too slow to be interesting.\n\n2. Discord. I only play over Discord. MAYBE PMs if you really convince me. But you can message me if you're interested and we'll go to Discord from there. But Discord is an amazing and underused RP tool, I promise! \n\n3. Must enjoy story and plot. Nothing ruins a game faster than sex after sex after sex. Story over Smut, please! \n\n4. Speaking of hella gay sex, you must be OK with NSFW themes. This goes with sex, suicide, murder and all of the darker, more adult themes that surround the video game. I'll never go too far with it; after all, it's there to enhance the experience and not be gratuitous. \n\n5. You MUST, MUST, MUST be able to capture the spirit of the game and at least play half of the characters with me. This game should be about both of us, but an RP where all we do is RP as Chloe and Max sitting around and being cute isn't any fun. I want to go on an adventure, and that means we gotta write the side characters like Victoria, Jefferson, Warren and all the rest out, too! But I'll always do my part to play at least half of them. \n\nThat's about it! Now let's get to the fun part! Wowsers. :)\n\n\nI'm fine with setting the RP during or after the events of the game. I would like to AVOID the \"Sacrifice Arcadia Bay\" ending, please. I feel like it's out of character for both of them to just accept that they basically murdered their family and friends and to live on like nothing ever happened. If we were to set it after the game, I'd rather it be in an alternate reality where the storm never happened and we can go from there. Jefferson and Sean will be gone, but there will be new adventures and conflicts and trouble to get in to. We just gotta be creative!\n\nA few possibilities...\n\n- Max and Chloe survive the game and avoid the storm. A year later, Max is attending college, and Chloe works... wherever a punk like her would. They share an apartment and the story would probably start off with something ominous happening that'll kickstart a brand new adventure for the both of them. Something to do with Nathan's father, maybe?\n\n- Max chooses to sacrifice Chloe. When Nathan shoots her, he fails to kill her and is arrested. Because Chloe learned her lesson from the butterfly and is no longer selfish, the universe / butterfly decides that she can be spared and that Chloe doesn't have to die after all. A month later, Chloe recovers from a coma and wakes up in a hospital bed with Max sleeping in a chair by her side and the butterfly on the window sill. Thanks to the butterfly, Chloe has remembered everything that transpired throughout the game during her coma, and wakes up with the memories she and Max shared during Life is Strange, despite them technically never happening in the current timeline. \n\n- We set it during the game, but with a twist. We will still follow the basic structure of the game, but instead of speaking Max and Chloe's lines word for word, we'll improv and add some of our own, extra, non-canon scenes and hijinks for them to get in to, while still covering all of the important stuff, like the diner, breaking in to Blackwell, their scene at the pool, etc.\n\n- Anything else we can both come up with together. :) \n\nMy \"Yes, Please\" List\n\n- Darker, adult themes\n- Romance\n- Passion\n- Kissing and cuddling\n- Descriptive partners and writers\n- Hella amazing Chloes \n- Partners I can call friend and chat with ^^\n- Drama\n- Creative writing \n- Sad, emotional scenes\n- Melodrama \n\nThat's about it... please message me if you wanna be my Chloe! Thank you!",

OCs are great; canon characters are too. I welcome both!\n\nAs I enjoy incorporating adult themes into my plots, a partner over 18 is a must (although 21+ would be even more ideal). I do like to have romance involved so long as things don\u2019t feel forced, and I\u2019m happy to write characters of different genders and sexual orientations in just about any combination.\n\nI find that I tend to enjoy plots that take place during a time where there aren\u2019t too many Jedi/Sith roaming around the galaxy. The concept of those ideologies being mostly lost to time or seen as myths makes for interesting tensions when someone who can manipulate the Force does show up.\n\nIf you have any cravings or ideas you\u2019d like to bounce off of me, please just let me know. If not, these are some of the themes/set-ups that I\u2019m particularly interested in exploring:\n\n-Writing a non-Force sensitive character opposite a Force-user.\n-Forcing enemies to work together for survival.\n-Subterfuge and double agents.\n-The contrast between one character who is physically powerful, and another who needs to rely more on cunning, charisma, or manipulation.\n-Transporting a prisoner from one place to another.\n\nI know those are all quite vague, but I wanted to list some options that could apply to a number of different time periods.\n\nIf you have any questions about anything I\u2019ve said here, or if you\u2019ve read anything that\u2019s piqued your interest, I\u2019d love to chat with you! My preferred method of communication is Discord (I can send my tag upon request), and I\u2019m always happy to plot or gab OOC.\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "The title says it all really. I'm driven largely on adventure-driven stories revolved around a singular character that acts as the proto-protagonist as they muck about in another person's Medieval Fantasy world whose story encompasses violence, exploration of the unique cultures, races, nations, forgotten places left in mountains and holes in the ground, as well as discovering new monsters, magics, etc. In a way, I sort of enjoy being able to describe it as a universe similar to the Witcher. A bitter, unpleasant world that's coming to a new age as fantasy and the harshness of reality bleed together to create a profoundly dark world that drafts real concepts from reality like economics, geopolitics, causes for conflicts amongst rulers where they use casus belis to flimsily give themselves cause to push for their real ambitions...so on and so on. If it's a world that can manage to make me uncomfortable, then you're probably doing something right with it.\n\nI don't care about the gender of my partner or any other circumstances related to them. It's not my business unless you care to make it; that being said, I've been at this long enough that if you're someone who self-describes themselves as a 'detailed writer,' then ninety-percent of the time ti doesn't actually mean anything. If you know how to structure a paragraph and can convey the feelings you want to get across, then that's more than enough for me. I'll provide a writing sample further down. Obligation has me say that I have no trouble with smut whatsoever, though the character I had in mind was a female with a favortism shown towards the same sex, which may very well come into conflict with the societal norms of the world, or be something entirely ignored. Either works for me, and, indeed, having sexuality be a point of tension can be quite fun if designed and plotted out well.\n\nI use Discord, Skype, as well as GMail/GDocs; message me for contact details for that.\n\nThanks to Kevin for giving the chance for this piece. This is by no means a prompt, and only serves to act as a form of advertisement for the level of writing I prefer.\n\n&gt; His attire was the usual of his imperious self, a simple pair of pressed trousers above polished leather boots. Over his shoulders was draped a collared shirt, and a light leather jacket above it; an odd choice in the hellish waste which was the Prestor's hold. Still, the man wasn't even sweating as he stepped forward, his limp obvious, while his hazel eyes gazed down at the girl with a thousand emotions flowing through, making a single indiscernible amalgamation. Her gaze met his, and she felt just as many, the strangest among them, among the fear, the anger, the respect, was the love. Not of a woman to her man, but of a daughter to her father. The man, for his part, did not look older than thirty, making it rather strange in the looks, but she had spent centuries with him... And while she felt nothing so strong as for the princess of her dreams, it was still enough to stop her strangling him until he inevitably forced her away. Instead, she just keeps a grim, determined look, causing him to sigh, and set the cane against the table, before pulling the chair on his side out, to sit down, with some struggle, due to the weak leg.\n\n&gt; When he has situated himself in the chair, Saria's eyes following him coldly as he does, he pulls it in, resting his arms on the table as the weak leg splays out for better comfort, before his eyes finally rest on her once more. The man seems unwilling, or at least unable, to say anything, wordlessly watching her in a mutual contest of whom could maintain poise longer. And Saria wasn't willing to play, yawning fakely to break the manufactured tension in the room, before leaning forward in turn; keeping her back straight and hands held perfectly, as she finally says, her first words since she'd talked to Raven's graving into the bedside, \u201cWell. You look good. Is that a new hair style you have?\u201d Daas, despite having not cut his hair in weeks, instinctively put a hand on his head to see what she was talking about, before casting an annoyed gaze at her and sighing. \u201cCan you take nothing seriously?\u201d He asks that, after a moment, his tone matching the gaze as his hand returns to the table, which causes her to shrug her shoulders, indifferent.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhen it's worth taking seriously, yes. But unfortunately for you, you aren't worth taking seriously.\u201d His gaze hardens again, his jaw set in a manner to indicate her words had bitten as harshly at she'd expected. There was a primal pleasure in tearing down those you hated; at least to her, and there was no one she hated more. Part of her disliked that pleasure she received, but she didn't care to listen to that; not here, not now. Her mental tangent is broken by Daas' words causing her to jolt; breaking her from the trance she'd already fallen into. \u201cSaria. Are you ever going to stop acting like a child, or am I going to have to treat you like one?\u201d Her gaze casts over him for a moment, coming up with a response which he immediately understands will be sarcastic, causing him to just cradle his head in a hand as she replies with, \u201cWell, I don't know. Children don't have to think, and they get to (Whoops, censored!) until they're nice and happy. Being treated like a child sounds like a dream.\u201d\n\n&gt; Daas' eyes glare her down, indicating she had gone a step too far in the wrong direction. She felt no remorse for the man's annoyance, however, shaking her head as she cuts in, before the man has a chance to criticize, \u201cYou're the one who forced me into this god-forsaken tower. Don't you fucking dare tell me to treat you with dignity or respect; you traded yours a long time ago.\u201d Rather than further annoyance, Daas' expression turns to that of a bemused smile, somewhat forced, as he chose to simply come to her side of thought, for now, if only to warm her up for the questions he had planned. \u201cYou did, too, you know. So I suppose that makes two of us, just pigs, rolling in the mud.\u201d Saria's eyes glance at the man, finding some anger at what he'd said, at the mention of her having given in her dignity. \u201cI didn't really have a choice in the matter,\u201d her tone is far more pressed, now, and her eyes slant. \u201cYou took my dignity... Though, if we're pigs, then I suppose that one of us is magical and the other's a murderer. Sounds like an excellent story for the ages. Maybe one of these days you can say that story to the next woman you kidnap and hold here.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cI'll keep that in mind,\u201d He says, softly, before leaning forward, thinking on her remark on dignity. \u201cBut you say that as if you didn't enjoy it. You enjoyed every moment, every kill, every hunt. The difference between you and I is that I don't enjoy my atrocities; and you do, Saria.\u201d The man has barely finished speaking before Saria's chair is thrown into the wall behind her, chipping away the stones behind her as she stands, glaring down at Daas, who shows no chance in composure as he watches her staring down at him with barely-contained fury from his words. \u201cYou...\u201d She says, voice shaking in the same manner as her quivering arms, \u201cYou...\u201d Nothing more came. It was true; what he said, at least about her. But the fact he'd said it, and the way he'd done it, made her want to burn the man down. But she didn't. And slowly, his arm raised, as she saw the familiar deathly black energy running along it, powered from it, as he gestures to the thrown chair. \u201cPick it up,\u201d he says, calmly, \u201cAnd sit down.\u201d",

That fast pace isn't for me so someone who understands a slow pace in regards to offline duties is necessary. Real life comes first. Always.\n* I don't want us to include the Avatar OC as a character. I want us to focus on the already existing canon roles.\n* I can give about 3-5 paragraphs and want the same in return. Third person, past tense should also go without saying.\n* I have played all three paths several times but if you have only played a certain one, please let me know so I'm not bringing in outside information (mostly in regards to Valla) unless you don't really care about spoilers.\n* Lastly, communication is vital to a story's success so please be prepared to plot with me. Talking to a brick wall gets really worrisome when partners fail to contribute or even get excited about what's going on or what is to come.\n\n**Character Cravings:**\n\n**Characters I can play:** Hinoka, Mozu, Silas, Sakura, Oboro, Kagero, Subaki, Kaden, Laslow, Selena and Leo.\n\n**Characters I'd like someone else to play:** Xander, Ryoma, Subaki, Jakob, Kaze, Rinkah, Kagero, Leo and Silas.\n\n**Some pairs I'd like to explore:** Xander/Hinoka, Xander/Sakura, Leo/Sakura, Subaki/Mozu, Kaze/Kagero, Kaden/Mozu, Ryoma/Selena, Jakob/Sakura, Ryoma/Oboro and Silas/Hinoka.\n\nOf course other options work too, I am open for suggestions. However there are several characters that I do not have any interest in working with, either writing as or against so if a common character isn't listed, it could be due to my personal disinterest in them but it doesn't hurt to ask and if someone as a way to sell me them and maybe give them something interesting, by all means reach out to me. All in all, I'm pretty open and I'd love to do something post-series but we'll see what happens.\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "I really want to do a Game of Thrones role play with you, here are some ideas I\u2019ve been tossing around:\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD. \n\n1.) The Crown \n\nThis idea could only exist in a different reality where Rhaegar Targaryen won Robert\u2019s Rebellion and inherited the throne from his father the mad king. The role play will follow the trials and errors of future rulers Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys, the children of Rhaegar and Elia Martell of Dorne. Rhaegar and Lyanna never married or had Jon in this version. It\u2019s up for discussion, we could also change the names of the Prince and Princess if you don\u2019t like them. This story is what we make it. \n\n2.) A King\u2019s Lust \n\nYou are the King of all of Westeros. Your rule hasn\u2019t been easy, but you are a good King. There is only one area where you have been struggling. Your wife, the Queen, has not given you any heirs. You\u2019re an honourable man, so you stand beside her through all of this, until you meet me. I am a Lady at court, beautiful and desired by all men that have ever laid eyes on me. My family hears of the King\u2019s misfortune, and tasks me with seducing you. If I fall pregnant with the King\u2019s child, you could be convinced to set aside your barren wife for me, increasing my families position. I like the idea of the King struggling over his honour and his lust. \n\n3.) A Lady Disgraced\n\nYou are a nobleman, be that a King or a Lord or whatever you desire. It\u2019s up to you. I am the daughter of a traitor, there was endless evidence of my father conspiring against the Crown. You hold me hostage. Think a Joffrey/Sansa or a Sansa/Ramsey type situation. You don\u2019t have to be as cruel as them if that\u2019s not to your taste, but I want my character to be like your new toy. \n\n4.) The Lady &amp; The Knight\n\nFrustrated by my disobedience, my Lord father makes an agreement with me. He will allow me to train with a sword, if I behave in front of the suitors he has selected for me. You are the knight he has asked to teach me. During our trainings, we grow closer. This could go in a lot of directions and is definitely up for discussion. \n\n5.) Pretenders\n\nSet before the death of Jon Arryn. I would play his secret bastard daughter, travelling to Kings Landing under a stolen name in order to discover more about my father.  You would play whoever you desired at court, but you would quickly discover my secret and blackmail me. This blackmail could work in a number of different ways, we\u2019ll talk about it. \n\n6.) Love &amp; War \n\nI am a whore, following Robb Starks army and seducing his high ranking men, gaining information and reporting back to the Lannisters. You request my company and grow suspicious of my questions, but keep me in your bed in order to keep a closer eye on me. It doesn\u2019t hurt that I\u2019m committed to your pleasure. Still we are on different sides of the war, and I\u2019m curious to see how this plays out. \n\n7.) Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken \n\nYou would play Oberyn Martell, before his untimely demise. I am a Lady at court, tasked by my father to find a suitable husband. We meet and I\u2019m reluctant to enjoy your company due to your reputation, but various circumstances bring us together and I agree to help you in your plight against the Lannisters. \n\nAny ideas you have that you want to explore are open for discussion. Send me a PM and we\u2019ll talk. You must be 18+, I\u2019m serious about that. I also don\u2019t accept one liners. Smut is great, but let there be story as well. I have a Kik, but right now I\u2019d prefer to use Discord or Reddit PM. ",

            "selftext": "Hello, you! I'm looking for roleplays that focus on being long-term and story-driven. Adventure, intrigue, mystery, even politics/socioeconomics and such related things are all enjoyed! Slice of life is fine -- downtime is inevitable, and is often very enjoyable! I just don't want a roleplay to be *all* about slice of life.\n\nI'm no stranger to romance or NSFW content, but the key thing here is story-driven. I'm happy to discuss how to do lewd things and make sure we're compatible, but in terms of what's actually written in-character it's probably gonna be pretty heavy on the story! Though, I'll be blunt -- I generally only do straight pairings and I prefer to play guys. I'll also note that I'm *mostly* vanilla, with some outliers, but overall I prefer to write touchy-feely 'lewd' stuff over outright smut! Most of the time. I have my moments. I can also write some pretty dark stuff, but that's largely for story purposes over lewd ones.\n\nI enjoy quite a bit setting-wise, pre-existing or homebrew! I have knowledge of a lot of canon ones, either to steal elements from, or to use as-is. Just ask after any that interest you. More picky on canon *characters,* though. I enjoy plenty of original settings and love the brainstorming involved, too! The various forms of fantasy, be they medieval, modern, victorian or elsewise. Steampunk, cyberpunk, sci-fi be it space-faring or planetary, space opera, only twenty-minutes-into-the-future, et cetera. Even sci-fantasy sorta stuff! Regardless of time period or nature of the setting, there's stuff around that can't be found in real life. It's a pretty wide range of things to cover, and too many options *can* be a bad thing. Restriction breeds creativity and all. I do tend to do 'standard fantasy' stuff most often, but certainly not limited to just that! Just expect most of my own ideas to have a bit of swords n' sorcery elements to them.\n\nI feel the whole 'be literate, able to write well in English, yada yada' goes without saying. I'm assuming some minimum level of capability, able to tell between \"your\" and \"you're\". \"they're\", \"their\", and \"there\". That kinda stuff. Typos? Everyone makes mistakes. Stylistic rule-bending? I do it plenty. Just realize the language is as important as the story it's trying to tell. I don't have a hard post size requirement, just write what feels best, but some quantity is nice to go along with the quality every now and again. Beyond that, I'm hoping to find a partner that doesn't mind taking up a GM role. A narrator or storyteller of sorts, if not without their own characters. I recognize it is asking for much. I'd like to mention I'm still quite happy to assist in worldbuilding, brainstorming plot/character ideas, and playing side-characters of my own -- I've done my own fair share of running games. I hope to alleviate concerns it'll be skewed too far. I'm not entirely certain what incentives I could offer, but hopefully I've at least got you interested.\n\nBit of a vague ad, I don't have anything truly *specific* in mind that I'm *dying* to do right now. Don't expect me to sit around and nod my head dumbly, though! I've got ideas and characters ready to use of my own, and I'm not afraid to throw things at the wall until something sticks if we wanna do something completely original. Everyone has their dry periods, true, yet I don't intend to be dead weight. PM me and feel free to ask any questions you might have!",

            "selftext": "**After many long months of development, the Mod Team at BSRP is happy to announce the grand opening, tonight at midnight EST.** \n\nWelcome to [Black Skies,](https://i.imgur.com/qwcpZ9E.jpg) a 100% original steampunk and victorian-era inspired world. Essentially imagine the eras of the Age of Exploration and the Steam Age were swapped in dates in a different world with different countries, and cultures. The game begins with the World\u2019s Fair where the major countries come together in the name of progress and innovation. However, in the south, those same major countries vie for dominance over the sea and skies and scramble to colonize the treacherous continent of Alkebu. It is up to you to swing the direction of our world and discover the secrets that will lead you on an adventure of your own making.\n\nIn Black Skies RP, you can create a character with a unique set of skills and abilities. As the conflict and tensions grow between countrymen, roll the dice for a successful rebellion. Or attempt to explore the hidden secrets of Alkebu, or invent new technologies to improve the world. Black Skies RP features revolt mechanics, battle mechanics, economy mechanics, mechanically-supported character growth, and the most steampunk-y of all \u2013 alchemy mechanics that will help create, invent, and shape the world around you - from the biggest invention to the smallest. The possibilities are endless, and with some creativity, collaboration with others, writing, and a spot of luck you can craft all sorts of stories.\n\nWe are a text based roleplaying game and no matter what your skill level of writing, we invite you to come, check us out, and join a community of steampunk enthusiasts in a world that is all our own. Read up on lore or join our community\u2019s steampowered hype train.\n\nCheck out our community subreddit at r/bsrpcommunity or join our [discord chatroom!](https://discord.gg/wB2sSDV) If you want to read up on our lore first before deciding to jump straight into the Great Bitter Sea, check out our [wikia.](http://black-skies-roleplay.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Skies_Roleplay_Wiki)\n\nThe great game of gears has not yet begun but as we grow closer to the cutting of the red ribbon, we, the mod team at BSRP, have a detailed schedule of announcements, unveilings, Q&amp;A\u2019s to help and hype you through the process of understanding the world of Black Skies.\n\nFare thee well,\n\n/u/vanecia, and the Mod Team at Black Skies RP",

            "selftext": "Alright new request, and I'll do my best to keep things brief. First before getting to the RP section I feel the need to clear a few things up. Mostly because of issues in the past with other partners that would have never happened if I had been more up-front about some stuff.\n\n1. If I'm happy, or energized I tend to talk about whatever subject comes to my mind. Past partners have accused me of not caring about what they have to say because of how I jump from topic to topic. That is not true. I care a lot, I just sometimes have a lot to say, and want to say it. I actually do pay attention to what my partner is saying, and will try to keep on topic despite some random jumps here, and there. \n\n\n\n2. if I'm not feeling particularly energized my speech comes off as far more subdued, and this has lead to partners telling me that I seem like I'm irritated, and one even quitting on me, because in her words; \"I feel like I'm walking on egg shells with you\" Okay this is wrong on so many levels. Sometimes I'm just not super happy. It doesn't mean I'm irritated, or annoyed. It just means I'm recharging my energy.\n\n\n\n3. I sometimes get partners who try to give me ideas for my side, that I shoot down. And they respond by raging like; \"Well all you do is shoot my ideas down! &gt;=(\"  Okay let me be clear, THAT'S ONLY ON MY SIDE! Your side can have any idea you want. I'm not going to tell you how to do your side, and your free to reject any ideas I come up with. My side is my side, and if I don't like an idea you have about my OC or whatever, then yeah I'm going to say no. Just as I would expect you to say no, if I throw out an idea that you don't care for. Otherwise all ideas are fine.\n\n\n\nAlright now for the RP stuff\n\n\n\n1. I'm OC friendly, that means original characters for anyone who doesn't know.\n\n\n\n2. I am of legal age for smut, and will do so if my partner is too.\n\n\n\n3. I have discord, and email. I have no idea why I mentioned the email because I'm pretty sure everyone does either discord or kik anyway.\n\n\nRP List;\n\nBoku no Hero Academia\n\nLife Is Strange\n\nThe Elder Scrolls\n\nMass Effect\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\nHorror Games (resident evil, dead space, fnaf etc)",

I'm okay with roleplaying with someone from another timezone, just as long as we both have times where we can have back\\-to\\-back replies and more than one message per day!  \nFor a *type of apocalypse,* I am fine with either **zombies or nuclear apocalypses.** I prefer zombies, but we can spice up what type of zombies there are, how fast they are, how quick they spread, how the virus spreads and stages of infection. This is something I enjoy discussing and planning.  \nI also think right now I would prefer a FxF roleplay, but if you wish for a FxM, then that is fine by me!  \nI also do not mind whether we set the roleplay 10 minutes or 10 years from the outbreak, anything is fine with me as long as it goes by the story.\n\n**My rules are really simple if you are interested:**\n\n* Please do not rush the relationship between our characters, I would love to build a romance up, but starting off as acquaintances, maybe not even trust or like each other, but I'm looking for something long\\-term.\n* Please be able to mainly write in paragraphs.\n* Be literate!\n* Keep it as realistic as realistic goes when it comes to an apocalypse. No godmodding or superpowers.\n* Please don't rush my replies. And i won't rush yours! We both have lives!\n\nI'm looking for a dramatic bases story between two characters ages between 15\\-17 who are trying to survive and have to pair up due to circumstances we can discuss. But throughout their friendship, hate, and romance, there will most likely always be drama. I am looking for a partner that can provide the skill in writing to experiment with angsty scenes, involving blood, gore, tension, disputes and death. I would prefer someone who is 18\\+ to carry out these gory scenes, but this is not necessary as no sexual scenes will appear unless we make this long\\-term (which Im hoping for) and the characters grow up together, passing the age of 18.\n\nI'd love to focus on the growth of our characters, not just their relationship \\- but the growth of themselves, and how they learn to deal with the apocalypse. I would love to explore different emotions, stages of friendship, etc. I want someone long term that would like the same.\n\nI have a couple of ideas for these roleplays, including the 'immunity' concept, group rivalry's, partner survival, etc... But I would love for us to discuss things together and build up a world together.\n\nI use discord only to roleplay.\n\nSend me a message if you're up for it, and I will reply asap.",

            "selftext": "Hello all! Im Talia! I don't want to drag on and on about boring little me, but I guess I should be clear. Recently, I have lost most of my (toxic) friends, and they just so happened to be my only RP partners! But I miss that closeness of having someone who I could be friends with, and write with!! So what better place to search than the internet? Lol \n\nI'll balance out me with what I'd look for in a roleplay, okay?? I really am searching for a friend alongside the story! \n\n- I'm 19 years old, and I live in Florida \n\n- I am a gorl \n\n- I love musical theatre, anime, K-pop, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc etc. Basically I'm a giant nerd but I'm also oddly picky about stuff?? Idk man\n\n- Sharks are my favourite animal, and I also love dinosaurs and puppers\n\n- I like to think I'm aesthetic? I love the 90's retro look, so I try to capture it as much as possible. But I work at a movie theatre so ugh I'm always in a polo shirt lol\n\nAnd, as anyone should expect, I'm a writer! I love love love stories, especially when they are built with someone else. Writing is such a release for me, and so I guess I just search to do it as casually and frequently as possible.\n\nWhich brings me to a roleplay! Right now, I would love something slice of life and lighthearted to bring up the typical humdrum of daily life. So some things to get out of the way would be:\n\n- I write in 3rd person, past tense! \n\n- I only write literate style, though I don't want to have some minimum/maximum of reply lengths. Whatever fits, fits. Something casual but well written!\n\n- I AM ONLY LOOKING FOR M/M RIGHT NOW!!! That doesn't mean I won't have other cravings, especially if we come up with something super cool! But for starters, M/M works!\n\n- On that note, I don't like the typical tropes that M/M brings along. I would much rather work out a nice plot and create characters that fit that! \n\n- My favorite genres are slice of life, something sweet but not boring. Romance is a must! But that doesn't mean the plot has to be dumb or dull!! I love drama and angst and cuteness and conflict!\n\n- Smut is awesome too btw\n\nOK WITH ALL THAT SAID!\n\nI'll wrap up with some contact preferences and a conclusion (what is this, an essay?). \n\nI would love for someone around my age. 16-23 would be best! I want someone willing to be my friend. Hell, even if you don't wanna write at first and just be friends before trying to force an RP, I'm SO down with that. I'm looking for a genuine connection with my RP partner, so that we share much more than just a story! Male or female doesn't matter to me, as long as you're nice and compatible! \n\nOkok I might be done now. \n\nHope to hear from you! I prefer Kik, but if you don't have one just message me here and we can work it out. \n\n**DONT JUST ASK TO RP I REALLY WANT SOMETHING REAL, SO PLS TELL ME ABOUT YOU AND SHTUFF OK BYE**\n\nKik: raptor.kidd \n",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs\n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

            "selftext": "**The devil's in the details, so hang with me....**\n\n\n- Roleplayer and writer for over a decade looking for long term, descriptive partners. \n- I always make an attempt to warn partners if I know of an impending issue in schedule. If I do not know ahead of time, that cannot be helped. *Life comes first.*\n- I prefer that you don't mind OOC chatter, considering some days, one just doesn't feel like RPing and needs to talk. I reserve a different email thread for OOC as well as any RP question that may come up once we start.\n- I am willing to answer any questions that come my way, all you have to do is PM me. Be mindful that I do not check Reddit every five seconds. It may take a little while to get back to you.\n- Again, life comes first, and if something comes up that pulls me away from RP, please be aware that I will attempt to warn you before it happens if I can. \n\n\n**Play Style:**\n\n\n- I am able to play male or female characters in any given setting. Message me about an idea you have. I will respond either way. (I have no problem with side characters, but I do not double mains.)\n- As my character is not me, your character is not you. It doesn't matter to me whether you are male or female and what your character is. \n- Heterosexual relationships are my first and foremost preference , but I will not discount a different RP idea that strikes my attention enough. \n- If something is not working for you, please tell me and do not disappear on me. I do not disappear on my partners, and it would be nice to know what can be improved or changed. \n- Be willing to plan with me. A little world-building can save a lot of floundering later on, and I'd like to be able to sketch out at least a little bit before we begin.\n- **I will politely decline to keep responding to you if you cannot produce anything over one line or incomplete sentences.** The purpose of this long, thought-out advert is to deter you from wasting my time and your own.\n\n\n**Post Schedule:**\n\n\n- I am completely unavailable on Sundays, Wednesdays, and some Saturdays there are very few exceptions to this. Each second Friday of the month, for 4 days or so, I will be sporadic in responses.\n- On a good day, I may be able to get in 2+ posts per day or more. I may be able to rapid fire. Others, I may not be able to post at all. *Please be patient.* That being said, if it has been 3 days or more since I have responded, feel free to send me an OOC email to remind me. Your email may have been one I opened on my phone and did not reset as unread. \n\n\n**Post-Length:**\n\n\n- I typically range anywhere from three to six paragraphs or more, depending on necessity. My introduction posts or description posts will obviously be longer than simple conversation. I am not asking you to mirror me. My posts include internal dialogue and conflict, if that bothers you - please do not waste my time or yours.\n- I would prefer a partner that is both literate and descriptive. At least two paragraphs or more and I need a partner to help drive the story forward.\n\n\n\n**Platforms:**\n\n\n- I use email. It is the easiest way for me to keep track of everything. \n*My apologies, but I will not be changing to any other platforms, it is simply too inconvenient for me. You will, unfortunately, not be convincing me otherwise.*\n\n\n**Genres:**\n\n\n- Darker themes, gore, survival horror, drama, high or low fantasy, sci-fi, steampunk, crime noir.... a vibrant mix of several, you name it and we can talk it over and see if we can find something we will both enjoy. \n- Romance is a preferred subplot, but I prefer things to develop organically and I do not want this to be the main focus of any RP. It is likely I will get disinterested if we do not include romance in the plot to a greater or lesser degree.\n- NSFW content is not necessarily off-limits, but please be aware that I would like to discuss things first.\n- I will not change a character completely to suit your wants/needs. I will alter characters as I see fit, to my own discretion or I will create an entirely new character.\n- I reserve the right to say no. It's nothing personal. \n\n\n**Time Periods**\n\n\n- Any. Let's talk it out. I prefer an element of fantasy, which means I will prefer any offers for it over completely realistic. (Of course, two human characters fighting dragons is not completely realistic, I will accept that.) Slice-of-life is okay, but it cannot be the main focus. I get bored.\n-  I can absolutely be convinced otherwise, if you have a good enough idea or plot that is also realistic - let's talk.\n\n\n**Fandoms:**\n\n\n- I will readily attempt to play in a fandom that I like. That being said, I do not prefer to play very many canon characters.... just in canon universes. Want to play OC mutants? New heroes in the DC or Marvel universe? Let's try it. (If you're wondering who I am willing to play canon in these universes, please just ask.)\n- OCs versus canon characters are welcome. Ask about this.\n\n\n**Need Not Apply:**\n\n\n- I can and will refuse any RP I want, but it is likely that I will give it a shot first if we mesh well together in our initial conversations.\n- Do NOT contact me with a situation in which I am basically under your thumb and you are (or you want) a DM/GM type.... I do NOT like this type of RP and I you will not be changing my mind. Thanks.\n- Do not expect rapid-fire posts or conversations from me constantly, I will reply when I am able, I promise.\n- Anyone seeking nothing but NSFW roleplay can keep looking, I prefer rich story and worlds. \n\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\n\n- Please contact me via **message,** I do not respond to comments. \n- Let's talk it out before or after we move to email, I don't mind either way. If I seem to have missed your message or email in 2 or max 3 days, send another and I will reply right away. ",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nYou can call me Alex and I\u2019m 26 and looking for a role play partner. I have been writing and role playing on and off since a little site called Neopets. Yeah, crazy! Anyway I have a full time job/life so I will be straight forward that I will not be on 24/7 like back in the good old days, but what I will provided will be at least a post that is detailed and moving the story forward. I\u2019m not looking for a novel, but I am looking for details and matching each other\u2019s post(within reason). I don\u2019t care if your grammar isn\u2019t spot on or if you spell a word wrong, as long as I get where you are going I am a happy camper. I typically write anywhere from 3\\-5 paragraphs per post.\n\nI love gore, sex and drugs when it is called for, don\u2019t randomly have your character go \u201cAlien\u201d with a alien popping out of his chest when you are supposed to be Spanish pirates.\n\nOnly things I ask is that my partner helps to push the plot forward and that they are older than 18\\+. The later I have no way of enforcing and have broken that rule so often before, but it makes me sleep better at night.\n\nWait, another \u201crule\u201d my partner has to be able to play more than one person. The world doesn\u2019t have just two people in it. I am completely fine with two main characters, but there needs to be supporting cast and crew. I prefer not to double because I always end up focusing on one that I really like to write.\n\nNow the good stuff. What do I will to role play.\n\n\\-Anything historical, anytime period any culture, I am your girl. I have several plots for these as well. (This is what I honestly want to role play) Mafia, Roman/Greek, Tudor, Victorian, Shogun\\-whatever!\n\n\\-slice of life: this is normally with a pairing and I am fine to do that, but there needs to be some direction. I would love to do a one with a actress/actor and someone that is coaching them or teaching them for a role in a movie or show.\n\n\\-Fantasy and sci\\-fi: would love to do an adventure plot or high stakes mystery. Very open to creating a world with some one.\n\n\\-Not a fan of fandoms, but I would be open to doing OC in the world of the fandom.\n\nI will play any gender, I might have a peference once we have come up with ideas but I can do anything. I prefer f/m or f/f but would be open to m/m(never have done it, but can).\n\nPM me for my email or for discord info, I will do either, but prefer email. Thanks for stopping by!",

            "selftext": "Hey fellow redditors, thanks for dropping by, I appreciate it. I\u2019ve been lurking here for a few weeks now and have finally decided it was time to make an ad of my own. First things first, I have under a year of inconsistent roleplay experience so if that is a deal breaker, it\u2019s probably best you stop reading now.\n\nA little about me, I\u2019m in my late 20\u2019s, have a career, and participate in a handful of other extracurricular activities. My work schedule is a bit sporadic, but I can usually find blocks of times available to chat or write with a partner if you\u2019re not looking to play by post. I tend to post rather long, detailed posts anywhere between two to five paragraphs in the third person perspective. It would be ideal if I could find a partner that can match this, but if you feel you can progress or develop the story or situation with less I\u2019d be up for giving it a go. For this ad I\u2019ll only be using Discord to roleplay as I find it to be quite convenient and easy to use. Finally, I live in the Pacific Time Zone and am mostly available in the late evening, generally after 8 PM is a safe bet.\n\nOk, now to the good part, what I\u2019m looking for! I have two plot ideas that revolve around playing OC mutant characters. While I do want both our characters to be original characters, I would like the roleplay itself to be set in Xavier\u2019s School for Gifted Youngsters. I prefer a mix of action, drama, and romance to be involved in the plots I roleplay. I am open to having NSFW scenes or themes involved, but not right away or as major themes or components of the roleplay.\n\nThe first idea involves me playing a young male mutant that just so happened was captured at an early age and was manipulated and molded into becoming a villain. After a run in with the X-men or any other super-team, he would be apprehended and given a choice for a fresh start at life. Though this offer comes with stipulations such as mandatory therapy, education, and community service to be served at Xavier\u2019s School. This character is very well fleshed out and I can provide details upon request about him if needed. Characters with elemental based powers would be a plus here. I believe this premise opens a wide range of character types for any potential partner to play. If you need suggestions, I\u2019d be happy to provide more than a few for you.\n\nThe second idea is much more ambitious and would require both myself and any potential partner to play at least two characters total. I\u2019d like to create a small group of mutant students with a partner that would be trained to be a youthful extension of the X-men. (Think Generation X or New Mutants.) These new OC mutant students would all arrive at the school together and be trained and educated together. This idea would take some time to plan, coordinate, and write out once we were prepared. If this is something you\u2019re interested in, please understand that this will be quite a lengthy process and it may be some time before we even begin to roleplay.\n\nWell that about wraps up my ad, thanks for making it all the way through. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions feel free to leave me a private message.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Title!\n\nWith any great fandom comes the greatness that is shipping, but I often find that RPs focused around shipping characters lose the essence of what makes a fun RP a fun RP. Nothing but smut gets tedious and boring if there's not a good plot and a good story to accompany the ship. And let's not beat around the bush; we all know most RPs involving fandoms center around pairing two of our favorite characters together.\n\nFor this RP, I am looking for: \n\n1. Someone fun and creative and willing to play over Discord\n\n2. Someone who knows their lore and their characters \n\n3, Someone who can give descriptive posts, and post often \n\n4. Someone who can combine NSFW themes and darker, more adult elements with the fun, loving, adventurous spirit we'd all come to expect from an Overwatch game \n\nThat's really it. \n\nMy ideal pairings would be as follows:\n\nReaper / Sombra or Widow\n\nReinhardt / Brigitte \n\nSoldier or Genji / Mercy \n\nThough, I'm mostly comfortable with anything, so long as it's fun and interesting. Like I said, I want to keep this grounded to the established lore and not just make it a shipping fest, but I am willing to play multiple characters in a complex story and I am hoping that you are, too.\n\nIf you're interested, just message me.

I should have it back by Monday, so if you're waiting on a reply from me, it's coming!\n\n\nHey there, party people! I'm looking for more people to GM for in my science-fantasy setting. If you're not too familiar with science-fantasy, think Star Wars and you'll have a good idea for what you're in for. I'd be happy to give you all the specific details when we start discussing things, but expect to encounter plenty of aliens, exotic worlds, interstellar governments and communities, and maybe even a little magic along the way.\n\n\nAs a GM, I'd like to know what kinds of things you're hoping to do in an RP like this. Do you want to just explore? Do you want to join the military and go to war? Are you just looking to meet someone? Or do you just want to make some cash smuggling? You're not limited by these of course, but knowing what you want will help me give you more opportunities to do those things.\n\n\nIt's also important that I know what your limits are. Please tell me if you're okay with blood, gore, battle, carnage, or dark things in general. Depending on how you choose to progress, you may encounter this stuff and sometimes I like to get pretty descriptive with it. Please also tell me if you are okay with smut and if you want to include it. I'm more than happy to include some sexual content, and if you really want you can just go on some sexual misadventure to bed every alien in the galaxy or something like that.\n\n\nNow, the boring part: writing requirements. Don't fret, if you're an experienced roleplayer and a good writer, this won't be a problem. All I ask is that you send me a message with substance that I can reply to. It doesn't need to be a specific length, though I'd like you to be capable of writing a few paragraphs when appropriate as it's not uncommon for me to do that. I'd prefer if you played in third-person, but I'd accept first as well. Playing multiple characters is a bonus as well. I'm going to be doing most of the heavy lifting here so I greatly appreciate a partner who puts work into their replies. Standard roleplaying etiquette applies of course, so no godmodding, metagaming, etc.\n\n\nThat's pretty much everything. If you're interested, please send me a PM with what you'd like to include and do with me!",

            "selftext": "Hello all. I'm looking for someone interested in \\*\\*Death Note\\*\\* the anime.\n\n\\- I post 2\\-3 times a week.\n\n\\- I post about 4\\-5 paragraphs typically.\n\n\\- I play both genders.\n\n\\- Mature content is okay in appropriate doses. \n\n\\- I use reddit primarily but I could use discord or google docs. Maybe email. \n\nNow regarding some plot ideas, I do have many others but for now I'll list a few and can go into deeper planning via PM. Like most I think the first half of Death Note was the strongest. The game of cat and mouse, the morals being questioned, secrets and lies, all of that good stuff is what I want to try and embody. I am sure writing Death Note can be intimidating but I'd done a few short stories by myself so I'm hoping that translates well into roleplaying with others!\n\n\\*\\*Generally speaking I'm looking to double as Misa and Light. I am open to playing Naomi, Sayu and maybe Matsuda or Near. I'd love someone to play L to my Misa in a romantic sense, but other pairs can be worked out if you want Light with someone or maybe Sayu or Naomi with L instead of Misa. Again I do have many other ideas (like 15 general jumping off points ranging from AU settings to different ways in which Misa and L meet) so if these don't jive, let me know and I can share others or we can talk and work something out together.\\*\\*\n\n\\- A plot centered around L and Misa (around the 13 or 14'th ep). Misa caves and goes to L, telling him everything he needs to know about the Death Note and Light. Now that both sides are more even, the true game can begin. Light doesn't know Misa betrayed him so she plays both sides as delicately as possible. Light and L continue to work on the task force while L and Misa get close, trying to gather enough evidence to convict Light. Of course the rest of the task force isn't aware of Misa's Death Note or of her companion Rem. Secrets are abound as so\\-called friends lie to one another and family ties are threatened.\n\n\\- A plot in which there is no Light Yagami as Kira but instead it is Misa Amane who takes it upon herself to judge the world. Moreover, her killings are harder to track as she does not stick to one singular method (like Light's heart attacks). The Kira Investigation is kept on their toes as Light is brought in to aid L's task force. Together they try to catch Kira but soon Light comes into possession of a Death Note and his own ideals are brought into question. Would he still help L or turn to help Misa? We can figure out if Misa has Ryuk or Rem by her side and other details via PM. This is essentially flipping Light and Misa's roles.\n\n\\- A plot which has Misa on the run from police and must hide herself. Upon getting them both out of L's custody, Light's father hijacks the car and frees both of them (taking off from episode 17). Light fades into the shadows, feeling betrayed by L who he once considered a friend. Misa is also in hiding. Both Light and Misa have not yet regained their memories. Several years pass and a new Kira has risen to power named Mikami. L is still convinced Light and Misa are the true First and Second Kira but he still pursues Mikami. Eventually Light becomes a police officer in northern Japan and returns home to help L who is all alone at this point. This idea is a little iffy as I want Misa and Light to regain their memories but it will take some magic fudging (like them mailing themselves a sheet of paper and getting it years later or something). So I'd like to talk more about this one. Another idea would be that Light's father kills his son and then commits suicide, forcing Misa to flee herself, L then traveling abroad to locate her.\n\n\\- A plot where Misa grows up in Whammy's House alongside L. Misa admires L right away and when he goes off to solve cases around the world, Misa buckles down and studies intensely, much to Near and Mello's amusement. However not really book smart, she becomes more sociable and street smart, into riddles and puzzles. She and L bond and when Kira makes the headlines, she goes off to help him. L believes Misa could be a double spy of sorts and instructs her to take the To\\-Oh university entrance exam with him. Thanks to Watari's connections, Misa is accepted. She then goes to befriend Light in order to help L prove that he is Kira. This may need a bit more work but that's what I have so far. \n\n\\- \\*I'm also open to an OC only plot where maybe one person has a Note and the other has a Pen or something where both need the other to work. However I don't want a copy of Light. I don't want some guy hoping to cleanse the world and become some kind of Light\\-clone with a huge ego.. I genuinely think if a normal person found this, they might help their friend who has an abusive father. Or they stop small time criminals in the area, nothing grand like people already in jail serving time. Maybe that's just me?\\*",

You're dreaming.\n\nWe are a mature RP server focusing on the Marvel universe but anyone under the age of 18 is welcome to join as well.

            "selftext": "Greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...My Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Pokemon, Splatoon, and Legend of Zelda.  I can try other fandoms but that's a case by case thing and anything that holds ZERO similarity to what I am looking for is likely a hard no.  With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",

I\u2019m a big fan of Marvel\u2019s list of superhero movies(Hulk aside) and I\u2019ve been having a Pepper/Tony itch that can\u2019t seem to be satisfied. I know it\u2019s difficult to play a convincing genius but god, I\u2019d do /anything/ if you wouldn\u2019t mind trying. I can play Tony myself, although I do best when it\u2019s a Rule63!Version and I\u2019m pitting him(her) against someone else. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\n\nCharacters I play:   \n* Pepper Potts\n* Natalia Alianovna Romanova  \n* Rule63!Toni Stark\n* Rule63! Steve Rogers    \n* Lady Loki  \n* Bucky Barnes  \n* Steve Rogers  \n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nPairings I enjoy:  \n* Pepper/Tony  \n* Bucky/Nat\n* Clint/Nat  \n* R!63 Cap/Tony  \n* Toni/Steve  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI\u2019d like to stress that wit/banter and writing a **believable** character is very important to me, much more than the smut or whatever else that comes later down the line. I also know that it\u2019s difficult to write with someone whose style doesn\u2019t quite match so I prefer to exchange writing samples at the start of everything just so we won\u2019t waste each other\u2019s time. Plot wise, I\u2019m sure we can come up with something after some discussion.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you and good luck in your search as well. \u2665  \nPS: No matter how old this ad gets, feel free to send me a PM if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "[WARNING]: Gore, brutal violence and swearing is a part of the roleplay's story, people with sensitive thoughts may be offended. Remember, you have been warned.\n\nHello! recently a roleplay server of mine has been usually piling up with more participants and we are indeed searching for more. Let's get straight into the point shall we?\n\nThe roleplay is based on a fictional universe where thus a possibility of non-fictional elements being implemented towards the story. The story embarks on a strange but mythical journey that involves unreal creatures against humanity.\n\nIn the past (1/24/2006). A planet invasion from so called 'Unearthly' begun to exist and made history for quite a very long while. Unbelievable and sangerous monsters/creatures went against humankind as their first traditional feast. Two gigantic almighty beasts rose up from the deep and buried grounds, each of their own side of their respective planet. One is named The Alpha, the guardian of Planet Earth, and the other is named The Omega. The counterpart malevonent of The Alpha.\n\nPlanet Earth was infected by the corruption of the Unearthlies, after the war between The Alpha and The Omega, many groundbreaking strikes and heavy blows that we're both made by the overwhelming superiors that slowly shattered the mountains, the villages and somehow slightly the Earth. Both fought and fought with tremendous effort until there was only one left standing and one that has fallen and descended to the empty grounds, The Omega was victorious against it's benevolent counterpart. The Unearthlies displayed loyalty and respect towards the Omega, they we're victorious as they celebrated the end of humanity, slowly being infected by the creatures outrageous and violent inhumane actions, some turned in to sacrifice their lives, some died to surrender and gave up their life for nothing, and some kept their spirits strong to fight them off.\n\nOne day an odd and graceful one. The bloody Unearthly demons slowly faded, disappeared and vanished until a thought occured to them humanity was no more. The creatures we're gone as they returned to their home planet. Almost nothing was nothing left for humankid but their rough lives.. The war started at the year 2006 and ended a year later. (1/24/2007)\n\nSomeday, these creatures may return and rise again to ruin humanity's last chance of existing in this cruel galaxy. More unique creatures and savage beasts are manifesting at this very day. Who knows what path will the future take us? what kind of future will it be?\n\nLore seems decent? good? great? stop by and give it a shot to enter!\n\n-[Server Link]-\nhttps://discord.gg/E3PXrqN",

I have an idea of my own but I would love to hear if you have any ideas or maybe we can both come up with something. I would like to do a mix of both canon and oc. Mainly looking for someone to play Zero Two or really any of the girls from the anime, no not someone similar. No I will not play Zero Two so if you're looking for that look somewhere else. I really don't have many rules expect for no Godmodding, be caught up with the anime, and if you don't want to roleplay anymore at least let me know and don't just straight up ditch me.\n\nSo if you're interested message me for my Discord. Also in your message post your favorite color so I know that you actually read this.\n\nSide Note: SERIOUSLY! Please be committed if you're going to message me. I've already had countless people saying they want to roleplay and with the exception of one all of them have pretty much ditched me without a word before we even finished discussing a plot. What's the point of messaging me if you're to do that crap? It's annoying and it just wastes my time. So make sure you actually want to roleplay before messaging me.\n\n",

During the Crusades, the Catholic Church accused the scientists of other groups to be demons, and these other groups were either exterminated or forced to flee. They sailed the stars before settling on the other heavenly bodies: Orcs on Mercury, Elves on Venus,  Dwarves on Mars. For millennia, they were myths and legends\u2014alien. But finally, humans have discovered how to meet again. There\u2019s still tension however. This is a universe where nuclear weapons were not used, meaning culture wasn\u2019t obliterated. There\u2019s a bit of supernatural on higher levels, but it\u2019s not necessary. We can make stories about the criminal underworld, blue-collar lower class trying to survive, a middle-class dreamer, the upper-class technocrats, even galactic explorers. Any story you want to tell, no matter how small or big in scope. I see this being a mature anthology, closer to Cowboy Bebop or Ghost In The Shell than Star Wars or Star Trek. We can tackle mature topics and this is as SFW or NSFW as you like.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/33egJdf",

They can all range from Sci-Fi to medieval times!

I also enjoy taking time into writing my replies and I'd like you to as well so we both take something out of this.   \n\n\nFor tonight I'm looking for people with Discord ONLY.

The school is like a safe haven for many, in a world that is less then accepting of those who are different. \n\n\nI am open to NSFW situations, but I do not want them to be the centre or the main focus.

It's a tough world out there and it can often be intimidating to shout into the void and find that no one wants to roleplay with you - or, if you don't feel super confident in your writing abilities, this is also a friendly environment where you can improve that skill which is so crucial for forging great narratives.\n\nWe are welcoming and accepting of everyone, regardless of your gender identity, race, religion, or politics. Anyone who deigns to harass anyone else in The Writers' Retreat will find themselves on the other side of the banhammer - and the admin is always open to feedback and advice.\n\nThank you for considering us!\n\nHere's the link: https://discord.gg/C9jxgD",

I actually really enjoy playing against OCs, I just don't enjoy using them myself.\n\n\nA bit about me, I'm a 21 year old dude from the US. My main hobbies are music, videogames, anime, overworking myself, and bumming around in my spare time.\n\n\nI've rated my prompts and fandoms with a 1-5 star rating based on how interested I am in doing an RP pertaining to this right now.\n\n\n**FANDOMS**\n\n\nSoul Eater \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBoku no Hero Academia \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nShin Megami Tensei / Persona \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nOverwatch \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nHunter x Hunter \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nHarry Potter \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nStar Wars \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nPokemon \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nElder Scrolls \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nFallout \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nWarhammer 40K \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nShadowrun \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nWorld of Darkness / Vampire: The Masquerade \u2605\u2605\n\n\n**NON FANDOM RP IDEAS**\n\n\nSuperheroes \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nZombies/Apocalypse \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nOriginal High Fantasy World \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nOriginal Sci-Fi /Cyberpunk World \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nNoir / Neo-Noir \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nYandere \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\nSlice of Life \u2605\u2605",

I also don't care about post length, as long as what you type helps nudge things along. Third person is also a must, as I often play multiple characters and background entities which makes first person weird and clunky.\n\nI know its not a lot of info, but I am just trying to garner interest.

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking for a partner interested in doing an RP based within a fantasy world similar to the Witcher or God of War. If you're looking for something else, however, I'm more than happy to discuss some alternative RPs we could do if fantasy isn't your thing. I'm also completely open to ideas or suggestions! \n\nFor some details about me, I'm an 18-year-old male whose been an active roleplayer for about 4+ years now. Unfortunately I have taken a break from RPing due to schooling taking up the majority of my time. My usual responses range from a paragraph or more and I tend to avoid ever going below 4 sentences. \n\nAs for the RP itself, I'm looking for a story containing mature themes, content, and topics. I am personally okay with most things so feel free to suggest what you would like to have take place within the story. Romance between our characters is a thing I would like to have take place as long as it isn't forced. Also, things such as smut and the like are welcome so long as the RP doesn't become based around it 100%\n\nBoth male and female partners are welcome!\n\nFeel free to PM me if you're interested ",

All the lives I've destroyed, the people I've killed and those you weren't able to save; all that blood is on your hands and you'll have to live with the consequences. Thanks to you I've become this monster, unfeeling; uncaring and capable of horrors that even I would have never been able to imagine, I became the villain so you could play the hero. I just hope it was worth it for you; was it worth the applause, adoration and love the people gave you? Are you proud of the way our lives played out? I hope this is what you wanted, because now it's too late to stop. I am the way I am because of you, but just remember this; You are nothing without me.\n\nLove,\nMe\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSo there's that, the lead in to our plot; we don't have to use that in story but it's the general theme/feel/mood of the story. A scorned lover, death, destruction, mayhem and lots of revenge and fighting. Together we will see the growth, destruction and eventual fallout of this relationship between our characters and that's where the fun comes in!\n\nAre we superhuman's with incredible powers and unmatched strength? Are we two immortals cursed to live out our lives among and ever changing world? Are we just two normal humans that have gone off the rails and just enjoy fucking up each others lives?\n\nWhat I'm looking for is someone that's serious about this, literate and wants to see this through to the end. As far as posts go, I'm a fan of quality over quantity, I try to match post length and I work so there might be times where I can't post, but I will do my best to get at least one post in daily. So if this seems like something you're into message me and we can get started on fleshing things out.",

            "selftext": "Naruto: New Moon (\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u65b0\u6708, Naruto: Shingetsu) is a Naruto-Fanon Project that takes place in the Naruto World a hundred years following the conclusion of the Fourth Shinobi World War, and approximately eighty years after the battle between Kawaki and Boruto Uzumaki. The project is a continuation of the Boruto series, however, because we can not predict the nature of how Boruto will end, the project is considered an Alternative Universe that deviates from the canon source following the conclusion of Boruto and Kawaki\u2019s battle.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShortly after Boruto defeated Kawaki, he was quick in his response and ultimately saved Naruto from his injuries, and with Naruto still alive, the Shinobi Union quickly eliminated Kara, a major threat to their operations. This triumph temporarily cemented shinobi as more reliable than the technology that had been created, inciting moral in the people, and ultimately preventing the end of shinobi. Regardless, those who still treasured technology continued innovating, hellbent on proving their superiority over shinobi, and the samurai, who seemed to have gained slight traction due to their role in the Shinobi Union, begun openly advertising their own work. As the three factions fought for a monopoly over missions and jobs, they distracted one another, preventing them from seeing the spawn of various Yokai and entities in their lands until it was too late. An army of demons, led by a leader of some sort, challenged the world, seeking to conquer the human realm for their own.\n\nThe Shinobi Union rose up to stop this and successfully did so, however not without major casualties to the world. Many innocent people were killed, the land was destroyed and forever changed, the shinobi that fought were either killed in battle or killed from the flux of natural energy and corruptive chakra that had tainted their chakra pathway systems, leading to generations of chakra mutants affected by their parent\u2019s battle. In this war, Sasuke and Naruto sacrificed themselves to protect the shinobi realms, effectively pushing back the Yokai and stopping the first wave. While the other Five Kage survived, they found their bodies damaged, and eventually, they perished as well. With a power gap left, the Shinobi Union collapsed, once again splitting up the villages and offering the opportunity to the Samurai and tech-orientated warriors to claim jobs. Seventy years have passed since that battle, and over the course of those seven decades, the Yokai have returned in larger numbers, and somehow stronger. In areas where the Ten-Tails directly interacted with the world, the demons are titanic and powerful, yet, due to the God Tree\u2019s roots being planted in the entire world, every place contains Yokai of some sort now, and sometimes, even entire climates have been changed.\n\nOn top of the problems the Yokai have brought, the evil organization, Kumoyami, led by Kochi Uzumaki, have sided and subjugated the invading yokai. The means by which this was done is unknown. Kochi plans to use her Yokai army to restore the balance between good and evil, effectively turning the current world into an utterly peaceful, dull, and stable world.\n\n(You're welcome. I just saved you from having to read #lore in the server xD)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWith that in mind, come and join this just-recently-made server! We are set in a post-apocalyptic world where demons have invaded the Shinobi World. Join the Shinobi forces or the Samurai as we fight against Kochi Uzumaki and her band of dangerous groupies!\n\nNOTE: I did not make this server! I am posting it for a friend!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm currently looking for a long term roleplay partner because I've been finding myself really wanting to write lately. I have about seven years of writing experience and I am eighteen years old. To keep this sweet and simple I'm looking for someone who would be interested in creating a unique world for our characters to survive within, a sort of sandbox world if you will. If you have any questions about that I don't mind answering to clear things up. \n\nAnyways, I am also searching for someone who can write a decent amount such as two paragraphs or more. I can't stress this enough. There have been multiple occasions where my partners start out strong but fail to carry out when it comes to length. These replies usually die down to a sentence or two and I will not tolerate it. I really want to grow as a writer and I don't see myself doing that when given a few sentences to work with. \n\nIf you're interested or just have questions shoot me a message. I look forward to hearing from you! ",

            "selftext": "Everyone told you moving down to the deep American south would be a bad idea, but it actually hasn't been that bad so far.\n\nThe people in the neighborhood were all friendly and welcomed you right in, you found a nice job that's making you decent money, and life is going pretty well.\n\nOne peculuar thing is noticable though. It seems to be a fashion statment among some of the town's members to wear a rather unique pendant, and this is even more popular with members of the local church. It's much like a normal cross, but the bottom extends into an arrow shape, and looks to be peircing a skull with vampire teeth and a pentagram on the forehead. When asked about what it means, anyone wearing it will usually say something about it being a fashon statment and look to change the subject.\n\nAsside from that minot quirk, life is nice down here, until one night in early December. A couple neighbors offered to give you a ride home from work, but took an odd detour into the woods away from town.\n\nThat's when things get weird, they all suddenly grab you and produce nasty looking knives, and......are those fangs they have?\n\nWhile the sight of their fangs becomes more and more clear, the knives close in and get ready to kill. But just as they're about to begin, a gunshot rings through the woods, popping the driver's head like a tomato in a drill press.\n\nThe knife weilders start to scramble as the squeel of tires can be heard, along with more gunshots and shouting. They leave the car, and start running, but not before they're all gunned down by several people in a silver hummer that drives up near you, with the same cross and skull mark pinted on the side.\n\nSeveral people who look geared to fight come out, while two stay in the truck. Most go over to the freshly shot corpses, while a large man in his mid twenties walks up to the car.\n\n\"They're gone, are you okay?\" He asks as he bends doen to open the door for you.\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nHey there, thanks for reading all that! I came up with this idea a while ago, and wondered if anyone else would enjoy it as well.\n\nIf it apeals to you at all, then feel free to hit me up on in DMs and we can talk further. See you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello! Don't let the name fool you, I'm a 22-year-old female, name's Olivia. The name is a reference to an old game that I love - and if you get the reference, I think we'd enjoy talking to each other. But anywho, as the  title implies I'm looking for potential RP partners, as well as potential friends. I like OOC chat just as much as RP-ing - I like to talk to my partners, get to know them, see how their life is going, and plan things out. So if you're already uninterested, thank you at least for taking the time to read this far! Have a good one!\n\nIf you're still around, then here's a little about me: I live in Florida, USA, on the EST. I'm not asking you to be in my timezone or even near it, I never much cared either way, but I know it's important to figuring out when we can write. I have 9-10 years RP and writing experience, so while I lack the self-esteem to call myself a Master, I'm certainly no novice either. I'm a horrible night-owl, so it won't be until about 4:30 or 5 in the afternoon (my time) that I'll be at the computer, but with no life, I'll be present and attentive all the way until about 6 or 7 in the morning (my time). Unless I get a job that doesn't have a night or graveyard shift, this sleep schedule is not going to change, so I totally understand if we don't work out because of it. No hard feelings.\n\nWith that out of the way, here's what I'm looking for in a partner: Potential friendship. This is supposed to be fun, like a hang-out, not a business relationship where we just write and never talk. I want a genuine back-and-forth, to exchange ideas, talk about the RP, compliment each other, maybe give some criticisms. Talk and vent about life. I'm also looking for consistency - I'm not the \"one reply per day\" kind of RP-er. I want a consistent back-and-forth for an amount of time. I get that life happens, and that's fine - Lord knows my girlfriend keeps me active - but don't just poof on me and take all day to respond without saying anything, and then expect me not to say something or poke you. If you've got something going on, I like to consider myself understanding, it's perfectly fine. Just please let me know. I'm looking for advanced literacy in the actual writings, I'm totally cool with text speak when we're chatting to each other, but not in the writing itself. Also NSFW-content is a must - I'd go into detail, but that's against this subreddit's rules, so I'll just say that while it's probably not going to be the driving force in the RP's, I want it present for realism and fun. That's about all I can think of, I'm probably forgetting some stuff but oh-well.\n\nNow for a few genres I'm cool with. Please keep in mind that this isn't the whole list, I'll be leaving many out so as not to make this already-giant post even bigger. (It won't be listed, but History and Historical Fiction is a no for me. Sorry, not into history.):\n\n- High Fantasy\n- Low Fantasy\n- Urban Fantasy\n- Sci-Fi Fantasy\n- Sci-Fi\n- Modern\n- Slice of Life\n- Apocalypse (Nukes, zombies, what-have-you)\n- Gritty\n- Horror\n- Romance (big one here)\n- And others.\n\nI'm just as OK with Fandoms as I am with making our own original thing, so here's some of the fandoms I can think of off the top of my head that I'm cool with:\n\n- Fallout (Love this)\n- TES\n- Lord of the Rings\n- Game of Thrones\n- The Walking Dead\n- Gears of War\n- Dishonored\n- Naruto\n- DBZ\n- Bleach\n- Fulmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n- MLP (Yes, I'm a furry, and furries are welcome to message me)\n- Dark Souls Series\n- Bloodborne\n- State of Decay\n- And others. Not a lot of anime though, mostly games. I'm a big gamer.\n\nI DO NOT WRITE FOR CANON CHARACTERS. I'm sorry, but that's not my thing. OC-only, I'm not going to write for Marcus Fenix or Corvo or Rick Grimes or Jon Snow, nor do I want you doing it. That's really my biggest rule that I can think of. So, if you're still here and you're interested, shoot me a PM telling me about yourself and talking about the ad here, and if I'm interested I'll toss you my Discord and we can get rolling. Cheers!",

            "selftext": "Hello all, I have made a Bleach RP called Bleach 3rd Phantom: The Winter War. It is based on Bleach 3rd Phantom but if you have not played the game you'll be fine. This takes place during The Winter War Arc. Basically an AU of what could of happened and adding the protagonist of 3rd Phantom Matsuri and Fujimaru into the mix.\n\nLore:A few months have passed after the events of 3rd Phantom the Kudo twins are well adjusted to the human world exploring it and enjoying its many splendors.\nHowever word has reached them about Aizen's plans, now the Kudo twins must protect their new home from a man they once called friend. The Winter War has arrived.\n\nInfo:You can play as an already established character or make your own OC. They can be any of the established races in Bleach. We are lgbt friendly too just FYI. \n\nWith the RPs interaction you can change the outcome of the Winter War. Every decision will rebound back you regardless if it is good or bad. There are boundaries and actions will have consequences in here.\n\nRequirements:\nWe are not picky on rules and only ask for you to follow the discord rules once inside. We have unique roles for people to use based on their race and role.\n\nWe are newbie and beginner friendly but we do require you to try to be descriptive. It just to help you develop into better RPers.\n\nPlease be ready to write fight scenes and be able to handle blood battles!\n\nAlso please note we will not have any ship, Kubo, or any bashing this is for fun. This goes for character bashing too.\n\nIf you are interested message me for the discord link. I hope this will bring in some awesome people to RP with!",
