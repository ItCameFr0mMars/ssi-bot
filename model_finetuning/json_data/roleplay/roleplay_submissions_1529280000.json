I do know, however, that I want it to be a tragic romance spanning the course of the war. I want to slowly develop our characters over time and explore how the war affects them and changes them forever. As to whether or not the ending will be tragic? Well, we'll just have to see how things play out. ;) I look forward to working out a story with you and am always open to suggestions.\n\nI don't have many requirements. You don't need to be an expert on the period, just a basic knowledge of it is good enough for me. Also, please be literate. My replies are generally short, but I try to avoid one-liners. I'm also incapable of writing a novel while RPing. :P just wanted to get that out of the way. I look forward to hearing from you. :)\n\nAlso: Though the overall tone of this RP will be quite dark, there will be lighter moments as well. I am a *huge* fan of fluff and sweetness!",

I'm okay with roleplaying with someone from another timezone, just as long as we both have times where we can have back\\-to\\-back replies and more than one message per day!  \n\nFor a *type of apocalypse,* I am fine with either **zombies or nuclear apocalypses.** I prefer zombies, but we can spice up what type of zombies there are, how fast they are, how quick they spread, how the virus spreads and stages of infection. This is something I enjoy discussing and planning.  \n\nI also do not mind whether we set the roleplay 10 minutes or 10 years from the outbreak, anything is fine with me as long as it goes by the story.\n\n**My rules are really simple if you are interested:**\n\n* Please do not rush the relationship between our characters, I would love to build a romance up, but starting off as acquaintances, maybe not even trust or like each other, but I'm looking for something long\\-term.\n* Please be able to mainly write in paragraphs.\n* Be literate!\n* Keep it as realistic as realistic goes when it comes to an apocalypse. No godmodding or superpowers.\n* Please don't rush my replies. And i won't rush yours! We both have lives!\n\nI'm looking for a dramatic based story between two characters who are trying to survive and have to pair up due to circumstances we can discuss. But throughout their friendship, hate, and romance, there will most likely always be drama. I am looking for a partner that can provide the skill in writing to experiment with angsty scenes, involving blood, gore, tension, disputes and death. As these scenes usually are NSFW, I am looking for someone 18\\+ to include these. I am also okay with doing sexual scenes, as long as it fits with the story, and isn't abused. \n\nI have a couple of ideas for these roleplays, including the 'immunity' concept, group rivalry's, partner survival, etc... But I would love for us to discuss things together and build up a world together.\n\nI can roleplay males or females, and mainly do pairings of MxF or FxF as I\u2019m inexperienced in doing MxM.\n\nI use discord to rp.\n\nSend me a message if you're up for it, and I will reply asap.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nWhen I was younger, I RPed a lot and was involved in some very sexual RPs and after some falling-outs with the various groups that I was in, I stopped. It's been about 3-5 years. Here as of late, I've been longing for the fun of RP again and I would love to jump back into it. If you are wondering why specifically female, it is because what I am most comfortable with. I am not necessarily looking for sexual RP so please do not think this is my intention. Here is sort of a rundown of what I am looking for to do/can do as well as not looking for:  \n\n\n\\- Smut is fine, just gotta talk about it first and see where our comfort levels lie\n\n\\- I am a fan of Marvel and enjoy to read and don't mind a Marvel RP\n\n\\- Historical stuff is great. I have a passion for history\n\n\\- Modern day is what my previous experience is based in. The RPs had a heavy focus in RPing daily life. It was sort of a calming thing. These are great.\n\n\\- Anime/Manga is out of the question. I'm not well versed in these to confidently right.\n\n\\- Alternative History is awesome\n\n\\- More, just ask!  \n\n\nSide Note: With it being 3-5 years for me, my writing might be sloppy here and there but totally willing to take constructive criticism if I make mistakes. Looking for someone that doesn't mind if this is detailed nor long term just willing to work with possible grammar mistakes (at the start).\n\nIf you're interested, PM me and we can talk about possibilities!",

            "selftext": "Hello! Thanks for checking in! To explain the title, I need a paragraph or two. I'm a roleplayer with several years of experience, but the experience itself is kind of specific. When roleplaying, I've mostly stuck to fandoms, and as such, I'm much more comfortable with playing canon characters rather than original ones. So I was looking for a partner who would be OK with that.\n\nMind you, that does not meant I want \\*you\\* to play canon too. You could do that if you want to, or play an OC, whatever feels more comfortable to you. The limit is really only to myself. If you're fine with this, I'll list a few other things for the sake of clarity.\n\n**-** Any age/experience level would be welcome, unless you intend to smut, in which case you do have to be over 18 (I am 18+ myself);\n\n**-** If you're extremely against some kind of theme (like death or violence), please let me know. We might plan beforehand, but if we don't, I might spring some heavy stuff unexpectedly, and I don't want to hurt anyone by doing it.\n\n**-** Romance/smut is quite fine: I have a big preference for either F/F or M/M. Yet I will do M/F if you really want me to. I can play either gender, with preference towards females.\n\n**-** I like to have at least a paragraph of a response to work with. But so long as we're moving the story forward, you can't go wrong with any length.\n\n**-** I don't demand that we are partners for long: just that we do our best to make the experience satisfying. As such, if anything grows dull or you wanna shift gears, let me know.\n\n**-** I fully intend to listen to your request of what character you might want me to play out of the canon characters once the universe is decided upon: just keep in mind that I can't promise to properly depict every single character. I'll always least make an attempt, though.\n\nAlright. As for the fandoms that I have... I do like *a lot* of stuff. I'm more familiar with games in general, however. I know few anime and movies/books. I'll follow this up with the fandoms more prominent in my head.\n\nThe games that come to mind are, in no particular order:\n\n* Fire Emblem (mostly anything between \\[and including\\] Blazing Sword and Awakening; also Heroes);\n* Persona (especially 3 &amp; 4);\n* Touhou Project;\n* Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney;\n* Hyperdimension Neptunia;\n* Danganronpa (especially the first);\n* Kingdom Hearts;\n* Tales of (Graces, mostly);\n* Kid Icarus;\n* Disgaea;\n* Rune Factory (3 / 4 / Frontier)\n\n... and there is a bunch more that are smaller cravings. \n\nAnime-wise, I do have a soft spot for card game anime. Yu-Gi-Oh, WIXOSS and the like! Other than that... most of the ones I see are either really bittersweet ones (Madoka Magica, Princess Tutu) or some shonen (My Hero Academia, Noragami, etc.). Feel free to check in with me! I don't bite. Heck, I'd just be happy to receive the message.\n\nThanks for the attention and have a good day!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n- I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\n- Real Life Romance\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- Sci-Fi\n\n- Mecha\n\n- Halo\n\n- Elder Scrolls\n\n- Destiny\n\n- Superhero\n\n- Apocalypse\n\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

            "selftext": "First of all, thank you for reading. Second, I am super laid back and ready to write! If romance is included I\u2019m already interested! Let\u2019s talk and set some stuff up!\n\nWho are you?: My name is Maddie and I am twenty-one years old and I am located in the lovely mountains of Kentucky. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for years and years as a hobby. I am found in the EST timezone. I am obsessed with Shinsou Hitoshi, cats, anime, learning about cultures, true crime, food, and drawing.\n\nWhere you RP: Kik, Skype, Discord, Email, maybe somewhere else if you ask!\n\nWhat you RP: Boku no/My Hero Academia, Naruto, Monster Munsume, One Piece, Pokemon, Supernatural (genre) and more so just ask me! It will mostly be movies, anime, cartoons, books.\n\nWhat you are looking for: I am looking for a mainly romantic story for my OC. I WILL double with you no matter what, M/M, F/F, whatever else you are looking for. I can try to play any character from the anime listed below, but having a list to choose from is nice. Angst, fluff, hurt/comfort, slice of life, horror, supernatural (genre) is fine with me!\n\nCharacters you RP: I will usually always play as an original female character, but I will be happy to double as whoever you choose. \n\nCharacters you\u2019re looking to interact with: These are listed from MOST to LEAST wanted.\nMHA: Shinsou Hitoshi, Ojirou Mashirao , Sero Hanta , Bakugou Katsuki. \n\nNaruto: Gaara , Kankuro, Kiba Inuzuka, Shinki\n\nOne Piece: Sanji, Zoro, Law, Bellemy, Bartolomeo, Luffy???, Chopper??\n\nSnow White With The Red Hair: Obi, Zen, Ryu, Mitsuhide\n\nSuper Natural: Demons , Lamiia/Naga , Were creatures , Faeries, Witches/Warlocks/Wizards , Vampires ???\n\nParagraph or dialog form?: I prefer paragraph form, please! \n\nGrammar/Length requirements: Please have some decent grammar! No text talk unless it is in an actual text or note between characters. As for length I prefer two upwards to ten paragraphs, or around 650 words per side depending on how into the roleplay we both are. Two to three should work fine but sometimes I end up rambling.\n\nShort-term or long term?: Both! I vastly prefer long term. \n\nGenres I roleplay: Romance, horror, fantasy, tragedy, supernatural, hurt/comfort, fluff, angst.\n\nAs my partner, a person would have to: Become my friend! I love meeting new people and hearing stories. Talk with me OOC frequently if you can! Respect my boundaries and I\u2019ll do the same with you.\n\nOther ideas?: I have a few! \n\nA commoner girl catching the sights of a prince and allowed to move within the castle walls.\n\nForced marriage between two warring countries.\n\nMedieval assassin who falls in love with his target and decides to create a life with her. \n\nAn herbalist/traveler moving through a creature\u2019s (vampire, werebeast, etc) territory is taken as a hostage/wife. \n\nA daughter from a very wealthy family of hunters is gifted a rare beast for her birthday, and the two end up falling in love. \n\nIf I sparked your interest, please message me with a little about yourself and what you\u2019d be interested in roleplaying! I look forward to talking with you! ",

            "selftext": "Hey! As the title suggests I'm looking to start a Fallout related Roleplay! The announcement of a new game as got me pretty hyped and inspired!\n\nI'm a big fan of the grittiness that comes with Fallout games. Raiders, Slavers, Gross Mutants.. all that fun stuff! My goal for the style of RP is something with a lot of dark humor, kind of like the games!\n\nAs for where we could base the location of our RP... Any of the game settings work for me! I particularly love the barren wastelands of the Mojave or the hustle and bustle of The Commonwealth!\n\nSo.. my character I'd like to play! I've worked around with this character for awhile but would love to finally get the ball rolling in an RP with her.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Name:\\*\\* Clarke Remington\n\n\\*\\*Age:\\*\\* 19\n\n\\*\\*Race:\\*\\* Human\n\n\\*\\*Sex:\\*\\* Female\n\n\\*\\*Personality:\\*\\* Coming from a large raider encampment... Clarke was your typical low life. Rude, violent, chem addicted and just a tad bit crazy. Despite all this the woman still has a sense of innocents to her even though she has done unspeakable acts. Clarke has survived her whole life being a scrappy runt and she'll continue to do so to get by.\n\n\\*\\*Appearance:\\*\\* 5'7, Scrawny, Caucasian. Half of her black hair shaved off on one side, Poorly functioning prosthetic leg that is repurposed from a gen 1 synth.\n\nRegion of residence: Currently wandering after her raider gang was wiped out. Nomadic.\n\nOccupation:  Thief, Raider, Chem Smuggler\n\n\\*\\*Faction:\\*\\* Raider\n\n\\*\\*Bio:\\*\\* Clarke was born into a rough raider gang in the Commonwealth. The gang was called \"The Lost Ones\" and controlled a part of Boston at the time. Clarke was just another face in the crowd growing up. She slipped and slid her way through life as best she could. Around the age of thirteen Clarke lost her leg to a land mine while out scavenging. Thankfully her gang had some enslaved doctors to help assist their members. What was not so great was the replacement leg she got was practically a hunk of metal with a foot on it. Over time the leg has been worn down, vandalized and  remains somewhat functioning. Clarke walks with a bit of a limp because of her metal appendage but she gets by.\n\nCurrently she is wandering the American wastes, looking for some sort of purpose after the \"The Lost Ones.\" fell many years ago. The outfit she currently wears is a beaten down flight jacket that is clearly too big for her and a dirty white tank top. She also sports a ruined pair of tight pants that have holes exposing her faulty metal leg that has lovely messages on the side that are carved in like, \"EAT SHIT\". Finally she has a pair of heavy combat boots she uses to adventure around the wasteland.\n\n\\*\\*SPECIAL Stats:\\*\\*\n\nS - 3\n\nP - 6\n\nE - 5\n\nC - 5\n\nI - 3\n\nA - 7\n\nL - 6\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs you can see I've had a bit of time to think about her as a character and her past. The question is.. what will you play? Well that is totally up to you! I'm open to suggesting certain things to base a character off of but I'd love to see you get \\*\\*creative\\*\\* with this! I'm also open to twisting my character's past if it helps with forming a great narrative between the two.\n\nAnyways, I post around a paragraph or two per response, can respond pretty quickly and I'm open to NSFW themes. Shoot me a PM if you're interested!",

I'm not a grammar nazi, but I do expect my partners to be literate.  When writing, I'd say my posts tend to be 2-4 paragraphs, though I'll try to match my partner.  As always, quality above quantity, and sometimes small posts are justified.  I'm currently working part time while training for my pilot's license, so I'm available fairly frequently.  I love to chat with partners OOC, whether we are brainstorming on our plots and characters or just shooting the breeze.\n\n**Plotlines:** Currently, I'm most interested in doing something involving Fallout, or a superhero themed RP.  I've been watching too many marvel movies, and just started on My Hero Academia!  Feel free to pitch any other ideas my way as well, though I make no promises that I will be interested.  I'd prefer to play with OC's no matter what we do.\n\n**NSFW Content:**I am fully comfortable with adult themes, language, violence, etc. etc.  I am also open to romantic subplots between characters.  That said, I am not interested in playing out any sex scenes.  If they come up, I would prefer that we simply fade to black and resume afterwards.\n\nI think that's about it!  Please feel free to ask me any questions that you have.  I appreciate your time spend reading, and wish you luck in all of your future stories!",

I do know, however, that I want it to be a tragic romance spanning the course of the war. I want to slowly develop our characters over time and explore how the war affects them and changes them forever. As to whether or not the ending will be tragic? Well, we'll just have to see how things play out. ;) I look forward to working out a story with you and am always open to suggestions.\n\nI don't have many requirements. You don't need to be an expert on the period, just a basic knowledge of it is good enough for me. Also, please be literate. My replies are generally short, but I try to avoid one-liners. I'm also incapable of writing a novel while RPing. :P just wanted to get that out of the way. I look forward to hearing from you. :)\n\nAlso: Though the overall tone of this RP will be quite dark, there will be lighter moments as well. I am a *huge* fan of fluff and sweetness!",

            "selftext": "[Solvitur Charta](http://solviturchartar.com/) is a roleplaying site with various games (and people) seeking new players and adventures. \n\nBelow is a complete overview of groups, partner searches adn interest checks. Come join the fun! \n\n[**Guardians of the Keep**](http://solviturchartar.com/threads/guardians-of-the-keep-ooc.130/) **is a fantasy adventure.**  \n\n*Welcome to Noverra.* \n\n*More specifically, the  continent of Eilin. Half the continent is dominated by the Verid Empire,  a powerful civilization lead by the young Empress Freja. Despite it  being only her third year as regent, she has shown promise as an  excellent leader. Her methods are simple but efficient. So long as  citizens pay their taxes, abide to their local leadership, and follow  the law, they are free to live their lives as they see fit. However,  tensions are rising as trouble brews just over the horizon.*  \n *Westward, the colonization effort in the untamed territory known as the  Wyldlands are turning sour. Monster attacks, though common in the area,  are growing at an alarming rate. This, added with the dwindling supplies  and reports of ill treatment, have riled up the colonies' conquered  population. Rumors of a rebellion are on the rise, and its only a matter  of time before they come to fruition.*  \n  \n\n[**Punks of Atlas**](http://solviturchartar.com/threads/punks-of-atlas-ooc.48/) **is a Science Fiction adventure**\n\n*Punks of Atlas is a Cyberpunk Fantasy  Roleplay set in the world of Atlas. Ever wondered what it'd be like for a  Medieval Fantasy based world to advance into the far flung future? Well  here it is! This world is one of magic and mystery as well as  megacorporations and space age tech. Welcome to the future, welcome to  the hellish techno future. A dystopia is what most would call it. The  majority of people live in poverty while the rich get richer and those  high up in the world just keep getting higher. But that's where the  Punks come in. Punks reject their role in society and seek to break out  on their own. You're gonna be a Punk, definitely. Or would you rather  just work a dead end job that comes with no retirement and enough money  to barely feed yourself let alone a family?*  \n\n[**Aella**](http://solviturchartar.com/threads/aella-wanderers-caf%C3%A9.45/) **is a non-traditional/episodic multigenre RP**\n\n *Located in the In Between - the place between worlds - is a single  village. Or rather, a single street of shops and diners. One of these  would be Wanda's Caf\u00e9.*  \n *It's always busy with people of all words and regulars know it's smart  to listen to Wanda. Despite eyeing petite and fragile, her generally  reputation precedes her. The worlds, all of them, are full of people who  mean others harm. There are murders, kidnappers, Krakens and much  worse. It is said there is even a world where Hitler won and that world  is in chaos and disarray.*\n\n*However, rumours and speculation isn't what brought you here. Whatever  the reason you are now here, your evening won't consist of alcohol and  flirting or whatever else you could find here it seems.*  \n *A guy you've never met approaches you with a confidence and insolence  rarely seen. He invites himself to your table and talks to you like he  knows you. He definitely knows Wanda and she does nothing to interfere.  Anybody who knows Wanda knows she doesn't take kindly to this kind of  behaviour. He ends his tale with the request you help take care of a  \"small issue\". Shouldn't take up too much of your time, presuming you  listen to Wanda along the way...* \n\n***Partner searches:*** \n\n[**ForeverWandering \\[member\\]**](http://solviturchartar.com/threads/1x1-partner-search.50/) \n\n*I enjoy just about every genre/setting except realistic high  school/college life, Steampunk, Anime, Furries/Anthros, Cartoons, and  Video Games. I can play both male and female characters (preferably  females), can double/triple, can give my partner(s) multiple  decent-sized paragraphs, and can write in the third person (past tense)  perspective.* \n\n***Interest Checks:*** \n\n[**Whisper of Madness**](http://solviturchartar.com/threads/intrest-check-whispers-of-madness.41/)\n\n*Though many are plagued by whispers in the darkness of Arkham, rumors  spoken by half mad citizens spread like wildfire. Hope of sanity, in a  world maddened by monsters from another realm. Whispers like these have  always been, often leaving the tongues of those newly maddened. Everyone  hopes for sanity\u2019s soothing touch after witnessing the horrors this  world has to offer, it\u2019s just the way. Only, there\u2019s something different  about these words. They bring fear to the cultists, whom scramble to  silence the citizens.* \n\n[**The 8th Continent**](http://solviturchartar.com/threads/the-8th-continent-a-tale-of-exploration.29/)\n\n *A mysterious 8th continent has been discovered far north of the known  world, ushering in a golden age of exploration and discovery. Nations  and peoples scramble to claim as much of it as they possibly can for  their own, funding deep reaching expeditions and colonial towns and  cities along its shores and surrounding islands. Border disputes and  skirmishes escalate each year, threatening to consume the world in  all-out war. To make matters worse, scouts from all nations report an  odd cold, snow, and ice coming from a small ruin in the center of the  continent, and an increase in the number of undead spotted. Dismissed at  first, the reports grow each year, and the nations are starting to take  notice. Something grows at the center of the island, and each nation  falls to old prejudices, blaming others.* ",

( I like to get pretty dark sometimes )\n- Someone who is 18 or older! \n- Someone with a lot of ideas to share.\n- Someone who can be active most times of the day.\n\n\nRoleplay wise I am into more modern based or realism. Though if we can make something interesting enough I would be open to exploring other genres. \n\nEven though I am open to darker themes i\u2019m not here to cater to your fantasies. Please make sure they don\u2019t take over the whole rp. Also no asking for pictures/calls, If you do so you\u2019ll be quickly blocked.\n\nIf anyone is interested, hit up my dms!

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. To introduce myself, I'm a 24yo uni student who is looking for someone to RP in the Marvel universe. I feel like the movies and RPs have largely focused on the current Avengers lineup, so if at all possible I would love for this to have elements of the Young/New Avengers (Hulkling, Wiccan, etc.) Be whoever you want! I would certainly not say no if someone wanted to do Teddy, Billy, or someone else but if you want to do your own OC that's totally fine by me, as I personally will have an OC. I really prefer flexibility with these different universes, and I really would prefer it if my partner wasn't too much of a stickler on \"Marvel fandom rules\". Obviously I don't plan on having Harley Quinn come running into the picture, but as to other fantasy characters like werewolves, vampires, demons, etc., why not? Hell with all the characters out there surely it wouldn't be too out of the ordinary. Romantic and/or NSFW elements are certainly welcome, but it would be M/M pairings (that being said, if we're getting into NSFW stuff I would like there to be some kind of romance behind it). For that kind of thing I absolutely require my partner to be 18+. \n\nSo, on to the format, structure, the boring bit. I try my best to be as detailed as possible; when I RP I really enjoy forming a mental image of the scene, and so I would prefer you be detailed as well. Though I'm flexible when it comes to length, we will have a bad time if all I see is \"Character X says \"Ha\" and sits down on a couch\". Obviously there will be time where our characters will mostly be engaging in dialogue, so again I'm not trying to sound like I have a stick up my bum. All in all, let's try to have a happy balance.\n\nI definitely prefer to RP over Discord or Skype. This gives us a happy back-and-forth dynamic which I LOVE. I typically respond quickly, but I also understand that life happens. I'm not going to harass you for a response if two days pass by and there's nothing, but if you'll be gone for more than a week or some serious stuff is going down, I'd definitely appreciate some communication. \n\nFinally to the last bit (I promise) even though this is RP I would love to develop some kind of friendship alongside it. The best kind of RP is when you can go OOC and have a laugh about what your characters are doing, and that kind of dynamic would be greatly appreciated. So if you are at all interested in what I'm offering or even a hint of this post caught your eye, feel free to send me a message! Let's see what kind of fun story we can strike up. Thanks for reading and take care.",

I\u2019m 20 and would prefer a partner around my age, nobody younger than 17 please! \n\nOn top of this, please be literate and a reasonably fluent writer! No one liners and since we\u2019re doing OCs, please please please don\u2019t make a Mary Sue \u2014 Cor\u2019b\u00e1n with bright blue hair, an eagle companion, and a tragic past yet a heart ready for love would have been killed on day one and you know it. I\u2019m looking for compelling, flawed, relatable characters and all that good shit. \n\nThanks for reading if you got this far! Chuck me a DM if you\u2019re keen! ",

But he would break more rules for her, and not take her to... clubs for sexual deviants. It would be much more of an in-house thing, but in the doors of his office? She would become his queen.\n\nSlice of life, drama, slight romance, and totalitarian themes are what I desire for this.

My human could be welcomed with opened arms. Or poorly misunderstood and mistreated.

I am able to rp mostly at night, and pretty much every night. If for some reason I can't, I'll try to let you know, but please forgive me if it slips!\nExperience: I've been roleplaying for about 10 years now... so that's about half of my life. I'd say I'm pretty good at it by now! I consider myself literate.\nTypical Posts: Minimum 4 paragraphs, usually, and it can get kinda crazy long depending on how much I'm digging the rp. I post in third person, and am willing to background NPC.\nWill RP: Canon Characters, Original Characters, Canon settings, original settings, smut, no smut, romance, platonic, up to triples, any gender, any sexuality, Crossovers, AU\nWill not rp: We can discuss that together.\nPlaces I'll rp: Gdocs&gt;Discord&gt;Other Sites&gt;Reddit\n\nI have an EXTENSIVE list of canon settings I enjoy, so feel free to suggest literally anything and there's a chance I might be into it. For now, here is a list of canon settings that I'm craving beyond belief. Please don't take it as a MUST. If you'd like to see a complete list of canon settings that I like to rp in, message me!\nMarvel - Harry Potter - Lord of the Rings - Detroit Become Human - Disney - Danganronpa - Homestuck - Star Wars - Legend of Zelda - The Elder Scrolls - Fallout - Borderlands - Magic the Gathering  - Detroit Become Human\n\nAnd now here's a list of original settings and ideas that I've been toying around with, I'd really love to roleplay any of these, too! I'm also open to your ideas... so just pester me!\n- Human x Ghost \n:: Trainhoppers\nI have a great idea for a romance rp about the ghost of a crust punk who fell under the rails, and yet another punk who is currently hopping the train that this particular ghost haunts. \n:: Wrong Number\nA ghost has inhabited a piece of technology, and is haunting a human!\n:: The House on Blossom Way\nA ghost is haunting the house a human just moved into!\n\n-Historical Fiction\n:: Revolutionary Wars \nCould be any revolution, but I especially love the French Revolution. This is lowkey just an excuse to see uniforms from that era though...\n:: At Sea\nI love me a good ocean romance. Could be pirates, could be naval units... could be mermaids too, but I guess that's more fantasy than historical, ha!\n\n-Other Garbage\n:: Androids\nEither a pair of escapee androids, or an android and their owner!\n:: Anything High Fantasy\n:: Vampires??? Werewolves??\n:: Literally anything\n\nOkay, I give up. Basically... you should message me. I'm sure we can come up with something.",

            "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nFallout 76 looks bloody great doesn't it? I've played the games since the isometric days, invested months into the franchise over the years - I'm a massive fan of the ethos.\n\nI\u2019m seeking another detailed para/multi-para roleplayer for a Fallout themed roleplay. I have a character I\u2019ve tweaked for some time; a reclusive and shrouded ghoul sharpshooter. Born before the Great War in England (migrated to the US), Lee has spent the past two centuries honing skills in survival and other various skills through hunting game and reading books respectively. 200 years of modifying and maintaining the same .308 hunting rifle has also made him an impressive sharpshooter, able to shoot down animals with ease and avoid trouble early. \n\nLee is a hermit, who avoids contact with humans. His only real contact being with travelling caravans to trade meat and pelts for books and supplies.\n\nI have a few story ideas we can discuss but welcome to consider yours. Locations wise I'd say we stick to a more recent fallout game but I'm open to ideas.\n\nI have a google doc to detail and refine this character, including his  SPECIAL, Traits and Skills. I have been known to use Skype and Google Docs however I'm very keen to give Discord a try, as it appears to be the new platform and I'm easing my way into it\n\nBoardwalk Empire's Richard Harrow is an excellent example of Lee, the reclusive behaviour and the voice especially. If you watch the show you\u2019ll know but I can easily provide short clips to give you an idea.\n\nWhat I\u2019m not looking for:\nGary/Mary Sues, One-liners, Overtly sexual themes, Kik or someone with limited Fallout knowledge\n\nI\u2019m GMT based, attached and have a full time job. My aim is to write regularly as I can access discord via Phone and Laptop. Someone with similar circumstances (or understanding of) would be ideal. \n\nInterested? Drop me a line, your discord even ",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit! My name is Danielle and i'm a British 18 year old, in the time zone of BST (British Summer Time). I have been roleplaying for around 5 years now, and i'm craving a slice of life/realistic romance story. Whether it\u2019s high school life, office life, cliche meetings, or even some dramatic themes like criminal partners - I\u2019m really interested in any ideas or plots you may have. I\u2019m up for researching some with you and coming up with one together. \n\nFor this roleplay, I would like to roleplay a female character preferably, and I am up for FxF or FxM, whichever takes your fancy. \n\nHere's somethings about how i roleplay;\n\n- I like detailed roleplays. Usually I do about 3 paragraphs a post, but it depends on the situation and where we are in the rp. If we are at a scene where there is significantly less action then it\u2019s acceptable to just post 1 paragraph or a couple of sentences.\n\n- I roleplay in 3rd, but can do 1st if you prefer.\n\n- I like NSFW scenes. This includes gore, violence and blood. When it comes to sexual scenes I am totally up for doing them if you are 18+ AND if our characters are of age. I would only want these sexual scenes when it is appropriate, I really do not want to focus on these scenes. We can discuss this more.\n\n- Please don\u2019t rush my reply, I\u2019m sure we are both busy at times, and I will respect when you don\u2019t reply. But I would like us to have a post out atleast within 2 days of the last reply. Don\u2019t leave it too long. If you reply almost instantly then that's great!\n\nCan't wait to hear from some of you!\n",

If you're not into indulging in AND enjoying these themes, than this is not for you. No compromises.\n\n\n~ The year is 2037. We live in a world where there are people born with special abilities. Mutants, if you will. Albeit very rare, the common population and government are scared of what they don't understand. What do they do instead of getting to know their counterparts? They lock down their cities and outlaw the presence of mutants within city limits. The civilians that sympathize with mutants are charged with betraying the US and executed, leaving no tolerance for anything mutant related. \n\n~ We live in Stormport. A city that is as dreary as it is dangerous. The crime rate is high, it's raining 90% of the time, and there are MCF (Mutant Control Force) patrols everywhere. It's like a more urban, modernized Gotham City if you're into comics. But you know what? We call it home. We mutants.. call it home. You and I, along with three of our good friends (Who are also mutants.) live together in the grungy part of town inside of a cheap apartment. We're young. We live life. Going to trashy parties. Smoking. Drinking.. among other vices. It's all about having fun for us. Here's where the path branches. We could decide to turn over a new leaf and use our powers for good, Use them for our own personal and selfish reasons, or just cause pure havoc and try to take over the city. Maybe we could just have regular drama like pregnancy, or addiction. Hell, we could even turn ourselves in after an accident of some kind. \n\n~ I would like for our characters to have a really close, fun, flirty, and inseparable bond with each other, as they've known each other for 5 years. It could be more, like FWB or a relationship if you would like. Just specify. Please note that if we just have the close bond, it will eventually lead to heavy romance.\n\nMessage me on Reddit so we can move to another platform.\n\nYou WILL need a character with a reference picture or detailed description complete with your power.",

Roles custom made for whatever your pronouns are and whatever elemental type you happen to be. While it is a primarily paragraph roleplay experience, there are text-based chats aswell! There is a light application process (which is making a bio for your character(s)) for you to do to be accepted, but I promise it isn't too long. \n\nPlot events will be held biweekly in the main chat canon, which takes place 8 or so years after the events of USUM. The plot will be mostly made on the spot, as it must cross most regions and which regions are featured is up to the whim of the majority. \n\nThere will be no nsfw roleplay/imagery in this discord, and no, not even a nsfw chat for those specifically above 18. Minors and the sexually repulsed are people too, y'all. \n\nThis is mainly for experienced roleplayers, keep in mind! Paragraphs will be slung around. Come prepared for detail and emotion, folks.\n\nMore in the discord itself!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/tcXG3dU",

We plan to be a rather literate group, and therefore are asking that you are capable of creating a detailed biography of your character, and writing 3-5 sentences MINIMUM per roleplay.\n\nDarkness Awakened is a plot-based group roleplay that features factional strife and a spreading evil, with various nations, including the most powerful, the Empire of Vllaiistrae, and also an island of strictly mages, a group of evil religious leaders, and a royal court susceptible to corruption. Choose to fight the ancient forces working against the Empire or choose instead to craft a character that is out for his or her own betterment\u2014your choice! The plot essentially combines a holy war with class warfare, as the growing evil promises equality of all people and the dismantling of the decadent feudal system that governs the continent. We are especially looking for those well-versed in managing and moving a plot along, as at the moment, we are a bit lagging in action.

            "selftext": "As the title implies, I'm looking for a specific experience. I want to be a player in a GM/DM's world. I want to specifically *roleplay* in that world, so if it's a world you made for a game, I don't want to *play* the game as much as I want to roleplay the player character, if that makes any sense. Maybe it doesn't, I dunno, but I hope it makes enough sense to be understandable. Anyway, onto the ad!\n\nA little about me:\nI'm a 22-year-old female living in the EST of America. I have a decade of writing and RP experience under my belt, and I have a serious passion for writing. No school, no job, so nothing to interfere with our time except my girlfriend and my horrible sleep schedule. I get up out of bed around 5 in the afternoon, and don't go to sleep until about 7 in the morning, so between those times you will have my full attention for a solid ping-pong of back-and-forth responses. I'm perfectly comfortable doubling, tripling, even quadrupling in characters, it's just as easy for me as playing one, and I will only play female characters. I'm sorry, but that's non-negotiable. I'm not terribly interested in male characters, and have zero interest writing for one.\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n- An experience where you control the world around me, the background characters, side characters, and characters important to the story, while I control the player character(s). I react to the world as you, as the world, react to me.\n- Obviously the default for this kind of thing is a Fantasy setting, but I have no preference. If you've got a cool Sci-Fi world you want players for, I'm down. If you've figured out how to make a modern-esq world like this, I'll give it a shot.\n- A responsive, understanding, and generally nice partner. I'm not a \"one response a day/week\" kind of girl. If we can't have a back-and-forth going at *some* point (meaning setting up an RP date if we have to), I'm not interested. If you're gonna be rude and controlling, I'm not interested.\n- Romance, if possible, would be nice as a subplot, should one of my characters take an interest in one of those in the world. I would also prefer NSFW themes be present, and while it's an important thing for me, we can easily discuss it in private.\n- I'm furry-friendly! If your world has anthros in it, I'm fully down. Also LGBT+ friendly as I'm LGBT myself.\n\nWhat I'm *NOT* looking for:\n\n- Do not control my character. At all. Don't talk for them, don't make them move around unless it's a mundane task like following someone along during a conversation. I control my characters, you control everything else.\n- Actual game stuff. I love D&amp;D, but that's not what I'm looking for. I'm not gonna sit and make dice rolls to see if my Elf Mage casts a spell. This is an RP, I decide if she's going to cast the spell, but you can decide if her target dodges or whatever. Hopefully that makes sense.\n- God-modding. I'm not going to make an all-power character or characters right off the bat, ones that can just bulldoze through everything. If they end up that way later on, cool. I'm looking for genuine challenges and hardships that at least have the possibility of being overcome, even if it's not in the first time that I encounter it.\n\n\nThat's about all I can think of right now. Probably forgot some stuff, but hey, I'm only human. Sorry if any of that came of as rude or offensive, wasn't my intention, there are just some things I'm kinda stern on y'know? But anywho, if you're interested, shoot me a PM preferably with a brief description of your world or idea so I can get a good enough feel for what it is you want me to get into, and I'll toss you my Discord.

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone that would like to partner up and create a story based on relationships and romance. I appreciate all types of romance stories and like to incorporate interesting settings into them while staying within the realm of SoL. I like experimenting with pairings and creating stories that focus on character relationships. As long as it revolves around two characters falling in love or are currently in love, than I\u2019m more than happy to write about it, or hear any additions you\u2019d like to add. I\u2019m open to writing smut, but if you want, we can fade to black during any 18+ scenes. \n\nOne idea that I\u2019ve had for a while is a pairing between a cocky, alpha-male douchebag and a shy bookworm type girl that has trouble with talking to people. The alpha male gets introduced as an arrogant guy that only gets with women to fuck them. He sees the girl and immediately his mind goes to \u201cnew prey\u201d. However, the guy has a very soft and broken heart that he tries to hide by acting like a douchebag, so basically he builds a shell around his feelings and emotions so that no one could see them. I\u2019m thinking that the girl gets to his soft side and core and becomes more than a fuckbuddy to him as they truly both fall in love.\n\nAnyways, if you message me, I\u2019d like for you to be reliable with your responses (respond in at least like 2 days for the RP, if you can\u2019t, just let me know), practice decent grammar, and include some detail. I don\u2019t have a limit as to how much you can or can\u2019t write. I know I get writers block and can\u2019t think of anything too crazy to write about sometimes, so it\u2019s no big deal whatsoever if you only respond with just a sentence or two. There\u2019s only so many ways to elaborate on your character just saying no. I tend to match my partners length of writing, but usually it depends on the situation. I can write as little as a sentence to as long as 2-3 paragraphs. I\u2019d also like to keep this on Discord if that\u2019s okay. I think it\u2019s organized and it\u2019s a better interface than what Reddit provides. I also will do Kik, but I\u2019d much rather correspond via Discord. \n\nAnd I guess that\u2019s it! I\u2019ll be on for a while, but if you\u2019re seeing this later, don\u2019t be shy to reply. I\u2019m always open to new partners. Thanks for reading, and I hope to hear from you soon!\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Introduction:\n\nHello and welcome to my RP ad, I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful day! Thank you so much for taking the time to stop by and read this, I greatly appreciate it! I know this a wall-o-text but I wanted to try and provide as much information as possible about myself and what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019ve edited the ad quite a bit, adding a few new settings and themes, hope you enjoy!\n\nPersonal Info:\n\nA little about me, I\u2019m in my early 20\u2019s, a full-time student, and am currently living in the PST. I have about 2-3 years of RP experience and I\u2019m still learning a lot! I do my best to use spell check and read over my posts, but I am human and do make mistakes. I do have many other hobbies and activities that I actively participate in, so please do take that into consideration.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSchool is out, and I am mostly available around late mornings (10 AM PST) or late evenings (9 PM PST.) This is not always the case, but it much more likely I will be available around these times. If I am heading out of town or on vacation, I will do my best to inform you beforehand. I prefer partners that can post at least four times a week. If you don\u2019t think you can keep up this pace, I think it would be best if you stopped reading now.\n\nMy RP style:\n\nI prefer to RP in the third person format, posting anywhere between two to five detailed paragraphs depending on the situation. If you can match that awesome, if not, that\u2019s fine too. If your posts are detailed, quality, and are contributing towards the growth and development of the story and characters, I\u2019m happy! Most of the time I prefer to create and play original characters, however recently there has been one cannon character I have been really dying to play who I\u2019ll mention a little later in the ad. As the title says, I\u2019m only looking for FxF pairing, your RL gender doesn\u2019t matter to me, only your characters. I am seeking NSFW sexual elements in my RPs, so if that makes you uncomfortable I apologize, but best not to read on any further. While I am seeking NSFW themes, that does not mean I am foregoing story and character progression. I believe they can all coexist in an RP together without any one theme overtaking the other. My preferred method of RP is Discord, though I am new to it and may need some assistance navigating it.\n\nPreferred Themes &amp; Settings\n\nAs my wall-o-text is already getting seriously steep, I\u2019m going to list my themes and settings in order of preference with little side notes where needed. When messaging me, please tell me what specific themes and settings you\u2019re interested in. \n\nThemes:\n\nRomance: I absolutely adore this theme and am just going to put it down as mandatory. I\u2019m a huge fan of opposites attract stories, though it\u2019s not a must. (Mandatory theme)\n\nDrama: This goes hand in hand with romance. Let\u2019s not make things TOO easy for them, hmmm? Love mixing in emotional and unexpected twists that can complicate a budding or even established relationship! (Favorite)\n\nNSFW Themes: Mainly Sexual in nature, will only be discussed through private message as I want this ad to remain SFW.\n\nAdventure: Yes please! Let\u2019s not have our characters be sitting around all day, let\u2019s go out there discover the world, live out dreams, and broaden our horizons. (Favorite)\n\nAction: This goes hand in hand with a lot of the settings I\u2019ll be listing below. Sometimes conflict is necessary! (Favorite)\n\nSettings:\n\nMarvel Runaways (Hulu Series): It has been sometime since I have read the comics, but my love for this setting was recently rekindled by Hulu\u2019s take on the superhuman teens. This is where my cannon character itch comes in, as I would LOVE to play Karolina Dean with my partner playing Nico Minoru. Unfortunately, this is really the only pairing I\u2019m looking to play with this character. I know I\u2019ve had this as part of my ad for a while now but I\u2019m still hopeful that someday I\u2019ll find a partner for this! (Preferred/Favorite!)\n\nX-men/ X-Mansion: I am a huge fan of this superpowered team and have read some of the comics, seen some of the movies, and would love to work with you to create a pair of original mutants that learn to control their powers together. Using Xavier\u2019s School for Gifted Youngsters would be a plus, but not necessary. If you\u2019d like, we can create our own original school, college, or environment for our characters to learn to control and safely use their powers. Would also be up for the possibility of crafting a villainess x heroine situation if that\u2019s your sort of thing!\n\nHarry Potter: I recently, and excitedly discovered that there are handful of other Wizarding Schools that exist within the Harry Potter universe apart from Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons! I currently have a very detailed profile fleshed out for a young witch that studied at the Mahoutokoro School of Magic in Japan but am also willing to create new characters. The roleplay would need to take place after our characters have graduated from their respective schools as romantic themes with characters that young are just not my thing.\n\nSlice of Life: While I am still learning about this sort of RP, I have found myself really enjoying it. For the most part I find it much more convenient to use college, a workplace, or a small, sleepy town that one of our characters is forced to move to or be roommates in. I have received a lot of requests for stories set in High School, the only way I\u2019d be willing to agree to this is if both characters are 18+ as romance is a mandatory theme for any of these settings. If you have any other suggestions for locations besides what I have listed, I\u2019d love to hear them. I\u2019m also willing to add supernatural elements to the story if you\u2019re interested!\n\nOriginal Sc-Fi: This is a setting I\u2019m not very familiar with but would like to try out. I\u2019d really enjoy working with another creative mind to mold our own futuristic setting to delve into and explore. However, this is an idea that will take a lot of time, planning, and work on both our parts to conceive so please consider that.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\nOk, almost done, I promise! I think the most important thing to me in a potential partner is the ability and willingness to communicate. I\u2019m not talking about OOC chit chat, but being able to openly talk about ideas, stories, and characters in a creative and constructive way. This is a collaboration after all, I value my partner\u2019s thoughts and inputs into the story that we are creating together, so please if you\u2019re looking for one person alone to take the reins, please look elsewhere. I\u2019m also looking for someone who is passionate about these themes and settings I have posted. I know this seems like a given, but it really does make a difference, especially in the writing if you really love or care about these elements. Lastly, I\u2019m looking for someone who is understanding, as I mentioned above I will be starting school again in a month, and I may not have as much free time as I do now. I need someone that is understanding of the pressures of life, and that I may not be available all the time to post or play.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOk, whew.. if you made it through it all, congratulations! Thank you sooooo much for taking the time to read all this. I know a lot of my settings are pretty niche, but I\u2019m really hoping to find someone that loves them as much as I do. If you\u2019re interested, or just have questions or comments feel free to leave me a message but please make sure you have read this all thoroughly. There is nothing more disheartening to me than answering questions that I have already taken the time answer here in the ad. I hope you all have a wonderful day!",

            "selftext": "\n\nWhy, hello there! I am going to try and make this post as simple as I can and hopefully, it won't turn out to be too overwhelming to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start off, I am looking for a romantic sort of roleplay. Not all romance but I would like it to be one of the main focuses of the plot itself. It can be between either be straight or gay.That being said, I will play a male or female character in straight if you would prefer that but I will not play a commanding female or one that's in charge of the relationship. When it comes to a gay roleplay with two males, I will play either the one in charge or the sub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you ask \"What do you like to roleplay?\" or something similar, I will respond with \"A lot of things.\". Give me specific questions so I don't have to put everything I like into one response. You could mean a lot of things. Pairings, genres, settings, times, personalities, backgrounds, side characters... Just specify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to get on my good side, then tell me what you like as well! I mainly want to know what you like in pairings, genres, and settings but the other things can be listed as well if you would like. I don't require any of that in the very beginning but know that it is inevitable for me to ask what you like when it comes to those three items. Haha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI prefer realistic roleplays, or very minimal fantasy. No sci-fy, steam punk, whatever. I will only do original worlds or characters that we make ourselves. If you have gotten this far, welcome! I hope to be receiving a PM from you soon that will include your Discord account so I can message you there and make this whole process a lot easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions at all, then please state them in the PM or wait until we get to Discord!! Hopefully, I'll talk to you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey,\nI am looking for someone to play a male (or female) in a semi-literate, long term roleplay. I have a wide variety of interests ranging from SoL to supernatural, Sci-fi to fantasy, History/medieval to modern or futuristic/dystopian. I have a big passion for roleplaying and have been doing so for a very long time. I don\u2019t mind whether you are also a veteran or if you\u2019re on day one, so long as you are going to write literately and try to contribute to character development and plot, and assist in driving the plot forward. I am a quality over quantity kind of girl, in fact I think if that the longer the posts, the less we are really roleplaying and developing characters and plot together. I don\u2019t want a roleplay of one liners but I think sometimes they have their place in a scene.  \nI tend to match my partners length and style, and am happy to roleplay in 1st or 3rd POV and on Kik, Discord or email. I also prefer to do original roleplays, not so much fandoms and canons. I would like romance to be a large component of whatever we do together but I want it to be a romance that develops over time. There should be things that get in the way and personality conflicts, and drama. I am up for NSFW content, but it should fit into the plot and be a part of the build-up of the relationship, not just thrown randomly for fun. \nThe kinds of things I am really into blending with romance are action or adventure type roleplays. I like having two worlds collide in an irreversible moment. Two people meet from two walks of life, two different worlds (perhaps literally), or two people who are not supposed to have met do. \nI have a quite a few different plot ideas, but I would love to work with someone to build something new, or evolve an idea below. These are just some in the categories of supernatural and crime.\nSupernatural \n-\tAlpha or Beta werewolf (M) X human (F)\n-\tAlpha or beta werewolf (M) X werewolf (F)\n-\tWerewolf X werewolf\n-\tVampire Lord (M) X human) F) (thinking along the lines of beauty and the beast, but with vampires if that makes sense)\n-\tVampire Princess (F) X Human (M)\n-\tVampire Princess (F) X low-0 ranking vampire (M)\n-\tVampire x human \n-\tMermaid (F) x Human (M)\n-\tWitch (F) x Human (M)\n-\tFairy (F) x Human (M) \n-\tAlien (M) x Human (F) (Thinking along the lines of I am number 4)\n-\tGenetically modified human x Human\n-\tGenetically modified human x Genetically modified human\n-\tMutant (Like x-men or, like zoom academy) (M) x human (F)\nCrime\n-\tMafia boss (M) x average girl (F)\n-\tMafia boss (M) x crime boss\u2019s daughter (F)\n-\tMafia boss (M) x undercover police officer (F)\n-\tMafia Boss (M) x Indebted man\u2019s daughter (F)\n-\tUnderboss (M) x the Boss\u2019s daughter\n-\tThe Mafia Boss\u2019s daughter x Security detail\n-\tAssassin (M) x average girl\n-\tAssassin x Assassin\n-\tCrime boss (M) x a lost soul (F) (thinking sort of JokerxHarley Quinn but not exactly so)\nI\u2019d be up for some of the male roles to be female roles for a FxF romance, so message me ladies, if anyone is interested in anything. \nI am also, as stated before, into much more beyond the list above. I could list stuff forever, but no one wants to read that\u2026  Good job for making it this far, honestly. If you want, message me and ask about some of my interests in regard to ________. (Fantasy, medieval, historical, sci-fi futuristic, dystopian, apocalyptic worlds, slice of life etc. Whatever you are interested in.) Hopefully we will work something out that interests us both. \nAlso, if you are going to message me and lose interest, I would appreciate a heads up. Ghosting is incredibly frustrating and I am not going to do it to you, so please extend the curtesy. \nI look forward to hearing from people x\n\n\n",

            "selftext": " I'm a 29 year old looking for some nice male x male Rp with an interesting story and a good romantic relationship with some adult moments here and there.\n\nMC = My Character YC = Your Character\n\n**Idea No.1 Knight(YC) x Prince(MC)**\n\nYC is a royal knight, serving King and country for years now and like everybody else YC knows the story of the crown prince disappearing only weeks after he was born without any clue where he was taken or who was responsible for it. And after the whole country searching for the prince for several years now YC didn't ever expect to find him. And especially not in a house specialized to cater to the needs of lonely men and women.\n\nYC could have been a young knight and in charge of looking after the infant prince (And failing) which leads to him having a lot of pent up guilt.\n\n**Idea No.2 Knight(YC) x Prince(MC) Version 2**\n\nInstead of the Prince getting kidnapped the royal spies actually got information about a planned assassination towards the prince and he could be brought to safety, hidden away in a remote estate with only a few people knowing about his whereabouts. To keep the young prince save he was never told his true lineage, that is until YC arrives to accompany him back to the castle on his 18th birthday. Everybody expected the dangers to be over.. but they were wrong.\n\n**Idea No.3 Fae King (YC) x Human Prince (MC)**\n\nThe war between the Fae and humans had been devastating for both sides but it had been the elven mages that had crushed the human armies in the end and so the human kingdom had fallen under Fae rule. But surprisingly for everybody on the Human side, the King of the Fae ordered only two things. That all decisions made in the Human kingdom would have to be approved by him and that MC, the crown prince of the human Kingdom would come and live with the elves under the king's (YC) supervision. The humans thought he was meant to be a hostage but YC's thoughts went rather towards teaching and training the young man to be a better and more knowledgeable ruler than his father was. Little did YC and MC expect that they would end up intrigued and fascinated by each other.\n\n**Idea No.4 Vampire Servant(YC) x Human Master (MC)**\n\nMC expected a few things when his grandfather left him his fortune and estate, skipping his father in the process but what he certainly didn't expect was to find a vampire lurking in the estate, claiming to be his new bodyguard and servant. Because YC has sworn a blood oath to MC's family to protect the head of the family until he is released from this oath. In return MC is meant to be the one providing YC with his blood to keep him strong.\n\n**Idea No.5 Fantasy rogues**\n\nYC doesn't know much more of the World than the rough, unforgiving woods and cold winters of the north where he grew up, traveling and hunting with his father. He has heard stories and legends about fantastical creatures that lived in the south, of magic that could do things he couldn't even imagine.\n\nUntil one day he runs into MC. More exotic than anything he had ever seen MC draws YC in and before he knows what's happening, they are on their way to the south together, to a different country where all the things from the legends seemed to come alive.\n\nI imagine MC as a kind of spy/thief, not quite human, more leaning towards a type of elven creature.\n\nAlso I'm more than happy to expand side characters to secondary pairings where I'm willing to take on a more top role as well to balance things out.",

            "selftext": "Hi there. Seeking a partner for a long-term RP set during World War II. I have a vague idea for the characters but nothing set in stone yet. I do know, however, that I want it to be a tragic romance spanning the course of the war. I want to slowly develop our characters over time and explore how the war affects them and changes them forever. As to whether or not the ending will be tragic? Well, we'll just have to see how things play out. ;) I look forward to working out a story with you and am always open to suggestions.\n\nI don't have many requirements. You don't need to be an expert on the period, just a basic knowledge of it is good enough for me. Also, please be literate. My replies are generally short, but I try to avoid one-liners. I'm also incapable of writing a novel while RPing. :P just wanted to get that out of the way. I look forward to hearing from you. :)\n\nAlso: Though the overall tone of this RP will be quite dark, there will be lighter moments as well. I am a *huge* fan of fluff and sweetness!",

Like Starfire, but an adult.*\n\nMetropolis, home of the infamous Superman and prime target for villains. Over the years, the city has seen more than its fair share of disaster and destruction. This particular was hardly any different. The average hustle and bustle of the city is brought to a grinding halt when the unveiling of a new statue commemorating one of the Justice League's own lost their life in the latest of a long series of battles. [I'm partial to Batman or Superman, but I know how that's gonna be met.]\n\nThe ceremony was broadcasted all over the city, so once something came crashing down and destroying it, it was anything but inconspicuous. The resulting rich blue explosion knocked the countless news anchors, vans and other passersby into nearby buildings if they were far enough away, or into another life otherwise. Some of the cameras miraculously survived, and one was at just the right angle to show the cause of the destruction. A tall, busty, orange skinned woman with long, white hair that was seemingly on fire at the end came out of the crater looking obviously confused. Her outfit was, generously put, scantily clad. \n\nMarvel: *This is a bit more comfortable territory for me. I've fleshed out this character a bit more.*\n\nThe streets over New York are private airspace to any hero or villain that needs them, or wants them. Even if they can't fly. With a sudden influx of Spider people, the public grew weary of which of them would go too far and ruin all their names. Their suspicions were suddenly confirmed one day out of the blue when a group of thugs were found hanged from light posts and flag poles. Not hung and alive, hanged and dead. The news spread like wildfire. The Spider people quickly became public enemy number one. \n\nTony Stark managed to gather all of them together into one room, away from the public's prying eye. \"What the Hell? Which one of you killed them?\" The majority swore up and down that it wasn't them, and any machine showed them telling the truth, until one voice spoke up from the back. \"It was me.\" A woman not much taller than Gwen stepped forward, wearing baggy jeans and a violet jacket, her eyes a piercing blue.

            "selftext": "Paradigm Shift- Northern Frontier is a text based science-fiction apocalyptic roleplay server that takes place in discord. We are currently a new rp server that has just opened and is looking for active roleplayers along with potential staff members once our server gets larger. We are still in development with a lot of things still requiring tweaking, fixes, and replacements however we do hope that you decide to give us a chance! At the moment we are a slightly dead server as most members are from the previous roleplay however we hope that with your help, we can get active again as this is a community driven server. Currently we have a unfinished website which provides additional information about the server that includes a more in-depth lore of the world and other neat things. We hope that you decide to try our server out and if possible, invite your friends! \n\nLink to the server: https://discord.gg/2ewh4mc\n",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Afy, and I'm looking for a few casual roleplaying partners! A few things about me:\n\nI have been roleplaying for about 12 years now. I'm much more casual than I used to be, what with work and a social life.\n\nI prefer medieval fantasy, but I've been moving into modern fantasy too. Either way, I like myself a little bit of fantasy. =)\n\nI am a 25 year old female. I don't care what gender you are, but I would be more comfortable to roleplay with anyone over 18. \n\nI am perfectly fine with gore and smut, but always in moderation and when it makes sense. I prefer roleplays to focus around something other than gore and smut, but if it comes up in the plot, then it's all good!\n\nI prefer quality over quantity. In fact, having to read and reply to three paragraphs can be a little daunting. If there is any sort of character interaction, please give me a chance to have my characters reply. If that requires a smaller post, then so be it. \n\nI ask for casual, but not too casual. Please have a good grasp on grammar and punctuation. I understand spelling errors and things like that, but please don't make a habit of it.\n\nI'm actually very friendly and understanding! I love chatting OOC, and if for any reason you need to stop the roleplay, I understand. If you suddenly vanish, I may poke you a couple times to see if you're okay, but you won't hurt my feelings if you don't reply. \n\nI really like using plots, at least to get the roleplay started and for it to have at least a loose aim. Although I really enjoy reading large-world fantasy books, I'm not as great roleplaying in them unless I have something to follow, especially if the world has already been created with a massive amount of detail. It kind of feels like I'm intruding on someone else's masterpiece. So if you want to make something together, great! If you have a plot set in your own world, and don't mind me possibly altering your world due to ignorance about it, then also great!\n\nLastly, and this may be a bit odd, but please double check my username to make sure we're not already doing a roleplay, or have tried one in the past. I've had a few requests from people that have dropped a roleplay with me, or we're currently in the middle of one. I don't really know what to say... so I don't say anything. If you do recognize my username and want to restart something, or even start a second roleplay, then by all means! \n\nAlrighty, I think that's all. If you've gotten this far, then thank you! I have a bunch of plots that I'm always happy to use, and I'm even happier to see other people's plots, so send them my way! If you want to see my plots, here is a link to a very old website I have: [http://afyvarra.webs.com/plots.htm](http://afyvarra.webs.com/plots.htm)  (Don't just me for how it looks)\n\nI hope to hear back from people. I'm heading off to bed now, so please give me a bit of time to reply to anything.",

            "selftext": " \n**Hey my fellow RPers!**\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n**Platforms**\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n**Posting Speed**\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n**Genres**\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n* Urban Fantasy\n* Historical (Realistic)\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n**Fandoms**\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n**World Building**\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n**The Conclusion**\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n**To previous users who know me!**\nI currently lost all my discord chats and chat history, If we have an unfinished RP please message me and I can get back to you!",

You get to meet people at conventions, you get to step into the shoes of someone from quite literally a while other world, and for a brief, shining glimmer all eyes are on you. If you could catch a passing glimpse of her, you\u2019d think she had it all. Her social media presence was unparalleled in the cosplay community and she ruled every convention she went to. She had more fans than anyone, including her, would say she deserves. But she doesn\u2019t feel whole, she\u2019s not happy. Everyone sees the happy persona she puts up but no one sees the sleepless nights alone, no one knows what she looks like without the costumes and makeup. At every convention she would be surrounded by fans, and she never felt more alone. Until you came along.\n\n2. She just couldn\u2019t stop herself. She made it all the way through high school with no relationship struggles or issues but right before graduation she made one huge mistake that she\u2019s going to have to deal with for nine months. She leaves the state to go away for school for a fresh start, having to deal with dorm life while balancing her new struggles. You\u2019re the only thing keeping her from going crazy\n\nJust something I thought of while browsing cosplay sites online the other day, as well as an idea I was considering. Looking for someone to tell a sweet narrative-focused story of romance and coming to grips with one\u2019s demons. I\u2019ll be playing the character in the prompt and id like you to play the love interest. Either gender will do! I\u2019m good for MxF or FxF. This will be an SFW roleplay so no smut. I write in 3rd person paragraph form, so literacy is a MUST. As far as post length goes I prefer quality over quantity, but don\u2019t phone it in. I want this to be mostly happy but real life isn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows so it\u2019ll get dark and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m happy to discuss potential ideas for the story with anyone interested, just PM me and we\u2019ll talk :D",

In it, you'll be put into the role of an Imperial Guardsmen and you'll have the choice to be an expert in any field of war (demolitions, subterfuge, sniper, etc). You'll serve side by side with your fellow man, fighting in the trenches, storming beaches, maybe even more if you live long enough to do so! Also, it should be known that the NSFW tag is for the possible bloody end of your character, should you take a rogue las shot to the head or step on the forgotten enemy mine. If this interests you or you wish to discuss the details of the rp, please pm me. When you do, please come with an idea for your character (such as a name, physical description, backstory, etc.). Anyway, I can't wait to hear from all of you! For the Emperor!",

I have a few ideas below, mostly I\u2019m interested in roleplaying as Bobbi Morse against Lance Hunter, but I am definitely open to doubling! \n\nIdeas: \nPlot 1- Playing out Bobbi and Hunter\u2019s life before the events of AoS. How they met, the drama and tension between their marriage, missions they went on, etc. \n\nPlot 2- Playing out the events after season 2 episode 21 when Bobbi is kidnapped and leading up to her and Hunter\u2019s departure from the team, as well as what happens after. \n\nInfo about me: \n- I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+\n- I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply\n- I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out \n- I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does \n- I would prefer literate partners \n\nLike I said, I am definitely open to doubling or even you playing other characters besides Hunter if you are interested. NOTE: the one character I WILL NOT play with or against is Grant Ward. Just not something I can get behind. Please PM me or comment if you\u2019re at all interested in playing in this world!",

            "selftext": "Hello all. Thanks for reading. I'm new to a reddit account, but I'm not new to rp. I've been writing/roleplaying for 10+ years. I do detailed, multiple paragraph writing. Third-person perspective. I would prefer to find a long term writing partner, but I'm flexible.   \n\n  \nI am interested in just about any Fiction genre, including but not limited to;   \n\nFantasy \n\nAction and Adventure \n\nSci-Fi \n\nHorror \n\nCrime \n\nDrama \n\nRomance   \n\n\nI don't really like canon or fanon or anything like that.  I prefer original characters and setting. I will occasionally use an existing world or setting as a basis for a story, but I always want to make it different than the original. Using it for inspiration, rather than fanfiction.     \n \n\nNSFW content, including strong language, violence, and sexual themes are encouraged in context but not necessary. I would ask that you be 18+, or even 21+ for certain aspects to be included in the story. We can always discuss it.     \n  \n\nAs far as *where* we write, I'm flexible on that too. I do have discord, trillian and google. I likely won't download any new programs. I can use e-mail or messaging or whatever you prefer. I am not always around, I have a full life, but making time for writing is important to me. So I'll try to be around at least a couple hours every night/every other night. I'm on Eastern time. I will always try to respond once a day at least and more if I can. I try to be courteous if I have something coming up or going on and letting you know that I will be unavailable when that happens, I do appreciate the same in return but I'm patient. If you don't have much time I can work with that. Real life comes first, of course.     \n \n\nWhat I'm looking for in a writing partner is someone with something to contribute. A creative, intelligent individual that enjoys cooperative writing and is adaptable. If you're interested or have any questions just drop me a PM. Happy Hunting!     \n  ",

You do not have to have any knowledge of the show Sons of Anarchy (a show about a motorcycle club), but it certainly does help since it is an rp about a motorcycle club, but knowledge about motorcycle clubs in general works just as well. I speak from experience when I say that it is a fun rp to be a part of. There is an audition process, but nothing too difficult. Just a few questions that are different depending on whether you intend to play a male or female. \n\nI am not the owner of this server, I am just trying to help out by trying to spread the word about the rp to get more people interested and/or involved.

I'd love to do something immediately post-Return of the Jedi. I want to explore their budding relationship and the adventures they get up to. They have such a great back and forth dynamic and I really want to build on that.  \nI'm also very interested in doing something with Vader x Padme, where Padme doesn't die and Anakin has her brought to him.

What is Divine Fantasy? Simply put, it's world mythology and the exploration thereof in one convenient site. Xibalba (pronounced she-ball-bah) is an 18+, but SFW, RP site that encourages people to look beyond the mythos you know from most popular fiction and branch out, exploring new deities.\n\nAll new members start with a character that is called a Guardian, a sort of High Priest or Priestess who acts as a representative on earth for their Patron Deity. You can build relationships with fellow Guardians, defend humanity from monsters and other threats, and work to prevent the apocalypse together. \n\nIf you're interested or have questions, let me know here or hop on over to [xibalbarpg.com](https://xibalbarpg.com) to see if it would be the right fit for you!",

I dont right essays every post, I do what's necessary to make a proper image, and move on. I'm really looking to do some sci-fi, action, romance style scenes, with plenty of character development, and fun to go with it. I am a somewhat busy guy, so I dont always reply right away. So long as you understand that silence is not me ignoring you, we will get along just fine. I'm a fun, loving, easy going guy, who really just wants a partner (or multiple) who just understands roleplay, and clicks with me. I know this is all over the place, I promise I'll make more since when we talk, so please, shoot a PM my way with your platform of choice, and your info. I look forward to meeting some cool people!",

Even though some of the world is reduced to desert like the outskirts of New York, England, and parts of south america because of the immense heat. But, society has changed for the better. No wars, crime rate has dropped to almost zero. And everyone is living happily together. But there's a reason for that.\n\nThe fox hunt. A game for the rich from the 17th century remodeled to be the capital punishment and the one most carried out in this new society. Whether you killed someone or simply stole a loaf of bread, they're all subjugated to the zero tolerance policy. You can just die and be shot publicly. Or you can take your chances with the fox hunt and the 8 hunters they send after you.\n\nThe 8 hunters, all hand picked from their cities from around the globe, and all bring their own traditions and ways of the hunt. They have access to weapons, vehicles, maps, and resources. Everything they'll need to catch their prey and get their next paycheck. Each hoping to get the head of the kill as they'll get the bonus.\n\nThe fox however, gets nothing beside a motorbike, a satchel with a single barrel shotgun with 5 shells, some provisions, and a knife. \n\nBut this is the most carried out sentence for a reason. It has a chance to get off scott free. If you escape that is. And in the history of this punishment, there's only been one person to escape and make the hunters give up. \n\nBut there's always someone against them, as in every story. Bandits? A religious group? Another society? Or just simply a group of colonists trying to get by that was scooped up by this society? Either way, you're important enough to be scooped up.....",

            "selftext": "Introduction:\n\nHello and welcome to my RP ad, I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful day! Thank you so much for taking the time to stop by and read this, I greatly appreciate it! I know this a wall-o-text but I wanted to try and provide as much information as possible about myself and what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nPersonal Info:\n\nA little about me, I\u2019m in my early 20\u2019s, a full-time student, and am currently living in the PST. I have about 2-3 years of RP experience and I\u2019m still learning a lot! I do my best to use spell check and read over my posts, but I am human and do make mistakes. I do have many other hobbies and activities that I actively participate in, so please do take that into consideration.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSchool is out, and I am mostly available around late mornings (10 AM PST) or late evenings (9 PM PST.) This is not always the case, but it much more likely I will be available around these times. If I am heading out of town or on vacation, I will do my best to inform you beforehand. I prefer partners that can post at least four times a week. If you don\u2019t think you can keep up this pace, I think it would be best if you stopped reading now.\n\nMy RP style:\n\nI usually prefer to RP in the third person format, posting anywhere between two to five detailed paragraphs depending on the situation. If you can match that awesome, if not, that\u2019s fine too. If your posts are detailed, quality, and are contributing towards the growth and development of the story and characters, I\u2019m happy! Most of the time I prefer to create and play original characters, however recently there has been one cannon character I have been really dying to play who I\u2019ll mention a little later in the ad. As the title says, I\u2019m only looking for FxF pairing, your RL gender doesn\u2019t matter to me, only your characters.I am seeking NSFW sexual elements in my RPs, so if that makes you uncomfortable I apologize, but best not to read on any further. While I am seeking NSFW themes, that does not mean I am foregoing story and character progression. I believe they can all coexist in an RP together without any one theme overtaking the other. My preferred method of RP is Discord, though I am new to it as I was accustomed to using AIM\n\nPreferred Themes &amp; Settings:\n\nAs my wall-o-text is already getting seriously steep, I\u2019m going to list my themes and settings in order of preference with little side notes where needed. When messaging me, please tell me what specific themes and settings you\u2019re interested in. I don\u2019t want to list specific ideas or scenarios here as this ad is already lengthy, and I prefer to talk those topics through with any potential partner.\n\nThemes:\n\nRomance: I absolutely adore this theme and am just going to put it down as mandatory. I\u2019m a huge fan of opposites attract stories, yet it is not a must. (Mandatory theme) \n\nDrama: This goes hand in hand with romance. Let\u2019s not make things TOO easy for them, hmmm? Love mixing in emotional and unexpected twists that can complicate a budding or even established relationship! (Favorite)\n\nNSFW Themes: Mainly Sexual in nature, will only be discussed through private message as I want this ad to remain SFW.\n\nAdventure: Yes please! Let\u2019s not have our characters be sitting around all day, lets go out there discover the world, live out dreams, and broaden our horizons. (Favorite)\n\nAction: This goes hand in hand with a lot of the settings I\u2019ll be listing below. Sometimes conflict is necessary! (Favorite)\n\nSettings:\n\nMarvel Runaways (Hulu Series): It has been sometime since I have read the comics, but my love for this setting was recently rekindled by Hulu\u2019s take on the superhuman teens. This is where my cannon character itch comes in, as I would LOVE to play Karolina Dean ideally with my partner playing Nico Minoru. Unfortunately, this is really the only pairing I\u2019m looking to play with this character. (Preferred/Favorite!)\n\nX-men/ X-Mansion: I am nowhere near current on the comics as that hobby is a bit too pricey for a lowly college student.. sad face! In any case, there is a small possibility I may want to try my hand at playing either Paige Guthrie aka Husk or Illyana Rasputin aka Magik though I will most likely play an OC. (Favorite!)\n\nSlice of Life-ish?: If this is more your pace, I\u2019d love to have something based on college life, but am not opposed to hearing other suggestions! If you\u2019d like it to remain realistic, I\u2019m ok with that, but I\u2019m also open to adding a hint of fantasy or other fiction as well. (New to me, but excited to try!)\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n\nOk, almost done, I promise! I think the most important thing to me in a potential partner is the ability and willingness to communicate. I\u2019m not talking about OOC chit chat, but being able to openly talk about ideas, stories, and characters in a creative and constructive way. This is a collaboration after all, I value my partner\u2019s thoughts and inputs into the story that we are creating together, so please if you\u2019re looking for one person alone to take the reins, please look elsewhere. I\u2019m also looking for someone who is passionate about these themes and settings I have posted. I know this seems like a given, but it really does make a difference, especially in the writing if you really love or care about these elements. Lastly, I\u2019m looking for someone who is understanding, as I mentioned above I will be starting school again in a month, and I may not have as much free time as I do now. I need someone that is understanding of the pressures of life, and that I may not be available all the time to post or play.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOk, whew.. if you made it through it all, congratulations! Thank you sooooo much for taking the time to read all this. I know a lot of my settings are pretty niche, but I\u2019m really hoping to find someone that loves them as much as I do. If you\u2019re interested, or just have questions or comments feel free to leave me a message but please make sure you have read this all thoroughly. There is nothing more disheartening to me than answering questions that I have already taken the time answer here in the ad. I hope you all have a wonderful day!\n\n",

Of course, I'm up for anything you might suggest as well, I'm very flexible and able to play either gender and a multitude of character types. For the genre of RP I am once again flexible, although I enjoy a healthy mix of Slice of life, Combat, and romance, if at all possible in the situation (Although I understand not every RP needs or can include combat). I like my partners to be somewhat available, I understand that daily might not be possible, but more than a couple posts a week is preferred. My posts vary depending on yours, but on my own, I always attempt at least 1-2 paragraphs, if not more. I'm not super picky about everything being prim and proper grammatically, we all make mistakes!

As usual anyone can message me, any gender of any age, and I'll understand if your first language isn't English!\n\nNow, I only play as male and I use first person.

I am looking for a Life is Strange RP where I play as Max paired up with Chloe. I will play side characters to help with the story and the plot, but I will not budge at all on this. I only play Maxine, and I am looking for the perfect Chloe Price. \u2764\n\nI do have some ground rules I wanna cover, so let's go over the MUST HAVES of what you need if you'd like to RP with me on this.\n\n1. Descriptive and frequent poster. I get that life gets in the way, but if I'm waiting days for a reply, then it's going too slow to be interesting.\n\n2. Discord. I only play over Discord. MAYBE PMs if you really convince me. But you can message me if you're interested and we'll go to Discord from there. But Discord is an amazing and underused RP tool, I promise! \n\n3. Must enjoy story and plot. Nothing ruins a game faster than sex after sex after sex. Yes, Max and Chloe will have cute, hella gay sex, but that's not what I want the main focus to be. Story over Smut, please! \n\n4. Speaking of hella gay sex, you must be OK with NSFW themes. This goes with sex, suicide, murder and all of the darker, more adult themes that surround the video game. I'll never go too far with it; after all, it's there to enhance the experience and not be gratuitous. \n\n5. You MUST, MUST, MUST be able to capture the spirit of the game and at least play half of the characters with me. This game should be about both of us, but an RP where all we do is RP as Chloe and Max sitting around and being cute isn't any fun. I want to go on an adventure, and that means we gotta write the side characters like Victoria, Jefferson, Warren and all the rest out, too! But I'll always do my part to play at least half of them. \n\nThat's about it! Now let's get to the fun part! Wowsers. :)\n\n\n\nI'm fine with setting the RP during or after the events of the game. I would like to AVOID the \"Sacrifice Arcadia Bay\" ending, please. I feel like it's out of character for both of them to just accept that they basically murdered their family and friends and to live on like nothing ever happened. If we were to set it after the game, I'd rather it be in an alternate reality where the storm never happened and we can go from there. Jefferson and Sean will be gone, but there will be new adventures and conflicts and trouble to get in to. We just gotta be creative!\n\nA few possibilities...\n\n- Max and Chloe survive the game and avoid the storm. A year later, Max is attending college, and Chloe works... wherever a punk like her would. They share an apartment and the story would probably start off with something ominous happening that'll kickstart a brand new adventure for the both of them. Something to do with Nathan's father, maybe?\n\n- Max chooses to sacrifice Chloe. When Nathan shoots her, he fails to kill her and is arrested. Because Chloe learned her lesson from the butterfly and is no longer selfish, the universe / butterfly decides that she can be spared and that Chloe doesn't have to die after all. A month later, Chloe recovers from a coma and wakes up in a hospital bed with Max sleeping in a chair by her side and the butterfly on the window sill. Thanks to the butterfly, Chloe has remembered everything that transpired throughout the game during her coma, and wakes up with the memories she and Max shared during Life is Strange, despite them technically never happening in the current timeline. \n\n- We set it during the game, but with a twist. We will still follow the basic structure of the game, but instead of speaking Max and Chloe's lines word for word, we'll improv and add some of our own, extra, non-canon scenes and hijinks for them to get in to, while still covering all of the important stuff, like the diner, breaking in to Blackwell, their scene at the pool, etc.\n\n- Anything else we can both come up with together. :) \n\n\n\nMy \"Yes, Please\" List\n\n- Darker, adult themes\n- Romance\n- Passion\n- Kissing and cuddling\n- Descriptive partners and writers\n- Hella amazing Chloes \n- Partners I can call friend and chat with ^^\n- Drama\n- Creative writing \n- Sad, emotional scenes\n- Melodrama \n\nThat's about it... please message me if you wanna be my Chloe! Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm currently looking for partners for a wide variety of plots I would like to do! Without further ado, I'll dive right into it!\u00a0\n\nA little bit about me:\u00a0I have been roleplaying for nearly four years. I'm usually available afternoons on most weekdays, and free on the weekends! I'll do my best to alert you if I am aware I'll be gone for an extended period of time.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n-\u00a0Someone who is detailed.\u00a0I'm looking for someone who puts detail and effort into the replies they send. I don't mind the occasional grammar error, I'm not too much of a stickler when it comes to it. I don't expect massive walls of text every reply, as long as you aren't constantly spitting out one line responses, I'll be happy! I tend to write two to three paragraphs per response, although I will do my best to match the length of what you send.\n\n-\u00a0Someone who doesn't mind playing multiple characters.\u00a0This one isn't too much a requirement as it is a preference. If you like playing several characters, cool! Otherwise, it's not a deal breaker for me!\n\nPlots I'm interested in.\n\nAlright, so here is the list of plots I would like to do. It's kinda long, so I've divided it into two categories.\u00a0Fandom and Non-fandom.\n\nNote: Anything marked with a '[!]' next to it means I especially want to do that one!\n\nFANDOM\n\nNote: I'm not to big on OCs, I greatly prefer if you play only cannon characters.\n\n[!] RWBY:\n\n- My character would be a teenager, running around Vale as a thief. Eventually caught, but instead of being sent to a detention center, the headmaster of Beacon Academy has a better idea. He would be put under the watch of one of the teams of the academy. It could be team RWBY, JNPR, CFVY, Cinder's \"team\". Heck, I'd even be willing to give a team STQR approach. (They would be a bit younger, of course.) Maybe of unique team, composed of various different characters?\n\n- Same character as above, different scenario. What if all of the main cast of the show were put in one large house? Chaos would ensure, definitely. Chaos that my character would be thrown into. I'm pretty open to any character roster for this!\n\n- My character would be a new student to Atlas Academy. A bit of a troublemaker, until an dust incident results in him being put under the watch of Winter, much to his dismay. (Winter could be swapped out with Pyrrah, or even Glenda for this one!)\n\n[!] Overwatch:\n\n- My character would be a teenager who ran away from home, sneaking aboard a cargo ship. For the last 6 months, I've been traveling the world this way, before accidentally coming across Watchpoint: Gibraltar\n\nAlternatively, he could be kidnapped by Talon.\n\nBorderlands:\n\n- My character would be a teenager, the heir of a massive mining company. After a rebellious act of running away, he would crash land on Pandora, before being found by Lilith or Maya. This would take place after the main campaign of BL2 is done!\n\n- Or, my character could be a lowly thief on Pandora, before making the grave mistake of trying to rob Lilith/Maya/Athena.\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club:\n\n- A mysterious event brings the characters of the game into the 'real' world, leaving a destructive rift behind in their wake. Chaos ensures, especially now that Monika has access to the object she desires most\u2026\n\nOther characters I'm interested in my partner playing, but don't really have a plot for:\n\n\n- Samus (Metroid) [!]\n- Elizabeth (BioShock) [!]\n- Monika (DDLC)\n- Cynthia (Pokemon)\n- Lusamine (Pokemon)\n- 2B (Neir: Automata) [!]\n- Cortana (Halo)\n- IQ (R6)\n- Any girl from Pokemon, really. \n- Piper (Fallout)\n- Cammy (Street Fighter) [!]\n\nNON-FANDOM\n\nSo, I have a lot of non-fandom ideas. So I've simply listed roles I would be interested in my partner playing! If you would like to play any of these roles, just tell me which one and we can work a plot out!\n\n- Soilder/other high military officer.\n- Teacher/principal.\n- Cop/security guard.\n- Assassin\n- Slime girl/other monster girl.\n- Classmate\n- Android (Like 2B from Neir)\n- Kidnapper.\n- Serial Killer.\n- Criminal.\n- Former Actress\n- Famous YouTuber\n\n\n\nIf your interested in any of the plots or roles, pm me!",

I have 10+ years of roleplay and writing under my skills. I'm a female and I like to keep my real life and Rp separate as in; no pictures, no video, no discussion about rl unkess I'm comfy with sharing, and respect. My first idea is the BBC show Sherlock..I want to build character bonds and progress in story. Personality traits are a must for me, the closer the personality to the character the better. I am strictly OC I have multiple characters to chose from. I welcome other themes but I really connect with the following; Doctor Who, Sherlock, Fantasy, Beyond Two Souls [OC version], Romance, Gore, Thriller, Soul Eater, Steven Universe [OC version], Skyrim..and I do also take in other ideas. I only ask that you don't send one liners or half assed responces. I personally prefer Third person for my style I can work with your style be it first person or so. ",

            "selftext": "Greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...My Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Pokemon, Splatoon, and Legend of Zelda.  I can try other fandoms but that's a case by case thing and anything that holds ZERO similarity to what I am looking for is likely a hard no.  With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",
