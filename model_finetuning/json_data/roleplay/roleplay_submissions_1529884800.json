            "selftext": "So here's a quick intro about me. I'm 27, female, and I work at a comic/game shop full time. I play a lot of dungeons and dragons and a lot of my writing involves characters/worlds I\u2019ve created for either my own or my friend\u2019s campaigns. I like a lot of grit/realism in my fantasy, grey ass morality, imperfect characters, complicated conflicting emotions, all that fun stuff. I can write in both third and first person past, I think both have merits and I\u2019m up for either. While I mostly play women I can play men too. I have characters of lots of different sexualities/gender and it\u2019d be cool if you did too. And while I\u2019m not really aiming for a NSFW game I also understand that sexuality can play a roll in storytelling/character development so I\u2019m not going to avoid it if it fits. That being said if that\u2019s all your looking for, maybe I\u2019m not the person for you.\n\nSo on the more technical side of things I\u2019ve always role-played at the \u2018advanced\u2019 level. But I found those role-plays ended up moving so slowly people almost always lost interest. While I often write long posts I also think a few good paragraphs can work fine depending on the situation. I\u2019m much more concerned with quality of character and writing than length. So I guess I\u2019m still hoping for the writing quality of advanced, just with occasional shorter posts when there's not much to go on. \n\nQuality is a big sticking point for me right now. But I\u2019m not really sure how to talk about it without coming off as arrogant. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the greatest writer who ever lived, I'm mostly interested in roleplay in order to improve. But I would consider myself above average as far as my characters and dialogue are concerned. And I want to role-play with someone who matches and/or exceeds me. I\u2019m really not trying to be a jerk here but I don\u2019t want role-play with people who after some self scrutiny don\u2019t feel the advanced label fits them.\n\nAs far as post frequency, ideally I\u2019d like to aim for a rate of weekly or biweekly. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t be patient if there are delays, we all have lives. As mentioned above I also work full time so I may be having some of those delays myself and I understand things can get hectic. I'm not going to be super pushy as long as you don't ghost me. I\u2019m also not opposed to sharing multiple posts in a day if we get particularly inspired.\n\nSettings I\u2019m interested in the moment are mostly fantasy and variants on that. I have some pre-made worlds/lore for some of these settings and would be happy to share them with anyone interested. In the long run I'm more motivated by good characters than settings so feel free to suggest your own things too!\n\nMedieval Fantasy (Classic or one of my own settings or something entirely different) \n\nGothic Horror (Monster hunters, Madness, and eldritch abominations. Bloodborne &lt;3)(I have fleshed out world and many characters for this)\n\nPost Apocalyptic (Original or Fallout, I have a nightkin character who I just love to pieces, but he never fits in anything :c)\n\nModern Fantasy (I don\u2019t have anything in mind for this, but it can be fun)\n\nModern Super Powers (This is one I actually have a fairly fleshed out setting for if interested, less super hero oriented and more super powered people with problems.)\n\nSteampunk (Let\u2019s be over the top airship pirates! Or Historical based settings with steampunk flair.)\n\nA heads up pretty much anything involving badass women will be pretty easy to sell to me. So feel free to suggest something I haven\u2019t put down.\n\nLastly as far as medium is concerned I recently signed up for discord which I've been usually pretty frequently even if I haven't figured everything out. If you use another medium you think is pretty great I probably wouldn\u2019t mind that either. And that's about it, shoot me a message if you're interested. I'm willing to send samples or characters if asked.",

            "selftext": "**Hello, witches and wizards of Reddit!** \n\nAre you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter?  Have you always dreamed of an immersive experience of attending Hogwarts, casting spells, attending classes, playing some Quidditch, meet new friends and going on adventure? Do you want to build and tell a story of your own making in an immersive environment, and leave your own mark on the Wizarding World?\n\nWell, this is your letter of acceptance to Model Hogwarts! Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night. For some more information please check out our [wikia](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki)!\n\n##**What's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:**  \n1) Everyone starts off as a First Year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences! You and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that exploded potion nearly shrunk all of your heads into pinpoints, and somehow you dramatically saved the day. We also make it easy to graduate. Each year is 11 weeks long, with 2 weeks of summer in between, and no year is the same. Each one is filled with a variety of ideas, events, and classes you can take, along with an always changing and evolving narrative shaped by the players. But don\u2019t worry, unlike real school the classes are in no way an obligation, and if you\u2019d rather not attend class events, or are unable too, you can still get to decide on what your character\u2019s class performance is like, regardless of your attendance.\n\n2) You get to choose where you are sorted. We're not going to place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house (cough cough Pottermore). We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, Quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer. Don\u2019t worry too, if you\u2019re not sure where you\u2019d like to go, you can always ask the Sorting Hat to choose for you.\n\n3) We\u2019re stable and well established, as we\u2019ve recently passed our first year anniversary! This is great because you have the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts in a long term environment. Want to be a Prefect? Want to start a gobstones club, or a writing club, or even a flesh-eating slugs fan club? Hey, we won't judge! Model Hogwarts is ripe with opportunities but still is developed enough to give you the structure to succeed. Want to develop a new system of magic or discover a secret room? Hey, we\u2019re game!\n\n4) We have a number of custom bots made specifically for our server! Want to cast spells, practice them and know if they succeed? Want to train your characters stats? Want to practice reading tea leaves or tarot cards? Want to add to your character\u2019s chocolate frog collection? There are even bots that will allow you to participate in investigations and engaging plots! You can do all of that and more using the custom bots for Model Hogwarts!\n\n5) We\u2019re welcoming to both new and experienced RPers. If you\u2019re new to RP it\u2019s okay!  Model Hogwarts can get you started! We have a [detailed RP guide] (http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying_Basics) to give you some tips and tricks as you begin. Along with community RP, we also have staff lead plots and events frequently, so even if you\u2019re new to RP and shy, you\u2019ll have plenty of chances to join in on the fun!\n\n6) We want *you*. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking *us*. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.\n\n7) Were you a member of Model Hogwarts before, are you interested in returning? Well there have been many changes to the Model! We want to give our players the tools to tell the stories we want, and have had made numerous changes to help assist that. Our Spell Bot is brand new and you now receive 3 learn points a week that will always roll over, which means you will never miss out on learns again!\n\nOn top of that, the previous OOC Points system has been changed to Tokens, which allows you to purchase exciting items, interesting powers, personalize story prompts, exotic pets, useful plants, and much more! Everyone receives tokens every year, and can use them on purchases that will help you tell the story you want to tell.\n\n###**How to start:**  \n1) [**Join the Discord!**](https://discord.gg/56z6GMM) This is where the magic is happening. Meet your classmates and professors, roleplay, go to classes, fight mysterious ghosts, and get lost in the library. You\u2019ll get a week of \u2018Hogwarts Summer Camp\u2019 where you can informally meet your peers in your year and explore the castle without all the annoying upper years.\n\n2) [Check out our wikia](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki) for more information about our classes, professors, and some existing characters! \n\n3)[Read our student handbook!](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_%26_Guidelines) In here you can find info, our code of conduct, and FAQs. Don't worry, if you have a question that isn't answered here, we'd be happy to answer it as well!\n\n4) Take a peek at some of the classes we offer! Classes are drop-in, so even if you miss some you can still attend, but they\u2019re totally optional if you\u2019re more interested in roleplay! First years can currently attend the following classes:\n\nCharms\nDefense Against the Dark Arts\nDivination\nHerbology\nHistory of Magic\nPath to Success in the Wizarding World\nPotions\nTransfiguration\n\nOnce you\u2019ve reached third year you\u2019ll be able to diversify your interests with a variety of electives, as mentioned in the books and films! Currently these include:\n\nAncient Runes\nArithmancy\nCare of Magical Creatures\nMagical Theory\nMuggle Studies\n\n5) Please comment down below with any and all questions you have. We\u2019d be happy to answer them! We can\u2019t wait to welcome you to our roleplaying community! ",

But, if you want to add in a fandom character I\u2019m sure we could make it work!\n\nMy lines in the sand:\n\nAll characters and players must be 18+\n\nAll romance/NSFW must be kept strictly between characters, no self insertion.\n\nOther than that, I\u2019m pretty much anything goes.

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m just your typical college student looking for a writing partner to kill some time with on these lazy summer school/work days. I\u2019d like to do a long term slice of life roleplay with romance. I\u2019m open to a variety of different themes/story prompts, however the one I had in mind was a simple college setting, boy meets girl type of situation centered around us being in a co-ed fraternity. I had a more relaxed/fun theme in mind however I am ok with more serious or darker themes if that\u2019s your cup of tea.\n\nNaturally having a long term roleplay with no overarching theme can be kind of hard, so we would have to be creative with the story. Again, if you have any ideas for the roleplay I am more then happy to give the reigns over to you, but some creativity will be required regardless. I prefer 1st person and can use email or discord. I would like a more rapid fire type of messaging, although obviously there might be breaks for real life stuff (for example Wednesday and Thursday we might send a bunch of replies but Friday and Saturday only a couple due to real life.) I like multi paragraph responses although depending on the scenario short responses can be fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested feel free to let me know and we can sort out the finer details before diving into the roleplay!",

My main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. I do have a list of different scenarios to go over with you, but feel free to bring your own. Yours will probably be more interesting than mine as mine need developing abit more. I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, or tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. And if you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs be and\nI\u2019m happy to provide you with a character description or picture, whatever your preference is fine. \n\nMy favourite idea would probably have to be the cliche \u2018roommates\u2019 which is slice of life. But I\u2019m down for more exciting plots too, if you see my last post, I have a list of scenarios. They are basic and will need developing so if you want, we can take one and expand on it. Or we can just do one of yours as I\u2019m flexible and I try to play as many roles as I can.\n\nSmut will have an very tiny element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest (80% story, 20% smut.) Roughly. So smut will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build up. Also please be literate (more than a paragraph at least) as I tend of base my replies off my partners and if I get one that\u2019s small, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do back. I hope to hear from you soon and I should be able to reply to you within an hour or so - also I\u2019m okay with just chatting too, maintaining a friendly relationship with a partner is always good so please don\u2019t hesitate, I certainly won\u2019t bite. I find that keeping a good friendship means that we can base some ideas on our collective thoughts and change it whenever we need to. I\u2019m also happy with giving you time off, as long as you let me know in advance so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve been left hanging. Thanks for reading! \n\nPM me if you\u2019re interested, I can roleplay over reddit but Kik is my main platform. Yet I\u2019d be happy to download other apps which allow me to connect to you.

            "selftext": "Greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...My Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Pokemon, Splatoon, and Legend of Zelda.  I can try other fandoms but that's a case by case thing and anything that holds ZERO similarity to what I am looking for is likely a hard no.  Some outlying ideas people have come to me with being things like Kingdom Hearts, Skullgirls and Shantae for example.  With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",

Why worry about a mold to break when you don't have one? Why should we be confined to the whims of someone else's ideation for their characters? Therefore, let's make our own.\n\nI've been roleplaying for quite some time. If I had to guess, it would be fifteen years, give or take. I'm a Psychiatric Counselor, so that allows me a lot of flexibility with my schedule, as I'm the one that makes it and I can't really bring work home with me. So, when I'm home, I like to have a creative outlet that doesn't involve just sitting in front of a TV, as much as I love gaming and watching TV. I've been writing seriously as long as I can remember, so this is something very important to me. \n\nI want us both to be dedicated to this and voice any concerns we have while we are playing. Don't like the way things are going? Speak up and we'll course-correct. Think we could go into more detail? Let's bring it up and hash it out. I find that the biggest killer of roleplaying is lack of communication. We need to set forth our expectations and our hangups so that we know what the other person needs.\n\nNow, as for what we'll be playing out, we can decide that! I do have a tendency towards fantastical environments, whether that means full-blown fantasies or super powered individuals. Though, I have played more down-to-earth stories as well. \n\nI am perfectly okay with NSFW content, though it have some caveats there. I want it to fit in with the story and have a build, and we have to talk about our likes limits beforehand. I don't want either of us uncomfortable during these scenes that may very well be climaxes (no pun intended) to the story.\n\nHere are some of the baselines I have used in the past, kind of a two or three word prompt that functions as a springboard:\n\n***Forbidden Romance***\n***Unlikely Pairings***\n***The Unlucky Adventurer's Guild***\n***Superheroes and Villains***\n\nIf you've read this far, then thank you for your time! If you think we might click, then send me a message! I tend to play most on Discord, just because it's the simplest form of communication while I'm on my phone which I almost always have on me. ",

I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nSo, what am I looking for? I'm looking for a story based around the after of the events that take place in FNV.\\~ I would love to explore California or other areas that can keep the same 'Western' feel as the game, and would personally love to play my version of Courier Six (Also am more then okay with it just being still in the Mojave!) I think ten or so years after the events of the game would be a great time to pick up, I'm also open to it being as far as 25 years later! You can play whatever character you would like, maybe even a different number courier that affected the Mojave as much as six did? I'd love to explore alot of western themes that have become staples; Especially the one that involves what living a life full of violence may bring on some one, and if you can ever escape a past like such.\n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well. So, if you're going to play a male character just keep in mind I wouldn't want a romance story.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

The patient is your muse, meaning you can\u00a0\ncreate him however you like. However, I'll provide a bit of information for\u00a0\na plot. After the killings of multiple people, your muse was found not\u00a0\nguilty by reason of insanity, and was sent to a maximum security asylum to\u00a0\nlive out the rest of his days.\u00a0\n\n~Scenario~\n\nThere, he is assigned a nurse to tend to him daily (my muse). His\u00a0\npsychopathic tendencies calm, but only with her. However, this newfound\u00a0\nsensation of infatuation confuses him, maybe even scares him, and he\u00a0\nreturns to his violent ways. Becoming so out of control, he breaks out of\u00a0\nhis cell and rampages through the hospital, taking down everyone in his\u00a0\nway. Within the utter mayhem of his escape, he decides to kidnap my muse\u00a0\nand make it away from the hospital.\u00a0\n\nWe can take this route, or make a completely new one.\n\n~Requirements/Rules~\n\n1) Obviously, I ask that you be over 18.\n\n2) I only want experienced partners, please -- someone who\u00a0\ncan write more than a paragraph.\n\n3)  Please write in 3rd person, present tense.\n\n4) Please have a detailed description of your muse ready to go.\n\n5) Lastly, please do not abandon the conversation without\u00a0\nnotice. I absolutely despise that. Of course, I'll understand emergencies.\n\nWe can further discuss storyline details (location, world building, etc.)\u00a0\nonce you've messaged me.\n\nFinal Note: Please do not just say \"hello\". You will be ignored, if\u00a0\nnot blocked. Please introduce yourself properly and tell me what you're\u00a0\ninquiring me about. Thanks!\n\n",

I don\u2019t care about my partner\u2019s gender and I am versatile enough to play either a male or a female. I do roleplay exclusively through Discord and I prefer my partner be versed in using the forum. I do hope to hear from a potential partner soon.

Just wanted a cup of tea, maybe one of those fresh baked cookies.\n\nSeems some people I pissed off decided today was the perfect time for some payback. It had to be revenge, don't owe anyone money that I remember. \n\nIt was over before it really began, seems they weren't much for a fair fight. Once it was apparent I was ready for a fight, they took off. Even managed to get rid of them without causing too much damage to the coffee shop. Except the one window and a table, which I will gladly repair for you.\n\nThe RP would be set in the modern world, one where magic is all too real. Mages, witches, vampires, fairies: they all exist and so do their unsavory brethren. The average person on the street has their suspicions, but we tend to do a pretty fair job of keeping the non-magi in the dark.\n\nYou could be a baseline human or perhaps something more. That's entirely up to you.",

            "selftext": "Hi,  \n\n\nI am looking for people to discuss starting a long-term roleplay with, in a sci fi / space opera setting. Ideally, I would like someone who is equally passionate about their writing and takes pride in it - and thus exercises some discipline with regards to grammar and good writing practices. My style of writing is plot-driven, improvisational, and highly empathetic to each character, their unique quirks and how they develop over time.   \n\n\nFor this particular roleplay I'm looking to focus on SFW themes, particularly: romance, adventure and thriller. Somewhere along the lines of Doctor Who meets Mass Effect, perhaps. I am comfortable playing both male and female characters, and would probably play more than one.   \n\n\nIf you're interested, please message me an idea for a character you might want to play, as well as one key weakness they might have. (I am open to any medium - either e-mail or something else works for me). I'm playing around with a somewhat more light-hearted tone, so here's a possible introduction to a character I might use in the story:  \n\n\n \\*\\*\n\nA lone light blinked in a universe of darkness. It gaped open to form a mouth, as air seeped in and darkness escaped. A spaceship bearing many colors entered. It flew through skies of pitch black. It landed on ground that was charcoal black. A man in a black suit and black shirt stepped out. His black shoes croaked as it landed against the cracked stains of the surface. Ordinarily space travelers were not so well groomed. But this was no ordinary space traveler. And this was no ordinary day.  \n\n\nThe man walked for several miles and found himself opposite a giant stone black monument. It was shaped like an archway with a black veil flowing down the middle. The man stood facing the gateway and yelled at the top of his voice.\n\n  \n\"I am Alfred Zilch! I have traveled from many galaxies away to search for the ultimate truth of the universe. Today is a glorious day. Because my search is finally at an end! I stand before the Black Gateway! The one and only ultimate source of truth in the universe! As the first mortal man to complete this incredible journey, I command you, show me the truth!\"\n\n  \n\"Hmm.. you have traveled very far indeed, Zilch.\" A roaring voice, came from beyond the veil. It continued to speak without an apparent body. \"Oh what wonderful adventures you've had. What amazing feats of accomplishment. And at such a young age. Truly impressive indeed. Oh what's this..\"\n\n  \n\"Alfred Zilch, where is your wife?\" the voice asked.\n\n  \n\"My wife? Uh, I'm not sure I understand. I don't have a wife.\" Zilch answered.\n\n  \n\"Uhh, girlfriend, then? Boyfriend?\" the voice asked.\n\n  \n\"Nope, I am single. Listen Mr. Gateway, I'm not sure exactly how this is relevant. Please bestow upon me your glorious gift of omniscience and I will be on my way..\"\n\n  \n\"Uh, hold on for a second, what about your ex? I can maybe work with that.\"\n\n  \n\"Uhm. I've never been in a relationship.\" Zilch answered.\n\n  \n\"NEVER BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP?!! PREPOSTEROUS!!\" The voice bellowed.\n\n  \n\"Honestly I don't see the relevance of this. I have accomplished more than any other mortal man in the universe. Surely, I've earned my right to the ultimate truth.\"\n\n  \n\"But but, what do you do when you're lonely, man?!\" The voice asked.\n\n  \n\"Um. I read, I suppose. Plenty of things to read when I have thirty three centuries of history and literature catalogued right here on the hour-hand of my watch.\"\n\n  \n\"But, how do you expect learn everything there is to know about the universe, when you don't even know everything there is to know in the human world. I mean I've seen toddlers hooking up these days to play house. My God, man, what have you been doing all your life.\"\n\n  \nZilch stared back blankly. \"You're not honestly saying that I can't see the ultimate truth, because I don't have a girlfriend.\"\n\n  \n\"No, I am not saying that.\" the voice replied argumentatively. \"I am saying you can't see the ultimate truth because you don't have a girlfriend or a boyfriend or any romantic relationship. And have never had one.\"\n\n  \n\"But love is an illusion. It is fake. It is a lie people tell themselves to blind themselves from the truth of the universe.\" Zilch answered. \"At the end of the day, everyone dies alone. So what is the point? It only detracts away from one's ability to know everything. Surely something as menial as love cannot be the prerequisite for something as noble as seeking out truth!\"\n\n  \n\"Oh, but I am afraid it is. It is one thing to die alone. It is quite another to live alone.\" the voice answered. \"So it has been proclaimed. You, Alfred Zilch, will not return to this place until you have found romantic love at some capacity. Then and only then will you be permitted to witness the awesome truth of the universe. That is my final word. Gooodbyeeeee!\" The voice said, as it gradually deepened, fading out to nothing.\n\n  \nZilch stood there against the wind as it blew against his black hair.\n\n\\*\\*",

            "selftext": "Hey there, back again. \n\nI\u2019m generally always looking for new and hopefully long term partners. To start, I prefer OC worlds. I\u2019m just not into too many fandoms. But, if you want to add in a fandom character I\u2019m sure we could make it work!\n\nMy lines in the sand:\nAll characters and players must be 18+ and no self insertion will be permitted.\n\nOther than that, I\u2019m pretty much anything goes. Literacy isn\u2019t high on my priority list, but I really can\u2019t RP if I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to say, and I can\u2019t RP with someone who doesn\u2019t give me enough writing to work off of myself. I can play a variety of male or female characters, and I generally role play in 3rd person. \n\nSome genres I\u2019m interested in (+ indicates a strong desire); horror++, cyberpunk, sci-fi+, modern/urban fantasy+, slice of life. \n\nBit of basic info about me personally. I\u2019m a 22 year old female in the west coast of the United States so I\u2019m on PST time. A hobbyist artist, music enthusiast and general dork. \n\nFeel free to DM me on discord (@neighborhoodcryptid#8335) as that is where I\u2019m usually RPing \ud83d\ude42\n\nHope to hear from you!",

I want to write with you for a long time, especially if I like you.\n\n- Discord. While not an absolute must for the sake of the rules, I vastly prefer it to any other medium.\n\n- Platonic relationships. Never thought I'd need to specify this, but I do want to also play non-romantic relationships between characters. Frodo and Sam, Hand and Chewie, that sort of thing.\n\n- Someone who doesn't care about post length. I don't ask for a lot, and while sometimes I go lengthy I prefer that you move the story along even if its short. Size doesn't matter, basically.\n\n- A partner who will communicate freely and can give and take criticism in a civil manner is another must, as I need to know when I am making a mistake or an error and I do like to point those out to my partners as well to help keep things on track.\n\nI love a lot of collaboration, so if you think you match these criteria then I would like to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nFirst and foremost, I would greatly prefer 18+ and literate! I like nsfw themes in my RPs (not just smut!) so I like if my partner is over that age. I will also point out that I have periods where I might take a day or two to reply, as real life normally comes first for me. I'm going to be starting a new job soon and school in August, so sometimes my stress gets the better of me and I don't have the motivation to reply. But! That does not mean I'm not interested, so please don't take it that way! I also have an easier time responding if I befriend whoever I'm writing with.\n\nI have one specific graving for an RP that I've been wanting to do, and that's based off of an anime called Gakkou Gurashi, or School-Live!. If you haven't seen it, that's perfectly fine. The premise that I want to roleplay on is how their zombies function, and basically the set up of their world. The zombies are known to have memories of there past. For example, during weekdays, the streets are mostly quiet because everyone's at work or at school, and when it rains they try to seek shelter while also getting stronger. There have also been cases in the show where a zombie might remember someone and try to protect them/save them, even if it's temporary.\n\nIt's learned in the series that their town was an experiment for a bio-chemical weapon, and several buildings are built with things to help sustain life for long periods of time, along with antidotes that are hidden in said buildings. Now of course to start, our characters wouldn't know this knowledge, but it could be used for future reference.\n\nIf you're not interested in that, but would maybe still like a partner, then here's my basic interests!\n\nGenre: Fantasy, Horror, Slice of Life, Drama - I'm open to just about anything but these are my personal favorites.\n\nFandoms: Steven Universe, Shingeki no Bahamut, Supernatural, Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, Tokyo Ghoul, Dead By Daylight, Amnesia: Memories, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, Detroit: Become Human, Life is Strange, Oxenfree, Silent Hill, and a lot more if you want to just ask me! :)\n\nI also have my own worlds I've built for Vampires and Magic if you're interested in those! Please also know that while I don't mind smut in my rps, I will not write it if it's the sole purpose for the rp.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon!\n",

            "selftext": "Hiya.  I'm Gates.  It's a pleasure, and I apologize for the minor textwall.\n\nI'm not going to get into the weeds of things, but suffice to say that I've been around a few times, and - if it matters - I'm on the Gold List of RPCentral.  Still, I'm picky.  As long as you know what you're doing, and you like what you're about to read, then we're in business, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nSo.  I'm a pretty decent roleplayer with no real hangups and no real limits.  I'm in it for the writing, and if you're in it for the writing, I'm happy.  All that I ask is that what we write isn't simply gratuity for its own sake.  Swear and kill to your heart's content - but if you make it dark, make it dark for a reason.  And of course, that you have a character who can actually work with the story we make.  I\u2019ll work to accommodate you, so all I ask is that you do the same.\n\nI love damn near every genre except fandoms, and I'll roleplay with pretty much anything you have to offer.  But there's one big hangup with me.  I'm a big fan of DM/GM/(whatever the hell you want to call it)ing.  The way I see it, it's like writing a book, where you control the main character.  I might control the plot and the world - but God knows how you'll affect them.  And, besides, if I like you, I'd be happy to do something more traditional.\n\nLastly, I'm looking for plenty of different stories and genres.  If you've got a preference or idea, throw 'em at me.  But I'm most wanting something science fiction - and I've got a story I'm really wanting to do in it.  So if that's your boat, let me know.\n\nOkay!  That does it.  Feel free to PM me, or send me a singing telegram.  Past here, it\u2019s just a (not so) brief look at Lead and Filth, my sci-fi story.\n\n\\---\n\nIn the year 2798, humanity has stretched across the solar system, from the burned shores of Mercury to lonely mining stations in the Kuiper Belt.  From humble origins on Earth, every planet and moon is now graced - or damned - with human light.  And though humanity faced  near-extinction in the Last War, where the aging, greedy nations of old Earth waged nuclear war upon each other, humanity has survived and prospered.  From the Skyways of Venus, to the vast Tarsus Shipyards, to the Seventeen Courts of Mars, human hands have made human glory.\n\nOnce, nearly all of it lay under the dominion of the Ashen Empire, ruled by House Caen from their Burning Court on Mars, but the weight of their empire and the ferocity of their enemies led the Ashen Empire to a final collapse.\n\nNow House Caen rules the weak and fractured remnant of their empire, the Imperium of Mars, which stands divided by nobles, corporations, and the wolves which circle ever closer.  Their enemies in the Solitas Republic from Earth, House Aurenius of Ganymede, and the Commonwealth of the Asteroid Belt.  And even beyond them, from the Hollows deep beneath Mars, the rage of the people builds toward fever pitch.\n\nCrisis grips the solar system - and your family is in the center of it.\n\nFormerly an insignificant, poverty-stricken house on the verge of being mere common folk, your house has come into recent wealth, allowing new opportunities - and bringing unwanted eyes.  Your family has seen fit to pay your way into the Imperial War College, where the Knights of Mars are forged, where alliances might be built, and where your first enemies might be found.\n\nFrom humble beginnings, the tides of change - through wealth, war, intrigue, and perhaps even revolution - will thrust you into the forefront of the solar system.  Where you take your path is up to you.  If you survive, allies, wealth, and perhaps even true power will come - and with them will come enemies wishing to strip all of them away. \n\nNo matter your path, the way to deliverance is simple.  Rise and conquer, or fall into darkness.  ",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, some Fandoms.\n\nWhat I hope to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world. A GM/DM is who I am mainly looking for as a partner.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, feel free to PM me!

I'd prefer roleplaying with a F, but a M playing a F is totally fine!\n\nSome ideas I have: \n\n\\-My character being a Hannibal Lecter type character, sophisticated, with a good profession like a doctor/therapist who moonlights as a serial killer, and my partner's character being either the patient, or main detective on the case. I'm a fan of psychological dramas and dark romances, so this one is a favorite idea of mine. \n\n\\-A *Saw* type setting, with my character having a Jigsaw type role, and training a successor in the same vein as how Jigsaw trained Amanda Young. \n\nI'm well over 18, so I can RP smut, however you *have* to be 18+ or I'm not down with that. My ideas are still rough, so I'd love to hit it off with someone and develop them further, and hopefully have a fun time! Hit me up if you're interested!",

I have always had love for role playing and through the years have switched back and forth between different sources to find my partner(s). I am not looking for a healthy balance roleplay. Here are some of the ideas I have jogging around in the back of my mind (feel free to bring your own ideas if you\u2019re interested in a role-play with me): \n\n1.) Pirate misadventure(s): this RP takes place in the mid 1700(s) on the high seas and in between ports for a romance between my OC and yours. \n\n2.) A Viking(s) Glory: this RP follows the story of a stranger war party consisting of two people your OC and my own. \n\n3.)***expansion*** My idea takes place in a Dystopian society (future or past) where the towns people will take their most beautiful women and ritualistically offer them up as an offering to their God(s). The two main deities consist of a brother and sister god/goddess whom remain youthful from their conquest of the offering or the \u201cchosen\u201d. The mortals of the town refer to the gods as Ala for the female deity and Laeo for the Male.\n\nPM me if you have more ideas !! \n",

            "selftext": "The Ashen Coast was founded by Aelor Blackburn, bastard son of Aenys Targaryen. Aelor founded the coast with his wife and his dragon Ashal. Aenys set up five regions for his descendants to rule. These five regions were the Ashgrounds, the Faithgrounds, the Nestgrounds, the Greengrounds, and the Imperial Lands. His Conquest was however not opposed. Aelor had to submit some people to his rule, so he had to subjugate some people to his reign. \n\nAelor then sent his four children to rule the regions he had set up. His two sons Raenin and Valis, and two daughters Aylassa and Daena went to rule the city capital in each region. Raenin went to rule the city and establish the city Blackburn in the Ashgrounds. Valis went to rule and establish the city Highpyre in the Faithgrounds. Aylassa went to rule and establish the city Charstone in the Nestgrounds. Following suit Daena went to rule and establish the city Hearthscale in the Greengrounds. \n\n\nAelor eventually stood down from his position as emperor and passed it on to Raenin. His other children didn't see it fair though. They thought each of them deserved to rule. So they proposed to their brother they would each rule independent kingdoms. Raenis denied and they all went to war. Each of his siblings changed their name in retaliation. Valis changed his name to Highpyre, Aylassa changed hers to Charstone, and Daena Changed hers to Hearthscale.\n\nThe war became known as the War of the 4 Ashen Dragons, and it spanned 5 years. Over the course of the war many men died, and a few dragons. In the end though it was established that the Ashen Coast in it's entirety would be ruled by House Blackburn. Although each region was set up with one of the other families as lords paramount. With Charstone being paramount over the Nestgrounds, Hearthscale being paramount over the Greengrounds, and Highpyre being paramount over the Faithgrounds. \n\nThe Ashen Coast survived since then with a few occurrences of war and minor uprisings. Each time the country went to war destructive because of the dragons in their possession.\n\nI have a few places the story can go from this point so PM me if you are interested.

            "selftext": "Hello there, redditors!\n\nI'm looking for a partner for a plot I have been craving. Before I hop into the plot, though, I'll get a few things out of the way.\n\nAbout me:\n\n+ Older than 21;\n+ Work full time;\n+ Write solely through email;\n+ Don't use IM;\n+ Post roughly once a day;\n+ Like longer, more involved posts;\n+ Ditch-friendly (just let me know so I can reopen the request);\n+ English is my second language, but I've got a decent enough grasp and welcome correction.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n+ Older than 21;\n+ Understands real life gets busy;\n+ Is okay with writing and plotting being done through email;\n+ Posts in a timely fashion (anything from once a day to a one or two times a week is fair game);\n+ Likes to write longer, more involved posts (I'd say about 3 paragraphs, though if we're on a quicker back and forth posts can be shorter to get more out of the session);\n+ Is open about telling me if you don't want to do this anymore - no questions asked, no guilt-tripping from me;\n+ Doesn't need to be a native English speaker, as long as there's a decent grasp on grammar and spelling.\n\nIf you're still there after this list that probably makes me sound high maintenance, here's the rough outline of the plot I'm looking to write:\n\nSetting: Any country during a fictional war.\nCharacters:\nYours: A high ranking soldier from one of the countries.\nMine: A young girl of modest upbringing. She was born in the rival country, but has moved to the other one as a young child after her father passed away, and lived there since. When war breaks out, her father's old friends - all in the military - pay a visit or write to her, pressuring or threatening her into finding employment with the military man and passing along anything she can. She initially gives in out of fear, but as time goes by, she starts falling for him.\n\nI would love to see a romance developing between them, to the point where they get married. Maybe, for added drama, she gets caught when they're already expecting their first child, and he has to then decide where his loyalty is? We can do away with that, though I'd loooove to see that unfold because I'm a trash drama whore.\n\nI think I wrote more than I had originally planned, but it happens. If this is something that interests you, please hit me up and I'll drop you my e-mail address! Thank you for reading!\n",

Ever since that day, you saw yourself as indebted to me. We became very close friends, hanging out with each other whenever we could. You made a promise to yourself that you would always be around to protect and cherish me, developing an extremely overprotective attitude towards me. As we grew older, you realized that you loved me not only as a friend, but romantically. (You may choose to openly show this or be more reserved.) You were quite apathetic to everyone else, but you were content as long as you had me. \n\nThis is the basis of our relationship if you choose that. If you know how Mikasa and Eren\u2019s relationship is in AOT, then you\u2019d probably know that I based it off that. I\u2019d like to augment the story by making them apart of a fantasy world where they join an academy. Maybe with superpowers, or magic? I had an idea that everyone was born with a magic birth weapon and you joined a school to hone your skills with it, so we can do that too.\n\n\n\nYandere\n\nOf course, we have your other option. This would start off in the same way in that I helped you when we were kids in some form. Though we never became friends, just acquaintances. You didn\u2019t see us that way though. You became dangerously obsessed with me, convincing yourself that we were destined to be together and that you definitely WOULD marry me. Your obsession became destructive in nature as you would hurt yourself and others when it came to me, especially other girls. As we entered our senior year of high school, you decided that this year you would definitely make your move. \n\nI was thinking that this could probably be in a realistic world. If you choose this, I want you to be truly psychotic and cunning in your crusade to procure a relationship. \n\n\n\nI want someone DETAILED, LITERATE, and ACTIVE. If you read everything, I\u2019d like you to include \u201cBears\u201d in your first message.\n\n",

He\u2019s a comic OC from the beginning, but recently I have strayed from it. His a war vet, no stranger to loss, being blackmailed to work for a mob boss, and has the mutant ability to make fire with his hands, among other things. Aside from the shitposting I do, I usually crank out oneshot stores and parts of various ongoing storylines, and RPs. \nI like the Instagram RP community, and that\u2019s such an easy platform to RP on, and I\u2019ve made lifelong friends. But lately I\u2019ve hit a wall with my muse. I love my character, but I could use some fresh minds to critique him. I know he\u2019s got a lot of flaws but it makes the stories and the RPs interesting. I\u2019d also love some more people to read my stories and just to interact with.\nWhether it\u2019s on your personal Instagram account, or you have/wanna make an RP account there, PM me and I\u2019ll give you my username!\nThanks!",

Dark fantasy revolves around the gritty things : thievery, crime, small villages ransacked, bandits, things like that. I enjoy the feel of that instead of a bright fantasy world, the creatures will be disgusting creatures that are completely repulsive. Just pm me your discord and I\u2019ll be sure to contact you and even if you don\u2019t quite like my idea, we can sort something out! My time zone is EST, by the way. Maybe more people could be involved, I haven\u2019t decided yet.",

The main idea that I have for now is that it is a fully functioning park, and then something, of course, goes awry. For this RP, I'm looking something more story-driven, and character heavy. World and character building will be a large part of it. \n\nI do not have a set storyline or direction for this RP, that way we could both be a part of the decisions and moving the story along! This would be a long-term roleplay, if possible. This could be an extremely fun Roleplay, as I love the idea of a park filled with creatures from the prehistoric eras!\n\nI am not picky about styles, but I would like someone who can at least write a well-described thought in a few sentences. I personally write in the paragraph style, and I fluctuate between 3rd and 1st person between roleplays. \n\nI am an 18,year old gay male, and so any NSFW situations would have to be M/M related, or played by a girl who can write a convincingly as a male. HOWEVER, I am not only looking for an NSFW RP, so if you are female and wish to participate in a non-NSFW RP, awesome!\n\nHope to talk and experience some prehistoric chaos soon!",

            "selftext": "\u2022 [Basic Info]: I should note I am not the owner, but an assistant helping it grow. I helped develop lore and I\u2019m also assisting in trying to gain more members. We use a dice roll system and have stats such as a typical DnD based rp for combat and what not. \n\u2022 [Story/Plot]: The story begins on the island of Maex, a large continent packed with 3 prominent kingdoms with varying regions and cultures. However, there is a 4th that has been shunned by history for its bloodthirsty invasion of the continent, simply named \u2018The Maexian Empire\u2019. They were a Aztec like culture and invaded the prominent kingdom of Highland, and secondary of Ja\u2019kar. The two would forge an alliance as the pushes back the attacking forces and kept them quarantined back into the jungle of Maex. Many years later, the Highlander King Argon is killed by a mysterious Maex assassin, spreading rumor that the Maexian Empire will rise again soon with the collection of 6 ancient orbs spread across the continent to awaken an ancient god. ((Note: I am currently trying to assist in the lore as it has some flaws, so bare with me)) Instead of sending an army or official forces to check on this as an act of war, the Highland government issues a warrant on the assassin and collecting the orbs to random adventurers ((You)) to prevent another war with high pay as reward. This is only the first arc once it is completed, having many more to come .\n\u2022 [Locations]: There are 3 main kingdoms on the continent ignoring the Maexian\u2019s and their jungle. The first foremost is known as \u2018Highland\u2019, a kingdom in the center of the continent with far ranging forests, snowy mountain peaks, volcanoic locations of lava pools and obsidian terrain, to a secret underground forest that holds something unknown. The people are typical fantasy medieval themed, with knights while having a bit more of a Nordic influence than European. The second kingdom takes up th western side of the continent known as \u2018Ja\u2019kar\u2019. It is a vast biome with blazing hot sand dunes and Rocky Mountains, however having 3 capital kingdoms with their own provinces that work in unison as a union. The people have a middle eastern theme such as Persian or Arabic, but uniquely have a biome bordering the jungle of the Maexians in a Savanna like terrain with a African tribal like people. Finally, the eastern side of the continent is called \u2018Underkeep\u2019 which is filled with mostly grueling swamps with deadly fauna and toxic fogs, to humid dry mountains south of it with dirt and dust. The center of Underkeep has a large lake, with a island roughly the size of London with a Victorian theme, yet still medieval. \n\u2022 [Details]: There is magic just to say, and you may pick from any kingdom you which have many varying races beside human ((Such as crocodile people, literal mice people of actual size, or other things that are difficult to explain)). You can have 4 characters maxium, as anything you want of course. You do not have to follow the main plotline of the bounty as there are side quests to offer or free style rp that does not have to be certain quests.\n\u2022 [Final] For now, that is all I can mention as we are still working on the lore ((But it is completely for the majority) and looking for people to join. Please feel free to stop by and ask any questions that we\u2019re not stated here.  \nhttps://discord.gg/4ys4syE",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am a 21 year old US\nmale looking for a Roleplay partner. I am not very strict on the requirements for that partner... the only thing I ask is a passion for writing.. the response length can vary depending on where we are within our writing: \n\n1.)\u201cFrom another world\u201d-This Roleplay follows the story of a young man who has washed ashore and has been found by your OC ... against your mothers orders you allow my OC to take refuge within your OC\u2019s home for a strange connection your OC feels for mine. The plot could evolve in a number of ways we can discuss in more detail if this plot interest you.\n\n2.) \u201cTitans GO!\u201d- This role-play feeds more into my own love for the teen titans and I wanted to create a plot around the day in and day out lives of the titans... we could play our own OC(s) who have been added to the team or we could plays as some of the titans ourselves evolving their characters in whatever plot we see fit.\n\n3.)\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the Winchester\u2019s\u201d- This role-play takes place within the realm of the hit-tv show \u201cSupernatural\u201d. I am a huge fan of the show and of almost every single character brought to life on the show either as hunter or hunted... why not write our own story based off of their rules. \n\n4.) \u201cWe ain\u2019t in Kansas anymore\u201d- This idea is actually the brainchild of my recent rewatching of two staple retro anime\u2019s \u201cCowboy Bebop\u201d as well as \u201cSpace Dandy\u201d. I thought the idea of my OC exploring all of time and space with another\u2019s OC for the exploit of currency would be fun . This plot is extremely volatile and we could discuss more details of this is a tune you\u2019re tapping your feet to.\n\nI am extremely open to other ideas... these are just some I had kicking around my noggin. \n\nPM if interested!\n",

We have two primary kingdoms, one in the midst of a full-fledged rebellion and the other ruled by a mad king who claims to be a god and has fathered hundreds of bastards who are all fighting to rule after him. These are all highly wanted canons with multiple connected characters already in play and thus guaranteed dramatic story lines. We are 18+, 3-3-3 rating and a premium jcink board.  We also have an active discord so if you care to come check it out, you can do so [here](http://xroyalsandrebels.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=2071&amp;st=0&amp;#entry9678).\n\n**Khanos Zakarne**\n\n&gt;*The mad king of Myrh established himself as a god with a wrath and cunning worth fearing. He presides over a court of secrets and power struggles, his own multitude of bastard children being his greatest weapon- though it be a double-edged blade. He plays his children against one another as they await their chance at the crown, due to no legitimate heir. They in turn present loyalty and service, until the old, mad, god-king of Myrh finally loses to the very games he employs to keep both allies and enemies alike in check.*\n\n**Balan Storm**\n\n&gt;*As a bastard son of the god-king, Balan Storm should have gotten everything he wanted. He took land and title, and the position of Lord Huntsman in his father's court- tracking down other siblings who try to hide- easily enough, but what he could never capture was the heart of obsession, Iseult Sabanok. She reciprocated the interest for a time, but instead fell in love with Malphas Storm, one of Balan's half-siblings. Seeking revenge, Balan became lover to Iseult's married sister, Lyona Valefar, fathering a child by her that he has only recently learned of, twenty-three years after the child's birth. He now finds himself promised to protect his son, Krispin, searching for ways he might prove useful in the constant struggle in the god-king's court...*\n\n**Silas Storm**\n\n&gt;*The King's Shield, another bastard son of the king and a servant woman. He clawed his way up to the top to head his father's personal guard. He takes after his father in pure sadism and is highly ambitious in his quest for the throne. Silas is utterly ruthless in his dealings with his siblings and a strong contender for the throne.*\n\n**Nimue Valefar**\n\n&gt;*When everyone is looking to take, you must be able to give... a sword to the gut. Despite discouragement from learning how, Nimue is better with a sword than most would be willing to test themselves against. She stands with her brother to protect her family against a court of wolves and snakes. It's complicated by a nephew's illegitimate lineage that could have that court knocking down the door...*\n\n**Rohar Vyrwel**\n\n&gt; *Cousin to the king of Draiwen and a reluctant rebel spy, Rohar finds himself guilty of passing on information to the rebellion that resulted in a vanished princess and an attempt on the royal family's lives. The royals are now searching for rebel spies, and he's sure to be caught. With a new kingdom coming into play, it's possible this silver-tongued and obviously wronged noble can dig himself out the mess he's been dragged into.* ",

            "selftext": "Hello role players my name is Hat and I\u2019m here to get as many of you people into our RP Inexplicable Reference to the End of the Story. We have been rocking and rolling for seven years now and we are looking for some fresh new blood.  \nOur group is a bit small but it's full of creativity. We run what is basically a science fantasy slice of life adventure group. Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains (usually me) to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.  \nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, lords of chaos, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence. Feel free to choose from our RPs take on the pure magic races such as elves, dwarves, etc. or go nuts and make something crazy and we will add it to our species list.  \nThe world is alive with more lore than you could learn in several years and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature.  \nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.  \nStart in any corner of local reality you wish, and play however it is you want. Go for a more morally upright guardian soldier in the Ultram Alliance ready to fight for freedom and justice, or play as an imperial inquisitor scouring entire worlds in flame for their crimes against the Empire.  \nBe a righteous stand up dude or a right bastard it\u2019s up to you. How far you go depends on your drive, ingenuity, adaptability, and intelligence.  \nAlso to clarify as there have been some misunderstandigns. This world contains both magic and science in equal mixes. Neither is hard, so don't ask for the molecular structure of arcane. You can get very powerful with both arcane and tech, it just takes time as power comes from time spent active. That means if you spend every day working on things and do that for a month, you beat out the guy who does nothing for six months. As well, we move in real time. That may be a drag but we do it so that characters don't become locked in interactions with people who show up more rarely. One member bless her heart is a Paramedic. Valuable as that is, if you talk to her and had to wait, you would be trapped as she shows up for only a few minutes every couple days due to her work. That means when you leave if the scene goes on, your character will auto pilot to whatever it is you want them to do. Training, research, sleeping, eating, whatever. Please know that it may feel strange or bad, but we have lasted this long so something is working. It's like some games, the start sucks the most, but get past that and it becomes a lot more fun. Like Warframe. Or getting addicted to League of Legends.  \nPlease not we are most active from 8-1 central time. We sometimes have intermittent RP through the day but it\u2019s not regular by any means. We are willing to accept people worldwide but if you are in a time zone that makes regular activity easy in our prime RP times I cannot guarantee you will get as much out of the RP as others.  \nIt\u2019s important to note combat is a fairly large part of the RP. We have a fairly significant plot coming up involving a war for a very strategic system. While utility and slice of life characters have their place it\u2019s important prospective recruits have a main character that is combat viable.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n- I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\n- Real Life Romance\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- Sci-Fi\n\n- Mecha\n\n- Halo\n\n- Elder Scrolls\n\n- Destiny\n\n- Superhero\n\n- Apocalypse\n\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs\n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

            "selftext": "The group is called Korlia Fantasy Role-playing game It was created by me mechanically with help of a few play testers to polish the system up to snuff. All players will travel to the land of Korlia about 6 months after the sun mysteriously stopped at dawn for 5 hours, rumors coming out of the land state that 4 of the 6 greater Gods appeared in front of two competing armies and reversed a bloody battle manipulated by a man called the \"Inquisitor.\"  \n\nMain draws:\n\n**7 Stat combat:** Hp, Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Endurance, Stamina, and AP.\n\n**Dodge/Defend:** Dodge is all or nothing, defend is 20&amp;#37; damage resistance blocking up to 75&amp;#37; on a successful defend, adds strategy to fights.  Tactical reversals to make sure you can last longer, switch to defense if they are targeting your low Dexterity, or switch to dodging if they are targeting your low Endurance!\n\n**Quick start:** Learn skills for battle, each character starts with bonus ways to get skills per race. Start with 4 skill slots and 4 shape slots.\n\n**Rebirth system:** If a character dies, you carry 20&amp;#37; Gold, Reputation, Exp to the next character, with an additional 10&amp;#37; and 30&amp;#37; to two choices and the ability to carry more with specific upgrades.\n\n**Character Dukedoms:** Players can use missions and if they meet the staffing requirements can move into a taken castle.\n\n**War Battles:** basically like above PVP with added Npcs, Allies and Enemies.\n\n**Classes and Races:** Extra customization 13 classes 5 races. The game starts with 6 unlocked and more will be unlocked as the game progresses.\n\n**Many Weapons:** Many types with upgrades and Legendary weapon missions.\n\n**Shapecrafting:** custom magic system you can use to craft spells on the fly, note this is limited to one race at the start but not by class.\n\n**Multiple Mods:** 3 main mods and a 1 mission mod for every 5 players. Mission mods have access to Npcs to make games more interactive and deeper. \n\n**RP Rewards:** Get rewarded for some RP actions such as If you work as a smith and a player wants to get their weapon upgraded, the player can gain a portion of the gold it costs to get upgraded, or work as a guard and get paid to fight Outlaws.\n\n**Range Based Combat:** Move into melee to have an enemy bowmen scramble to get a clear shot.\n\n**Several Battle Types:** from Friendly spar to all out battle to the death in the trenches of war.\n\n**Request a mission:** Bored and need something to do?   Ask a Mod/Mission Mod if they can give you a quest to do, usually they will.  RP?  Battle?  Working?  There are missions that can fit every need!\n\nWill you rise to power in the lands of Korlia?

            "selftext": "Greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...My Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Pokemon, Splatoon, and Legend of Zelda.  I can try other fandoms but that's a case by case thing and anything that holds ZERO similarity to what I am looking for is likely a hard no.  Some outlying ideas people have come to me with being things like Kingdom Hearts, Skullgirls and Shantae for example.  With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",

            "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m Lesli. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for quite a while, but I stopped for some time and I want to get back into it. I\u2019m currently on summer break with next to nothing to do. I\u2019m looking for maybe a light, fluffy romance with some adventure type element to it. \nSo, I\u2019ve had one or two posts about half a year ago about this fish out of water roleplay, and all of them were really good but all of them also ghosted on me without a trace. So, here I am. I hate starting with prompts, because I never know how to respond to them, so the very basic idea is one of us is dropped into another world, be it the past, present, or future, any made up or real planet, etc. with the other one and they\u2019re forced to kind of get to know each other based off of finding out the ethics and culture of this new world. It could maybe have, I forget the name of the syndrome, but it\u2019s like falling in love with your captor like Belle and the Beast. If you find that part interesting but aren\u2019t the most creative coming up with your own species, I have my own and I would be willing to play it with you. \nI don\u2019t really have many ideas for the slice of life. They could be work, high school, college, whatever. I feel like college or work is more my style but whatever fits your fancy.\nI am a very open playing partner, I\u2019m relatively easy to get along with, and if you have a certain thing with the play that you don\u2019t like, like you think that this character should look a little more like this or you want to scrap this character and bring in a more enemy character or likable character, I would totally be willing to do that. \nShoot me a PM if you\u2019re interested and we can get started!",

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow writers! Thank you for taking the time to read my roleplay post.  Let me start off by introducing myself \u2014 I\u2019m a man in his mid-20s who (like many of you) is seeking to find a roleplay partner.  I've been somewhat busy due to a combination of work and grad school, but as of late, it has been truly refreshing to connect with so many other like-minded people in this community of writers.  Given that I\u2019m expecting to have a bit more time on my hands in the upcoming weeks, I figured I\u2019d reach out again, and hopefully find a few more mature, talented writers.\n\n&gt;**Preferred Genres:**\n\nMy writing tends to span a wide variety of genres\u2014including science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic modern fiction.  My writing has spanned both a personal as well professional nature, and as a result, I\u2019m always up for experimenting with new genres and writing styles.  Recently, I\u2019ve been dabbling a bit more in fantasy themes; however, I\u2019m still a novice when it comes to taking on high-fantasy themes.\n\n&gt;**Writing Style:**\n\nI will humbly admit that I tend to be a voracious writer, and as a result, my posts frequently range in the 3-4+ paragraph range.  Granted, there are certain occasions when a shorter length is more desirable (especially in conversational, or dialogue-intensive scenes)\u2014and this is certainly something I implement when necessary.  I\u2019m a strong believer in quality over quantity, and I\u2019m hoping to find a fellow writer who has an appreciation for packing a large quantity of details in a condensed post (within reason).\n\n&gt;**Collaboration:**\n\nFor me, the pre-writing, collaborative stage is as enjoyable as the writing process itself.  I know that some writers prefer to jump head-first into writing the story itself\u2014with minimal discussion.  Based on experience, this approach is due to the fact that some writers fear that too much discussion may \u201creveal\u201d too much of the plot prior to writing.  While this is certainly a valid point, it is important for me to mention that my discussions do not pertain to plot;  rather, they pertain to exploring the characters\u2019 backstories, emotional orientations, cultural groundings, and other such factors.  It\u2019s more with regard to developing a creative discourse with my writing partner to truly immerse\u2014and \u201clive\u201d\u2014the experiences of our characters.  To me, it is this level of exploration and collaboration that truly make roleplaying a much more engaging process as compared to solo writing.\n\n&gt;**Writing Platforms:**\n\nI prefer to write my stories via email; however, I strongly prefer to collaborate with my co-writers via a text IM platform such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or Discord.  This is largely because an IM platform allows for a truly conversational, back-and-forth discourse about the story (rather than a static series of isolated messages via email).  I also find that my best stories tend to emerge with individuals with whom I am able to cultivate a strong intellectual chemistry with\u2014and as a result, this has led to several long-term stories.  I would be absolutely thrilled to find other writers in this subreddit who are also looking for long-term stories.\n\n&gt;**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 \\[ideally over 21\\].**  \n   * This is not to suggest that my stories always involve adult themes.  In fact, many of my stories do not involve NSFW themes at all.  However, I feel exponentially more comfortable discussing literary ideas with fellow adults.  As a result, I set this as a strict limit, and I have a zero tolerance policy for those who lie about their age.  As a result, I will be firm for only this particular issue\u2014 \\*do not contact me unless you are 18 years of age.\n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.**  \n   * As I mentioned above, I\u2019m seeking a writer who is truly interested in forming a long-term collaborative writing partnership.  This means not only focusing on issues pertaining to our story at hand, but also to broader issues concerning our writing as a whole.  Ideally, it would be nice to connect with other working professionals who are looking to use writing as a creative outlet, of sorts.\n* **Mutual respect.**  \n   * As I\u2019m sure is the case with many of you, I simply cannot be in front of the computer 24/7 due to real life responsibilities and obligations.  Because of this, I hope to find a writer who is committed, yet flexible\u2014someone who is willing to maintain open communication while at the same time, respecting one another\u2019s autonomy.\n\nIf this post has captured your interest or imagination, then by all means, I would love to hear from you!  In your post, please tell me a bit about yourself, and your background in writing.  Hopefully we can get a conversation going, and weave our way into writing a story together.Thanks for your time; I hope to hear from you! ",

I would prefer if you had the same writing style, but I\u2019ll work with whatever! I write on Discord mainly but could write on Skype as well.\n\nI'm currently looking for a Game of Thrones or historical roleplay at the moment. So please have seen GoT, or have read the books and played the game!!\n\nI tend to include a lot of drama, angst and not so nice characters in my roleplay, just to add some spice to it and make it a lot more interesting! I do include smut, but there has to be plot as well.\nThough saying that I do think smut does add some extra elements to a roleplay, but I don't want it in absolutely every scene.\n\nI tend to get quite inspired when roleplay, so if we end up roleplaying together, expect a lot of drawings, playlists and Pinterest boards :) \n\nI'm sorry for rambling on so long, hopefully you've gotten a good enough idea about me and how I like to write! I would love to hear from you so please send me a PM if you're interested!\n\nValar Morghulis &lt;3\n",

            "selftext": "The zombie apocalypse started just over a year ago, thankfully a cure had been created and all of those who were eligible for it were rounded up by specialists to be cured. You just so happen to be one of those people. \nThough the zombies appear to be normal, underneath they were much more complex. They were able to think for themselves, speak and even recognize people they knew in life (Ask for more info). The specialists were trained to go undetected. They would close off one area of a city at a time to search and find those who were able to be cured, those who weren\u2019t were put down. Most of the infected were so torn apart or rotted away they couldn\u2019t be saved.\nThough, they don\u2019t rain you to see someone that you love. \n\nClara stalked the streets at both day and night, searching for something to quench her endless hunger for flesh of any kind, including human. She dragged her foot, her leg had been broken, with each step she took there was the click of bone. On top of that she was shot many times, but none of her wounds bled. \nIn the beginning you and Clara stuck close together. She was your wife after all, but somehow the two of you got separated and never saw each other again. \n\nAs you quarantined off the city your group came upon a large herd of infected, babbling and groans around as soon as they lay eyes on humans. Some of them crawled forward, for Let lacked feet, others staggered forward with as much energy as they could muster. At the front of that group of zombies was Clara, her eyes glossed over with the veil of death, she didn\u2019t seem to see you yet, but she could smell meat and needed it.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHey! \n\nI know this is weird idea, but I wasn\u2019t to try it out if anyone is willing. \n\nClara is dead, so you\u2019ll be doing most of the talking when she\u2019s cured (at the end of the rp).i hope you\u2019ll stay with me until then. Of course you do t have to be the character that I set up for you, you can be anyone else living, another survivor or something like that! \n\nSo if you could reply to the prompt above in the first message you send me that would be awesome! \n\nThank you so much for reading!",

I\u2019m 20, have a job and work overtime.... a lot. I tend to not have enough sleep, some days I won\u2019t reply. If I\u2019m no longer interested I will tell you. So please don\u2019t worry. \n\nWith that being said, I still want to be in and absolutely love this hobby. So HMU. \n\nWRITING : \nI only write Male characters, and M4M.... I cannot write female characters or play with them. Unfortunately experiences in the past have ruined it for me. \nThird person is my preferred writing style. Im not set on length nor do I expect you to deliver a specific length but tend to throw out 2-3 para. NSFW, is fine, I don\u2019t want it to be the center of the story though. Keep that in mind. \n\nGENRES : \nLet me just say, these are some I\u2019ve played and enjoy doing. I\u2019m open to mostly anything though, please don\u2019t hesitate, I\u2019m open to something new. \nI\u2019m looking for specific plots? Kinda. Message me and ask, don\u2019t feel obligated to stay. \n[OTHER THINGS I LIKE]\nSciFi \nFuturistic \nSupernatural\nRomance \nModern \n\nTHINGS IM NOT OKAY WITH:\n\u2022I\u2019m not interested in is, FANDOM RP. I can take ideas from shows/books/movies/ etc. I will NOT however play an already developed character. ONLY OC\nStill, there are a couple characters I will refuse to play with. \nEXAMPLE : Marry Sue\u2019s/Damsel\u2019s in distress, those who cannot hold their own. If you character cannot speak three sentences without sounding like they\u2019re having a seizure.... I\u2019m out.  \n\u2022No power/God mod, it makes the Roleplay boring if your character had the answer for everything. \n\nOOC : \nI love making friends. I\u2019m more then okay to chat about other things then roleplay. I believe it opens up a lot more to discuss, along with with introduces great ideas. All in all, well both be more comfortable talking about the roleplay as well. \n\nCONTACT  : \nI\u2019m currently only using the app, Discord. \nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far! Thanks so much for reading, I hope to hear from you. Truly hope I didn\u2019t scare too many people away. ",

            "selftext": " Superheroes have been a staple of society for as long as anyone can remember. Great heroes like Superman, Batman, or Wonder Woman have made their mark and opened a path for a new generation. They all started somewhere, most with humble means, and the Teen Titans offered a chance for the younger populace to follow in their footsteps.   The first generation of Titans, led by Robin, moved on and left the Titan Tower dormant for a handful of years. It wasn\u2019t until recently that a teen has stepped up and restarted the Titan initiative.   A neighborhood vigilante that had enough of a social media presence and following was contacted by Robin. Working with the city and getting the brief blessing from Robin, they earned the keys to the Titan Tower and began community-funded upgrades and renovations to a once abandoned building. Combined, it took a year before everything was ready. She then opened the doors for applications once more.  \n\nA fresh era of heroes, villains, and people struggling to maintain or change the status quo was about to emerge.  The world, ready or not, was about to be introduced to a new generation of Teen Titans.\n\n  \n**What will be your legacy?**\n\n\\------\n\nHey there, Titan! \n\nLooking for a group to join and be a superhero or super villain? This is the start of a new original character based group for the Teen Titans, the original series! Teen Titans Go will probably not be canon or referenced here. The story takes place after the first crew has moved on, leaving behind the torch to be passed on to a newer generation. \n\nThis group will be very focused on character development and creation, we want awesome OC's that have room to grow! There will be events, plot posts, etc, but will be mainly seeing what the new Teen Titan crew gets up to. If you're looking to play a villain, we have room for you too! We allow up to two characters in the group you can use at one time, so you could have a Titan and a Villain. \n\nThis group is for SERIOUS roleplayers only, those who have lots of experience or are willing to push the boundaries of their creativity to make something really cool. It's also needed to be literate and detailed, as we use THIRD-PERSON and use the 'literature' style of RP. There is an application process where the DM will go over your character and interview you, should you be rejected you will be given a few chances to make corrections. \n\nHope to see you there! We're looking to create a fun little community for memes and jammin RP's! The group is still finishing the set up but we figured we'd advertise to get people in who are interested! There is currently only one DM (me), and I will be sporadically busy until 5PM CST for work on weekdays, so if you aren't greeted when you first walk in- don't fret! I will give you a warm welcome when I come back. :)\n\nLink to Discord Server: [https://discord.gg/jBCQvyx](https://discord.gg/jBCQvyx)",

            "selftext": "Hi there. Seeking a partner for a long-term RP set during World War II. I have a vague idea for the characters but nothing set in stone yet. I do know, however, that I want it to be a tragic romance spanning the course of the war. I want to slowly develop our characters over time and explore how the war affects them and changes them forever. As to whether or not the ending will be tragic? Well, we'll just have to see how things play out. ;) I look forward to working out a story with you and am always open to suggestions.\n\nI don't have many requirements. You don't need to be an expert on the period, just a basic knowledge of it is good enough for me. Also, please be literate. My replies are generally short, but I try to avoid one-liners. I'm also incapable of writing a novel while RPing. :P just wanted to get that out of the way. I look forward to hearing from you. :)\n\nAlso: Though the overall tone of this RP will be quite dark, there will be lighter moments as well. I am a *huge* fan of fluff and sweetness!",

The character I'd like you to play is a part of the same world, but from much much earlier. He belongs to a book named The Silmarillion. It's alright if you don't know much about him. If by the end of this post you're interested, a wikipedia article will suffice to bring you up to speed.\n\nThis story is primarily a power struggle, but also a conflict between the two. She belongs to a tribe of elves he has a personal problem with (due to family reasons), but she is young and beautiful, and everything he desires in a future wife, a companion, and a friend. I want her wooed, I want her hurt, I want his passion unleashed on her with the force of a thousand horses, leaving her terrified and confused. I want him to desire her so profusely, and yet care for her so deeply, that it turns into an internal struggle not to bang her senseless even when he's inside her. \n\nI'll be happy to make a starter for us, if this sounds interesting.\n\nI will also ask for a writing sample and happily provide one of mine.\n\nComment or PM me, please.",

            "selftext": "\\### Realm of Angarak\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### What is Angarak?\n\n\\---\n\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### What makes it unique?\n\n\\---\n\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### What are the 'requirements'?\n\n\\---\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### Tl;Dr\n\n\\----\n\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj](https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj)",

Basically some other character will go missing (we can decide who when you message me) and Rachel plus whichever girl you want will want to try and solve the mystery of it all. \n\nI\u2019m open to any pairing with any of the female characters in the game, as long as we don\u2019t rush into it. Smut, murder, and all of the other dark tones that are present in the game will be present in the RP as well. I\u2019m also looking for detailed role players only, so if you can\u2019t write at least a paragraph per response then I\u2019m not interested sorry! Anyways if you read this far then please message me with a little bit about yourself plus your favorite moment from the game! ",

            "selftext": "Good afternoon, all. Thanks for the click. Hopefully, it'll be worth your time.\n\nObviously, I'm craving a good, strong Voyager RP. It was one of the first things I ever did RP for when I was a kid, and it's been the love of my life since I was seven years old (take my word for it - that's a long time; it hadn't even finished airing yet), and oh, I want to write for it again.\n\nI'm only interested in Voyager; I have no desire to explore any other Treks, even in crossover fashion. We can either set this during their time meandering around the Delta Quadrant, or we could explore the happenings directly after they get home - or we could even do something twenty or so years later. I'm completely down for anything, so long as I get to play with the world and characters of the show that's been one of my favorites since I was in second grade. \n\nI do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner, though, so let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am a professional proofreader. I'm nitpicky for a living, and it's ruined me for being a nice person. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I'm not into those blue NSFW things. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories don't have gratuitous \"mature\" content, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think.\n\n* Despite the above, I still prefer to write with other adults. I'm not comfortable with anyone under 18. There are lines, and I'm not interested in accidentally crossing any of them.\n\n* For anything set in the Delta Quadrant or directly following \"End Game,\" I will be playing Kathryn Janeway. I would very much like you to at least double as Chakotay for me (I do not support the C/7 pairing and will only accept J/C). In return, I can and will double as any canon of your choice. OCs are all right with me. Conversely, as mentioned above, I'm open to something about twenty years later - in that case, I'll be playing my own OC, J/C's spitfire, contrary rebel of a daughter.\n\n...I think that's enough word vomit.\n\nSo! If you're interested, I very much encourage you to PM me, so we can see if we mesh! Please note that I DO NOT respond to comment replies left here under any circumstances, so please use the PM function. \n\nThank you!\n\n~Kisa",

This isn\u2019t just the regular Pok\u00e9mon world though. It\u2019s a lot more gritty and dark. For example: There is prostitution, murders, cursing (gasp), drugs, alcohol, and it\u2019s just overall more like the real world. We can choose whatever region you\u2019d like and establish the overall aim of the story when you contact me.\n\nWhile a DM/GM plays every other character, if you\u2019d like to insert a female protagonist to go alongside mine on their journey, then I have no problems with that. Just make sure you\u2019re able to play every other character like normal.\n\nNow, I have a pretty high sex drive and I almost need sex to be in any RP I do to have fun, so I would like a healthy amount of it. Let me be clear that this is not going to be a big big part of the story, but just something that happens. I would prefer to not be bound to one woman, but if you decide to make a protagonist, I\u2019ll make an exception if you\u2019d like.\n\nIm looking for someone who has good knowledge of the Pok\u00e9mon universe, is fully literate, active and not afraid to put a lot of detail into their replies. If you\u2019re interested in this, please message me on Reddit so we can move to another platform.",

            "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m looking to do a romance roleplay between a psychotic murder and a sociopathic depressed girl. There are two plot lines, one is the romance between the two characters and the other being that they are both trying to get out of the country while the police comes after them.\n\nAlso a little smut would be nice.\n\nThe roleplay will start with a group of people having a campfire in the woods, the girl being one of them. She isn\u2019t good friends with the others, maybe one of them she is actually friends with but aside from that she\u2019s just there for the drink and drugs.\nOne by one, our murderer will pick them off, maybe even joining in on the get together and no one will bat an eye because of how out of it they are. He finally makes it down to the girl but hesitates, quite clearly not wanting to kill her, so he knocks her out and takes her back to his apartment.\n\n(I\u2019d like to point out, since the characters are the main part of this roleplay I\u2019d like you to have your ideas and agendas so don\u2019t always feel like you have to stick to the script, we can spend as much time as we want on each scene)\n \nThe scenes after the first I don\u2019t really want to plan out rather than have a rough framework that we can work with because as I said, it\u2019s very character based.\n\n2nd scene: Apartment: you\u2019ll awake in my bed alone and get up to find me in the living room.\nThe main idea of this scene is that we eventually sleep together, how we get to that conclusion is part of the fun.\n\n3rd scene: a normal day: Things haven\u2019t quite kicked off but during this day police will find the bodies from the night before, suspecting two killers. But this day is mainly for character building and building on the relationship between the two.\n\n4th scene: road trip: This is the longest scene and probably devolving into a series of smaller scenes such as going to a gas station, going to a truck stop, going to a motel, going into towns, going to restaurants. But while this scene plays out most characters have to remain weary of police and being recognised.\n\n5th scene: Finale: do we leave together? Do we part ways? Where do we go? What do we do?\n\n.....\n\nNow to go into more depth of what character I want you to play.\nSo as I skimmed over, this girl isn\u2019t perfect, she\u2019s mentally ill with depression and self harms through cutting herself and anorexia. She isn\u2019t a friendly person she\u2019s very cynical and won\u2019t let herself appear as weak. She\u2019s very self-aware and and pretty intelligent despite her appearance. She has short red hair, a soft yet defined face, brown eyes, a nose ring and tongue piercing, she is very tall for a girl being 5\u201910 and she has a slender figure but with the right curves.\n\nIf you have a slightly different appearance in mind, I\u2019m all ears but I\u2019d like to keep the character the same.

            "selftext": "Hello all!  I've posted this before and if our RP didn't work out or I forgot to PM you back, you can PM me again.\n\nHello all!\n\nI am looking for someone to play out a VERY specific dynamic with me. If you'd like to double up and do something that you are super passionate about, I'd be totally game--or maybe this has been the very thing you've been searching for and we are fated WHAT LUCK.\n\nOkay a few things about me:\n\n(*)I'm over 20\n(*)I live in America\n(*)I'm a professional writer (ask me about it after we get to know each other and you will never, ever, ever hear the end of it sorry in advance)\n(*)I'm on break right now and for the next two weeks I have quite a lot of time.\n(*)I love realistic romance above ALL ELSE.  I would like to play the female in one M/F relationship and am happy to do another male/female for you in return as long as we come up with something cool and engaging.\n(*)I write third person/paragraph style, though my preference is rapid fire posts where we only post as much as we need to.  Don't expect to get paragraphs and paragraphs of what the other person is thinking.\n(*)I am MORE than literate, but I write \"slow burn\" because I think good stories take time\n(*)My favorite settings are historical and sci-fi, but I'm open to literally anything.\n(*)I RP by email\n\nOkay, what I am searching for is the \"tough\" male (your character) and the girl who \"changes\" him (mine). I love the idea of characters who are incredibly idealistic--yours thinks that mine is his savior, mine thinks that she IS his savior. But of course, we all know that things are much more complicated than that. This relationship will NOT be healthy and will probably crash and burn in the most spectacular of ways (I can't wait). Ideally, I'll run this plot alongside something that complicates it--it won't just be two people who bumped into each other at the grocery store, but I'm not opposed to that idea either. I am SUPER ready to write out some complex, screwed up characters who possibly actually make each other's lives worse! I am seeking someone who wants to write this out as realistically as possible, but also with great beauty.\n\nI know that this next section will turn some of you away from me, but I want to be as open and upfront as I possibly can be.  Here is what I am not looking for:\n\n(*)Partners who completely disregard me, my character, and my story.  It's like I'm not there at all.  If you'd like to write a novel, I wish you the best of luck, but I want to write together\n(*)People who are mean and unpleasant or creepy and trying to hit on me.  We are RPING.  It is FICTION.  Dude you don't even know what I look like I could literally be Cthulhu think of all the tentacles you'd have to deal with\n(*)Unapologetic godmodders.  Everyone says that they don't godmod, and then people do.  Do not put words in my mouth\n(*)People who are unwilling to try anything without plotting it to death first.  Come ON where's your sense of adventure?  Let's find things out together!!\n(*)People who really aren't all that interested in romance and don't really have a passion for it\n\nAlso I have to tell you that if I don't think we are jiving, I will probably just be honest about it.  I will be nice and it's not that you're a bad writer, it's just that I don't want to use up our time with something I'm not that into.  It's a rare butterfly when two writers are equally invested in something, but darn it, I'm gonna chase that monarch to the ends of the earth\n\nPlease don't be intimidated by this.  I've been rping for a very long time (seventeen years) and have spent most of that time writing stuff I'm not all that interested interspersed with a few plots that made me laugh, cry, ache, and RUN to my computer every time my partner posted.  I want more of that--and I'm sure you do too.  So if you're interested, message me and let's see what we can figure out.  The best way to get my attention is by coming with an idea, a post sample, and a little about yourself.\n\nPlease message me if you are interested!",

I'm often available throughout the day, though weekends are usually pretty busy. If I don't reply for a day or two, don't worry. I will be back, I just need time to live in the real world, like anyone else.\n\nI'm looking for partners who are literate and seeking out longterm story building. Smut isn't required, but I don't really care if it happens. Just as long as it's mostly vanilla and tame.\n\nMy style is 3rd person, pretty mixed tense. My paragraph range depends on the situation, but I usually crank out at least one in the minimum. Usually, I try to match what's happening. Longer scenes call for bigger posts, fast action and snappy dialogue calls for a few sentences. Also, just because I'm a snob, my posts tend to be where I expect you to pick up where they left off, and not respond chronologically, like from the first thing that happened in my post to the last. My problem with that style is it kind of backtracks a lot? It just makes me feel like we're repeating ourselves over and over. I can give an example of this if asked.\n\n**My preferred methods are Discord and Email.**\n\nI have multiple prompts available for all of these ships and I am completely open to building something together! Italics for characters I prefer to play, origin of characters in \\[brackets\\], and types of prompts listed to the sides in (parenthesis). I'm completely open to playing either character, but everyone has their strong suits and those they're comfortable with.\n\n* Clark Kent/*Bruce Wayne* \\[Comics, animated shows, general\\] (Soulmate AUs, discovering each other's identities, slice of life, canon divergence)\n* *Spock*/Leonard McCoy \\[TOS\\] (Accidental bonding, pre-reform, time travel, alien Spock visiting Earth)\n* *Spock*/Jim Kirk \\[TOS\\] (Accidental bonding, pre-reform, post-TMP)\n* *Dr. Strange*/Tony Stark \\[MCU, general\\] (Soulmate AU, canon divergence)\n* *Bruce Banner/*Thor \\[MCU, comics, general\\] (Soulmate AU, Comics into MCU, Human!AU)\n* *Frank Castle/*Matt Murdock \\[Comics, general\\] (Soulmate AU, normal!AU, canon divergence)  \n",

There is no set plot as of right now, but the general timing will take place around the end of the third season. Because of this, there may be some manga spoilers. \n\nThe roleplay itself will be taking place on a discord server that has yet to be made, but will if there is enough attention. There is also an amino up and running for anyone interested in joining. More details about the roleplay and certain expectations are listed there. \n\nOverall, we\u2019re aiming for a small or large group roleplay depending on the interest receive with a solid mix of both canon and oc characters. Everyone is welcome to join, so long as they\u2019re willing to be active and join a discord server- as of right now, there\u2019s no limit for the amount of people who can join nor a certain literacy level. \n\nAlmost every canon character is currently available, bar hideyoshi nagachika and uta. There is also limitless space for oc characters. The roleplay itself will, most likely, have some mature content, so be aware of that. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested at all, don\u2019t hesitate to send me a pm or join the amino group http://aminoapps.com/invite/HRHJ3A1RAK\n\nThe amino link does expire after 3 days. If you wish to join and the invite is not working, let me know so I can update it. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Paradigm Shift- Northern Frontier is a text based science-fiction apocalyptic roleplay server that takes place in discord. We are currently a new rp server that has just opened and is looking for active roleplayers along with potential staff members once our server gets larger. We are still in development with a lot of things still requiring tweaking, fixes, and replacements however we do hope that you decide to give us a chance! At the moment we are a slightly dead server as most members are from the previous roleplay however we hope that with your help, we can get active again as this is a community driven server. Currently we have a unfinished website which provides additional information about the server that includes a more in-depth lore of the world and other neat things. We hope that you decide to try our server out and if possible, invite your friends!\n\nDisclaimer: The roleplay will include mature subjects which includes but not limited to: drug use, violence, death, and smut depending on what the character chooses to do. We ask that those who join are mature enough to handle these subjects.\n\nLink to the server: https://discord.gg/2ewh4mc",

            "selftext": "**Notes:**\n\n- I have a Naruto RP going right now and I'm very happy with it but I've been going back to the show and my craving has intensified. \n\n- Characters will be 18+ years old for obvious reasons, no one is gonna be underage.\n\n- I want canon x canon pairs.\n\n- I typically give 3-6 paragraphs and write in third person, past tense. I will not do first person nor will I write with someone else who does.\n\n- Posts come when I have time. Sometimes it means I can reply the same day you give me a post, other times it means I need a few days to reply. My partner needs to understand that writing is a hobby, not a chore.\n\n- Mature content is okay with me but only in moderation and with proper development leading to said content. \n\n- Lastly, I want us to have open communication, to both feel excited about our direction. We should respect one another and give the other room to make plot suggestions so we're both on the same page.\n\n**Pairs:** Below are pairs I'd be interested in developing. For the most part I'm interested in the rookies and their relationships with one another. My interest isn't really geared toward say the Akatsuki. I'd rather make our plot when we do the timeskip ahead. Also my knowledge of Naruto/Shippuden can be sporadic, just as a heads up. Roles in bold are ones I can play. They're also listed in order of interest.\n\n- Shikamaru x **Sakura** (I have plots)\n\n- **Naruto** x **Ino**\n\n- Shikamaru x **Hinata**\n\n- Kakashi x **Sakura**\n\n- **Naruto** x **Hinata**\n\n- Shino x **Hinata**\n\n- Gaara x **Sakura**\n\n- Kiba x **Ino**\n\n- **Sasuke** x **Hinata**\n\n- Lee x **Hinata**",

Maggie and her parents had been the sole survivors of a ship that had crashed on the island, leaving them stranded and alone. The family was forced to learn how to survive on the island, eating fish and fruit, and boiling water to cleanse it of bacteria. Maggie grew up watching and learning these techniques from her parents, until they were attacked by a black panther, leaving her to survive on her own at the age of 7. She had now grown into a young woman of 19, living and fighting in the wild all by herself, until an English ship landed on the shores of the island. \n\nMaggie was munching on a mango when the sounds of voices reached her ears. She froze, listening, then carefully, quietly made her way to the edge of the jungle. She looked over the edge of a cliff to where the sea met the shore. Her blue eyes widened as she saw a large ship anchored, and a handful of men already on the shore. \n\n\n- Y/c will be someone on board the English ship. \n\n- Maggie may recognize a little English, but not much. She may be taught more though. \n\n- We can both play as other people on board the ship. \n\n- I would prefer this roleplay to be mostly plot-based: more story, less, if any, smut. \n\n- Please be able to type in grammatically correct and complete sentences (including capitalization and punctuation) and write at least 4 lines per reply. \n\nIf you are interested in doing this roleplay, please message me. If you seem to fit what I'm looking for, then we can move elsewhere.",

            "selftext": "*Currently have RL going on for a few days but can still start a dialogue with interested people*\n\nHello all,\n\nFallout 76 looks bloody great doesn't it? I've played the games since the isometric days, invested months into the franchise over the years - I'm a massive fan of the ethos.\n\nI\u2019m seeking another detailed para/multi-para roleplayer for a Fallout themed roleplay. I have a character I\u2019ve tweaked for some time; a reclusive and shrouded ghoul sharpshooter. Born before the Great War in England (migrated to the US), Lee has spent the past two centuries honing skills in survival and other various skills through hunting game and reading books respectively. 200 years of modifying and maintaining the same .308 hunting rifle has also made him an impressive sharpshooter, able to shoot down animals with ease and avoid trouble early. \n\nLee is a hermit, who avoids contact with humans. His only real contact being with travelling caravans to trade meat and pelts for books and supplies.\n\nI have a few story ideas we can discuss but welcome to consider yours. Locations wise I'd say we stick to a more recent fallout game but I'm open to ideas.\n\nI have a google doc to detail and refine this character, including his  SPECIAL, Traits and Skills. I have been known to use Skype and Google Docs however I'm very keen to give Discord a try, as it appears to be the new platform and I'm easing my way into it\n\nBoardwalk Empire's Richard Harrow is an excellent example of Lee, the reclusive behaviour and the voice especially. If you watch the show you\u2019ll know but I can easily provide short clips to give you an idea.\n\nWhat I\u2019m not looking for:\nGary/Mary Sues, One-liners, Overtly sexual themes, Kik or someone with limited Fallout knowledge\n\nI\u2019m GMT based, attached and have a full time job. My aim is to write regularly as I can access discord via Phone and Laptop. Someone with similar circumstances (or understanding of) would be ideal. \n\nInterested?

I roleplay in third person and would prefer my partner does the same. I also use ocs( original characters) which is another reason why I don\u2019t use first POV. I\u2019m not a big fan of one liners, but short paragraphs are okay when it comes to having a hard time to reply. I tend to have at least one or two paragraphs, so I don\u2019t expect a whole essay. And as the title says I\u2019m okay with any gender character and partner, I mostly play female characters though.\n\nFeel free to message me!",

It could be fantasy based, modern, dystopian, since I don\u2019t really mind. I want to write as the female, but I don\u2019t mind writing one of the guys either!\n\nWhile I rather not focus on smut, it could be a part of the story.
