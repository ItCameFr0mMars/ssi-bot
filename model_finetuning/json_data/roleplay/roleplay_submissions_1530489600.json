            "selftext": "I'm looking for four to five new players for a heavily modified game of D&amp;D. If you've come for a stat and numbers based campaign, well then it's probably not for you. But if your here for a role-play heavy campaign that delves into character development...you might as well sign up now. The campaign system is bare bones based around character creation instead of mountains of stats but will have dice rolls. I'll walk you through it once we get to chatting. As for the campaign itself, it'll be a mix of all genres action,adventure, thriller,romance, horror... everything you'd expect. I'll be the DM having run several campaign in the past.\n\nIMPORTANT CAMPAIGN INFO:\n\n- It will solely be on discord with a dice bot.\n\n- TEXT only\n\n- It will be session based (I will discuss this with each player and pick a day for the campaign to start. I'm airing for once a week by will be happy to do twice a week if that works with everyone)\n\n- No need for character sheets. Once you give me all your info for you character, I'll then whip it up into a sheet and put it up on discord.\n\n\nIMPORTANT CHARACTER INFO:\n\n- As this is a story/character driven \u00a0D&amp;D campaign, I'd be looking for unique characters. I don't want four human male orphan slaves who are as bland as a bit of cardboard. \n\n- Character gender are not limited to players gender. It's role play after all.\n\n- LGBT characters are more than welcome as I've had been asked that in other campaigns.\n\n- I am allowing homebrewed races as it opens the door to different characters but I'm not allowing homebrewed Classes as then it starts getting into a cloudy area. If your interested in a homebrewed race, but don't know any. Don't worry, I can point you in the right direction.\n\n- Your character will be starting as a criminal in jail (this plays into the story). So maybe think of adding in a reason for his/her lock up.\n\nIf any of this interests you. Please feel free to PM me any time and I'll send more info for the campaign story. If you are PMing me, please could you tag on what time zone your in and what days work best. Maybe add in any ideas for a character you have in mind.\n\n(P.s. sorry if it takes me a bit to message you back. It takes time to get players sorted)\n\n",

            "selftext": "**General Theme and Feel of the Roleplay**\n\nFor the longest while, I\u2019ve been looking for a roleplay that will pull my heartstrings and let me experience two soulmates falling in love. I want the roleplay to be emotional and raw. People usually expect the roleplay to be a little sappy when I say it like that, but honestly, I want it to be about their personal journeys. I\u2019m not saying that it won\u2019t be a little sappy at times, but I also want it to be sad when our characters struggle, fail and make mistakes.  I want our characters to experience highs and lows because we\u2019re playing out lives of characters that are real to us. They don\u2019t always succeed in whatever they want to accomplish because they\u2019re only human.  I want to see how they walk through their lives together. I want to be able to experience moments in their life that allow us to cry, laugh, smile, cheer and truly feel for these characters on a personal level. I want this roleplay to be a character drama and a slice of life romance that truly grabs my heart and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\n**Plot &amp; Setting**\n\nI don\u2019t have a fixed plot or setting that I want to try since I\u2019d like to be able to discuss it with my partner. I do have a lot of ideas though, but it\u2019s really all up for discussion. I would highly prefer though if our story could take place in a modern setting, or something really similar to our world today. Of course, I would be willing to work in a different setting if the plot, setting and idea are all compelling.\n\nFeel free to message me in the PM\u2019s if you\u2019d like to discuss the plot with me.  We can decide where we want to carry the discussion whether it be on Reddit, Skype, Email, Discord, Google Hangouts, Kik, Forums or whatever.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThis is definitely something I think my partner and I should spend a lot of time on. I want to make sure our characters have great chemistry. They should have an interesting dynamic, and they should be able to build off each other. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll always get along. Fighting, arguing and going through hardships is what makes things fun. I want to have a good balance. I do want them to feel like real people after all.\n\n**Closing Notes**\n\nI believe half the fun is a good roleplaying partner. Being able to talk and enjoy each other\u2019s company is a great part of roleplaying. It\u2019s cooperative storytelling, and that\u2019s what I love about it. Plus, it helps build friendships, so I\u2019m definitely up to chat, discuss the roleplay and simply just spend time together as we fanboy/fangirl about our characters. I hope you don't mind being friends, but if you do, you can just make that clear.\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far and you\u2019re interested in roleplaying with me, please, send me a message! I\u2019m excited to go on this journey with you.\n",

So I\u2019ll start this off by saying I\u2019m not exclusively looking for a sexual \u201cbased\u201d role play. I\u2019ve seen heaps on that here and while we may explore the topic, I don\u2019t want it to be the only thing it\u2019s about; tends to make the story a tad bit repetitive. I don\u2019t have many rules, but I do have a few suggestions to make this an awesome long term role play!! \n\n\u2022I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could be detailed, and literate in your responses. The occasional writing error certainly isn\u2019t a problem, but please try to maintain a sense of structure! A little effort certainly goes a long way! I do not expect mountains of text in each reply, however one word responses get boring very quickly.\n\n\u2022I will so my best to respond as often as I can!! I go to the gym everyday, so that can take up most of the day. If I plan on being gone for long amounts of time I\u2019ll make sure to inform you!\n\nAs for the plots I\u2019m interested in, ill play almost anything! My favorites are:\n\nZombie apocalypse (I\u2019m clich\u00e9 like that :))\n\nRomance \n\nSlice of life\n\nI\u2019m really open to doing almost anything!! I\u2019d appreciate it if we could exchange ideas rather than one person coming up with everything! \n\nI typically use Kik, but I\u2019m not opposed to email, discord, etc! \n\n\nThanks in advanced!\nLooking forward to hearing from you!! \n\n",

I'm a fan of psychological dramas and dark romances, so this one is a favorite idea of mine.\n\n\\-A *Saw* type setting, with my character having a Jigsaw type role, and training a successor in the same vein as how Jigsaw trained Amanda Young.\n\nI'm well over 18, so I can RP smut, however you *have* to be 18+ or I'm not down with that. My ideas are still rough, so I'd love to hit it off with someone and develop them further, and hopefully have a fun time! Hit me up if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "Well, well, seems like I baited someone into clicking. ;)       \n\nAnyhow, as most of you posting here or only lurking, I'm looking for a roleplay partner. Not much requirements, but there are a few which I'll talk about in a bit. First off, have a little introduction(if you'd rather skip it, carry on to the next paragraph). I'm Adrian, 20, I spend most of my free time either chilling somewhere quiet or playing video games and I work the graveyard shift at a bar. Oh yes, I also study computer science(aka r e g r e t). Don't worry about offending me or whatever \u2013 I'm as easy-going as it gets, no need to walk on eggshells. Also, I'm chatty. Very chatty if I take a liking to someone, so if OOC gibberish isn't your thing then better begin with that or I might talk your ear off about random bullshit until you're annoyed enough to tell me to stop. Am I already giving info nobody cares to know? Yup. Enough of that, on we go.      \n\nNot much into fandoms; the only ones I can be persuaded into are League of Legends and Overwatch, and I'm only willing to play cannon characters. There are no genres I'd turn down \u2013 horror, fantasy, adventure, action, mystery, drama, romance, whatever comes to mind! I'm fine with most plots apart from ones entirely revolving around romance. Nothing wrong with it, I don't mind romance taking part, but when it's the only thing in focus it's a huge no thank you for me. Though throw a horror/fantasy storyline and I'll likely be all over it. If you have a plot you've been itching to do, I'm all ears. It's not an issue if you don't have one, I don't mind pitching a few ideas, even better if we can come up with something together.      \n \nWhen it comes to characters, I can play just about anything you ask of me. A man? No problem. A woman? No problem. A talking tree? No problem. If it's a sentient cloud you're looking for, then cool, I can play that sentient cloud. I might be flexible, but of course, I do have preferences and frankly clouds aren't a part of my favorites. A majority of my characters tend to be male, supernatural and relatively twisted. Based on the previous sentence, perhaps it won't come as a surprise that malevolent creatures are my favorite. Regardless, I'll gladly play whatever gender and role so that's that.        \n\nI'm far from a perfect writer, I won't nag about a few typos. Mistakes happen, that's entirely fine, I myself slip up fairly often. However, it's not fine to one-line and be completely illiterate \u2013 as obvious as this might be, I sadly felt the need to put it in after encountering enough roleplayers who offered two sentences at most and couldn't make a difference between your/you're, were/we're, etc. Apart from that, I expect you to be straightforward. Got ideas? Lay them out. Dislike the direction the roleplay is heading? Don't be quiet about it, tell me. My replies aren't giving you much to work with? Tell me. Anything that doesn't appeal to you? Once again, mention it. Communication is important, people can't read minds, if you aren't communicating with me then there's no way for me to know what's going on in your head. And last, don't simply ditch. Lost interest? Go ahead and say so. I have the courtesy to inform when I'm done with a roleplay for whatever reason, I expect the same from my partners.       \n\nSounds good? Hit me up. &lt;3",

I\u2019ll elaborate more on the plot (forgive me if it doesn\u2019t make sense). \n\nI\u2019m thinking of doing a romantic horror plot revolving around a werewolf who has over time lost their humanity to their lycanthropy, to the point that they struggle to act normal when in human society. This often causes people to view them as a freak or a brute, only pushing them further into isolation. Till they happen to met someone who doesn\u2019t treat them like a brutish oaf, who doesn\u2019t scoff at or judge their strange behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s not fully fleshed out, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nThis plot could possibly delve into some dark themes, so just be aware of that. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required(but welcome), but please be detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n- I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\n- Real Life Romance\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- Sci-Fi\n\n- Mecha\n\n- Halo\n\n- Elder Scrolls\n\n- Destiny\n\n- Superhero\n\n- Apocalypse\n\n\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon!

            "selftext": "*Hey there! Reading through my post history this evening got me itching to revive an old idea. I\u2019m afraid my RP profile is fairly outdated, but I\u2019ll try to provide a brief overview. I\u2019m an early twenties female seeking a 21+ male-character-playing partner who writes over email, Google Docs, discord, ~~or maybe even Kik.~~ I\u2019m mostly looking for the idea below, but may be interested in hearing whatever craving you\u2019ve got in mind right now!*\n\n*Please be capable of writing multiple paragraphs (and characters) when appropriate. I prefer to write in third person, past tense. My samples (in post history) are a bit older, but can give you an idea of my writing style and general length.* \nOn to the fun stuff! \n\nI'm wanting a story based on [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUMiEkMjtOQ). I've got a loose idea started, and would like to develop it with my partner.  \n  \nI'd like it to be set in a historical setting, but I'm not picky as far as what time. It can be vague, themed on the 'Wild West', but maybe a little more settled. Wooden houses and ladies staying home while their men go out and work. That sort of thing.  (*I\u2019m also very open to trying this out in a more pirate-themed setting! High seas, mayor\u2019s daughters, all of that sort of stuff. Don\u2019t be afraid to talk me into it!*)\n  \nI'm thinking that my character (MC) would be a young woman married to an older fellow. He's a good guy, despite his age, and they've got one or two kids together so far. Still, it was set up by the families and all, so it's not like she's head over heels for him. She's just trying to be a good wife.  \n  \nEnter your character (YC). YC is on the run, but it might not be public knowledge. Did he steal something? Did he kill someone? Who knows! This stranger rolls up in town though and is looking for work. He's capable, and MC's husband really could use the help in his older age. He's hired, despite MC's concerns about having some stranger around her children.   \n   \nWell, things end up good between YC and MC. I mean, really good. He's probably an attractive guy much closer to her age, and I can see their relationship growing closer over the course of time. They end up with a physical relationship before MC knows anything about why he's in their town, and that's where things start to get interesting!  \n  \nI'd love for this story to have a lot of drama in it. Does Old Man MC actually find out what's going on, or does he end up getting mysteriously strung up in the barn one night? Does YC end up returning the (inevitable) romantic feelings that MC has, or is he just a lady killer who takes what he can and then moves on?  \n  \nI feel like there's a lot of good open space between start and \"finish\", or at least where I've finished off the idea for now. Depending on the severity of the crime of YC, the story could go a million different ways.  \n  \nIf you've got interest in this, don't hesitate to shoot me a PM! I'd love to toss around ideas and see how we can customize this plot to suit ourselves. Thanks!",

I have a loose idea of what I\u2019d like to do with the RP, but you can come with your own ideas if you\u2019d like. PM me for my kik if you\u2019re interested. I can also use Hangouts, Discord, or Email. I can use PM, but it is honestly my least favorite way to role play. I don\u2019t expect anyone to write novels, but I would appreciate more than a few words. On occasion it is fine, but not consistently. I also ask that you have proper grammar. Typos happen, but I don\u2019t want blatant grammar mistakes. Can\u2019t wait to hear from you :) ",

            "selftext": "Hello fellow Roleplayers! As of right now I am currently seeking roleplayers willing to assist in the development and establishment of a Fallout Roleplay set in a different portion of the universe. Essentially, I just grew tired of the servers that I was roleplaying on, there was no real goal, no real systems in place, and very inactive or just unaware staff. So I thought to myself, why not just make a worthwhile server that actually functions similarly to the game. So, I've decided to actually put some work into making a server. I saw that a majority servers either had the whole world open or a certain area without any real lore. Along with this, none effectively used a rolling system, and I feel as though it is possibly the most quintessential part of any Fallout game or roleplay. And this is where you as a roleplayer step in, I\u2019m in need of aid from those in the community to make a really worthwhile server that even the most inept in Fallout lore can understand. There are three courses of action that you can take. The most important at the moment is assisting in the world-building process. We need to write lore to actually captivate a crowd, and the setting itself is not an area elaborated upon within the Fallout universe. Thus, we have chosen to flesh out and be creative with this new setting we have, yet still keep it in line with the canon lore. Second, moderation and server assistance, a job that entails what the title asks for, simply assisting in moderating the server, creating events for roleplay, and making the roleplayers adhere to the rules. Third, player recruitment, this job would be much more quintessential toward the latter portion of server development or after server launch. If you feel as though you can do any of these, feel free to contact myself over Reddit to attain my Discord information and to chat about the server as a whole. Below will be a little blurb about the world altogether, thank you for reading!\n\n**Fallout: The Forgotten Star**\n\nIt was only recently that interest arose in the lands known as Texas, a region known to be both beautiful and treacherous to the common wanderer. The area as a whole is commonly referred to as the Forgotten Star of the Wasteland, a place filled with Rangers, Ghouls and even the common Wastelander. A refuge as many would refer to it, scattered and disorganized towns, a place without any sole power in control. Yet powers seek to encroach and claim this territory as theirs, from the ever so knowledge hungry Brotherhood to the heinous and treacherous Legion. Texas is home to relics of the past, once home to the creators of the infamous vaults, Vault-Tec. To Rangers that in no way affiliate themselves with the NCR, rather they choose to rebel against their rule. An archaic motto that is still chanted in times of distress is simply \u2018Come and take it\u2019. Texas is a trove to outsiders, a land that could prove vital to nearly any power that can effectively organize and stay in the land. But most importantly, Texas is a home to many: vault dwellers, soldiers from the Brotherhood of Steel, ghouls, and much more.",

The genre has to be fantasy (he's a merman), but I could see it being either medieval or modern depending on what you are interested in. A strong female character is preferred. :D I have a couple of vague plot ideas, but there could be some world-building involved. \n\nA few things:\n\n\\- Please be 21+ as there will likely be romance (M/F only though).\n\n\\- Please be prepared to write a minimum of two or three paragraphs.\n\n\\- Please be willing to play multiple characters for the sake of moving the plot along.\n\n\\- Please understand that I will try to reply once a day, but may only be able to write something up two or three times a week.\n\n\\- Please be open to ooc chat.

I want to write with you for a long time, especially if I like you.\n\n- Discord. While not an absolute must for the sake of the rules, I vastly prefer it to any other medium.\n\n- Platonic relationships. Never thought I'd need to specify this, but I do want to also play non-romantic relationships, as well as romantic, between characters. Frodo and Sam, Hand and Chewie, that sort of thing.\n\n- Someone who doesn't care about post length. I don't ask for a lot, and while sometimes I go lengthy I prefer that you move the story along even if its short. Size doesn't matter, basically.\n\n- A partner who will communicate freely and can give and take criticism in a civil manner is another must, as I need to know when I am making a mistake or an error and I do like to point those out to my partners as well to help keep things on track.\n\nI love a lot of collaboration, so if you think you match these criteria then I would like to hear from you!\n\n",

I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n\n* Low Fantasy\n\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n\n* Sci-Fi\n\n* Horror\n\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n\n* Warcraft\n\n* DC Universe\n\n* Marvel Universe\n\n* Assassin's Creed\n\n* Borderlands\n\n* Dishonored\n\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n\n**To previous users who know me!**\n\nI currently lost all my discord chats and chat history, If we have an unfinished RP please message me and I can get back to you!",

We know in canon it has been stated that Wish Robin, never married Marian. And there was no mention of him being a father either. So we can assume perhaps he never happened either. But of course, if the writer of this version of Marian wishes to include Roland, by all means do so. (Though I'd check with Robin first).  \n\n\nBut, I am getting sidetracked. Forgive me. The basic premise here is that since the Wish Realm Marian never married Robin. I sort of conceived this head canon. That she -being a big fan of the BBC's version of Robin Hood (&amp; the Marian &amp; Guy pairing)- instead was drawn to Guy &amp; had an affair with &amp; fell for him, whilst supposedly being a spy for Robin, who she was in a relationship with at the time. Ultimately, she betrayed Robin &amp; his men &amp; chose Guy, as you can't help who your heart chooses.   \n\n\nWish Robin is a slightly darker version of himself. So therefore Wish Guy would be a more honorable &amp; redeemable version of himself. Almost a reverse of the tale. But sadly. At some point during some sort of fight to defend Nottingham, Wish Guy was killed. Cue devastation &amp; heartbreak...  \n\n\nBut of course. The story cannot end there. Finding her way to Storybrooke somehow, Marian will stumble across Original Guy. A very different man to the one she knew. But of course that side of him is still in there somewhere. If she can lure it out.  \n\n\nOther notes: This Marian would be much more based on other versions of the character. Particularly the BBC one. Where she would herself be nobility, &amp; taken in as the Sheriff's ward/trophy. But sneaking out to meet with Robin &amp; robbing the rich to feed the poor herself, particularly as Robin seems more interested in just the thievery than the people. It is during this time stuck at Nottingham castle, that she begins to grow close to Guy. \n\nPrince Caleb, of the Southern Isles- Requested by Hans.\n\n **FC-** **Kristofer Hivju.**   \n\n\nEldest brother of myself. And father's favourite. So therefore, first in line to inherit the throne of The Southern Isles. In short, loathes me with a passion. Basically, rude, crude, cruel &amp; a complete prick. But hides it well, when needed. Even from his wife.  \n\n\nWants the throne sooner, rather than later. Ensuring his own children's lineage to the throne, over the rest of his brothers. And to make my life a complete misery - even more now, that I appear to be **finally** winning round the Queen of Arendelle herself, &amp; getting very close with her.   \n\n\nSo come on. Come &amp; play. Come &amp; be mean to me. Abuse me, beat me, hurt me. Do your worst (well best). As dark &amp; twisted as you want. You know it'll be fun. Plenty of ideas in mind for us. And, for a story arc we are going to be running. You know you want to be a big bad.  \n \n\nLa Fou. - Requested by Gaston.\n\n**FC - Josh Gad.**\n\n Cursed Identity as we would be in Hyperion Heights. Is Louis. Surname I do not give a damn about. Things like that are not important to me. So feel free to make one up.   \nHe would be an accountant. Specifically MY accountant - a homage to this little reference from the wiki regarding his character.  \n\n\n\"Another version is a more nerdish character who acted as Gaston's accountant. It is also mentioned in this draft that he was initially very well educated, bright, and enterprising, but Gaston's bullying alongside his failed attempts at keeping Gaston's reckless extravagant and lavish spending in check left him really neurotic and high-strung.\"  \n\n\nMust adore me, in a completely unhealthy, unnatural way (Not difficult I know).  \nBe able to deal with my mood swings, and my intimidatingly spectacular personality and put downs.   \n\n\nMust, be up for a laugh, and not take things too seriously.

            "selftext": "Hey [r/roleplay](https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplay) I\u2019m looking for creative, inspired people to create with. I\u2019m a 30 year old woman living on the East coast with more than a decade\u2019s worth of experience playing and creating with others. I enjoy a variety of settings and types of roles however what I\u2019m looking for as of recently has a thread of romance regardless of genre. In romantic roles I tend to play primarily female and usually do M+F pairings although I\u2019ve been known to make exceptions. I don\u2019t care about your actual gender as long as your characters are believable. I don\u2019t like to censor myself so I prefer to only play with those 21 and over. Graphic sexual scenes aren\u2019t my primary focus and I prefer for them to be within the context of the wider story.\n\nIn terms of style I write in multi-paragraph posts via e-mail or hangouts but primarily Discord. If I\u2019m inspired it\u2019s not unheard of for me to write multiple page posts. I put a lot of detail and effort into my characters in the form of character sheets, outfits and even family trees when occasion calls for it. In terms of availability I\u2019m around most afternoons and early evenings for chat. Depending on the length of the post my response times can vary from several hours to a couple of days. I have an actual life that I enjoy so I don\u2019t spend every moment chained to my keyboard and expect any potential partners to have a similar outlook. Roleplaying is supposed to be fun not a chore so any snarky, badgering or harassing requests for a response will only lead to the ceasing of any writing.\n\nHere are some of the particular ideas that have been standing out for me recently.\n\nSlice of Life such as:\n\n**Historical Roles** (just about any time period but especially Renaissance, WW2, Reformation, Gilded Age, Edwardian Era. I also love alternate realities of existing historical eras)\n\n**Odd or Mismatched pairings** (this could and has taken many interesting forms from our characters being vastly different classes, Beauty &amp; The Beast style roles to one of our characters have supernatural abilities)\n\n**Mob or Criminal Enterprises** ( I\u2019m perfectly comfortable being the criminal within this roleplay if you prefer but I am happy either way. You can either be a rival, a forced ally, law enforcement or even an innocent guy\n\n***I am also extremely interested in GOT/ASOIAF themed roleplays.*** However just because it isn\u2019t listed doesn\u2019t mean I am not interested. I welcome all new ideas that you may have and want to share. I also have a handful of scenarios already written that I didn't post for length sake if you're interested.\n\n If anything I said strikes an interest feel free to message me with your discord name or your ideas. I wholeheartedly look forward to hearing from all you wonderful people. \n\nGood luck on your search.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! This is going to be V E R Y long, so I'll keep this part short. My name is Ari, I've been Roleplaying for a decade, and I'm 22 years old. The two plots here are usually romantic, but WILL NOT include smut. They will still be mature, however, as I prefer darker, grittier plots. If you're interested in either, please PM me with your choice and why you'd be interested! Thank you!\n\nPlot 1: 1950s New York; a young woman seeks the help of a private detective to find the man that changed her into the monster she is today (more details about plot can be discussed via PM)\n\nThe sound of honking horns and tires pulling water up from the asphalt and splashing it onto the sidewalk interrupted the pitter patter of rain against her apartment building now and then. Besides those small disturbances, Charlotte couldn't hear much else from her apartment on the third floor of the brick building. With a sigh, the slender woman pushed herself up from the bed on one arm and gazed out of the window. It was a sad, dreary day. Rain continued to drizzle from grey clouds hanging low in the sky. It didn't seem much brighter now at 8:30 AM than it was at 8:30 PM the previous night. It felt like she'd been living in the darkness this past week. The weather hadn't lifted nor changed from the last Wednesday. It seemed like the rain was never going to end.\n\nThe woman lifted the comforter off of her body, and her eyes instantly landed on the dark dried substance that covered almost her entire torso. She felt instantaneously nauseous. It didn't take a scientist to figure out what the iron smell accompanying the mess was. Avoiding looking into a mirror or too long at her filth covered clothing, she stripped and entered the shower. She didn't wait for the water to warm, so the shock of the cold spray stole her breath. She recoiled until it started to heat up, and then once again immersed herself.\n\nWhile she showered, she intentionally tried to keep her mind blank. She didn't quite remember all that had happened last night, and she wanted to keep it that way for her sanity's sake. Charlotte could never forget the first time she had...fed. It sent a shiver up her spine each time she allowed the thoughts to flood to the front of her mind. The guttural, gurgling last scream of her victim haunted her. Each time she closed her eyes, she could see the life draining out of his. Every time she caught the scent of blood, she could feel the hunger pains coiling in her stomach. She would lick her lips and narrow her eyes. Sounds would suddenly become much louder. She could hear things then that she couldn't usually. Even now, she could feel herself starting to let go of the tight rein she held on her control. On her humanity.\n\nGritting her teeth, she opened her eyes once again and started furiously scrubbing the blood off of her body until her pale skin was clean once more and rubbed raw. Her hand reached for the tap and turned it off. Once again, the deafening silence enveloped her. Here she couldn't hear the drizzle of the rain outside, but she could see the water rolling down her shoulders and hair and hear the drops splashing onto the bottom of the porcelain claw foot bathtub.\n\nShe took her time getting out of the bath. Covering herself in a silk robe that was left by her partner when he disappeared, she sauntered back into the bedroom. She got the sensation of disconnecting from the scene in front of her. It felt like an out of body experience as she watched the young woman start to clean the room. She couldn't smell the blood anymore, couldn't feel the sheets she grasped with her fingers, and couldn't hear anything but the rain against the window pane. The detachment of mind and body seemed to be the only thing that was keeping her sane anymore.\n\nNearly two hours and a whole bottle of bleach later, Charlotte seemed pleased with her work. A small smile pulled her lips upwards, but the movement didn't touch her eyes. She scrubbed herself in the sink once more, trying to cleanse her skin of the blood that no longer covered her. \"Out damned spot,\" she muttered the first words she'd spoken all day to herself and the noise seemed to startle her out of her trance. Again, the ghost of a smile touched her lips at the thought of she being Lady Macbeth.\n\nWith her bedroom spotless, she walked back from the bathroom and into the bedroom to get herself dressed for the day. Today, she wore a matching black skirt and jacket suit combination over a white blouse. Her short, dark red hair had dried and started to curl on its own accord. Before she could place the ever-present, dark-colored sun hat over her head, she took care in setting her curls correctly around her pale face. She rimmed her hazel hues with black eyeliner and brushed a couple of coats of mascara on her lashes. To complete her look for the day, she lined her lips with a red pencil, then filled the outline with a slightly lighter shade of red. Gently, she pulled the dark, wide-brimmed hat over her curls and tilted it to one side enough to mostly cover her eyes.\n\nOn her way out the door, the woman picked up a matching black clutch purse and made sure the slip of paper with the address was still within it. She verified that the other scrap of paper with her only clue was also inside. She slid her feet into a pair of short, strappy black heels and closed the door to 'her' apartment behind her.\n\nWaving down a taxi in this part of New York was relatively easy. Within moments, she was out of the weather and seated in the back of a yellow Dodge. She told the driver her destination and sat silently with her hands in her lap as she watched the world whiz by her window.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPlot 2: Sarah O'Reilly was your typical teenage girl. She just made the varsity hockey team with her best friend, got the guy of her dreams, and was on track to finish the term with straight A's. She was living the high life and nothing could go wrong. That was until the day that she missed her bus and had to walk to school. Deciding to take a shortcut through the woods behind her house revealed a gruesome scene...\n\nSarah was walking the trail that wound through the dense forest, anxiously looking around and trying to hurry up and get to school. She wore one of her favorite outfits under her game day jersey. A pair of her beaten old black converse, a plain pair of jeans and a long sleeved black t-shirt that matched their black and red school colors. Tonight they'd be playing Poland, their sworn rivals since the beginning of time it seemed. She smiled to herself; there was no doubt that they were going to win. She could feel it.\n\nHer daydream was disrupted by a shrill cry somewhere off the trail, in the densest part of the woods. She stopped dead in her tracks, adrenaline rushing through her veins as she thought about what the hell that could've been. It came again but cut off abruptly. She could hear the blood rushing in her ears, and she took a deep breath while scanning the trees. She couldn't see anything out of the ordinary where she stood, so she disappeared off the trail towards the sound of that shrill cry. She tried to tiptoe around the twigs and branches to refrain from alerting any animals or humans that might have been lurking around. She started to slow when she heard voices nearby and another muffled scream. She finally could see something moving, and she slowed her pace to hide behind a tree.\n\n\"Hey! Make sure she's tied down tight!\" She heard a man say. She tried focusing more intently on the one that spoke, he wasn't that far away, but it seemed as if there was a shimmering quality around him. It was almost as if she were looking through a wave of heat coming up from the ground. It made everything wavey and distorted. She could see that they were in a clearing and four men were circling a struggling body. When one of the men shifted, she could see that it was a woman...but there was something wrong with her. She looked human, except for the fact that big white wings sprouted from her back! Not only that, but they were stained red and twitched! She gasped and shrank back farther into the shadows, though she couldn't seem to take her eyes off of the scene. One of the men turned, and she squinted to see him better. The distortion surrounding the scene might have been altering her view, but she could've sworn she saw wings attached to his back, too. \n\nThe man's lip curled up in a silent snarl as he looked directly at the tree she was hiding behind. \"Oy, it seems as though we have another to be worried about.\" The others stopped what they were doing to look up giving the man confused looks. \"In the trees!\" He continued, \"Mortal in the trees! She has seen!\" He started walking calmly towards Sarah, and the creature that was being tied down spoke up, \"Run! Run little one! They'll--\" She was cut off by a sharp kick to the head, and Sarah cringed then turned running as fast as possible away from the scene, but she was no match for the black winged creature. It quickly caught up to her and wrapped it's arm around her waist. She let out a tiny scream before another hand came and covered her mouth. She kicked and fought with all her might, but it still wasn't enough. All it managed to do was aggravate the creature. He tightened his arm around her waist and growled in her ear, \"If you know what's good for you, you will no longer struggle.\" His nails dug into her skin, so she winced and stopped struggling. He made a satisfied grunt and continued walking her back to the clearing with the white winged creature.\n\n\"What are we going to do with her, sir?\" One of the others asked jerking her chin towards Sarah. The others continued working on the white winged creature, but they glanced up shooting confused looks at Sarah. She was dropped roughly onto the ground and kicked out of the way. She grunted in pain and held the side that he kicked. She closed her eyes for a moment and when she opened them again, the white creature was staring at her intently. It didn't have any emotion in its eyes, but the look was a warning. \"Get away young mortal. Or your fate will be the same as mine.\" She heard the voice clear as day in her head and it made her even more scared than the men that circled her. The creature faked a small smile, \"Don't be frightened, little one.\" Its smile disappeared as it was kicked roughly in the stomach. It didn't wince though, which Sarah thought was even weirder than the fact that it had wings. \"Heed my advice. Run, run as fast as you can.\" Another sharp kick and the creature seemed to have been knocked unconscious. Sarah whimpered and slid away from it, but she was quickly yanked to her feet by a different male this time. \"Don't even think about leaving us, sweetheart, we have a special surprise for you.\" It's sickeningly sweet breath tingled on the back of her neck, and she shivered.\n\nThen, just like that, the male that seemed to be the ringleader of the group cried out, \"Now!\" One of the other black winged creatures picked up a weapon of some sort, a sword, and plunged it deep into the other woman's heart. Her body jerked from the impact; her eyes flew open briefly before closing again. Her wings twitched before her body lay completely still. A silvery substance flowed out from under her and stained the grass and dead leaves scattered on the forest floor. Little flowers bloomed where the silver interacted with the dirt. Sarah's knees buckled, and the man behind her had to hold her up. Tears fell down her cheeks and dropped onto the silver liquid she assumed was the creature's blood. Then, three of the four other creatures turned to her and smiled evilly, \"Ahh, my favorite pastime, killing mortals.\" The ringleader purred. The one that wasn't advancing on her was kneeling next to the body and spooning some of the blood into a tiny jar. Her stomach flipped with disgust, and she looked away, but the ringleader grasped her chin and forced her gaze to his. Fathomless, black, cold, desolate eyes that burned with a twisted desire in them. She cringed away from his touch, but she couldn't go anywhere. She was trapped, trapped like that poor creature had been. And she was going to die here, in the middle of a clearing, at the hands of these creatures.\n\nJust as she was accepting her fate, there was a strange flapping sound, and the creature that had been holding her upright suddenly disappeared. There wasn't a chance for her to wonder what was going on, as she was quickly lifted up again and forced to start running. \"C'mon you stupid girl move!\" A harsh voice called in her ear with urgency. She started running as fast as she could, but the owner of the mysterious voice was annoyed with how slow she was going, so he picked her up and started carrying her. She looked behind him towards the scene that was unfolding in the clearing. Blurs of colors were all she could see: black, white, green, and blue clashing and bleeding into one another. The objects were moving too fast for her eyes to comprehend.\n\nShe finally looked back at the person who was carrying her. An unbelievably attractive male, he couldn't have been much older than her, a year or so maybe? His face was set in determination, his eyes straight ahead. She finally found her voice, \"Who are you?\" She asked, brows furrowing. The boy looked down at her briefly, and she could see piercing blue eyes that stole her breath from her lungs. \"My name is Ariel.\" He looked back ahead of them and could see a clearing up ahead, though he didn't smile, she could tell he was relieved about that. Upon entering the clearing, he pushed off from the ground and big, blindingly white wings sprouted from his back. She gasped, and Ariel smirked down at her. \"Surprised, young Sarah?\"",

I'd like to play an OC and for you to play a character or multiple characters from the main story so like Naruto, Sai, Kakashi, Jugo, or even Pain (any others are also available these just popped in my head first). (I really like the idea of pain lol) I'd like some romance but their certainly doesn't have to be any. I'm doing this for more of the story, the thrill of being a ninja. So hit me up and we can hashout some ideas like where my character can me coming from or whether or not I'm on the same side as your character or not.  I prefer 3rd person and detailed accounts of what's going on please be descriptive I tend to put a lot of thoughts into my posts and you also get what you give so if you start putting out one-liners and it dulls the story I will either respond with one-liners or give up. I have both discord and kik so anyway... I hope to hear from you soon!",

Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment but I can't help but to keep trying to find a small group for a One Piece RP.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is just a few people, maybe like four or five, to make up the crew of a pirate ship (maybe we'll get a bigger crew as time goes on but I figure we should start small). We'll be a relatively new crew, so our characters have a chance to grow, in strength, power, personality, and reputation.\n\nStoryline wise, I'm hoping everyone can contribute and come up with their own arcs for everyone to play through. That means people coming up with NPCs, willing to play them, and contributing to the over all progression (though I can cover the first few and quite a few people).\n\nPlease be a multipara poster, no one liners. No OP ridiculous characters. Be able to come up with a three dimensional characters, who have personality, history, drive, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI could go on and on about what I want and what I don't want but I don't think anyone wants to read that and I'm trying to be more flexible. The RP will be on Discord. Please send me your character idea and a sample post as well as your Discord ID if you're interested. Any questions, please feel free to ask.",

They spoke in a series of hand gestures, body language, and facial expression. Their lives were ruled by constants, any minor change spelled catastrophe for many of them.\n\nChildren of the Earth Mother went by many tribes.

            "selftext": "Setting-Dark Age England\nIn the year of our Lord 410 Anno Domini legend states that the mercenary brothers Hengist and Horssa, under orders of their employer the King of Cwent, went into battle to fulfill their contract. In the battle one of the brothers died, and the King refused to grant the remaining brother pay, so he and his men simply revolted and took over the kingdom, renaming it Cantawara. This began a great migration from the regions of Jutland, Frisia, and Saschen in the region of Germania, fertile lands for the tribes of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes was up for the taking in Britain as the petty Brythonic kings squabbled and fought wars for control, they soon found barbaric raiders at their doorsteps. While at first the kings on the eastern coast of Britain were easy pickings for the rugged germanic tribes, the interior was a harder nut to crack. It has taken the Germans sixty six years to conquer the eastern coastline, from Canterbury to Hadrian\u2019s wall and farther north into Lothian monarchs reign over a myriad of kingdoms much like the Britons still do. \n\nIt is now the year 476 Anno Domini, the Western Roman Empire has truly fallen to Odoacer, in the eastern half of the empire a civil war is being fought between the Emperor and Zenon the deposed. Gaul has been taken by germanic tribes like the visigoths and burgundi, and Britain is still fighting for its survival against the invaders. However in one region, war has not only ceased but negotiations have been opened up with the Angle tribe in control of the eastern coast. This harmony has been found between the Queen of Northumbria, a conquering angle queen who sailed across the sea not even 20 years ago to stake her claim to the land north of the Humber river in hopes of finding success for her tribe. With her capitol based out of the city of Deire (York to some) to the west is the Brythonic region of The Pennys or Lancaster where the king of those lands has come to a peaceful settlement with the Queen of Northumbria. She will marry his son, a prince, and all children produced will be a union of the two dynasties. In return upon the death of the king his son would inherit the throne of The Pennys and would then formally unite the two realms into Northumbria, and in that kingdom the Britons will be treated as equals.\n\nOf course, there is one person who has not been asked about any of this, the prince who while he is more than happy to go along with the marriage plan, but is a bit shaken by the idea. Little does he know that he is in for more than simply some barbaric strong-woman with more interest in conquest and ale than in the softer things of life.\n\nNotes\nI know that was overly long and probably very boring, but if you made it this far thank you. Now, onto the other things. I want this to be a cute and romantic kind of rp. As a baseline SFW, though you can have some discretion on that. Both characters in this are basically the inverse of each other, one is a battle hardened barbarian, the other is a young and noble poet prince. That sounds sweet and fun to me but I am open to plenty of other character ideas and switching it about.\nIf anything about that sounded interesting, message me with questions and/or discord info and I will add you on there. Discord is my preferred method of rp.",

Lightning lit up the skies, bright as daylight for only a moment before the loud crash of thunder shook the forest. A young woman lay lifeless on the forest floor her dress drenched in rain.~ \n\nPreviously- Savage stared off into the distance as she sat at her desk. Things were strangely boring and slow on this Friday afternoon. She sighed and rubbed her eyes before getting back to work. Her fingers clacking on the mechanical keyboard as she put together yet another marketing file for her boss. She'd already finished three before this and was finally on her last one. A man in an expensive looking grey suit walked up as she was typing out the last sentence. \"Savage, when you get done with that last file you can go ahead and go. It is the weekend and you've been working really hard after all.\" She lifted her head and looked over at her boss, David. She smiled up at him. \"I actually just finished the last file!\" She started the process of shutting down her computer when he spoke again. \"Do you have any plans for this weekend?\" She pushed away from her desk as the computer turned off and stood up, stretching a bit. \"I plan on going to the park for a bit, but other than that I really dont have any plans. Just relaxing at home.\" They walked together to the elevator. \"Would you like to meet up for drinks later this evening?\" He always asked the same thing every Friday. There was a small group of colleagues that usually met up at a small club near work. She thought for a minute that. \"I think I will join in since it's been a few weeks.\" He smiled at her as she stepped onto the elevator. \"Great, I'll see you tonight then.\" She nodded before the door closed and rode to the bottom floor in silence. \n\nLater that evening she opted for a little colorful sleeveless dress. Nothing very sexy, just comfortable. She decided to walk to the club and on the way pulled her long black hair up into a loose, messy bun. As she went into the club it started to rain outside. Her eyes flicked to the window and she hoped it would stop before she had to go home. Her bright green eyes searched the small crowd for her co-workers. She spotted them at a small booth to the back but it looked like everyone but David was leaving. \"Hey guys, y'all aren't staying?\" She asked as Lisa and Matt walked her way. \"I've finally convinced this vixen to give me a chance and let me take her to dinner.\" Matt said with a sly grin on his face. Lisa rolled her eyes and crossed her arms across her chest. \"As if... I'm just hungry.\" Savage shook her head and smiled. \"Well enjoy your dinner.\" She waved as the left then slid into the booth across from David. \"So they might hook up, huh?\" David asked as she sat down. She shrugged. \"They've been flirting back and forth for a while, tension so thick you could cut it. So I'd assume, yes.\" She laughed as David pushed a drink across the table for her. \"I hope you don't mind me ordering for you.\" She shook her head and lifted the drink to her lips, taking a long sip before setting down the cool liquid. \"Mmm, not at all. That's delicious!\" They chatted about work and home life before deciding to part and go home. \"See you Monday, David. I had a great time tonight.\" He waved and nodded. \"Same, see ya.\" It was still raining but she decided to walk home anyway. The cold water seeped through her dress and her hair slowly came undone from the bun, her hair tie lost. It started to rain harder so she stepped into a little antique shop. Surprised to see it was still open she started looking around at all the strange antiques. A little old woman came around a corner carrying a small wooden box. \"Oh hello, I just came in out of the rain, I hope that's ok.\" Savage said as she smile at the old woman. \"Its fine dear, destiny lead you here.\" Savage's eyebrows rose in confusion. \"Huh?\" The woman smiled and pressed the box into Savage's hands before muttering something in a language she had never heard before. Lightning split the sky with a crack of thunder that shook the store before everything went black. \n\nI have discord and kik. I am really enjoying this idea and would love to have more experiences with different worlds and such. I'd like there to be magic and dragons, ogres, orcs, fairies, werewolves, vampires, demons, any kind of fantasy world you'd like to help create. I'd prefer if my partner were either only half human or not human at all. I like a little romance so if a relationship develops that's awesome! If you are interested hit me up with a description of your character and maybe a bit on how you'd like the story to go. I look forward to hearing from you.",

Since the age of fifteen you have been solely responsibly for not only keeping her head on her shoulders, but also keeping her out of trouble- the truly difficult part of this posting. She is loved by her people; renowned for being kind, considerate, and generous. But it is this same good nature that causes you to often find yourself on ventures past the castle walls. Her curiosity is her biggest flaw. \n\nBut you love her none the less for it. Of course your first years together were difficult, she was troublesome and she was your responsibility. One step in the wrong direction could lead to her death and your head. She was stubborn, but so were you. As she\u2019s grown, she\u2019s become significantly less foolish. She spends more time studying then she does trying to sneak out of the palace. Her duties as princess keep her occupied, and you stand beside her faithfully no matter the task. Years spent beside her have softened your heart; for her alone. She is everything to you; the only thing that matters. Her smile is what keeps your heart beating. Her laugh is what gives you joy. But it is impossible for you to tell her that. \n\nIt is forbidden for you to love her. You were only supposed to be a sword; a ruthless and cold guard meant to keep her safe. But how could you not fall in love when she sees you as so much more? She\u2019s shown you kindness. She\u2019s given you much more then any other royal guard could hope for. She treats you as a person. As a friend. And at times you swear you see her look at you as if you are the only thing that matters in her world. \n\nYou love her. \n\nBut it is forbidden. \n\u2014\nHello there!

You are with her at almost all times, save during the night when she has retired to her quarters. \n\nI\u2019d like this prompt to pick up during a festival in the kingdom, where through I series of events, the princess is kidnapped and poisoned. YC must save her, and this gives us plenty of dramatic time for him to argue with himself and his feelings. When he inevitably saves her, he must decide if it is right to tell her his feelings, or if he should remain silent. ",

            "selftext": "Hello, all! After taking a long hiatus from RPing, I'm back and find myself eager to write. I also find myself with a lot of extra time on my hands - I decided to break my ankle playing baseball a couple weeks ago, so without baseball and being out of work (I work for a landscaping company - aren't you excited to know my whole life story?) for a few weeks, I've got a lot of free time on my hands.   \n\n\nWith all that being said, I'm definitely looking for a couple solid writing partners to develop some great stories with. My writing style tends to lean toward 'advanced,' even though I feel pretentious saying that. High-casual works for me if that's the level you're at, but I love detail and depth.   \n\n\nI also really love working things out with my partner OOC. I like to think I'm a nice guy, so don't be afraid to reach out with your own ideas or suggestions if we start working together. We'll make it happen.   \n\n\nI try to keep things pretty straightforward, but I do have a few rules I should probably make known:   \n\n\n\\- Please be at least 18 if you want to write together. Some of the RPs I do have adult themes, and even if you're cool with it and super mature (good for you), it makes me uncomfortable.   \n\n\n\\- That being said, please be comfortable with certain adult themes if you're interested in working together. I can cater to different needs. If you're not comfortable with more sensual scenes, we can fade to black. If you don't like cursing, gore, violence, etc., let me know. As for me? I don't have any limits. You'll see that most of my pairings are based in reality. Reality isn't always pretty and certainly doesn't fade to black, so neither do I.   \n\n\n\\- I might risk losing my man card in saying this, but I'm a sucker for a good dramatic romance. I like tension and discord, but two characters that can become passionate about each other and really click can make a great story. That being said, I'm not looking for a love at first sight story.   \n\n\n\\- I know I said it earlier, but I consider myself to be somewhat of an advanced writer. I ask that my partners are at least high-casual. I don't care if there's the occasional misspelled word, and I could give a crap about the Oxford comma. I guess my interest is in length. I'd prefer it if you're able to write at least 4-5 paragraphs per post. I realize in times of heavy-dialogue, this can be different.   \n\n\n\\- I would prefer to RP email or Google Docs, but I'm open to other avenues. \n\nI do have a few ideas in mind, instead of just listing 'pairings,' but if you've been itching to work out a plot of your own, I'd love to hear that too. Thanks - looking forward to hearing from you! ",

You will start in a generic D&amp;D esq world only to find yourself in an alternate dimension where animals and monsters are replaced by pokemon. They are not the lovable creatures you know. In most cases, they will be trying to kill you. I wont give away the whole plot, but you will be traveling around a medieval  kanto region. If your interested at all, send me a message with a bit about your self and i will send you the discord link. We don't have a day picked out yet but keep in mind it will use voice chat. Thank you.

In this server you and your friends will assemble a pirate crew and journey out to fulfill your dreams. You are more than welcome to join the Revolutionary Army or the Marines if you would like. Most characters will start off at the lowest rank but work their way up through role playing. The roleplaying server will have many antagonist and npc\u2019s, you and your friends are welcome to either battle them or to create an alliance.(so yes you can alliance with Yonko and other pirates. Not warlords though, as it is their job to kill pirates.) The possibilities are endless within this story, so set out on your own adventure and have fun. (be sure to read #rules) This server started at the same time that Straw Hat Luffy started his journey  \n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/4YatrHj",

I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-400+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene don't have alot going on and therefore require less. However, I must stress the need for a good grasp of grammar, punctuation, etc. I like having long, thoughtful replies back where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and writing as I am.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance, using face claims, and am looking for characters in thier 30s-40s and older. I'm a sucker for the gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. The broken ones who are rough around the edges and aren't afraid to throw a punch. But are tender enough provide a hug if needed.\n\nI\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'd be delighted if you were the same. Last but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along.\n\nI love all types of genres, but especially real life, fantasy, and science fiction. I also like to use fandom worlds and drop in original characters. All my characters will be adults and I require my partners do the same. \n\nFor plot ideas/fandom list, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and possibly writing. Look forward to hearing from you! ",

            "selftext": "Hey  everyone. I've posted this before but I think I have room for another partner, maybe two or so. I figured I'd go ahead and throw this post out there again in case any are interested.\n\nTo introduce myself, I'm a 24yo uni student who is looking  for someone to RP in the Marvel universe. I feel like the movies and RPs  have largely focused on the current Avengers lineup, so if at all  possible I would love for this to have elements of the New Avengers  (Hulkling, Wiccan, etc.) Be whoever you want! I would certainly not say no if someone wanted to do Teddy, Billy, or someone else but if you want to do your own OC that's totally fine by me. I will be using an OC character so please keep that in mind if you're interested so far.\n\nI prefer flexibility with these different universes, and I  really would prefer it if my partner wasn't too much of a stickler on  \"Marvel fandom rules\". Obviously I don't plan on having Harley Quinn  come running into the picture, but as to other fantasy characters like  werewolves, vampires, demons, etc., why not? Hell with all the  characters out there surely it wouldn't be too out of the ordinary.  Romantic and/or NSFW elements are certainly welcome, but it would be M/M  pairings (that being said, if we're getting into NSFW stuff I would  like there to be some kind of romance behind it). For that kind of thing  I absolutely require my partner to be 18+.\n\nSo,  on to the format, structure, etc. I try my best to be as detailed as possible; when I RP I really enjoy forming a mental image of  the scene, and so I would prefer you be detailed as well. Though I'm  flexible when it comes to length, we will have a bad time if all I see  is \"Character X says \"Ha\" and sits down on a couch\". Obviously there will be time where our characters will mostly be engaging in dialogue,  so again I'm not trying to sound like I have a stick up my bum. All in all, let's try to have a happy balance.\n\nI  definitely prefer to RP over Discord or Skype. This gives us a happy  back-and-forth dynamic which I LOVE. I typically respond quickly, but I  also understand that life happens. I'm not going to harass you for a response if two days pass by and there's nothing, but if you'll be gone for more than a week or some serious stuff is going down, I'd definitely  appreciate some communication. In my opinion it's just a decent thing to do. That being said, if we are RPing and you don't feel it's a good match after a few posts, please let me know. We're adults in this, I promise I'm not going to attack you if my writing style isn't your cup of tea.\n\nFinally to the last bit (I promise), even though this is RP I would love to develop some kind of friendship alongside it. The best kind of RP is when you can go OOC and have a laugh about what your characters are doing, and that kind of dynamic would be greatly appreciated. So if you are at all interested in what I'm offering or even a hint of this post  caught your eye, feel free to send me a message! Let's see what kind of fun story we can strike up. Thanks for reading and take care.",

            "selftext": "*Gotta get back, back to the past -* You know who I'm talking about.\n\nHello! To be honest, I've been pretty dead when it comes to roleplay because of some personal stuff going on in my life right now, and I took myself a hiatus for a few to digest what's going on, but there's this craving that has been itching me for a good time - so I'm going to make an exception for myself, just in case someone might be interested in this.This is gonna be a shot in the dark since I don't think too many people in the forum (or the roleplay world) are interested in this fandom? But I really want to do a **Samurai Jack** roleplay.\n\nYes, I am in fact talking about of the childhood cartoon (at least for so many of us) that made an epic comeback last year. I re-watched the show, I watched Season 5, and oops, I re-found my old crush on the samurai - what now? I'm really craving to **ship Jack with my OC** for this fandom. So if you're willing to indulge a fan, please, keep on reading.\n\nThe rules from this roleplay request are 100&amp;#37; copy-pasted from another roleplay request of mine in another site (slightly edited - deleted a few because they felt a bit off in this roleplay request), sorry, but in case you don't know who I am, let me introduce myself very briefly: I go by Xii on the internet, and I am a 21-year-old roleplayer from Chile, located in wonderful South America! I have 8-9 years of experience roleplaying, and when I'm not roleplaying, I am studying to enter medical school. I'm also very into Lolita fashion, and I'm studying Japanese on my free time, as well!\n\nAlright, having this part tackled, let's go to the rules.\n\n* **Grammar and Spelling:** I understand that oftenly we can make some \u2018typos\u2019, or that in various cases, English is not a main language for some, and it can be a huge struggle to us sometimes. Don't worry, I won't make a fuzz over a mistake you may have not seen, but all I ask is at least to apply basic spelling and grammar rules in the roleplay, like capitalization or punctuation. I'll assume that if you're a native speaker, you know how to type and write properly. Now, as not a native speaker myself, I request from you that you have a bit of patience with me when it comes for spelling, grammar and ortography things. I promise I write the best I can from my knowledge in the language, and I also proof-read and spell-check all my writings before sending them, but still, gramatic horrors (yes, I said that right) might happen from once in a while. Be warned!As in for other things; Text talk? NO, thank you. I won't take you seriously if you roleplay (Or generally type) in text speech or shorten any words. I also won't roleplay with people that \u03b1\u03c1\u03c1\u2113\u0447 \u03c9\u03b1\u0447 \u0442\u03c3\u03c3 \u043c\u03c5c\u043d s\u0447\u043c\u0432\u03c3\u2113s when writing. It looks pretty, I agree, but it\u2019s not the proper way of writing when it\u2019s meant to roleplay.\n* **Format:** I am a **Literate, Multi-para/Para** roleplayer who writes in **third-person, past tense.** That being said, I'm also looking ONLY for Literate roleplayers that are capable to roleplay in Paragraph form. I'm not really picky about length, I can easily adapt myself to whatever my partner is comfortable writing - but please, NO one-liners. My roleplays tend to be long of length (3+ long paragraphs average, but also able to get to novella length and format), I just love to write a lot! But if you don't, I won't pressure you. Don't worry!\n* **Doubling:** I wanna make it clear that **I DOUBLE TO MY PARTNER\u2019S REQUEST** \\- This means that I'll be happy to roleplay any character you'd like for any OC you may have. Although this is not mandatory, this is something I very much like to do because, come on; it\u2019s only fair to return the favor to someone that has agreed to play one of my favorite characters. Now, if you don't have a love interest within this fandom (because let's be honest, there aren't too much recurrent characters on it) but you still want to receive your part of the deal, I'll be happy to return the action by roleplaying as any character from any fandom that I have knowledge of. Just pipe up.If you just want to be a generous soul and roleplay as Jack for me without expecting anything in return, you can do that too. Bless your soul.\n* **Avoid going OOC:** Each person haves their own perceptions and headcanons of the character, and that's really appreciated! After all, that's what makes the character fun, but please, do your best on keeping the characters you're playing in-character. I know it can be difficult some times, but please show some effort in this part, don't forget the main points of their personalities and their stories when you're going to play them. If you\u2019re not familiarized with a certain character, my advice is that you do a proper research of it before roleplaying it. I\u2019m also willing to give any advice to you if you need it. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask me for any tips! I will be more than glad to help out!\n* **Adult themes and Limits:** To comply with the rules of this subreddit, these will be discussed through PM's upon discussion of the roleplay's plot and other stuff. That being said, **I WON'T DO ADULT-THEMED ROLEPLAYS OR ROLEPLAY SMUT WITH PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 18**. Underage partners are more than welcome, but if that's the case, I'm not doing any R-rated content with you, and our roleplay will have to be 100&amp;#37; clean. This is for my and your safety. I hope you understand.\n* **Again, where do you roleplay?:** I fear I'm only available to roleplay through Discord for now. If you're I have no problem in doing OOC talk through Discord and doing the roleplay on a place like Google Docs, but if none of these are your preferred ways to roleplay, I'm very sorry.For any reasons want to stop roleplaying? Don't be afraid to tell me. It will hurt a little to see you part away, but I won't be angry with you, or ask you for any explaining if you don't want to. I will completely understand. I swear.\n* **I have a life, too:** Please, be aware that I\u2019m not a person that instantly replies, or that is in the computer 24/7. Just like you (I assume), I have a life outside the internet: I study, I go out with my friends and family, and as well, I can get lazy, and I procrastinate a lot too ~~(Like, a real lot. Seriously)~~. And right now I have even less free time in my hands because I'm currently studying to take exams to enter college.So, all I request you to do is: ***Be patient***. I will immediately cut off with you if you start bugging me by spamming the chat or ask me about our RP every 15 minutes. If you haven\u2019t received something for me in a period of 7 days (a week) or more, feel free to ask me how things are going. But please, be aware that I will answer ASAP. I will notify you regularly about my current status on the writing process, and tell you when I'll be (or not) available to roleplay, so you can have an idea about how much time do I have in my hands at the moment. If I have to take a hiatus from roleplaying, whether it is short or long, I'll let you know of it.\n* **Have fun!:** The most important rule (although not exactly one) of them all: Have fun! After all, that's why we are roleplaying, right? Also, I would like to mention: I really, really, really like to talk and communicate with my roleplay partners while we are roleplaying. So don't be shy if you want to start a conversation! It will actually make me feel really happy. One of the reasons why I roleplay is because I love meeting new people and making new friends! \u2665\n\n\\---------------------\n\nI know the chance to get someone who might be interested in doing this with me is very slim, but if you happen to be that person, please don't hesitate to contact me by sending me a message or leaving a comment here!\n\nThanks for stopping by and reading! Even if you're not interested in this roleplay request in particular I really appreciate it from your part c:\n\nSee ya'! \u2665\n\n\\- Xii",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I'm looking for a partner for a roleplay I've been throwing around in my head a fair bit. The idea is that you are an inhabitant of another. Maybe you are a religious Summoner like Final Fantasy X's Yuna, maybe you are a priest(ess) praying at the temple of an old god(dess) for a hero to save your world/kingdom/town/village. Maybe you are an apprentice mage in magic high school where gladiator battles between summons is the main sport and you want to go pro with your summon(s)... we can discuss your role and the world, though I do have an idea for it if you'd prefer to just go with that.  \n  \nWhatever the reason, you end up summoning a powerful creature from another world with nearly unmatched powers (between your people, other summons can have the same 'power level'): my character.  \n  \nWhat I am can vary. Maybe I'm an elemental, maybe a demon of one sort or another. Or, my favourite, I'm a normal human whose body and abilities are warped on the transference to your world and I end up as human as I was emotionally and mentally, but now with a very different body and a few powers to sweeten the pot.  \n  \nSo, couple of house rules!  \n  \n1) **Only 18+ players, please.** As the title says, it is NSFW.  \n  \n2) **I'm not playing a human.** The character I'm playing can vary in appearance, but they will always be at least a little monstrous. No cat girls or the usual monster girls either, I'm talking something like a fire atronach from Elder Scrolls or the Dancer of the Boreal Valley from Dark Souls 3. \n  \n3) **Writing requirements.** I don't particularly care for post length, my posts can be paragraphs deep or just a few lines, depends on the situation. And I know typos happen and it's okay, but I expect an at least passable level of grammar. At the very, very least, know the differences between the \"your\"s and capitalize the \"I\"s for first person in singular.  \n  \n4) **Schedules.** I have a life outside too and sometimes I have to take care of things, so give some time to reply, please.  \n  \n5) **Content.** I'm happy to include and/or remove most things you ask me to, except for a few that due to the subreddit's rules we can talk about in PMs, but there is a very specific thing that this prompt revolves around so it must be present. I'm pretty sure that by the contents of it you can guess it, but I'll state in PMs neverthless.  \n  \nThank you for reading, hope to hear from you soon!",

I should clarify I'm looking for a partner to do a long-term, romantic, adventure roleplay.\n\n---\n\nHow exactly the cataclysmic melt was triggered no one really knows. But those who didn't drown or perish in the plagues afterwards are now having to quickly come to terms with their new reality.\n\nMost of what used to be landmass is now covered in oceans and what remains are either uninhabitable mountains or small chains of islands, viciously fought over by the survivors.\n\nMuch of human civilization now lives on and from the ocean. As do our main characters...\n\n---\n\n\nBeyond this very basic setting I don't want to nail down things too far. I love to both character and world build with my partner, so that we end up playing a story we both enjoy and find engaging.\n\nI should also say that I value literacy, detailed prose and proper grammar, as well as good OOC communication. I'm happy to play either over email or Discord, but first message me here please.\n\nIf you found the idea above I intriguing, have questions, comments or (constructive) criticism, please come and say hi, I'd love to hear from you!\n\nLove Alex",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters.  I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi** and **Cyberpunk RP** in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars, Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. I am not looking for group games or communities, nor am I looking for system games.",

You couldn\u2019t find it on a map, for it was so small no one thought that it was worth putting there. It was bland, there was absolutely nothing to do, and absolutely no one interesting that was there. It wasn\u2019t like anyone New was moving in either, with a population of around 700 residents everyone knew everyone. \nThough, this changed with the entrance of a young woman named Clara. She was odd to say the least. the woman stayed inside most of the time, she didn\u2019t like the stares people gave her. Her corkscrew curls were dyed a deep navy blue, her dark brown eyes always sparkled like she had something just waiting to be said. She was little, standing at just 5\u20192 and being skinny. \nIt doesn\u2019t take one long to realize that something odd was happening in this place. Some men in their sixties had faces that looked exactly like people who had lived in the village when it was founded. Some would steal away in the forest with people of the town and return alone. Not to mention the hooded figures that stalked the edge of the forest at night. Clara would find this out all too soon with the start of her job as a nurse in the town hospital.\n\nClara played with a pen on the front desk, as usual the day was slow. Nothings more than a stitch up or the occasional broken finger, nothing to write home about. The Night shirt was even slower if you could imagine that, so much so that only one doctor and three nurses were placed on it. Much to Clara\u2019s dismay it was her turn to take the shift. \nSoon an officer (could be you) pulled in. He was practically dragging another another man who was babbling about something under his breath (also could be you). \n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Clara stood up, \u201cdid you hit him with your car?!\u201d\n\nLittle did anyone know, this was only the start of their journey through pure hell.\n",

            "selftext": "Hey there, having graduated from university recently I've found myself with a lot of free time on my hands and would love to start on some involved and interesting roleplays. \n\nA bit about myself, I'm a big fan of reading and writing and find roleplay to fit nicely in as a hobby alongside them. I'm interested in a wide range of genres from science fiction, to more generic fantasy and espionage style roleplay just to name a few. My favourite genre overall is cyberpunk but it is quite niche and very rare to find a partner interested in it, so bonus points if you are! \n\nI also have numerous prompts on my profile, but they all lean more to an adult setting. I don't mind with our roleplay being more adult orientated or not. I'm fine with either, although I would like the roleplay to be somewhat mature in tone. \n\nI'm open to any ideas or discussions, just fire me a PM and we can see if we work out. Hope to hear from you soon! ",

            "selftext": "**Edit: most people seem to feel sceptical about the \"varying genders and orientations\" and \"multiple characters\" restrictions below. If that's the only thing you don't like, please contact me regardless. We can work something out, and maybe I need to adjust my criteria a bit. :)**\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

            "selftext": "Alright so, it's 7:19 a.m. for me right now, so I'mma drop this now, head to bed and hope for the best when I get up tomorrow. I want to write a crime drama...thing. Basically, I've watched NCIS, NCIS:LA, Castle (I'm drawing inspiration especially from Castle), and most recently, Longmire. I don't know a *whole* lot about law enforcement, in fact the most I know is *from* these shows, but I think it'd be a fun thing to try.\n\nSo, a little about me. 22-year-old female over in Florida, EST. I have about a decade of writing and RP experience, I'd like to think I'm fairly creative and I've been told I'm fun to write with, but I don't wanna sit here and brag. Normally I'd prefer a F/F pairing for this - IRL gender doesn't matter to me, as long as you'd played a female character - but this time around, I'm open to male characters too, so don't feel like you're at a disadvantage if you prefer writing male characters. I'll only be writing female, though.\n\nSo I'm looking for partners to do a crime drama RP with. I'd prefer romance to be present, though I'd rather it be organic and built-up if our characters click in such a way, rather than forcing it. Along that line, I'd prefer smut to be present, and when it is - naturally-fit into the story, and obviously not the center of it - I'd rather we play it out in detail and enjoy it. So if you're not comfy for that, please move along. I write 3rd-person past tense just because it's what I've gotten used to, but that can be discussed as I've had experience with 1st and with present-tense. I'm detailed, usually a single paragraph to several, but I *do not*, by any means, require you to match that. As long as you're committed, you're putting effort in, and you're advancing the RP, I'm good. Quality over quantity, friends.\n\nThe RP would obviously be centered on our characters, and their on-going service in - preferably - a big-city police force, likely as detectives. (Again, drawing inspiration from shows like Castle, so if you've seen any of the shows listed above and enjoyed them, we'd likely click). I'm looking for fully literate during RP, but in OOC chat I'm perfectly comfortable with text speak and will use it myself, so if either of those bother you we can discuss it, but it might be a deal-breaker. It'd follow their lives as they deal with the day-to-day of being detectives, and I already have a character in mind that I'll be playing, the details of which will be shared with you if we click. If you know more about law-enforcement than me and can help me along OOC during the RP, that'd be awesome. if you know as little as I do, or even less, that's fine too, we can play fast and loose, I'm down for that. I want drama, grit, realism, darker themes are obvious, I don't want this to be a stroll down gumdrop lane - it's an RP about big-city crime, it's gonna get dark, so a lot of NSFW themes will be present.\n\nThat's about all I can think of right now! I almost certainly forgot some stuff, so if you've got questions, feel free to leave a comment or PM me, I'll hopefully see either one. I primarily use Discord, I can be convinced to use Email or even Reddit (though I don't like Reddit), but Kik or anything else is out of the question, sorry. I'll toss you my Discord in PM's if you're interested. I hope to hear from you guys, have a great day/night!",

I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-400+ words). I  love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s  head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel  together.\n\nI understand if the scene don't  have alot going on and therefore require less. However, I must stress  the need for a good grasp of grammar, punctuation, etc. I like having  long, thoughtful replies back where we truly immerse ourselves in the  world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot  and writing as I am.\n\nI'm a big fan of  romance, using face claims, and am looking for characters in thier 30s-40s and older. I'm a sucker for the gruff and tough men who secretly  have a soft heart. The broken ones who are rough around the edges and  aren't afraid to throw a punch. But are tender enough provide a hug if  needed.\n\nI\u2019m the type to make pinterest  boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind  me of our characters and/or ship. I'd be delighted if you were the same. Last but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than  happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story  along.\n\nI love all types of genres, but especially real life, fantasy, and science fiction. I also like to use  fandom worlds and drop in original characters. All my characters will be  adults and I require my partners do the same.\n\nFor plot ideas/fandom list, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and possibly writing. Look forward to hearing from you!",

Unless it is dialogue and the character is standing completely still and not emoting at all like a robot, you can make it more than a few sentences.\n\nScheduling: I can post +3 times a day if it happens to be a lighter day for me, but life happens. I get it. I expect at least one post from you a day unless you are going through a life or death situation. You feeling a bit ill should not hamper your RP abilities. If you feel that once a day is too restrictive, leave now.\n\nContent: I prefer to play straight male characters, and I expect my partner to play a straight female. However, I do not force romance or smut between characters, as I feel that romance needs to naturally evolve between two characters. I also follow book canon, but can adjust to show canon if necessary\n\nPlot: I am most flexible with plot, and will compromise heavily on plot points. I have RP'd just about every role in Game of Thrones, from Flea Bottom thief to a Lannister Lord.\n\nHere are some of my more specific interests:\n\nMargaery X Robb\n\nCatelyn X Brandon\n\nAshara X Ned\n\nIf any of that interests you, shoot me a PM.",

Well, partner is my real goal, life is busy and I find one quality partner to be more than enough to keep up with. Anyway though, I'm searching for a gal who is over 18 (in case the RP takes some more dark or mature turns) to hit me up for some brainstorming via discord or skype, and then some kick-ass roleplaying, probably through email. Well, email is my preference but if you talk fast and make a good argument I can be talked into roleplaying other ways.\n\nA bit about me, I roleplay in the third person, past tense, love original stories, settings, and characters and despise fandoms. I'm great with using them as inspirations, but I am looking for something original. I average two to five paragraphs per post and would love a partner who works in that length as well. I'm currently craving a fantasy type of setting and have a few ideas to share. The two things that i desire the absolute most in a partner is communication and creativity. Be open about ideas on plot, characters, etc and also if you're busy in your real life and won't be around much. Bring something to the table...sure I have a bunch of ideas but I find the best RPs are when we feed off each other to create something that is ours.\n\nSo now you know what I want, shoot me a message and tell me what you want. Lets start brainstorming! I can't wait to hear from you...and don't hesitate. If this ad is still up, I'm still looking for the right partner.",

            "selftext": "I am back looking for a long term role play partner who enjoys doing romance plays. I am hoping for at minimum one reply a day, if not more from my new partner. Email is my preferred method of communication, although I would also be open to Google Docs and *maybe* discord. There are several ideas bouncing around in my head (some original, some thanks to other plays I have started in the past), but I am always open to new suggestions. I am big into the 1800s and early 1900s history, Doctor Who, Sherlock, The Walking Dead, and a few other shows, just for reference. Onto the ideas! One note first I guess is I really enjoy getting to know the person I'm RPing with so I tend to have a separate conversation ongoing via Google Hangouts or another email that is just chatting about life. I've made some great friends this way! \n\n1) Two strangers meet at a wedding. Maybe they are members of the wedding party. The thing is, this isn't the typical 'I want to hook up at a wedding' neither person really wants to be there, but the conversation eventually leads to romance or getting physical.\n\n2) A man, down on his luck had one night with an Escort/Hooker, and it doesn't go as planned. He starts falling for her. What happens next? (Check out the movie The Escort which this idea comes from!)\n\n3) One of the two characters could be an Uber driver that either frequently picks up the other person, or the pair is sent on a long journey together (See the movie Take Me Home for reference). What starts as two complete strangers becomes a friendship with romance eventually entering the picture.\n\n4) This one is the same principle as the Uber one above, except it involves an airplane. Here we could either play pilot and flight attendant, flight attendant and passenger, or two passengers who either hook up in a quick romantic rendezvous or who develop the slow burn of passion over time.\n\n5) Daily schedules always cause us to run into each other, maybe at the coffee shop or at lunch. We notice each other in passing, but one day a conversation starts.\n\n6) We start emailing back and forth, having met in a chat room or on reddit. We get to know each other and fall for each other. Little do we know, that we actually are co-workers, or friends...completely unaware we are really talking to each other.\n\n7) This could be combined with ideas 1 and 2 really, or be a stand alone. We are strangers, maybe we meet at a bar, and things get heated the first night. A couple months later the guy gets a phone call because, well...you are now pregnant. (See Amazon's Series Catastrophe for more on this idea!)\n\nThere are other subtle ideas we could add in...conservative family members, jobs, long distance, etc. None of these ideas really have to get sexual, but I am open to that as well...as part of the play. This isn't supposed to be a purely sexual RP, but getting physical is one part of romance. Hopefully one of these ideas has peaked your interest. Sorry for the long post, but I really am enjoying role playing, and would like to find some serious friends. It is always fun to get to know someone through a role play...because you never know if they are developing a character or pulling from experiences in their own lives. Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! We are a small Discord group roleplaying in the established universe of Bleach-with only a few minor changes- with the main focus being on the Winter War. \nAt the moment, Orihime has just been kidnapped and Ichigo and the gang has just been alerted to her disappearance so if you want to join now, you can definitely catch up easily and don\u2019t have to worry about reading through the previous roleplays-as it will be summarised for you in the discord.\n\nThe basic rules are to be respectful and friendly to other members, not bashing anyone\u2019s characters or the manga/anime itself.  As the founder of the group insisted on this RP following after the events of the game 3rd Phantom, there would only be some minor changes to some of the canon character\u2019s position and nothing more than that, so that can be easily dismissed...unless you are looking to play as Shinji Hirako then you must remember that in this RP you were never the captain of the 5th Division.\n\nIn this group, you can play up to 5 characters, both canon characters as well as OC\u2019s. If you are interested, you can either PM me to ask about this group or just click the link below to go straight to the group :)\n\nhttps://discord.gg/TBcaRA4",

            "selftext": "First things first, as long as this or any of my other RP posts are up, I'm interested in what you have to offer! No need to lead in with \"Are you still looking\" or anything like that. I'm pretty much always actively looking in some way or form, just sometimes things don't work out.\n\nThere are a few things to note though before you read any further. For starters, I am 25 and more than alright with topics that are better left for people over the age of 18. As such, I like for my partners to be 18+, and truly prefer if you are 21+ just cause ain't no body got time for drama. Second point: I'm a VERY casual RP'er. This isn't a job, nor is this something I dedicate all my free time to (sorry that's homebrewing), BUT I do try my best to give replies in a timely manner. I have an anxiety disorder that at times can make me seem a bit distant and lacking motivation, but I promise if you bear with me I normally work right out of it and get back to the RP we got, or will at least work out something new. I understand that there are those that would rather write than be friends, but that isn't me so look elsewhere so I don't disappoint you. If that doesn't bother you, expect lots of chats about random stuff, memes, inspiration posts on whatever RP we're working on, and well...just understand I'll chat your ear off lol.\n\nNow, style wise? I write in 3rd person past tense unless present tense somehow makes sense for the scene we are doing. Expect three to five paragraphs from me per reply, sometimes more but I'm never the sort to hold my partner to that standard. In fact, quality is always better than quantity. Just as long as you give me something to work with, I don't care that your reply is only a few sentences long.\n\nI do have a few original ideas that I will list below these, but here's a general summary of the types of RPs I like (+ means I'm craving it rn)\n\n* Fandom (Marvel+++/Star Wars/Doctor Who/DC)\n* Modern Fantasy (Digital Age Witches/Occult Detectives/Hunters/Blood Bank Vampires) +\n* Post Apocalyptic (Mad Max-ish, not just the standard Zombie stuff)\n* Cyberpunk\n* Slice of Life\n* Crime/Mob +\n* Alternate Universes\n* Sci-Fi/Space Odysseys\n* Traditional Fantasy\n* University Life +\n\nAs far as fandoms go, I don't like to play Canons all the time, but there are a select few I don't mind messing with. Some of those off the top of my head are: Peter Parker/Spiderman, Bruce Wayne/Batman, Terry McGinnis/Batman Beyond, 11th Doctor, John Constantine.\n\nMost of the time though, I enjoy using OCs, specifically males. I can't write female characters besides the one off side character (don't mind doubling), and I prefer to stick to MxF pairings. NSFW is more than okay in its own measured doses, and craziness is always fun.\n\nHonestly this is just supposed to be fun! If for some reason you dig what you read above and below then send me a message and lets work something out! Please understand though that I have the right to drop the RP or planning process if I don't feel like we mesh well. Sometimes that includes not giving notice (you can thank my anxiety for that).\n\n-------------------\n\nNote: Of course none of these are set in stone and I am more than willing to hear suggestions about something you may want! Especially if it is a plot you haven't gotten to do because you can't find the right person! Give me a crack at it!\n\nFandom Plots:\n\n**Marvel's Spiderman TL;DR** \n\nSo we all know how Peter Parker got his powers, and we all know about his time in high school, but what about after that? I grew up reading The Amazing Spider-Man and loved being able to relate to a geeky high-school kid, but now that I'm older I want to experience a more mature Peter and the way he handles things! This takes some inspo from the new PS4 game coming out but basically I wanna do a College-Era Peter Parker against either OCs or someone from his canon like MJ, Gwen, Betty or Liz.  \n\n\nOC wise, the basic idea is to have Pete juggling his dual life along side your character who also happens to be either a hero of villain themselves. I love the dynamic, and have had good experiences with it before, but of course this is just a basic idea! We can always incorporate it with some of the canon characters from his history, or if you have an idea feel free to suggest it! JUST GIVE ME COLLEGE PETE lol\n\nCurrent OC plots:\n\n**Cyberpunk TL;DR** \n\nOur characters live in a dystopian society based off the artwork of Simon Stalenhag (basically an AU where tech took off in the late 60s, leaving the 90s more like its 2028 or some shit). Machines have kinda taken over the world, leaving a few sects of humans remaining in hiding. Our characters end up on a road trip across the USA in search for a way of ending the machines for good.\n\n**Fantasy TL;DR**\n\nThis plot is based off of Stephen King's \"The Dark Tower\" novels. There's several avenues which we can go through, but the main premise is my character, a gunslinger (basically a knight in this world), is tasked with trying to keep a rebellion at bay in a distant land. Things go south and it leads to a bit of a quest that can involve multiple characters on both sides and what not.",

            "selftext": "Greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...My Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Pokemon, Splatoon, and Legend of Zelda.  I can try other fandoms but that's a case by case thing and anything that holds ZERO similarity to what I am looking for is likely a hard no.  Some outlying ideas people have come to me with being things like Kingdom Hearts, Skullgirls and Shantae for example.  With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",

DMing of NPCs and Creation of Story Arcs is done through suggestions, where we will endeavor to makes sure that all members of the crew get their character arc as they see fit. We are focusing on Quality, Friendliness and Maturity, as we tend to discuss most things as a group before moving ahead with them.\n\nThe story lore takes place in an AU about 100 years after the end of Luffy's Journey to become pirate king. The oceans have been unstable and mostly impassable for about 100 years after the use of one of the \"Weapons\". The oceans are just now settling down but as people set sail they will soon discover that things are vastly different than they once were. New Islands, New Dangers, New Adventures, New Technology and New Races. The crew currently only consists of a Captain (Who is also a Musician), a Shipwright, an Archaeologist and a Cook. Any other roles are open, as well as Devil Fruits. \n\nNote: This is a small group RP, we are professional and looking for active and responsible members.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/KRJxgRa",

            "selftext": "We are set in an era where technology is greatly far more advanced than as we knew it on 2018. With the discovery of new forms of life in other planets, traveling from one planet to another has gradually become part of the daily life of mankind; as a result of this, many humans have stablished former families with the citizens of the new planets discovered and new creatures and mixed species have been born, from simple humans that share similar traits to animals to complete demon or angel like beings. Racism is now not about the color of one's skin, but about the race they belong to. The less exotic you are, the more people will look down at you.\n\nIn this advanced era and lively galaxy, there was a planet in which no one would ever live; dry and infertile , it's terrain would not seem to ever be able to grow any green, and life could hardly be born there, despite the temperature being quite nice. There was only one person who looked at that planet and saw a new possibility. Everyone thought he was crazy, and so the old human man spent his whole life alone in that place, working relentlessly until, one day, life started to erupt from the very roots of this planet. Thanks to all his effort, the man was able to transform this forgotten rock into a great mass of nature ; plants, flowers and fruits of all sort of colors grew, making this old man's dream come true. If only, however, he could share this with someone... Someone who would protect it. So he created a living conscious doll, whom he called Veronica, and taught her how to keep this world alive as if this living doll were his daughter. After he died, the doll remained alone in the planet, taking care of it until explorers started to show interest in the rich planet and the doll's work. \n\nWanting to share her creator's work with everyone and fill this lonely garden with beautiful species whk could enjoy it, she opened the Bloom Garden tavern and Teashop. A cozy, warm and welcoming house surrounded by all that Nature, where people of all races and species and social status could come and either spend some holidays there, enjoying the food the resort had to offer, the arranged customized rooms and the exuberant nature, or definitely stablish their homes there, even though building was forbidden to keep the nature safe and they would still have to live in the apartment rooms they offered in the Bloom Garden.\n\nNow, if you've gotten this far, that must mean you're interested in joining, right? First of all, let me go over some basic rules.\n\n1. Be aware that even though this group is aimed to find nsfw rp by building relationships between characters, we must keep the content in the group chat SFW, which meansno sharing pictures or whatsoever. Take any sexual act to your room / apartment room / any place in this beautiful garden planet.\n\n2. All characters must be over 15 years old, and with an anime / illustrated appearance. You *must* wear your character's appearance as a profile picture as well as their name must be the same as yours on Kik.\n\n3. Be respectful towards every user and don't kinkshame. We can consent your character can be a bit of a grumpy cat and have fights, but do not take it to being a plain asshole. If you've gotten this far, in your first message when you PM me you should say \"The Lotus has bloomed\" so I know you've read everything.\n\n4. BE ACTIVE!\n\n5. Be it you come looking for NSFW partners or just SFW roleplay, you will be welcomed as all the roleplay in the IC (in-character) chat must be kept SFW. When you want to get more intimate, take your partner to your PMs! \n\nLet's wrap this up. If you're interested in joining this little group, pm me at @XRollingSpace on Kik. I'm waiting for you! ",

Users are free to create and playout a narrative unique to their character, that can involve others\u2019 characters, or NPC like characters of your own creation. We\u2019re all about members enjoying themselves and developing their characters in this world, how they see fit.\n\nOur staff is friendly, and are open to suggestions to be added to lore, and even event ideas. We run a \u2018democracy\u2019 in this group. So if you have an idea, you are encouraged to share it.\n\nWe are a new, and relatively small community, but are growing, and keep the atmosphere relaxed and welcoming to everyone.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have an age limit, this server has a lot of 18+ content, and we expect members to act in a mature manner in the majority of situations, as a way to limit OOC drama. Any NSFW stuff is so be done in private. But violence, gore, strong language, and drugs are all allowed in the server channels.\n\nJoin us for some roleplay fun. All experience levels welcome!

Eventually the fae prohibited the humans to enter their world any more, a large thick forest swallowed the kingdom, hiding it from the prying eyes of humans. A prophecy was placed, and since then, the humans forgot about the fae, all that remained were legends of the shining kingdom. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIf you liked this, or are interested please message me!!

I'm currently in the middle of adding info and building the world, and I would appreciate a fresh set of eyes and some fresh brain matter to look over things and help me out.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in my mods is someone that has experience doing this, a veteran RPer and someone looking for something new and exciting! So if this interests you send me a message on here or Discord Revenge_Party#9002.\n\nI'll have to ask a few questions and get to know you, and hopefully not only will I find my right hand person but also I like making friends!\n\nIn closing, if you know how to moderate, want to help out a first timer with setting up and RP AND first choice at characters, this is for you!\nHope to here from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nMy name is Madison, and I am an experienced roleplayer in Canada looking for another long term casual writing partner! Since adult life tends to ocupy the majority of my time, I am not a daily active responder and need a partner who can be fexible with waiting. I do, however, work a job where I am writing the majority of the day, so depending on the day I might be able to get out a couple posts. \n\nI am comfortable with dark themes, NSFW content, and most things. If we decide it is relevant to the roleplay I am open to just about anything! \n\nI feel the need to add a disclaimer that I am a chatter, and I would ideally love to find someone open to OOC talk! This isn't a requirement, but it does help with communication and story direction I find.\n\nI have been playing around with a fantasy world idea that I would love to expand on. \n\nIt is centered on a world where there is a single shallow ocean with one central large landmass. This landmass slowly descends as deep as an ocean, but instead is filled with large trees which grow in size and height the further down you go. \n\nCivilization lives out on the ocean, only sending prisioners, exiles, and the diseased to the land. Dark magic surrounds the forest, slowly weakening the minds of those who spend extended time wihin. Those who succomb to madness either turn rabid, or mindlessly disappear into the depths as though under a spell. \n\nWe could play as prisoners exiled to land who come across one another and pair up to try and survive. Or mages sent to learn more about the magical energy and its effects. \n\nI am also open to amy romance, action, or sci fi ideas you might have! Please leave me a PM telling me about yourself, what you are interested in roleplaying, and we can take it from there!\n\nMy main platforms are email and doctors. :)",

            "selftext": "Hello, hello, hello!\n\nI\u2019d like to start with a little intro about myself; not too detailed, but just right for your knowing. I\u2019m a 19 year old female student with a passion for video games and fandoms alike. I do have a name, and I do love it, but I would rather go by my first initial \u201cA\u201d in OOC settings just to preserve my identity. I\u2019m very shy when it comes to talking about personal accords, but I can assure you that once you get to know me, I open up more. Another thing is, I have a life outside of role playing and you do too! I wish that we can both respect this knowledge and roleplay on our own free time rather than trying to cram in a response just because we feel pushed. That\u2019s not the way I roll, so I\u2019ve created a small list of rules. Really, they are guidelines, but they mostly touch on respect of my choices and suggested methods for writing. If you have a long-houred job, that\u2019s okay! Just let me know and we will be on the same page with things! The last thing I want is either of us being stressed about the other. \n\nSecondly, let\u2019s get on with my history. I\u2019ve been writing stories on my own time since middle school, and that eventually branched out into roleplay soon enough (fun fact: it was Marvel Cinematic Universe based). I have around 4 years of roleplay to back me up as well, so with that you can expect decency in my grammar, sentence structure, and dialogue. I am still far from perfect and I\u2019m sure we all are, but I do ask that you have some background in roleplaying before we start chatting. Oh! Another thing is that my preferred style is past-tense multi paragraph! This means that I type in the 3rd person and describe actions/dialogue of the character(s) I am writing for like it has already happened and I am recalling details. \n\nSo today I am not only looking for a partner that can write alongside me and feel the immersion of roleplay, but also shares my passion for the lore and characters of Overwatch. If you aren\u2019t aware already, Overwatch is a new-ish first person shooter multiplayer video game with very cartoonish graphics, but that\u2019s not just the beginning. My absolute favorite thing about this game is their lineup of cinematics. I mean, have you seen them? Actual masterpieces, I swear. The short cinematic animations give insight to the backstories of characters that you see in game and as NPCs. In these videos and on multiple wiki sites are where I have accumulated my knowledge of possibly all Overwatch lore... and that\u2019s hardly an understatement. I\u2019ve been through hours- and I\u2019m being serious here- hours of research on my favorite characters just to know more about them, and specifically that would be Dr. Angela Ziegler, the Swiss prodigy. \n\nNow I know it\u2019s far-fetched that someone out there would love Overwatch in the same way as I do AND roleplay about it, but if you\u2019re out there, I\u2019d love to chat. Male or female, please don\u2019t be shy, I am open to all. My messages is always open, so shoot me a comment on this or a message on here and we can get started! Thank you so very much for reading.

            "selftext": "Salut! I am *Wintermute* (a nickname I have adopted from a famous book series), though feel free to call me whatever you may like. I have been role-playing for over 17 years, with experience over various platforms and different mediums for storytelling. With quite a portfolio to shift through I could say I have done it all, but a wise man once said that a *'true master is an eternal student'* and thus I am looking for the next chapter in my role-playing 'career'.\n\n*Please note: Before I establish anything below I would like to point out that for anything related to explicit content of a suggestive context, I would like to discuss those things through PMs or upon exchanging Discord IDs. While this is 'Looking For' is tagged as being mature in nature, I am not exclusively looking for the aforementioned content.*\n\n*So to start I have a little streamline of information about myself:*\n\n* I am in my late twenties to early thirties.\n* I am Japanese and as such English is not my primary tongue.\n* I am female and I do respond to 'she/her' pronouns.\n* I have experience writing female and male OCs **only.**\n* I live in EST time zone / format.\n* I work from home so I have the accessibility to respond to posts with great flexibility.\n* *\\*Addendum: In regard to the above point I do however have other obligations (MMOs, Artwork, etc) that I participate in, and while I do make partners or stories a priority, some understanding for my other activities, free time, and work space would be appreciated.*\n* I am a Multi-Paragraph / Novella writer, averaging 2K - 4K words per post as my base / minimum and doing more than this easily when inspired. *(Discord's average word limit is 2000 / 2K, and this is the metric I use to clock my responses or denote how far or over it I am writing).* I am capable of clocking down to 200 - 600 word replies should the situation call for it or I am underwhelmed, in dialogue, etc.\n* *\\*Addendum: I do not expect you to match me, but I do have a hard limit I accept that I will explain below shortly.*\n* I am ***very verbose, detailed, and calculated with my prose / verbiage.***\n\n*What I am looking for in potential partners or long term storytellers is the following:*\n\n* A minimum of 4-8 years experience with role-play.\n* You must be over the age of 18 at the minimum and 25+ optimally. \n* *\\*Addendum: I refuse to role-play with anyone below these set parameters, it is for my safety as well as yours as writers that we respect the art and the medium at hand. If I find that you are actually below my requested outline I will cease contact with you entirely. This includes removing you from my Discord history as well as discontinuing further communication.*\n* You must be willing to post at minimum one full paragraph for a reply. One-liners are immediately a turn off, as it gives me nothing to work with in terms of giving you a reply back. The usual song to this is '*quality over quantity'* but in my eyes they both go hand in hand. \n* Be willing to communicate and assist in constructing stories, theory crafting, development and believable characters *per the universe's definition of 'normal'.*\n* That despite your personal gender as the writer you are willing to contribute characters of any sex to a level beyond their sexuality. People are more than the sum of who they sleep with, and if the only thing your character has as an accolade is being heterosexual, homosexual, etc, then I have no interest in writing anything of the sort.\n* That you be willing to double, triple, or create NPCs for the sake of moving plot and developing the world we live within (maybe not right away, but certainly over time.)\n* Someone with a good grasp of the English language; prose, verbiage, verbose nature, and wordsmiths are immensely welcome and heavily prioritized here.\n\nSo with those things set and out of the way you are probably wondering what I am looking for? Good question! I think I have just the bullet point (oh no, not more bullet points) to give you a general idea!\n\n* Romance - *It is a must in some way shape or form. I enjoy it immensely and I am fine with 'slow burn' style relationships, or pre-defined ones. Mix them up in a bowl and I am in heaven.*\n* FxM / F// (FxF) - *This is just what I am comfortable writing and I always take a female role. If you are a female writer and can convince me of a great story to spin then I will definitely play a male for you.*\n* Space Opera - *Give me your Gundam, TTGL, Voltron, Cowboy Bebop, all of it. I am open to not just anime stories in space but also personally created universes by us. We can world build, we can blow up the sun, just be sure to make it exciting.*\n* Slice of Life - *I am crazy about it if done right. I do not mind settings in a school campus, work related, community or neighborhoods. I do like some extra fries with my* ***cheese*** *though, so if we can add elements of action, maybe some direct opposition I am super excited.*\n* Dystopia - *Fallout, Wasteland, etc. I love the idea of trying to keep going when everything is more or less a public bathroom backdrop for color and mutants run rampant.*\n* Cyberpunk - *Because who does not love cybernetics and neon lights?*\n* Feudal Era - *Jidai to Sengoku, Shinsengumi to Shoguns, I enjoy it all. Bonus points if you can do something in the line of Sengoku Basara, but I will take realism for these as well.*\n* Lovecraftian - *Whether you enjoy Lovecraft's works themselves or inspired works I am all in for these. The creeper the better.*\n* DND - *Anything of the nature and anything to nod towards the grandfather of role-play is fine by me.* \n\nThere are certainly other things that I am open to that are not on this list. Primarily speaking I am looking to hear some of your ideas! I have done a lot of everything in my life, but just because nothing is new under the sun does not mean I cannot enjoy a fresh take or a new spin on things. If you have read through all of this then thank you, at least for entertaining me in that regard. If you are interested then you can drop me a private message and if we hit it off, I will give you my Discord information. I hope to hear from you soon!  ( \uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)/ ",

            "selftext": "New Orleans, 2285. One of the last bastions of sanity and civilization in the Deep South, this city's storied history is about to have a few more chapters added. Let me set the scene for y'all: New Orleans, a shining metropolis of everything that made it great before the War with a little bit of post-nuclear flair. Voodoo practitioners peddle their wares, mercs keep the mob in line, the jazz society attempts to preserve the last bits of civilized culture, and in the middle of it all, you. The swampland surrounding it is full of mysterious bases and raiders, mean and crude as vast expanses of death come; like Ray Charles before his daily heroin, but with more gatorclaws. And to the East, the Went Isles, a mysterious oasis in the swamp, a place full of its own secrets just waiting to be explored. More importantly, these places are filled with people, vying for control, drugs, money, or just plain old power. What was it they say about war again?\nJoin the adventure: https://discord.gg/4k2Ugbw",

            "selftext": "So, I just finished my exams in this semester and ended up with a lot of free time on my hands. As such, I've been desiring an RP. However, a more specific kind of roleplay. As a guy with a lot of stress already in his life, I really want to play something more easygoing or chill. Heavy focus on relationships is a plus, though it doesn't have to be romance. If any of you ever seen Spice &amp; Wolf - something like that. Meaning I don't mind SOME drama or action. It's good, it keeps the roleplay flowing at a decent speed. I just don't want to make our characters miserable at every imaginable point in the plot, after every single scene. Sure, let them have their hardships, but I just want something to relax with. I don't mind a bit of sadness or anything like that. Just nothing too brutal, be it physical or mental pain.\n\nI honestly would like something set in historical settings or fantasy, but I do have something in mind for sci-fi (be it cyberpunk or space opera) and similar things. I don't mind if you have your own wishes. I actually like some initiative!\n\nSo, if you don't mind admittedly weird request, and want to create our own little nich\u00e9 world, filled with life and just the right amount of happiness and pain, I'll be more than happy if you write me a PM! We can discuss the details there, I already have a few plots in mind.\n\nYou can check my writing style [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/8i0srz/philosophyofme/), and I wish you a good day!",

We can decide the rating later.  \n\nIf you want to try this out then send me a PM and we can try and make this fun for both of us.

Well then, I think I have a place just for you fellow adventurer. Tale of Hope &amp; War, a place where you can make your own story. Hello! my name is Xeno, co-founder and developer of a dice-based roleplay called Tale of Hope &amp; War. Tale of Hope &amp; War is a roleplay set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world, where only a few cities have survived and mobilized the cities themselves. We offer a unique system that consists of traits, skilltrees and items with unique abilities. Lore-wise the world of Tale of Hope &amp; War is riddled with corruption from the gods, who have tried to invade the corporeal plane to obtain artifacts left behind by the elder gods, objects of immense power. Sadly these artifacts are also what keeps the world alive. So in order to survive mankind and other species have to become strong, strong enough to fend off the avatars of gods and perhaps the very gods themselves. For a god stepping into the corporeal plane is the cause of cataclysm. If you wish to join us please feel free to take a look, we're always happy for new players to join! Come on down and join us as we tell you a Tale of Hope &amp; War! https://discord.gg/uUx6Q7Y",

            "selftext": "Hello! i am interested in doing a role-play where my character begins the process of becoming a drag queen and falling in love with the lifestyle..and maybe some genuine romance down the line as well! The prompt begins with my character being a rather naive young man who wonders responds to the interview not really knowing what it entails and being plunged into the ferocious world of drag! As this transformation occurs, my character will begin to question his sexuality and eventually come to the conclusion he is gay, so any potential romances would have to be male, just as a heads up. Ideally i would want my partner to act as a GM but if that isn't possible then being my drag mother would work just as well! i could also make an exception for my partner playing the club owner who is not a drag queen if and only if they were willing to play an older male. if this interests you comment below or pm me",

A lot of it is based from taking Japanese (and some from other mythologies and some original) mythical creatures and reimagining them , and mixing the culture of Japan in the Heian period of Japanese history with modern technology to world build a unique setting, but all this is just explaining it lightly. \n\nThe setting fits into the following genres: high/epic fantasy, dark fantasy, science fantasy, space opera, and in some cases dying earth \n\nInfo on the setting here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vzpYYSTGClELDZNWIwamdr2JOpP_7m1RZunY_sg87E\n\nPlease be prepared to deal with some pretty dark issues, if anything triggers you please let me know. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses.

            "selftext": "Hello! I've already made a long and detailed post on here probably about a week ago. So I won't go too much into detail here on what I want. \n\nI will say that I am looking for someone that can type out more than a few lines or more than 1 paragraph (5 to 7 sentences) per post. I can't stress this enough, I understand that some people may prefer small posts, but I'm an aspiring writer, I just need more than one paragraph please.   \n\nIf you reach out to me and we start roleplaying, and I see that you aren\u2019t giving more than just a paragraph or a few measly sentences, I will unfortunately call you out on it. As I\u2019ve stated that I want more than that. Other than that little tick of mine, I\u2019m pretty much a goof ball! I love OOC chat, and actually prefer it, because it\u2019s always nice to strike up a friendship outside of the roleplay. It makes plotting easier. \n\nI prefer my partners to be over the age of 18, please and thank you! I can also double up on pairings. I only roleplay on emails.\n\nNow on my last post, I had a list of fandoms that I wanted to do, but I think the ones below are the ones that I\u2019m really craving. I\u2019ll put in bold the characters I could play in these fandoms. I also have ideas for each fandom. \n\n*Harry Potter (Mainly Marauders and Golden Trio era)*\n\n1. Marauders Era, introducing an **OC** to be added into the madness of the Marauders and Lilly\u2019s shenanigans. Looking for a **Remus** or Sirius to be played here, with us also splitting up supporting or side characters. The roleplay can go multiple ways, while I want romance, I also want a good plot. I\u2019m thinking the roleplay could start in the Marauders 5th or 6th year, and progress into the issues with the rise of Voldemort and the Death Eaters. My OC would be a Slytherin who is having trouble with straying away from the Dark Arts, even though most Slytherins are being forced into that life. \n\n2. Also the Marauders Era, but a few years down the line with them out of Hogwarts, Lily and James having a young Harry already. Would basically start right before the beginning of the first book/movie My OC and either Remus or Sirius trying to keep the Potters safe. It progresses into the first book and then takes a time jump to book 3 when the remaining Marauders come into play. Focuses more on the Marauders, but can include the Golden Trio as well. \n\n3. (Can you tell I love the Marauders Era a lot) **Hermione** still has the time turner after book 3, and she finds herself struggling with keeping track of all of her classes as well as her best friend. She accidentally travels far back in time to the Marauders last year, and runs (literally) right into the younger Marauders, breaking the time turner in the process. With no idea how to return to her time, she\u2019s forced to go to Dumbledore for help. But even he can\u2019t get her back home right away, and Hermione has no choice but to live her life there, while missing her friends back at home and trying to find a way to keep James and Lily Potter alive. Looking for a Remus/**Hermione** relationship, or a Sirius/**Hermione** relationship.\n\n4. Would love to hear your ideas!\n\n*Once Upon a Time*\n\n1. A **Regina**/Robin story. Regina decides to walk into the Tavern that night that Tinkerbell shows her, her soulmate. This story can go many ways, with Regina and Robin striking up a forbidden love story. \n\n2. **Regina**/Robin story. What if Regina had ran away from home after her mother killed Daniel? She runs right into the Merry Men and after some cautious days, the Merry Men decide to take Regina into their arms when they realize she has nowhere to go. I hope this to be a slow burn love story. With Regina being terrified to open up to Robin out of fear of what happened with Daniel. This could go a few ways as well, with Robin and Marian still meeting and Roland coming into play. With Regina and Robin having a child but maybe Cora finds out and in order to keep them safe, Regina returns to her mother and the events of OUAT happens with a cursed Robin and Roland not remembering Regina.

            "selftext": "**New World Order: Origins**  In the year 2075, a world government is formed with the hope of ongoing peace, mutual prosperity, and the elimination of all diseases. All countries stand down their militaries, and the new world order takes control under the command of President Chang.  The new government begins accepting bids for privately held companies to begin curing diseases and sorting out the health issues in Africa.  The new president wants to eventually eliminate private companies and privately held property, but he\u2019s not able to just yet so he has to work with these companies.  One of these companies, Zenith Tech, lands several wealthy contracts that propels them to the forefront.  30 years later, in 2115, just as the newly elected President announces the elimination of HIV and the consolidation of more privately held companies into the public sector,  a new plague surfaces in Asia. One that spreads rapidly.  So rapidly that within 5 years 70&amp;#37; of the world is infected, dead, or dying.  No one can tell where it came from, and rumors abound. The government is desperate, and what  remains of these privately held companies pulls together and suddenly a cure is found.  Zenith Tech holds this cure over the head of the bankrupt government and begins to control it from the shadows. And by 2050, no one even pretends it\u2019s a government anymore and elections stop.(edited)  \n\n\nIt\u2019s generally accepted in some shadier places that Zenith released the disease to take over, some believe it was nature\u2019s way of striking back, and still others think it was terrorists  - which is ZT Corp.'s official stance.  Income inequality skyrockets, everyone is microchipped and desirables and undesirables are segregated. If you\u2019re wealthy and lucky, life is good in the upper parts of the cities. If you\u2019re rich enough you may even have a house where you can see the sun.  If you\u2019re poor you get shoved down in the below, a cesspool of lawlessness and rats fighting over scraps.  Welcome to Neo Kyoto, the New World Order.\n\nJoin us! [https://discord.gg/zFkVvKV](https://discord.gg/zFkVvKV)",
