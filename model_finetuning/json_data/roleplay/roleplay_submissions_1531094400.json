I have been role playing for roughly ten years so I like to think I have some \" skill ' when it comes to descriptive play :P. I para as a minimal and mainly multi-para , I like descriptive and imaginative posts. So please don't message me if you intend on one lining, one lining in my opinion is pointless, I\u2019m not a grammar nazi honestly so don\u2019t worry if your not clearly up to par I don\u2019t judge ;) ( I\u2019m not great either! ). \n\nI'd like my partner to be involved in adding to the story it's much more fun if it isn't just one person leading :). And please be descriptive! Role play is all about imagination after all right?.\n\nI have indulged as many of you would probably guess in every aspect/eras and styles of role play; from fantasy/ action to adventure/sci-fi to slice of life. Nothing is of limits with me as long as it's enjoyable/fun and interesting :). I do tend to stick to mainly the modern era as i feel more comfortable with it but I'm happy to dive into other settings with the right Story line :).\n\nCharacter development and long term is preferred I like to build a good story :). Romance is something that tends to be included in all my role plays and honestly I Like it that way. Romance I find adds a real good element to any role play :) there for NSFW content will more then likely be apart of it hence the 18+.\n\nI'm really into fantasy/action/romance at the moment so happy to hear any ideas you might have :). \n\nPlease message me if your interested in starting something up with me, we can discuss and brain storm an idea together :). I typically role play on email/ google docs/. Look forward to hearing from you soon :)\n",

But, please, *serious inquiries only!* \n\nAn idea I have is that you could play a recently awoken vampire in the year 1877. He is awakened by an aristocratic man who has just discovered a centuries-old family secret of the creature. The man is a father and step-father of two children and husband to a wife. The father uses the creature to his advantage, and basically orders him to be the family butler and bodyguard. However, he must keep the secret to himself. No one else in the family must know.\n\nI would play the step-daughter of the man, a girl who has recently come of age. She is being forced into finding a husband, and is very reluctant and defiant against the matter, until she and your character begin to near close with each other...The mysterious new butler ignites my character's curiosity, and she begins to stop at nothing to figure out who he is and where exactly he's from. Eventually, she finds herself falling in love with him.\n",

A small portal has opened up on the edge of a small port town. Adventures have come form all over the lands to get a look at it and pass though, but the lord of the land is refusing passage until his scouts return. So these adventurers lie in wait at the local tavern. On the other side of the portal is a medieval kanto where pokemon replace the classic D&amp;D monsters. Pokemon are not the cuddly friends you know, they are monsters who will kill for food or the simple act of protecting their territory. \n\nIf your interested, send me a message.

            "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nAs the title suggests I\u2019m looking for a fellow creative to hop on the fun train to a new world of writing. As dorky as that sounds, I\u2019ve been out of the roleplay game for a bit over a year and I\u2019d like to get back into it! I\u2019m pretty easy to get along with and would like a few new friends to work with! \n\nSome things I\u2019m pretty adamant about: \n\n* Be an adult! \n   * Sometimes stories can get dark,gritty, or involve all around adult content. I don\u2019t want to worry about age.\n   * That being said, NSFW can happen if it develops. I don\u2019t fade to black.\n* I\u2019m not a huge grammar nazi!\n   * But please for the love of Cthulhu no \u201cIdk hbu?\u201d\n* I prefer to write in third person.\n* Be willing to contribute to the story!\n   * I love creating drama, sub plots and various plot twists. But I don\u2019t want to be the one doing all the work. \n* Please, stay in character.\n   * Adult content is fine with me, as long as it pertains to the story.\n   * People don\u2019t fall in love or just automatically like one another.\n      * I.e Sally isn\u2019t going to fall in love with the alien if she\u2019s petrified of them. It takes time to overcome that.\n* I create characters per story. {I\u2019d really like this to be okay}\n   * They do have flaws! \n   * I\u2019d appreciate it if your character was as in depth.\n* I can post a few times a day. It isn\u2019t a requirement for you too! If you can\u2019t post I\u2019d like to have some communication!\n   * I have a life, so I assume you do to. I\u2019m not going to get upset if you tell me you are busy!\n   * I\u2019m willing to create a discord server dedicated to a long term roleplay to keep things organized. \n\n\u2665If you got this far into my nonsense, I applaud you! When it comes to worlds, I\u2019m not super picky. I enjoy both creating them and using pre-existing ones as well. If you want to approach me make sure I at least know about said fandom! If I\u2019m intrigued enough I\u2019ll do my homework to learn about it!\n\nSo, for the bad news! At least, this is usually what is make or break for others.\n\nI\u2019d like to play a FxM plot. I'd play the female. I don't require that the individual playing the alternate role is of the same gender, that's just silly.  *In return I am more than happy to do any form of pair up of another set of characters to double up.* That being said, equal time is required amongst all characters. I don\u2019t want it to transition off unless it\u2019s agreed upon.\n\nAs for plots! I believe they should be created together. \n\n* One subplot that I do have involves my character being sick or cursed with a fatal curse or disease centered around the concept of roses. I.e when she coughs petals can come up. When the thorns wrap around her heart she\u2019s dead. But a cure exists that can be found etc.\n   * \\[Not a requirement for our story. Just an idea!\\]\n* Genres that I\u2019m interested in! \\[Our idea can be a hybrid\\]\n   * Slice of life\n   * Supernatural / White wolf \n   * Romance \n   * Futuristic \\[Not necessarily space\\]\n   * Fantasy\n   * Fairytale \n   * Horror\n   * Halloween/Set holiday environments\n* I\u2019m not limited to the above, so please feel free to throw some ideas at me!\n\nAbout me:\n\nI\u2019m just another adult that hides away through her creativity on the internet when she\u2019s not gaming! I\u2019d love to make some friends through this !\n\nI hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Greetings! I\u2019m an experienced roleplayer coming back from an extended break, looking to scratch my proverbial creative itch with one or two adult writers. I\u2019m partial to the high fantasy genre, but I\u2019m always open to suggestions and fun ideas. I try to avoid established worlds (Harry Potter, Star Wars, Game of Thrones, etc) but am not *entirely* resistent to them.\n\n\nMy style is fairly simple, in that I rarely have more than a basic direction in mind when I begin a character or a game. Creativity is a fluid concept, and I prefer to try and ride that wave rather than control where it takes me. All my characters are my own, and my preference would be the same for you. \n\n\nWhen it comes to adult themes, particularly sex or violence, I find them perfectly acceptable as long as it makes sense. Please understand that all of my actions or inactions regarding my character(s) are made entirely in-character. If I attack you, reject you, curse at you, etc, it\u2019s not a reflection of my personal feelings towards you. It\u2019s simply the way my character is reacting to yours and nothing more. I\u2019ve lost one or two partners in the past because they took things too personally, and that\u2019s something I wish to avoid going forward.\n\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, then great! I\u2019m an EST player that prefers to play at night, so anytime after 7 or 8 would be wonderful. Just drop me a line through a PM and we can work out the details. I can provide a writing sample from an old game as well, should you be so curious.\n\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "*She walked down the cold, cobblestone street, wearing thin shoes of leather that allowed her to move as silently as possible, a necessity for where she was headed. The crisp air of the autumn night nipped at her button nose and caused her soft, grey eyes to well slightly with tears. Her long, dark hair was tied back in a single braid, and the night breeze caused the few small pieces that fell loose around her pale face to sway. \n\nThe thick black cloak she was adorned in billowed behind her with the wind, revealing underneath a simple outfit of a white, peasant-style, long sleeve shirt, and black trousers, held up by black leather suspenders. She wore two black leather harnesses; one across her chest and one across her hips. The chest harness held an assortment of things; wooden stakes, daggers with blades of silver, silver crosses. The hip harness held one thing; a sheathed sword, with a long, lethal blade of silver. It wasn\u2019t the typical choice of clothing for a normal villager lady, but, she was far from normal, anyway.\n\nThe cold stones of the streets in this small French village pressed against her feet as she walked, the sensation sending a chill up her spine. She toyed with a wooden, beaded rosary as she approached the cathedral; the vast, dark, wooden doors lit by two torches on either side. As quietly as possible, she pulled a torch from its procurement on the stone wall, then pushed open the heavy door, cursing that it groaned in protest as she did so.\n\nInside the cathedral, she walked hastily down the aisle, right to the bottom of the 4 small steps to the altar, where behind it a podium stood in front of a large, wooden cross, draped in the white cloth and thorny crown the Savior had so diligently worn at his time of crucification. \n\nLyra ascended the few wooden steps, then dropped to her knees at the altar, clasping her hands over the cross at the end of the rosary and bowing her head in prayer, the beads swaying slightly back and forth as she did. \n\nCompletely immersed, she prayed to her God; for safety, for courage and for luck, for she would need these things on her hunt tonight.*\n\n\n\nGreetings~ I\u2019m looking for a partner to write with me based off of the above prompt. The setting is European Renaissance, the theme is a supernatural adventure and maybe romance (if we go that route) between my character (above) and yours! You can play as whatever you\u2019d like, as long as we agree on it. \n\nPlease PM me if interested :)\n",

So, feel free to message me with your idea, we can try to work something out! I'm not saying I'll immediately jump on every idea you have, nor can I say that it'll turn into something we'll pursue, but I promise to keep an open mind. I'm not knowledgeable about every single fandom out there, so if I'm not familiar with something don't take it personally. That being said, I know a good deal! So if you're not sure, send me a message with your idea anyway. The worst that can happen is it doesn't work out and you move on. \n\nYou want swords and sorcery? Hell yes, all day. You want a little realism? Let's get into it. High adventure among the stars? Sign me up. Steamy romance? You know I'm down. A focus on camaraderie? I am so into it. \n\nI only require three things from my partners: Please be at least 18, please be willing to write more than one word in a reply, and please be enthusiastic as fuck about your idea.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I have kind of a specific request for you. But, please, *serious inquiries only!* \n\nAn idea I have is that you could play a recently awoken vampire in the year 1877. He is awakened by an aristocratic man who has just discovered a centuries-old family secret of the creature. The man is a father and step-father of two children and husband to a wife. The father uses the creature to his advantage, and basically orders him to be the family butler and bodyguard. However, he must keep the secret to himself. No one else in the family must know.\n\nI would play the step-daughter of the man, a girl who has recently come of age. She is being forced into finding a husband, and is very reluctant and defiant against the matter, until she and your character begin to near close with each other...The mysterious new butler ignites my character's curiosity, and she begins to stop at nothing to figure out who he is and where exactly he's from. Eventually, she finds herself falling in love with him. \n\nOf course, all of this is up for change or tweaks. We can also come up with a completely new idea. \n\nI hope you're interested! Thanks, loves! \u2665\ufe0f",

            "selftext": " Hey there. My name is **Danielle**, I'm from the UK in the BST timezone, and I'm looking for a long-term post-apocalyptic roleplay. I'm okay with roleplaying with someone from another timezone, just as long as we both have times where we can have back-to-back replies and more than one message per day!\n\nFor a *type of apocalypse,* I am fine with either **zombies or nuclear apocalypses.** I prefer zombies, but we can spice up what type of zombies there are, how fast they are, how quick they spread, how the virus spreads and stages of infection. This is something I enjoy discussing and planning.\n\nI also do not mind whether we set the roleplay 10 minutes or 10 years from the outbreak, anything is fine with me as long as it goes by the story.\n\n**My rules are really simple if you are interested:**\n\n* Please do not rush the relationship between our characters, I would love to build a romance up, but starting off as acquaintances, maybe not even trust or like each other, but I'm looking for something long-term.\n* Please be able to mainly write in paragraphs.\n* Be literate!\n* Keep it as realistic as realistic goes when it comes to an apocalypse. No godmodding or superpowers.\n* Please don't rush my replies. And i won't rush yours! We both have lives!\n\nI'm looking for a dramatic based story between two characters who are trying to survive and have to pair up due to circumstances we can discuss. But throughout their friendship, hate, and romance, there will most likely always be drama. I am looking for a partner that can provide the skill in writing to experiment with angsty scenes, involving blood, gore, tension, disputes and death. As these scenes usually are NSFW, I am looking for someone 18+ to include these. I am also okay with doing sexual scenes, as long as it fits with the story, and isn't abused.\n\nWe can discuss whether we would like to roleplay adults, young adults, or younger ages that would not include any NSFW content. I would love for our characters to bond and form a sweet bond and romance including some fluff and innocent romance that would be tested and almost destroyed due to the harsh reality surrounding them. I want near death experiences, experiences that cause our characters to hate each other for periods of time or that cause them to break down and lose parts of themselves. I want them to grow together, and through their roughs they survive together and help each other towards becoming a new person in the apocalyptic world. \n\nPlease message me with your ideas - I am much more willing to respond to you if you show me you are passionate and you have ideas to share with me.\n\nI have a couple of ideas for these roleplays, including the 'immunity' concept, group rivalry's, partner survival, etc... But I would love for us to discuss things together and build up a world together.\n\nI can roleplay males or females, and mainly do pairings of MxF or FxF as I\u2019m inexperienced in doing MxM.\n\nI use discord to rp.\n\nSend me a message if you're up for it, and I will reply asap.",

If you've come for a stat and numbers based campaign, well then it's probably not for you. But if your here for a role-play heavy campaign that delves into character development...you might as well sign up now. The campaign system is bare bones based around character creation instead of mountains of stats but will have dice rolls. I'll walk you through it once we get to chatting. As for the campaign itself, it'll be a mix of all genres action,adventure, thriller,romance, horror... everything you'd expect. I'll be the DM having run several campaign in the past.\n\nIMPORTANT CAMPAIGN INFO:\n\n- It will solely be on discord with a dice bot.\n\n- TEXT only\n\n- It will be session based (I will discuss this with each player and pick a day for the campaign to start. I'm airing for once a week by will be happy to do twice a week if that works with everyone)\n\n- No need for character sheets. Once you give me all your info for you character, I'll then whip it up into a sheet and put it up on discord.\n\n\nIMPORTANT CHARACTER INFO:\n\n- As this is a story/character driven \u00a0D&amp;D campaign, I'd be looking for unique characters. I don't want four shy human orphan slaves who are as bland as a bit of cardboard. \n\n-I have a artist waiting in the wings to draw your character.\n\n- Character gender are not limited to players gender. It's role play after all.\n\n- LGBT characters are more than welcome as I've had been asked that in other campaigns.\n\n- I am allowing homebrewed races as it opens the door to different characters but I'm not allowing homebrewed Classes as then it starts getting into a cloudy area. If your interested in a homebrewed race, but don't know any. Don't worry, I can point you in the right direction.\n\n- Your character will be starting as a criminal in jail (this plays into the story). So maybe think of adding in a reason for his/her lock up. This doesn't mean they are evil.\n\nIf any of this interests you. Please feel free to PM me any time and I'll send more info for the campaign story. If you are PMing me, please could you tag on what time zone your in and what days work best (also your discord username with #numbers). Maybe add in any ideas for a character you have in mind.\n\n(P.s. sorry if it takes me a bit to message you back. It takes time to get players sorted. Also if you've message me before, feel free to send again as I was flooded first go around)",

            "selftext": "Hello there, I'm Lynne!\n\nOnce again I am looking for one or two new partners to add to my roleplayer list. I tend to prefer people who are also willing to write long term together.  \nIn my experience, these have been the best roleplays - some have been running for two years by now.\n\nI'd like fairly regular answers, but I am aware of people having a real life as well, so I'm rather relaxed there. Ideally you tell me if you're going to be absent for several days at once.\n\nI won't go and count the lines of your posts, neither will I count mine. The length can always vary, I just don't appreciate to only get back one or two lines in answer to a rather long text and won't do the same vice versa. I believe one paragraph is the least one can do.\n\nUsually I write in a rather detailed manner and am normally able to keep that up throughout if my partner does as well.   \nMaybe you've noticed by now, my grammar isn't perfect, as English isn't my first language. Despite that I will always put in effort to write in a colourful and interesting manner and I expect the same of a potential partner.  \nAlso, I am more than happy to come up with a story or brainstorm ideas for one together, that way both can bring themselves into it and the responsbility isn't just resting on one alone. For this, communication is an essential aspect, so don't be afraid of letting me know if you disagree with something or have an idea you like better and so on, I will do the same.\n\nI'm 25 and would also prefer somebody who's older than 20, not only because I made my best experiences with roleplayers around my age, but also because NSFW themes might be part of a roleplay depending on the story. \n\nI absolutely love fantasy settings, be it in a modern or medieval era and most of my roleplays in the past have been set accordingly.   \nBe that as it may, I am open to try out new things as well, so feel free to tell me about that one idea you've been itching to try!\n\nI've been roleplaying on kik mainly, as it has been handy and quick to use in the past, but it isn't set in stone as that roleplay tool of choice.\n\nSeeing that this post will only become longer and longer, I will stop now, as I believe I've said the most important. If you, dear reader, have any questions for me or are interested to see if we'd get along, feel free to PM me.\n\nHope to hear from you!\n\nCheers \n\nLynne",

Then my love for Glee died and my writing went with it and it's probably been like 3 years since I wrote something. But even though it's been a long time, I still get the urge here and there to write. Not just for Glee, but just in general. I love making characters and finding reference photos. I haven't written something substantial in a long time, but I'd like to change that. I'm open to writing, obviously, in the Glee world (I played Rachel Berry) or creating OCs and making up our own universe.\n\n* I'm 26 years old and I do work full time, so replies depend on work and whether I'm exhausted or not.\n* I normally write third person but can do first.\n* I wrote for Glee roleplays for about 4 years before I quit and before that I did Degrassi and Harry Potter (totally open to those universes too!)\n* I don't watch a lot of shows now, so my knowledge of other universes and settings is pretty limited, but if your patient I can try?\n\nI think that's all I can put introductorily. If you have any questions, ask. If you have interest, let me know! Have a great day and thanks for reading.",

I\u2019m about to go on vacation for four days so I won\u2019t reply much then. \n\nShoot me a message if you\u2019re interested. ",

The clouds which struggled to withstand the burden of the weight which the rain held, soon gave in. The rain poured down over the city with a roar. The sound of emptiness was disrupted by the loud gregarious boom of thunder. \n\nA young woman ran across the hard cobbled stones a file above her head as the rain hammered down against the plastic Filofax with such ferocity it felt like her fingers were being pounded by a thousand tiny needles, her grey hues peered up to a small coffee shop just a mere stride away and she searched to seek shelter in there . Her cold stiff fingers reached forward and pushed the small door open as she slid her small frame around the bending of the door and pushed her self in the warmth of the establishment offering some comfort and relief from her Now wet cold frame . \n\nHer hair which was tied neatly in a bun against her head was slightly damp now small wet strands hung around her frame , she was rather petite .. She reached up un zipping her leather jacket and peeled it from her body thankful that the rain hadn't penetrated her blouse , the crisp white shirt was snug against her tiny frame . A pencil skirt was snug around her waist and pulled down straight enlightening the soft curves of her hips . \n\nA gentle sigh left her lips and she cursed as she brushed the tiny rain drops from her skirt her dainty fingers working against the fabric as she stepped forward not particularly watching where she was going she bumped into someone in front of her rather roughly that it caused her to step back nearly loosing her balance , a  Filofax dropped to the floor paper work billowing around the floor in a flurry , she cursed and bent down to retrieve the paperwork which had fallen from the persons folder in her haste she dropped her own Filofax paper work flowing in all directions she blushed quickly tugging some of her hair out of her face . \n\n\" gosh I'm so sorry ... I wasn't watching where I was going ... I... \" she stumbled over her words trying to sort the paper work out and sort the two different sets of different paperwork that were now in a jumble against the floor... \n\n(( thank you for reading my prompt :3.\n\nhopefully it has interested you slightly. I'm seeking someone to play the part of the male, Ideally what I would like is someone also in the buisness trade .. Someone confident and Daring. Clarrisa could do with some excitement in her life! Hoping to find someone wealthy who could spoil her and show her things she could only dream about seeing :). NSFW elements involved so 18+ please. \n\nSeeking mainly romance but would love action to! Even fantasy if you want ! Prefer semi/para/multi-para play. I enjoy descriptive language . Interested? Please don't hesitate to PM me and we can discuss it more )) ",

I'm mainly looking for someone over the age of eighteen, who is comfortable writing darker themes at times, and someone who is comfortable writing a male character. \nAlso, I'm looking for someone okay with writing hetero romance. \n\nI mentioned that I'm okay with NSFW and/or darker themes. However, I don't want the roleplay to be, well, just that. Substance goes a long way with both topics! \n\nI'll let you know themes that are absolutely off limits for me, please do the same if you're interested!\n\nAs for topics I'm interested in:\nFandom wise, I'd love something based off of Dark Souls(the first game), My Hero Academia(I'm only caught up with the anime), World of Warcraft, Pokemon(Humans/trainers or Pokemon/PMD), or something Supernatural(The television series) based. I would prefer to play original characters but if you would like to play someone canon that is okay! Just let me know. \n\nFor more original topics I'm open to anything gritty and modern. I'm, however, open to d&amp;d-esq settings. \n\nI'm a sucker for drama and romance. \n\nHowever, I am not looking for slice of life or pure NSFW roleplays. I'm sorry, I'm just not that interested in those. \n\nAlso, I'm looking for someone who can at least put in a reply once a day. You can expect the same for me  \n\nAnyhow, if anything caught your interest please send me a PM and we will work out details! Once again, sorry for any errors on this post because I'm typing via mobile. I assure you my replies will not be typed out this way. ",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nI'm not totally new to the idea of roleplaying, but I'm a little confused about some things. How does RP work? I've played rpg games (like tabletops and MMORPGS) but never actually done collaborative storytelling before. I think I've only seen and done a little bit of some basic type of rp when I was a kid, like, 'I walk up to you, I say so-and-so' and that's it. Even long, paragraph posts were mostly dialogue with voyeuristic self-inserts. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'm not interested in that. \n\nFor a long time, I thought that's what RP was, but after lurking here for a bit and seeing that a lot of people are actually looking to create coherent stories together and put narrative first, I started to get interested. I consider myself pretty literate and I read a lot, I also have an interest in storytelling devices and what makes a good story, but I don't have any significant experience in *actually* writing. \n\nI'd love to get into collaborative story-telling, does RP fall into that category? I'm a little intimidated about getting started - I have no real writing experience but at the same time I'm looking for some good, literate storytelling. Any advice? Would anyone be interested, maybe, in taking me on for some roleplay where I can stumble around a little bit? \n\n**tldr; how do?**\n\n",

Does the thought of dystopian adventures make your brain release endorphins? Do space ships and lasers sound awesome?

Scales! Scales!' mean anything to you? Do you like cats? If you answered yes to any of the above, DM me! I do not roleplay with players under the age of 18, adult themes are always present in my plots and my characters. I prefer fxf pairings for plots with romantic themes, which there will be at some point or another. Your irl gender **does not matter**.

After being kicked out of his birth pack, Red Moon Pack, for murder and treason, he went on his mighty way into becoming the forest's most evil alpha. He formed a pack with fellow loners, each full of anger at becoming rogues. This pack was known as the Nightshade Pack.\n\nNever having a Luna by his side become his biggest weakness. Along came Bellamy, sick of Farkas's treacherous ways. Once of age, the boy decided to leave Nightshade pack and train with fellow rogues, sick of the tyranny.\n\nBellamy wished for peace among the forest, and with Farkas here, peace would never be. Bellamy fought Farkas and after a near-death fight, finally had become the victor and taken down the forest's scariest enemy yet.\n\nWith Farkas now gone, Bellamy took over Nightshade, casting out wolves that wanted to follow in Farkas's ways, and hoping to give the pack a better reputation.\n\nThrough his journey, he met Shylin, a smaller-than-average, strong she-wolf who was quick to stay by his side through thick and thin.\n\nThis is where Nightshade's story now begins.\n\nInformation about rules, roles, and our backstory are on the discord server.   \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/AmzPQ9](https://discord.gg/AmzPQ9)",

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nI am looking for an advanced, long-term roleplay partner to do a romantic, slice of life roleplay with over PM, that includes lots of drama and twists and turns. I am looking for someone who is literate and can write multiple paragraphs per response. This is meant to be a story that we create together, so input and ideas from both parties are necessary to make this enjoyable for both of us.\n\nA little forewarning, I only play original characters and would like your character to be an original character too. Straight off the bat, I'll let you know now that I don't do roleplays that are based on the generes of fandom, supernatural, fantasy, medieval... etc. so if that's what you're looking for, then this is the wrong post for you.\n\nAnyway, a bit about my roleplay history... I've been doing text based roleplay for about 4 years now, with a main preference for romance and slice of life roleplays. I have been told that I am a literate and detailed roleplayer, and I put a great emphasis on using correct spelling and grammar in my responses. In terms of response length, I usually write a few paragraphs, dependant on the situation. As a general rule of thumb, the more I get, the more I give back, but it's never less than a paragraph. \n\nI am looking to create a roleplay where our characters already begin in an established relationship together, and can explore that relationship throughout the course of the roleplay, as different events and situations arise in their lives. I know this may sounds strange and a little boring, but I have a few ideas in mind that you can read over if you choose to PM me.\n\nAs for NSFW, I am comfortable with NSFW elements in a roleplay, but am happy to exclude them too. If NSFW elements are incorporated, I personally prefer my roleplay's to revolve around the plot and storyline, rather than the NSFW elements themselves.\n\nI'm hoping that I have expressed enough detail for you to be interested, without writing an entire essay. If you would like to roleplay with me or hear more about my ideas, feel free to send me a PM. If you have any ideas then I'm more than happy to hear those too, if you feel that they align with what I'm looking for.",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI'd love to do a RP centered around the dot hack universe. I would prefer R:1 but if we have to go to R:2, I can adjust I suppose. Generally speaking I want us both to play friends who know each other offline and who also game together online. I don't want to follow the idea of people falling into comas, but I would like there be to be some kind of looming problem, maybe technology is acting up, freaks accidents are happening. I don't know, maybe something akin to Pluto's Kiss?\n\nNow regarding characters I'm interest in a Wavermaster, Twin Blade or Heavy Blade. I would like us to keep classes to R:1 but again, I could be swayed into R:2 as long as the reason is you want to be some badass Tribal Grappler because to me, your class shouldn't dictate your interest in a RP and to me, simple is better. \n\nI can usually post 2-4 paragraphs on average and I do like romance in my stories, provided it's paced naturally. \n\nAs mentioned above I do Reddit or Discord, I'd prefer Reddit because I forget to log into Discord and sometimes I won't be on for 2-3 days without realizing it. It's just not a major part of my online habits. I can work with us making our own subreddit if that would be of interest to anyone. \n\nIf you got any suggestions or questions, drop me a PM. Dot hack is such a broad series that I think we can have a lot of fun with it. \n\n- C__G",

I use great grammar and spelling in my posts, and I try to type at least a paragraph or more. Bleach has been a long time favorite anime of mine, so over the years I've developed many OC's for the series. \n\nI just recently got into MHA, but I absolutely love it and am faithfully watching each episode of Season 3. I have developed one OC so far and am in the process of developing another one for this series. I would love to put any of my characters in action and work with you to create an interesting story line. \n\nFor themes, I like action, romance, angst, and even NSFW, but I will only write NSFW with another female partner, for personal reasons. I use Discord and Kik, so either of those would be fine. I don't usually play canon characters, but I will try my best! If you'd like me to play a canon character as a crush for your character, I'd be glad to if you agree to do the same for mine. \n\nI hope that I have managed to gather your attention, and maybe we'll get to rp together soon!

Please, for the love of God, don't take these summaries as a reflection of my writing abilities! Actual IC writing will be far more polished. I tend to give a minimum of 4-5 paragraphs and would love to find a partner who can do the same. I'd consider myself an 'advanced' writer, but that sounds a little pretentious and I don't want to scare anyone away. \n\nI do ask that my partners be literate, have few limits, be over 18, and RP in 3rd person. Anything else, we can work out together OOC. \n\n...And now for the plot summaries!\n\n* It Happened One Night: This would involve a wealthy young man (mid-twenties) who either just broke off his engagement or his girlfriend left him, though he's known as a bit of a playboy to the tabloids. He gets drunk in a high-end hotel bar one night and is approached by an escort who typically deals with men of his status (and pocketbook). He lives in a different city and is only there on business, but after she convinces him to take her back to his room and he eventually sobers up, he actually takes an interest in her. So much so, that he calls for her again the next time he's in town. Eventually, they both start to fall for each other but there are complications, of course. Only seeing each other in hotel rooms, him getting jealous about her having to sleep with other men...maybe she even works for some kind of pimp and would be in danger if she just 'quit.' Lots of twists and turns and ways this could go.\n\n* The Vote: I have a couple different ideas for this story, which would involve the political world. Basically, my character would either be a journalist or an activist of some kind, someone who is strongly and publicly against your character's father, a seasoned Senator who is set to run for President. Our characters meet somewhere, start to get involved, etc. Drama ensues. (This could also be done as a more medieval story, with the King's daughter and a Robin Hood-esque character who opposes everything the royals stand for). ",

I'd be playing the witch role and you can play whoever you'd like, get creative! This is planning to be a modern fantasy RP sent in present day or maybe the 80s or 90s? Are you a nerd in one of her classes? Maybe a fellow Witch? Someone who hunts supernatural summoners like her? Let your mind go wild!\n\nIn terms of the magic Im a big fan of demonic/satanic themes. Demons, blood rituals and all that fun sort of dark magic! Maybe our characters accidentally release a demon into the small suburban town or some other evil must be stopped!\n\nDespite the dark magic sort of themes I'd like for this RP to be somewhat light.. just not be doom gloom and miserable the whole time at least. I post around 2-3 paragraphs per response and would like the same in return! I prefer to RP on Reddit but you could sway me to Discord or Kik if you so please.\n\nWhen RPing I like to put story over smut! Not to say I don't enjoy smut... but I don\u2019t want it to be a main part of the story, please.\n\nAnywho, thanks for reading this and please put your favorite color in your PM so I know you read this!\n\nCan't wait for your responses! &lt;3",

When I say quickfire, I just mean multiple posts in a row, as opposed to days in between - it doesn't have to be 5 word sentences.  \n\n\nIf that sounds like it's your speed, just message me for my discord address!

I want to feel a strong emotional connection between our characters, and have a fair amount of drama between them. \n\nI should probably say a little bit about me... I've been roleplaying for years now, and I know myself well enough to say I like to respond with about 2-4 paragraphs of writing. I'd like the same amount from you, if not more. I find literacy to be very important. I also don't mind chatting OOC if you'd like. :) Since I'm 21+, I would rather you be old enough to write NSFW storylines, since I'm a fan of that type of writing. Don't get me wrong, I want our story to be more than that. I can write as a female or a male, and I don't mind your gender either.\n\nI want us to grow a deep connection as we write together and get to know one another. PM me and we can juggle ideas. As of now I kind of like the idea of college sweethearts, perhaps broken up and meeting one another again at their reunion, or something like that. We can work it out. :)",

No numbers or complex math on that end, and no having to learn individual jutsu (unless they're unique!). Just rate your skills based on your rank and act accordingly!

            "selftext": "Neither the scientists nor the arcanists could provide an explanation as to how the Sky Isles came to be. But there they were. And as civilisation evolved and began to explore, they were long a tempting goal reached only seldomly and with great sacrifice. Finally, airships happened, and with them the first Sky Isle colonies. The islands were mysterous, beautiful, and they were the source of everything, from rare materials to luxury goods. Of course, there was greed and greed bred conflict. Tempting as the call of the Sky Isles was, many a life was lost there and in the skies around them.\n\nThe Sky Captain stood on the wall of a port city in the south of the Old Continent, looking out into the distance, towards a few specks in the sky. It wouldn't be her first voyage to the isles. Still, things would be different from now on. She was deep in thought. \n\n\"Captain...?\"\n\nThe voice brought her back to the here-and-now. \"Ah, Marcus. Is everything in order?\" She smirked as she turned to face her First Officer. A kind soul. Perhaps too kind. The man nodded. \"The Silverwing is ready and cleared to depart at sunset, as requested.\" That was all he said. But there was something else on his mind. She knew him well, for a long time now, could read him like a book. \"That's not why you're here. What is it?\" The man cleared his throat, looking out into the distance, towards the isles. \"The uh... the stowaway... she... accepted your offer.\"\n\nThe Sky Captain grinned. \"I knew she would,\" she said. \"Now, let's head back and talk to her. It'll be good to have a maid again.\"\n\n*This is where you come in. Your character had been caught trying to stow away on the Sky Captain's ship, the Silverwing. She was given a choice - be handed over to the port authorities or accept the position of the Captain's maid. But who is she? Why was she there? Did she want to go to the Sky Isles to seek a better life? Was she running from something or someone? Let's write a story together. Details in PM.*",

Dressed in fur, wielding great war axes, they had descended on the monks and killed all. The boy had been locked in chains and thrown into a cage, along with several other children from previous raids. He held a small bag, and no man could take it from him. One of the raiders had tried, but the boy had bitten off two of his fingers and swallowed them. He had eaten the fingers to make the raiders fear him, to scare them into thinking he was unnatural or demon possessed. The boy didn't want to fight, even though he could kill them all. They had killed his masters. The only friends he had ever known. He had held the high priest in his arms. \"Survive,\" the old man had said softly as he died from his wounds. In the bag, was the shadow armour the monks had crafted for the sixteen year old lad. Now, he was on his way south. To be sold in the desert lands, where the women were large of chest, and the men dark of skin. The raven haired lad looked out of the cage, his unnatural red eyes staring with longing at the rising smoke of the monastery. He whispered his master's dying words one final time, \"Survive little shadow, survive.\"",

Before we get any further I'd just like to point out that I'm looking to do a lot of worldbuilding before we get into the meat of the roleplay, I'm someone who loves talking about the universe we're creating for hours on end until we finally reach a point where I'm comfortable exploring it head-on. Also, I'm not particularly looking for any romance, although if it does happen, I'm open to any pairings from F/M to F/F. I could also play a male character if I feel like it would fit my vision better, and you could also expect other sorts of pairings as well.\n\nAs for my partner (you?) I'm only expecting a decent grasp of the language, as I can't offer perfection myself, and won't expect it from you either. It would also be preferable if you were over 18, and possibly not too scared of graphic depictions if the story has a need for them.\n\nSo to keep this short, just send me a PM and we'll add each other on Discord, and then discuss things further! \n\nThanks for reading!",

I'm interested in knowing what you'd like to see in the RP as well as what kinds of character interactions you enjoy. For example, I'm a sucker for a bit of angst mixed in with the romance. Star crossed lovers are so fun! \n\nOff the bat, yes I am looking for romance but I also enjoy lots of storytelling and character development. Adventure and fantasy are wonderful elements to incorporate! I'm open to ideas you have, here's a few of mine. \n\nAn English Lord enjoying his holiday on an ancient loch in Scotland is astonished to find a wet, naked woman walk out of the water! (Think selkies or kelpies or the Scottish tale of the water horse)\n\nThe Master of horses managing the stables of a vast English country home falls for or is pined over by someone of the household. In other words, someone high above his common rank; making their romance quite taboo. (This lends well especially to M/M so PM if interested)\n\nA battle wearied captain freshly home from war falls in love with the young nurse that assists the doctor treating him. She is also the doctor's young wife. \n\nYes clearly I will roleplay intimate moments between characters, but feel it shouldn't be the focus or aim of the exchange. I like other stuff too :)\n\nIf these or the nature of these prompts appeal to you please let me know! I'd love to hear your ideas.\n\n\u00a0Open to fantasy too. \n\nI will do Reddit or Kik or email, but please no Discord. Thanks for checking out my ad!\n",

I do like creative-ness and longer replies however a one-liner every once awhile doesn't bother me. But one very big thing for me is that I do NOT do smut. Romance is fine as well as \"fading to black\" during smut moments and picking it up afterwards. But I will NOT roleplay anything sexual. \n\n\n**Requirements?**\n\n* I would prefer if you were 18 or older\n* Again, absolutely zero smut\n* Limited one-liners. A paragraph I think is an ideal length\n* Decent grammar and spelling (I make mistakes too!)\n* Discord for communication! \n* No cannon characters please. I much prefer original characters with personal touches to them.. However I don't mind having original characters in already created worlds for ideas. \n\n\nI would really want fantasy or apocalypse based(I know super cliche, but doesn't necessarily have to be a zombie one.) I find them quite fun and can be very creative. I would much prefer brainstorming with a partner to establish the worlds and such but I do have a few more ideas in mind depending. And if you don't like these I am totally open to new ideas and different things. Fantasy and apocalypse are not set in stone for me. \n",

Of course there are rules all creatures must follow to maintain order in the human world or it could cause the end for the mythical beasts. Our characters will be two young adults, both female, that are part of this world of fantastic creatures that live hidden amongst humans. \n\nThe roleplay will follow our characters after we meet. What I\u2019m hoping is for our characters to be completely opposite of each other one is a troublemaker and rebellious while the other is a goodie two shoes, always following the rules imposed by the higher ups of the secret society. As the story progresses our characters will slowly fall in love. \n\nThat\u2019s the main idea of the roleplay but it will of course contain some other story elements such as character development, story arcs, conflict, drama, everything needed for some good storytelling.

I have been role playing for roughly ten years so I like to think I have some \" skill ' when it comes to descriptive play :P. I para as a minimal and mainly multi-para , I like descriptive and imaginative posts. So please don't message me if you intend on one lining, one lining in my opinion is pointless, I\u2019m not a grammar nazi honestly so don\u2019t worry if your not clearly up to par I don\u2019t judge ;) ( I\u2019m not great either! ). \n\nI'd like my partner to be involved in adding to the story it's much more fun if it isn't just one person leading :). And please be descriptive! Role play is all about imagination after all right?.\n\nI have indulged as many of you would probably guess in every aspect/eras and styles of role play; from fantasy/ action to adventure/sci-fi to slice of life. Nothing is of limits with me as long as it's enjoyable/fun and interesting :). I do tend to stick to mainly the modern era as i feel more comfortable with it but I'm happy to dive into other settings with the right Story line :).\n\nCharacter development and long term is preferred I like to build a good story :). Romance is something that tends to be included in all my role plays and honestly I Like it that way. Romance I find adds a real good element to any role play :) there for NSFW content will more then likely be apart of it hence the 18+.\n\nI'm really into fantasy/action/romance at the moment so happy to hear any ideas you might have :). \n\nPlease message me if your interested in starting something up with me, we can discuss and brain storm an idea together :). I typically role play on email/ google docs/. Look forward to hearing from you soon :)\n",

            "selftext": "Hello fellow Roleplayers! As of right now I am currently seeking roleplayers willing to assist in the development and establishment of a Fallout Roleplay set in a different portion of the universe. Essentially, I just grew tired of the servers that I was roleplaying on, there was no real goal, no real systems in place, and very inactive or just unaware staff. So I thought to myself, why not just make a worthwhile server that actually functions similarly to the game. So, I've decided to actually put some work into making a server. I saw that a majority servers either had the whole world open or a certain area without any real lore. Along with this, none effectively used a rolling system, and I feel as though it is possibly the most quintessential part of any Fallout game or roleplay. And this is where you as a roleplayer step in, I\u2019m in need of aid from those in the community to make a really worthwhile server that even the most inept in Fallout lore can understand. There are three courses of action that you can take. The most important at the moment is assisting in the world-building process. We need to write lore to actually captivate a crowd, and the setting itself is not an area elaborated upon within the Fallout universe. Thus, we have chosen to flesh out and be creative with this new setting we have, yet still keep it in line with the canon lore. Second, moderation and server assistance, a job that entails what the title asks for, simply assisting in moderating the server, creating events for roleplay, and making the roleplayers adhere to the rules. Third, player recruitment, this job would be much more quintessential toward the latter portion of server development or after server launch. If you feel as though you can do any of these, feel free to contact myself over Reddit to attain my Discord information and to chat about the server as a whole. Below will be a little blurb about the world altogether, thank you for reading!\n\n**Fallout: The Forgotten Star**\n\nIt was only recently that interest arose in the lands known as Texas, a region known to be both beautiful and treacherous to the common wanderer. The area as a whole is commonly referred to as the Forgotten Star of the Wasteland, a place filled with Rangers, Ghouls and even the common Wastelander. A refuge as many would refer to it, scattered and disorganized towns, a place without any sole power in control. Yet powers seek to encroach and claim this territory as theirs, from the ever so knowledge hungry Brotherhood to the heinous and treacherous Legion. Texas is home to relics of the past, once home to the creators of the infamous vaults, Vault-Tec. To Rangers that in no way affiliate themselves with the NCR, rather they choose to rebel against their rule. An archaic motto that is still chanted in times of distress is simply \u2018Come and take it\u2019. Texas is a trove to outsiders, a land that could prove vital to nearly any power that can effectively organize and stay in the land. But most importantly, Texas is a home to many: vault dwellers, soldiers from the Brotherhood of Steel, ghouls, and much more.\n\n*Contact myself over Reddit to attain my Discord contact information.*",

            "selftext": "Hi potential friends! My name is T. I\u2019m 23 years old on the East Coast and in search of an RP friend to create an adventure of a lifetime. My partner should be literate and able to write a good amount of detail and be comfortable with playing around with characters. I don\u2019t care if your F playing M or M playing F, as long as it is done accordingly and well, I will love you. But alas, we are only human, so mistakes are okay - for now. I\u2019m into suggesting smut, but not writing it. I don\u2019t like it unless it furthers the plot. Most times (if not all), it\u2019s just boring.\n\nAnyway, as for ideas I have been plotting in my head have consisted of the following:\n\n1. Steampunk pirates (more of a 1920s vibe) in the North trying to find a treasure (we can talk about what it is) and risk a war with the pirates of the South.\n2. (Based in the \u201850s) A woman, married to an abusive husband, meets someone who instantly becomes her lover. She sneaks around to see them but finds her lover in a mishap (whatever your character may want) with her unknowing husband. What do they do? Can they keep their secret? (I would love for this to be super dark, tragic end, the whole package.)\n3. Fifteen years ago, a man went missing when he walked into a bar. Suddenly, he appears washed ashore on a beach in California and claims he can\u2019t remember who he is or where he had been for the last fifteen years. He has strange markings on his chest and arms. Tribe marks? Alien language etched in his skin? What could it be?\n\nI\u2019m also very open to building our own world, and building our own plots. I\u2019m really flexible and open. PM me if ya want! :)\n\nHappy RPing, friends! ",

            "selftext": "**I am searching for a DM-based roleplay. For the unaware, this means I build the story around your character whilst playing the entire world. It's like your own text-based RPG. If you're not comfortable with that or have no intention of RP'ing that way, please move on. Thanks!**\n\nHave you ever wanted an RP with more than just a good story? More than the typical conflict, romance, and conclusion? Do you want your decisions to matter and have consequences? Then I'm the guy for you!\n\nI grew up on RPG's that punished you when you made mistakes and forced you to adapt or fail. And although I have roleplayed for half of my life and have done the typical one-on-one set-up, I have found that if I want to *just* write a story, I can open google docs and do that by myself. Instead, I would prefer to write a story specifically tailored to someone else. More importantly, I want it to be dynamic and brutal. *What does this mean*, you might ask. Well, if you have ever played the video game 'Dark Souls', I'd like to think that's a fair comparison. But essentially, I love my roleplayer to be more like an adaptive tale with real obstacles for my partner rather than anything else you might have seen.\n\nThis means that there is also a 'sense' of difficulty. I kill off *tons* of my own characters, all based on your characters actions, and will punish your character as a consequence of their own actions. We can discuss this more but I feel that a real sense of danger to your character provides a more significant emotional bond to the story that we write!\n\nI typically respond with several paragraphs and a page's worth of writing, although I can't exactly remember how many words. I respond usually a minimum of five times per day and would strongly prefer that you do as well. Obviously, I write as multiple different characters (dozens and dozens), but I also give character's more personality and relevance based on your character's actions. That aside, I would *love* it if we have a real OOC friendship as well because I think it helps with the writing, and who wants to write with a stranger anyways?\n\nI would prefer to write in a pre-existing universe but I'm totally open to discuss possible real-ish scenarios! Some universes I would like are:\n\n-Mass Effect\n-World of Warcraft\n-Fallout\n-Dishonored\n-Half-Life\n-Elder Scrolls\n-Star Wars\n-Dungeons and Dragons (Faerun)\n\nSome of the original scenarios I wouldn't mind are:\n\n-Law Enforcement\n-Organized Crime\n-Military (Modern or Futuristic)\n-Space Exploration\n-Space Opera-esque Scenario\n\nI'm always open to ideas and discussion! If any of this interests your or you'd like to chat, feel free to PM me and then we can talk on discord :) Please introduce yourself, I love to know who I'm talking to (I'll do the same, of course)!

Writing wise, I prefer third person over first and also write around 2-4 paragraphs a post. \n \nWhat am I looking for in a partner? \n- Experience, I like someone who can be literate and stick to a good cohesive plot.  \n- Someone who can be open minded to most things. ( I like to get pretty dark sometimes )\n- Someone who is 18 or older! \n- Someone with a lot of ideas to share.\n- Someone who can be active most times of the day.\n\nRoleplay wise I am into more modern based or realism. Though if we can make something interesting enough I would be open to exploring other genres. I also do fandoms but, prefer if I can be a custom character!! \n\nThe Genres I prefer are :\n- Romance\n- Supernatural \n- Modern \n- Realism \n- Fantasy\n- Medieval Fantasy  \n- Scifi\n\nThe Fandoms I\u2019m interested in are : \n- Anime ( AOT, Ancient Magus Bride, Naruto) \n- Comics ( Marvel/DC\n- Starwars\n- Scott Pilgrim vs the world\n- Percy Jackson \n\nIf anyone is interested, hit up my dms!

My name is Ari and I'm always looking for other writers that are just as dedicated as I am. I've been in a terrible drought as of late. All my words have dried and died away, but I'm here to try to water them back to life.  \n\n\n# Plots:\n\nAs of this minute, I have no specific plots in mind. However, I will let you all know right now that I'm only interested in playing female characters and if there is a romance in our plot together, I'd only be truly interested in a MxF relationship. I appreciate your understanding.  \n\n\n# Interests/Genres:\n\nThe Mortal Instruments book series\n\n19th century America/England\n\nFantasy/Supernatural (Vampires, werewolves, demons, angels, fae, etc.)\n\nSlice of Life\n\nDrama, Sci-Fi, Horror, Psychological Thriller, Mystery  \nI like dark and gritty plots with a lot of time, thought, and effort put into them.  \nNot here for smut. Romance is okay, but any NSFW things will fade to black in the RP.\n\n# What I'm searching for:\n\n**Dedication**: A steady writer who would be invested in the RP we create together.\n\n**Creativity**: Everyone gets writer's block, but I'm asking you to help me and I'll help you turn our RP into something that'll have the both of us sitting on the edge of our seats waiting for the next person to reply.\n\n**Romance:** At least a little bit. If I'm being honest here, that's really the only way I become fully invested in an RP.\n\n**Action/Adventure/Twists/Turns!:** This also goes along with creativity. I'll do my best to keep the plot entertaining and exciting, I'd like you to do the same.\n\n# What you'll receive from me:\n\nAll of what is stated above. I'm a para-roleplayer and I love giving lots of tiny details to flesh out the bigger picture. I make a solemn promise to any and all of those that I RP with to be dedicated and honest and let you guys know if anything comes up in my personal life that would force me away from the WiFi connection.  \n\n\n***Thank you--***  \n*for taking your time to read through all of this*  \n*for taking an interest in getting together with me*  \n*for contacting me.*  \n\n\nYours\\~  \n\n\nAriana",

PM me here for my Kik info or to discuss any ideas or questions you might have  \n\nA bit about the pack: I haven't recruited anyone yet so it's just me. I will be playing the alpha Male so prospects for a mate and betas will be necessary.  I'm hoping to grab players interested in a few lines of literate wolf rp. \n\nWe'll only accept natural wolves, no wings or fire powers, etc.  The pack will have values like honor and diplomacy and be LGBT friendly.  \n\nLet me know if interested, let's howl at the moon together!!! ;)",

I love effort, and really seeing that my partner is enjoying the roleplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does lead into my next point, romance! I love all sorts of romances! The cute, cuddly kind. The sort where they are always at each other's throats but make up in the end. The forbidden love sort of thing but not like Romeo and Juliet. Haha Now, this also includes sexuality and roles! I can play male or female characters. I can play the one in charge, or passive. Gay, or straight. (Although I have no experience in lesbian roleplays. None. Nada. Zip.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have sort of been hoping to do a sort of Bad boy x Good girl type pairing, because it's been a while since I've had a good one where my partner didn't go missing. Of course, this isn't all I'm open to though! There are a bunch of pairings that I do, it's just a matter of asking, and keep in mind that I will ask you the same thing! I don't make roleplays on my own. I always come up with plots together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, feel free to PM me about any ideas or pairings you enjoy! If not, you will be questioned about it over Discord. Haha. I beg that you leave your Discord tag in the PM so I will be able to send you a friend request right away if I'm interested. I really don't check Reddit enough to hold a conversation here. Haha. It's been happening more often where people don't leave their tags, and it takes a lot longer for us to start talking, because I have to wait for you to respond back with your tag, which I already asked for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny further questions or comments, leave them in the PM and I will respond either here, or on Discord. Depending on if you're still the little rascal that doesn't leave their tag so I can't send a request right away. Haha. I will talk to you then!",

Hope\u2019s Run is a brand new roleplaying server on Discord, and we are looking for writers to join in on the fun! \n\nHope\u2019s Run is a fictional town located in Utah during the frontier era of the American Wild West. Our story will take place in the late 1800s, after the American Civil War. Cowboys, Natives, robbers and bandits, newcomers and locals...characters of all backgrounds are welcome! While we stick fairly close to historical accuracy of this era as it regards to setting, weapons, people, etc., please keep in mind this is a fictional space and Hope\u2019s Run is intended to breed creativity and inclusiveness above all else.   \n\n\nWill you be a bandit on the run from the law? Or perhaps a farmer just trying to keep his family safe from one of the raiding Natives? The sky's the limit, so come join us to find your place in our new world. \n\nOur inspiration is pulled from the many movies and video games that take place in this setting. If you are a fan of Red Dead Redemption, Godless, Westworld (minus AI), True Grit, Tombstone, or just Clint Eastwood in general - come check us out!   \nSee you in Hope\u2019s Run!\n\nThanks!  \n[https://discord.gg/](https://discord.gg/) ",

Well, let\u2019s start off with the former. My name is Josh, I am currently 19 years old taking college classes to work towards a criminal justice degree. I have a very high interest in murders, serial killers, mass murderers, and everything in between. For this roleplay, I\u2019d love to have another detective as a partner to help me with the cases that should arise. If you have any further questions about my capabilities, or else, then feel free upon your first message. \n\nAs for the idea, it\u2019s fairly simple. My character at least would be a fresh detective just hired on, and is almost immediately slapped him with a case. As for that case, it could really be anything, but I\u2019m leaning more towards a thrilling, desk gripping, serial killing case that has been taken place around their city. \n\nFor this, I\u2019d greatly prefer females due to the NSFW aspects it may include, but they can be left out if need be. 18+ for the bloody, gore of murder, and so on. If you\u2019re at all interested, you can clearly tell that this idea has plenty of improvement room. Message me on here if you\u2019d like to talk more about it, and move to any of the chat mediums listed. ",

I use Kik and Discord but I'm not looking for a group roleplay \n\nAlso I do Fandom Roleplays, so anime, comic (Marvel and DC), games, books, and movies!

I am looking for a dedicated partner but it doesnt need to be long term as long as you stick around for the story to run its course.  \n\nI am looking for a partner for a stalker/suspense story that will also include forced sex at some point, so you must be okay with that, and if you are into that, even better.\n\nI want a partner that writes in 1st person and is okay RPing over reddit pms.  Please be 18+  I would also prefer someone that is available to RP during the day (US time) as that is when I am most available, so we can have a little back and forth.\n\nDue to the nature of the story, there wont be much interaction with our characters, so you must be capable of writing a solo story with your character while I write one with mine until they cross paths.\n\nIf you are interested, shoot me a pm and we can work out the details.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am a 21 year old US\nmale looking for a Roleplay partner. I am not very strict on the requirements for that partner... the only thing I ask is a passion for writing.. the response length can vary depending on where we are within our writing: \n\n1.)\u201dNow you're king of the mountain, aren't ya, but it's all garbage!\u201d- This role-play is my newest role-play idea. Loosely based off of the contents of the popular retro-anime \u201cAkira\u201d, it would follow the story of our OC\u2019s and how they meet within this Neocity. Some of the teens in the city have been deemed as danger and classified with a mental disorder but in reality they\u2019re battling with the ongoing growth of their new psychic abilities which they often use to cause trouble with the city\u2019s martial law as well as with each other. They keep their powers hidden for the most part to maintain a normal appearance ( I.E. going to highschool , parties, etc). Plot is still in development so we can make this our own!\n\n2.) \u201cTitans GO!\u201d- This role-play feeds more into my own love for the teen titans and I wanted to create a plot around the day in and day out lives of the titans... we could play our own OC(s) who have been added to the team or we could plays as some of the titans ourselves evolving their characters in whatever plot we see fit.\n\n3.)\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the Winchester\u2019s\u201d- This role-play takes place within the realm of the hit-tv show \u201cSupernatural\u201d. I am a huge fan of the show and of almost every single character brought to life on the show either as hunter or hunted... why not write our own story based off of their rules. \n\n4.) \u201cWe ain\u2019t in Kansas anymore\u201d- This idea is actually the brainchild of my recent rewatching of two staple retro anime\u2019s \u201cCowboy Bebop\u201d as well as \u201cSpace Dandy\u201d. I thought the idea of my OC exploring all of time and space with another\u2019s OC for the exploit of currency would be fun . This plot is extremely volatile and we could discuss more details of this is a tune you\u2019re tapping your feet to.\n\n5.)  \"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed \u2014 or worse, expelled.\u201d- this Roleplay idea sets place in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, we don\u2019t have to necessarily write off the canon storyline but in fact create our own plot(s) within their \u201crules\u201d with our own oc(s). \n\nI am extremely open to other ideas... these are just some I had kicking around my noggin. \n\nPM if interested!\n",

            "selftext": "**Hey my fellow RPers!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n\n* Low Fantasy\n\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n\n* Sci-Fi\n\n* Horror\n\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n\n* Warcraft\n\n* DC Universe\n\n* Marvel Universe\n\n* Assassin's Creed\n\n* Borderlands\n\n* Dishonored\n\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n\n***I got permission to use this format from a previous RPer who quit*** ",

I am looking for roleplay partners preferably between the ages of \n18-20. \n\n\n\u201cLa morte del fiore della luna\u201d\n\nStoryLine:\nYou are a new member to a military base hidden on an island that has been lost on maps held by civilians. You just graduated high school and your father strongly pushed you into this career for you would be taking his place. One day when you get home, he hands you your bags and motions you out to the turned out car sitting on the curb. You have hardly any choice but to get in. You didn\u2019t fight much since you had been going through a semi rough time, a few days before graduation your girlfriend of two years left you for a friend of yours. You are driven to a military airport and you board a plane. The windows on the plane are covered in a high amount of tint to make it difficult for anyone they are exporting to see their location. Once you land you feel groggy, you had been woken up by a jolt of the landing stabilizers. \n\nLocation:\nA very tree packed island. A large concrete building with no windows visible to the ocean side but tiny ones around back. There is immense overgrowth on the building to somewhat shield it from anyone who might possible stumble upon it unknowingly. There is a tall electric fence surrounding the building and Cameras and guards everywhere.\n\nPlease be semi/literate.\n\nThis role is not made with the intention of intercourse, my character will engage in sexual themes but not intercourse itself. My character uses her body to get what she wants.\n\nPlease hmu if you are interested in this role, or one of your own!\n\nPs. No texting talk in the roleplay, also please send atleast 2 lines per interaction.\n\nI am in central time.\n\n\nHeya there! I apologize if this post is somewhat messy, thanks again!",

            "selftext": "Greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...My Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Pokemon, Splatoon, and Legend of Zelda.  I can try other fandoms but that's a case by case thing and anything that holds ZERO similarity to what I am looking for is likely a hard no.  Some outlying ideas people have come to me with that I've been okay with being things like Dragon Ball Z, Kingdom Hearts, Skullgirls and Shantae for example.  With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",

            "selftext": "Hey there. Hope everyone is having a decent week. As always, I'm looking for more partners for some great writing. Right now I'm mostly feeling my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts if you find me and my writing style of interest. \n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation, and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, unfortunately, and kind of particular. Typos? Not a problem. Some mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. I edit for a living, though, and it's ruined me for polite society, so I'm looking for someone of like mind with dedication to the language that keeps me hooked. \n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* I use email. I don't use any instant messaging, because honestly, it's less convenient for me. I will do PM if necessary. \n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)[Before session 7, preferably.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. (Sorry to the people who think my list is \"short.\" Again, I'm looking for the things that currently interest me, because this is a hobby, not a diplomatic mission.) If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! \n\nPlease note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.",

It was a balance for you could not have one without the other. The creatures and races of the sun frolicked in the sun and the warmth it offered. The creatures and races of the moon bathed in its eerie light and how it would illuminate the darkened dwellings. Nothing can last forever. For centuries there was peace and happiness. Little by little a darkened evil started to rear its ugly head in the far reaches of the realm. Except it was not a product of darkness but rather of light that slowly gave way to an evil nature. Wanting reign over all the Kingdoms that washed over the realm. Control over all the races to manipulate in their own gain. An army was quickly rising filled with those whom were called by the darkness as well. The many Kingdom know that a threat looms but have hope the light will be strong enough to not let the sway pull enough to the wrong side. The war has yet to come but make no mistake it is coming. Whose side will you be on?\n\nThis is a medieval fantasy group rp. We are looking for the best of the best! After having been in many groups as a member and moderator I decided to create one along with my co-creator. A world of light and dark. Good and evil. Hero and villains.\n\n    **What we are looking for?**  \n    ~This rp will be played over DISCORD. As will many other rps 1x1 or group we do have guidelines that we would like met by each member looking to join. Listed below you will find them. If you are interested and can check every one of them off then this group might just be for you. We want enthusiastic members who are eager to play in a medieval fantasy realm!  \n    \n    1: Please be 18+. In this group some NSFW situations might crop up, whether it be bought of blood and gore or, other situations. We want adults to avoid any legalities. So please be 18+.  \n    \n    \n    2: Don't be a dick. If you have a problem with something go to a member of the leadership team. Don't take it upon yourself to start a fight in OOC. That right there will get you the cold hard boot out of the group. We have rules listed in the group, follow them, you will be fine. I suppose they are more guidelines, just to keep all chaos from breaking out. This is an adult aged group, act like it.   \n    \n    \n    3: This is NOT, I repeat NOT, a RAPID FIRE group. While, at times, there can be some rapid fire moments depending on members online. This will NOT happen all the time. So if you are looking to go back and forth for hours on end, this might not be the group for you. We understand people have lives, we get it, so we do not pressure our members to continuous post throughout the day.  \n    \n    \n    4: PLEASE, PLEASE if you are thinking about shooting me a message to join.... BE SERIOUS about it. We want members who are pumped to rp. Who are actually interested in joining and participating in the group. If you plan to join, sit and twiddle your thumbs and not actively try, then this is not the group for you. We have a trial period for the group and new members for this specific reason. If you have a love of medieval fantasy and want to have a looksy and are enthusiastic to be a part of it, send me a message now!   \n\nWe want this to be fun people! Rp is fun! Wooo, yay! Alright. If you stuck it out and read this far, give yourself a pat on the back because you deserve it!\n\nAll in all, we are looking to expand our group and get some active members to be part of it. Help build this rp and take it further than it has already come. We encourage our members to participate and shout out ideas for us. Enjoy what they are part of and want to see this wee little baby grow!\n\nIf this caught your eye, please PM me with any questions or concerns you have. I hope to see some of you soon and introduce you to a world of pure imagination. Take care and I am bibbity, bobbity, outta here guys!",

The character I'd like you to play is a part of the same world, but from much much earlier. He belongs to a book named The Silmarillion. It's alright if you don't know much about him. If by the end of this post you're interested, a wikipedia article will suffice to bring you up to speed.\n\nThis story is primarily a power struggle, but also a conflict between the two. She belongs to a tribe of elves he has a personal problem with (due to family reasons), but she is young and beautiful, and everything he desires in a future wife, a companion, and a friend. I want her wooed, I want her hurt, I want his passion unleashed on her with the force of a thousand horses, leaving her terrified and confused.

            "selftext": "It was near every day now that earthen roof of the tunnels shook. The main entrance to the kobold clan's den had long since been destroyed beneath the feet of the towering giants that had settled into the area, at least seven feet tall even amongst their smallest. They had been doing their best to dig them out, seeing the tiny reptiles inside as an easy workforce and even easier meal for the northern winter that was due to arrive in not but a few weeks. Their numbers had been rapidly shrinking, those that ventured out of the numerous holes and exits they had desperately made in search of more localized food and water sources away from their captors weren't likely to return, and of the dozens that had once resided in the tunnels, raising their clutches of eggs and living in peace, hardly more than twenty remained, trapped like rabbits beneath the ground.\n\nThey were barely doing more than surviving before long, able to do nothing more than drink from the trickle of mountain water that had begun to flow into their caverns from the giant's razing and eroding of the mountain for their new home. And as the first iron pickaxe managed to chip away the heavy stone of the entrance of their home, they panicked into a flash of scales and horns, fleeing into the deep forests of Elinas, unaware of just how much their enemy had taken in their absence.\n\n[Hello! I've wanted to write something like this for a while with a central focus on one of my favorite fantasy creatures, Kobolds! Those little underrated rascals are some of my favorite to play, and while this story will have a main emphasis on story, other themes are welcome to be explored. There will also be a plethora of other races to be explored in the story through our tiny, scaled companions. In any case, i'm happy to explore more of the plot I have in mind, and will be glad to answer any questions. Last but not least though, I have no problem with NSFW themes in the story, and due to the kobold's natural nature and such, I quite encourage it. If you're interested and have read this far, please don't hesitate to message me!]",

And only a few of those options make it so I can come back.\"\n\nAlia chuckled and shook her head. \"Coil...\"\n\nThe other Reploid slowly walked toward her, making her back into the wall, then put one hand on the wall over her shoulder, looking slightly down at her. \"If I make it back again, just take some time off with me. That's not too much to ask, right?\"\n\nAlia looked off to the the same side, one hand up by her chest. \"Coil, come on, don't talk like that. You know you're gonna make it back.\"\n\n\"I will if you say yes. Promise.\"\n\nShe looked up at the other Reploid again, moving her hand from her chest to the other's cheek.\n\n\"One day.\"\n\n\"I'll take it.\" She rested her free hand on top of Alia's and the two stayed in the same position for a short while before a larger Reploid came along and pulled Coil away.

            "selftext": "Greetings roleplayers of reddit, I hope this message finds you well. As you may have guessed, I\u2019m looking for people to write with. \n\nI\u2019m a fairly literate and well versed writer, but I make my mistakes, as I\u2019m also only human. I don\u2019t ask that you match my style or level, even, but that I at least am given something to work off of and more than just 3 sentences for every reply. I only do 3rd person, but I\u2019m a bit more lenient on past or present tense. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a partner who is *active.* That means at least one to two replies a day. That means if you can\u2019t meet this, it probably won\u2019t work out. I\u2019m not unrealistic, though. As stated, I\u2019m a human, and I recognize and respect you as one, too. Things happen IRL, people lose interest, I get it. Don\u2019t hesitate to let me know. The boring stuff is almost done with, promise! \n\nI RP exclusively on Discord. \n\nI prefer a standard M/F pairing, but am open to F// as well. I can play either gender, but generally prefer F. For NPC/side characters, though, I can play a whole host of genders and types. \n\nLet\u2019s talk NSFW. I\u2019m fine with it, as long as it starts and ends in character. I do prefer a more slow burn type of relationship building, though, so don\u2019t come at me with it right off the bat, please. I love romance, however. Gooey, cheesy, flirty stuff is great with me at any time in the RP!\n\nI don\u2019t really do fandoms. I prefer OC over anything. I don\u2019t mind worlds that are influenced by fandoms, but it\u2019d be cool if we could add our own twist. \n\nFor time period, I can do modern, historic or futuristic. \n\nOkay, the fun part! For me, anyway. I have quite a few genres I\u2019m interested in, here\u2019s a list;\n\n-Supernatural/horror. (Not the show, but rather vampires, werewolves, demons, etc.)\n\n-Science fiction. (Space! Lasers! Aliens!)\n\n-Fantasy. (Typically of a darker/gritty tone.) \n\n-Slice of Life. (Again, dark &amp; gritty.) \n\n-Cyberpunk. (Have I mentioned \u2018dark\u2019 and \u2018gritty\u2019 enough yet?) \n\nIm always open to hearing your ideas regarding pairings and worlds and genres and so on, too!\n\n\nAlright! I *think* that covers it all. If any of this interests you, send a PM here and we can go from there. \ud83d\ude42\n",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I\u2019m seeking a partner to roleplay an original idea that I have\u2026. Normally I\u2019m not into Original plots, but I\u2019m trying to get my creative juices flowing for a book that I\u2019m trying to write, and I feel that roleplaying helps me do that. If you want to check out any of my Fandoms, feel free to go over my other plots. \n\nI do only roleplay over Email, that\u2019s really the only platform I\u2019m comfortable with, as I don\u2019t check other platforms that often and I don\u2019t have a discord. I ask that my roleplay partner(s) be 18+. I only roleplay in Third Person and I tend to get out 2-5 paragraphs, and try to match what my partner gives. I do ask that my partner roleplay 2-5 paragraphs as well. \n\nThe idea that I have is basically a story about a former Assassin that fled her old life and went into hiding. She meets a man and the two wed and form a family with one another. Five years later, their home is attacked and she has to fight to keep her family safe, revealing that she\u2019s not all who she claimed to be. I think the roleplay itself can go numerous ways and could be interesting. I\u2019m hoping the roleplay can be one of action/romance and maybe a tad bit of Slice of Life. I do ask that someone play the husband and we can discuss side characters. We can also delve deeper into the plot once you contact me over PM. \n\nHope to hear from you\\~!",

Slice of life or another genre, I'm open to suggestions. Disability can be a plot device or merely a character trait. Feel free to PM me, anytime.\n\nJust a few potential ideas. By no means limited, just some mostly random ideas.\n\nI don't like limiting posts. Sometimes I can post  paragraphs, sometimes just a line or two, I don't expect anything more from you.\n\n1. A new neighbor is moving in. She catches your attention, even before you see her wheelchair.\n2. You've been going to the same coffee shop everyday for over a year, mostly to see the cute barista, then she is suddenly gone for several months, when she finally returns, it's easy to see why, but now you want to know her even more.\n3. You have been trying to get the attention of a girl on the train, every morning, but she seems to ignore you. Why have you never noticed the white cane before.\n4. That girl at the gym always caught your eye, not just because she was attractive, or that she was an amputee.  you recognized her from somewhere, then one night a flash back to Iraq, jogs your memory. She saved your life.\n5. Your marriage was good, or so you thought. After catching your wife in your bed with two men, you leave, only to take solace in a local bar. The bartender gives you advice that changes your life. ( This one has several options for who my character is.)\n6. I have a few ideas that are a bit too much to post here.\n7. Almost anything else. I'm always open to ideas, and by no means stuck to one. Fantasy, sci-fi, historical, post apocolyptic stories always have a place, just no ideas yet. I prefer to over IM, email, Kik, or chatzy, but am open to others like discord. Send me a message anytime if any of this interests you.",

After the Heisei era i.e. Godzilla VS Destoroyah. After each of the Millennium continuities. And I also thought it'd be cool to fiddle with\u00a0the Monsterverse too.

What happens to it depends entirely on you, because as users citizens of The Country you will have the opportunity to shape it into your perfect utopia... or dystopia.\n\nSo, what is The Country?\n\nThe basic idea of The Country is for it to work as a roleplay subreddit for an entirely fictional country. That means that every user will be a citizen of The Country and not a group of independent nations like other subreddits do.\n\nThis is just the beginning, so things can change and new ideas will be heard, but for now the main objective is to get enough users to have our first elections and maybe write our fundamental principles, our own constitution.\n\nWhat may happen in the future? Who knows! But to give you some ideas: political parties can be created, ministers can be elected for different departments, same for judges (mods), campaigns, newspapers, podcasts, our own flag and anthem, maybe a rebel group appears, etc. The possibilities are endless!\n\nAll of this doesn't mean that you aren't expected to follow reddiquette and be civil. No threats, no harassment, no asking for karma, no brigading and most importantly: **NO REAL WORLD POLITICS.**\n\nThis is **very** important. The Country is its own thing, think of it as the only place in the world, at least for now. Real world countries do not exist for The Country, it has no official borders and that means no immediate neighbors. Users are expected to behave according to this basic ideas.\n\n**If you have any questions, or new ideas or just want to say hello to your new nation you are more than welcome! Everyone has a voice in The Country.**\n\nEnjoy!",

            "selftext": "Hi there.\n\nI'm am in my late-twenties, located in California, and am looking for a one or two partners to write with on Discord. I can be pretty flexible in terms of genre, but I am looking for writers who are more experienced and are willing to be involved with plotting, brainstorming, throwing out ideas, and are honest about what they like, don't like, and where they would like the story to go. I want us to create something we can both be really into and are super excited about. \n\nHere are just some quick nuggets of what I'm looking for:\n\n* I write anywhere from 2-8 paragraphs, my starters usually being the most lengthy and shorter replies more common during a more quick-paced scenario. I expect my partner to be well past the beginning stages of writing, but certainly don't need novel-length replies every time. \n* Aforementioned enthusiasm for creating a story together.\n* A decent amount of experience writing under your belt. I'm not a super stickler, but I'd want someone at least at my level. We can trade writing sample if you'd like.\n* I prefer writing past-tense 3rd person.\n* Open to any genre that I feel I can do justice to, but I have a soft spot for modern, modern fantasy, paranormal romance, romance in general, crime, and (post) apocalypse. Open to sci-fi, high fantasy, or anything I haven't mentioned if we can work up an interesting plot. \n* Not too partial to slice-of-life stuff or too-young characters (for the type of plots I'm interested in).\n* Someone who can be pretty responsive. At least one post every one-two days would be ideal.\n* I pretty much always like romance to have a presence, so sorry if that's not really your cup of tea. But it doesn't have to be all sunshine; it can be strained, manipulative, and have a sad ending. Whatever our hearts desire.\n* Speaking of which, I'm fine with smut, but it should be organic. If you have limits, we can discuss.\n* If we start RPing and I'm not really feeling it, I'll be sure to let you know. And if you don't feel like it's your cup of tea, my feelings won't be hurt. Better to be honest than just ghosting each other, yes?\n* Would be cool if you were at least 21+, and possibly around my age or older, anything younger feels a bit too young to be writing potential adult themes themes.\n\nPlease send me a message if you are interested! I can be a little picky, but I am always civil and am always willing to clear up questions about what I'm looking for. I also have a few half-baked plots that we can kick around. ",

            "selftext": "Hello roleplay redditor! I migrated from r/roleplaykik so this is my first time posting on this subreddit so please go easy on me. I am looking for a detailed partner who is fine with writing a romantic roleplay.\n\nThe story will start off with move-in day at our college. Now we're not moving in to our college's dorms because we're not freshmen. Instead, we'll be playing as seniors in college who are moving into an off-campus apartment that's not too far from campus. The apartment is simply called the Towers because it literally is a tower. It is a 20 floor high apartment that watches over a mall right across the street from it with a tram line running in the street as well. On the highest floor, you can see our campus as well as the famous lake that our campus is known for. The apartment entrance opens up with glass doors to a grand clean lobby with a doorman at your call. There are three elevators to take you up to your floor or down to the six sub levels that serves as the garage. When you arrive into the apartment housing floors, it's just like a hotel hallway; caramel brown walls with white fluorescent lights lighting the hall with the evenly spaced out white wooden doors that lead to each apartment. However, the apartments aren't filled with just students but also families who actually live and work in the area.\n\nAs for my character, well, I moved in about a week before school starts because I wanted to avoid the traffic and dealing with other students moving in. Luckily for me, I got a studio apartment all to myself. I would describe the interior, buuuttt that's only if I allow you into my home.\n\nNow this is where you come in. You can choose to start wherever you like! If you don't have a good starter, then you can go with a simple one; such as how you're just moving in your belongings into your apartment and need some help. The more interesting your starter, the more likely I will respond.\n\nNow for partner requirements. You see that detail I put into describing the setting up there in the second paragraph? That's the kind of detail that I want. I'm not asking for paragraph replies but replies that bring life to the roleplay. I also want long-term partners, since I am mostly free during this summer! Lastly, if you have to ghost me, don't! Just tell me when and why you want to leave so it's an understandable split. \n\nI prefer to roleplay via kik. My kik is pandafan007",

All players will travel to the land of Korlia about 6 months  after the sun mysteriously stopped at dawn for 5 hours, rumors coming  out of the land state that 4 of the 6 greater Gods appeared in front of  two competing armies and reversed a bloody battle manipulated by a man  called the \"Inquisitor.\"  \nThe game is a  text based rp with stats and currency, you start at level one and gain  stats on level up, work for money, RP and fight for sweet experience.  \nMain draws:  \n**7 Stat combat:** Hp, Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Endurance, Stamina, and AP. \n\n**Dodge/Defend:**  Dodge is all or nothing, defend is 20&amp;#37; damage resistance blocking up to  75&amp;#37; on a successful defend, adds strategy to fights.  Tactical  reversals to make sure you can last longer, switch to defense if they  are targeting your low Dexterity, or switch to dodging if they are  targeting your low Endurance! \n\n**Quick start:**  Learn skills for battle, each character starts with bonus ways to get  skills per race. Start with 4 skill slots and 4 shape slots. \n\n**Rebirth system:**  If a character dies, you carry 20&amp;#37; Gold, Reputation, Exp to the next  character, with an additional 10&amp;#37; and 30&amp;#37; to two choices and the ability  to carry more with specific upgrades. \n\n**Character Dukedoms:** Players can use missions and if they meet the staffing requirements can move into a taken castle.\n\n**War Battles:** basically like above PVP with added Npcs, Allies and Enemies. \n\n**Classes and Races:** Extra customization 13 classes 5 races. The game starts with 6 unlocked and more will be unlocked as the game progresses. \n\n**Many Weapons:** Many types with upgrades and Legendary weapon missions. \n\n**Shapecrafting:** custom magic system you can use to craft spells on the fly, note this is limited to one race at the start but not by class. \n\n**Multiple Mods:**  3 main mods and a 1 mission mod for every 5 players. Mission mods have  access to Npcs to make games more interactive and deeper. \n\n**RP Rewards:**  Get rewarded for some RP actions such as If you work as a smith and a  player wants to get their weapon upgraded, the player can gain a portion  of the gold it costs to get upgraded, or work as a guard and get paid  to fight Outlaws. \n\n**Range Based Combat:** Move into melee to have an enemy bowmen scramble to get a clear shot. \n\n**Several Battle Types:** from Friendly spar to all out battle to the death in the trenches of war. \n\n**Request a mission:**  Bored and need something to do?   Ask a Mod/Mission Mod if they can  give you a quest to do, usually they will.  RP?  Battle?  Working?   There are missions that can fit every need! \n\nWill you rise to power in the lands of Korlia?

It's really simple, I want people who enjoy a good fight, I want people who have fought before, I want people who know what they are doing, as well as people who have never done this before. I want anyone interested in fighting, who get that thrill when your characters life is on the line, who's literally addicted to breaking your characters arm to win some sort of fight. \n\nWill turn into a Roleplay. But i'm looking for a mainly fighting group. Comment, Dm me, give me something that shows me you are interested. \n\nThank you. ",

            "selftext": "I have quite a few ideas bouncing around my head and all I need is a person as equally ~~crazy~~ enthusiastic as I am to share them with.\n\n\nI'm only looking to write against canon characters, mainly because a lot of my ideas are centered around putting two or more established characters that have had little to no interaction on the screen in scenarios together to explore their dynamics and have a bit of fun. \n\n\nI can and will play anyone necessary for a plotline, but the main people I'm highly inspired to write for at the moment are as follows.\n\n\n* Hela, Goddess of Death  (I've got a great idea for something with her.)\n* Jessica Jones\n* Wanda Maximoff\n* Ororo Munroe\n\n\n\nI've got plenty of ideas ranging from fully fleshed out stories to little nibblets of concepts that need work. I'd love to work out a plot together, no matter what. I won't try to boss you around. \n\n\nThere are a few things I *have* to say before the end of this though. \n\n\nThird person, literate and descriptive writers only please. I'm really into substance and I hold myself to a certain level of quality and hope my partner would too. It's not usually an issue, but if it becomes one I will say something.\n\n\nThe main way I'm looking to carry out our story is by email or by discord, mainly because I check those the most. I like plotting out a path to take before we start, so if you're at all interested in anything I've had to say send me a PM. \n\n\nThanks for reading!\n",
