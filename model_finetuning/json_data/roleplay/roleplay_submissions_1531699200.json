As started in the above title I am in a creative slump, as it were, and would appreciate a roleplay partner to get the creative juices flowing in a manner of speaking. I\u2019m 25 and specialize in modern day crime dramas but am trying to branch out into historical/the American West type settings as well as medieval style fantasy role plays but anything I do has darker and more adult themes I don\u2019t like fandom role plays but am open to them in the right circumstance. I\u2019ve been role playing for the better part of 6 years and much prefer 3rd person and literacy. If you would like to chat or bat around ideas you\u2019re more than welcome to send me a dm.

            "selftext": "Hi! My name's Volva. I'm 18 yrs old, relatively new to rp, and am really excited about this idea! I'm looking for a fairly literate male and/or male-playing partner 18+ Who finds the idea of a fast-paced, Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-like rp just as enticing as I do! I'll be playing as Captain Sheila Rondulus, aka, The Red Reefer. A notorious, brash, daring, and sharp-witted pirate who captain's The Siren's Revenge. As for your character, I'm completely open to almost whatever you want to be! Roleplay is no fun if you aren't playing a character that you yourself created, I think. So long as you tell me about your character before we start, I'm not very picky! As I mentioned in the title though, I do want to eventually incorporate some romance. Whether we eventually add nsfw elements to the story is up to you.\n\nWhen it comes to writing, I prefer to write several paragraphs at least and will ask that you do the same. I prefer lengthier responses because it gives your partner more to work with and forces you to be more detailed and descriptive. I would like this to be in first person as well, but that I'm willing to compromise on if you'd rather do third. I also would ask that we both respond at least once every two days. I myself average about twice a day or so.\n\nTo begin we'll talk about our characters, where we want to start in the story, and briefly about were we want it to go. Then, we'll begin! \n\nPlease don't ask me to use anything other than Reddit pms or email, I don't have a discord or Kik, and can't get one. \n\nThank you for your consideration! I'm looking forward to any replys I receive!\n \n\n",

I don't usually freak about this area here, just no text talk. Smut is fine, but I don't want it as priority. I want it to be meaningful to the plot itself, if you're looking for smut you messaged the wrong person haha. Now onto Plots, I can also play male as well, anyway I enjoy Midieval Times and if you want to throw fantasy in there. Or if you don't I still dig it! Not huge on basic fantasy. On this topic, Werewolves and Vampires is a interesting topic I have ideas for this one even. I enjoy Digimon, Marvel and Dc comic stories, Percy Jackson which is frankly my favorite thing to do in this list, and lastly Avatar the last Airbender. This one is very interesting at well.

            "selftext": "Hello~ \n\nI\u2019ll get this out of the way first. I\u2019m a 22 year old female writer, and I\u2019m on PST time. I am *pretty* fresh to the scene, having picked it up again in June. That said, I\u2019m still a literate and well written person. I tend to post 2-5 paragraphs per reply in my Roleplay, with some exceptions (such as fast paced dialogue or action scenes being shorter, and descriptive scenes being longer). Ideally, I\u2019d like a partner who can post at least once or twice a day, and if they can\u2019t, a partner who lets me know. I understand life gets hard or busy! I just really appreciate being kept up to date as opposed to left in the dark! I\u2019d also prefer a partner who\u2019s okay with developing a personal connection (with *limits*) ooc. I will try my hardest not to absolutely spam you with music and RP inspiration posts. &lt;3 \n\nI will require that we do quite a bit of planning before jumping in to the action. I don\u2019t require us to have the entire plot and narratives outlined, but I need at the very least some basic, loose structure to work off of. So if you\u2019re trying to just start a Roleplay without planning, this won\u2019t work out. :/\n\nI only RP with players over 18. I love NSFW side themes, including, but not limited to; drug use, violence, gore, sex, etc. I am really open minded with my Roleplay and ask that you be, too. As well as 18+. *Only* 18+ players will be considered! (For clarification, I will NOT do a NSFW sex centric plot. I prefer to keep that as a side thing, and not every other scene.) \n\nAs far as genre and time period go, I\u2019m very open on these. I love working with historic, modern and futuristic. I love sci-fi, fantasy, horror, slice of life... you want a space operatic sci-fi horror? Hell yeah! A modern, slice of life with romance and drama? Absolutely! I\u2019m versatile and enthusiastic about working with others ideas! However, I don\u2019t do fandom or cannon characters. I want to make something entirely our own. \n\nAs far as OC go, I can do male, female, and virtually any pairing. I do lean far more toward MxF or FxF, though, and generally main F characters. I\u2019m not opposed to playing multiples but do prefer to have a main. :) \n\nAs always, I am open to hearing and discussing your ideas, too! Shoot me a message if any of this interests you, and we can discuss from there! I do my roleplaying and chatting on discord! ",

            "selftext": "Hello ladies of R/roleplay, I am in search of a creative partner who wants to do a long term roleplay story. I don't currently have a specific plot in mind as I like to figure that out with a partner. Though I have a rough idea of some worlds for us to explore. I use discord and don't plan to use other methods of contact at the moment. I live in est US and would like someone close to my timezone.\n\nThe story I have in mind is heavily an adventure with possible romance and other elements as we see fit to throw in. I normally roleplay in a medieval fantasy world though if we come up with an interesting sci-fi world I wouldn't be opposed to it.\n\nMy stories often have a darker or grim world where many characters know struggle. For reference some books and things that i find to be a darker/grim world are things like Brent weeks lightbringer, Warhammer, and attack on titan. I'm not looking to do a fandom of anything but want to create an original story and world.\n\nIf your interested you can PM me, messages with more info than Hi here is my username are great. For example let me know what kind of character you may have in mind and/or whether you want medieval or sci-fi. I look forward to hearing from you all and connecting on discord to create the story.",

I am 21 and have been writing in roleplays since about 2011, with frequent breaks in between due to life, and I'm looking to get back into writing long-term!\n\nI mainly write romance. Whether or not the romance itself involves canon characters depends on you. \n\nAlso, I speak English in my roleplays (as in no text-talk, full sentences, etc.) with at least a paragraph or two per response, and I would like the same in return. More is more than fine! I try to work with what I'm given, so my response length may vary.\n\nSo, to the point you're actually looking for, the list!:\n\nAssassination Classroom\nAppleseed (the Movie)\nAria the Scarlet Ammo\nBaka and Test\nBeelzebub\nBlue Exorcist\nBoku no Hero Academia \nDeath Parade (We can make it work somehow.)\nDeadman Wonderland\nGangsta. \nThe Future Diary\nHighschool of the Dead\nKill la Kill\nNoragami\nOne Punch Man\nPrison School\nRosario + Vampire\nSoul Eater\nMonster Musume (OCs only) \n\nI know other universes of anime, but left it at this list because this is the one I'm most interested in.*\n\nThat's it for now. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please don't hesitate to PM me. It is very much possible that some things I have said may have been repetitive or confusing, and that's because I pieced this together from a bunch of old RP posts I made... er, elsewhere. \n\nI hope to talk to you soon!\n\nMention in PMs if we're going to be discussing NSFW content.**",

Dark fantasy revolves around the gritty things : thievery, crime, small villages ransacked, bandits, things like that. I enjoy the feel of that instead of a bright fantasy world, the creatures will be disgusting creatures that are completely repulsive. Just pm me your discord and I\u2019ll be sure to contact you and even if you don\u2019t quite like my idea, we can sort something out! My time zone is EST, by the way.

            "selftext": "I used to roleplay quite a bit but after a bit of life getting in the way, I was unable to for a while. I'm quite literate and descriptive, and very much enjoy fantasy style roleplays. I can do some fandoms but I also like original plots, and enjoy coming up with a bit of plot with my partner beforehand before starting. Romance is a posibility, as is NSFW content later on, but only if the story goes in that direction. I find characters need to have chemistry before that sort of thing.\n\nI suffer from social anxiety so I usually don't do group roleplays, but if two or three people at most are interested I might consider running something for that small of a group. I much prefer one on one, however. I may also occasionally disappear for a day or two; if that happens, I'm just recharging, and I will be back.\n\nFantasy traits I like are elves, dragons, typical Tolkein high fantasy sorts. I'm a LARPer, I enjoy original races, technology, communities, cities, dungeons and dragons style adventure, that sort of thing. I have a couple characters I enjoy throwing into different situations to see the outcome. If this sounds like your sort of roleplay, PM me and we can go from there.\n\nI like to use Discord as a primary form of communication, but Skype is also a possibility, as is PMs here, and email.\n\nAs a final note, fandoms I can POSSIBLY do are Harry Potter, Homestuck, various magical girl shows (I love magical girls), Uta no Prince Sama (and most reverse harem type things), various Final Fantasy titles, YuGiOh, and other various animes and shows. Throw one at me if you want to do a particular universe and I'll tell you if I'm comfortable with it. I want to make sure I know the universe before I try to roleplay within it.\n\nI live in the EST time zone, but am sometimes awake fairly late.\n\nHit me up if you wanna give any of this a shot! ",

I would like to put more in that jar...this is where you come in...-!&lt;\n\nI have been roleplaying for a very long time and started on IRC. (Dates me as a Dinosaur). I dig the complex, multi-faceted angles a character's personality can take. The more tortured your character in depth and backstory, the better. I like a level of realism in everything I do. The aim is a slow burning love story filled with twists &amp; turns, angst, love and betrayal. I want to get lost with someone in a story that we both can enjoy with equal composition.\n\n**Genres:** I love anything Ancient. Historical Drama in any sense of the word to be honest. Any Era from Egyptians on. History fascinates me. I like Middle Ages/Medieval. I love Victorian Era stuff. Dark themed stuff. Modern/Slice of Life as well as Supernatural/Horror. I honestly am into a lot of things so just IM me so we can have a parlay.\n\n**Not into animae/video games characters as face claims.**\n\n* *Weaknesses:* I am not so great at space rps. I'm also inexperienced at some types of sci-fi. I have only recently gotten into Marvel/DC types and it's been hit or miss with partners who are actually good at those characters.\n* *Strengths:* Emotionally stable writer not looking for ooc connections beyond writing.

            "selftext": "Greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...My Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Pokemon, Splatoon, and Legend of Zelda.  I can try other fandoms but that's a case by case thing and anything that holds ZERO similarity to what I am looking for is likely a hard no.  Some outlying ideas people have come to me with that I've been okay with being things like Dragon Ball Z, Kingdom Hearts, Skullgirls and Shantae for example.  With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",

            "selftext": "My name is Valentine. I'm male and 20 and I quite enjoy playing around with anime ideas I like. Particularly at the moment is Dragon Ball yet I have some more I quite enjoy if asked, including but not limited to Hunter X Hunter, the Fate/ series, Naruto, My Hero Acadamia, Infinite Stratos, Gantz, and Overlord, with ideas in mind for most. Onto the one in the title.\n\nI have three major ideas, the first being quite simple and based on Xenoverse. The idea being that we both use OC's and our characters have been paired as Time Patroller partners, the reasoning for which can be varied. My idea originally is that one of us is a veteran and the other a new Time Patroller being trained, or we could both be rather strong, or both new or something entirely different with any added elements we want.\n\nThe second is more complex, where one of our OC's, for one reason or another, have been forced into the main plot of Dragon Ball at some point. This can be for a variety of reasons, but my idea is mostly avoiding too many outside characters aside from one of our own and playing around with the main group and where things would go differently from their arrival.\n\nThe third and final idea is my personal favorite. An alternate version of the events of the Goku Black arc being one where Zamasu was sent back in time when he wished to have Goku's body. Altering the timeline from the beginning of the original Dragon Ball, Goku is replaced by Goku Black as a child, altering the timeline from the beginning. Depending on where we start, we could have this go a multitude of ways, depending on how long we thing Goku Black would remain evil before becoming good. The possibilities with this idea abound and I would love a creative and intelligent partner to complete any of these ideas.\n\nPlease message me privately to discuss ideas. Thank you very much for reading and I look forward for the responses I may receive. If you would kindly name your favorite anime character in your first message, I would appreciate it.\nI have a kik and a discord with no preference between either.",

Maybe you have something you have been wanting to try and we can give it a shot?\n\nI post 3rd person Para posting, pretty decent grammar and what not most of the time but not at all a grammar nazi. I do not want a partner that post single lines but I also am not going to get upset about occasional short post. I normally play modern/ slice of life/ action/drama type plots but as I said I am open to pretty much whatever.\n\nThanks for reading, PM me on here I use Discord, or Kik, If we do rp and you want to stop please don't ghost just say something, I won't get upset.

            "selftext": "## Realm of Angarak\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n## What is Angarak?\n\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more! \u00a0\n\n## What makes it unique?\n\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n## What are the 'requirements'?\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to! \u00a0\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it!

I\u2019m free to roleplay on kik and if you drop your username I would definitely  get back to you. \n\nSo I\u2019m pretty much just looking for a roleplay partner who is chill. I have a couple scenarios in mind and super willing to compromise or meet in the middle but ultimately I\u2019m looking for some smut, romance, and drama. We\u2019d be a couple or friends and we\u2019d eventually date and play scenes as a normal couple would like I said incorporating high and lows, drama, smut and all the things that I normal couple would experience. We could be celebs or we could not which ever your into. Hopefully I can find someone :) \n\nRemember: drop your kik users \ud83d\udd25",

Or well, I was. \n\nIn a great and terrible war, the forces of good and evil clashed in a suitably climatic manner. The sky boiled with fire and shafts of heavenly light razed the forces of chaos below, mountains were sundered and kingdoms destroyed. \n\nSuitably climactic for say, the final book of a high fantasy series. \n\nYears have passed since then, and the world knows an unending season of wealth, plenty and peace. \n\nYou, the hero of legend, find yourself meandering an old book shop, until you catch a fateful gaze at the man behind the counter. \n\nIt turns out that the Lord of Darkness, was not quite as dead as you've been led to believe. \n\n(Nice little concept for a short term RP, I'm prepared to go on for longer depending if there's actually interest for it. \n\nRomance isn't out of the question, but I'm more a fan of snarky back and forth as my bread and butter\n\nI'd ask you be over 20 too, just for the sake of no accidental 14 year olds \ud83d\ude02) \n\nPm me if interested- I use Kik and Discord too if that's helps things along.

            "selftext": "&gt;#Prologue\n\nIt is the 370th year since Aegon\u2019s conquest. \n\nThe Long Night and the War for the Dawn interrupted the scramble for the throne of Westeros that began with the death of Robert Baratheon. The victory of the living over the dead came at a great cost and forced an armistice that satisfied no one.\n\n[Westeros remains divided](https://imgur.com/a/T1QtA3v) between two men who claim the title of King of the Andals, the Rhonyar, and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. In the east, the descendents of Aegon VI Targaryen and Shireen Baratheon sit upon the Iron Throne. In the west, the descendents of Tommen I Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell rule from the Golden Throne in Casterly Rock. With winter once again giving way to spring, the growing sentiment in both Royal Courts is that this state of affairs cannot endure indefinitely. \n\n*Two kings is too many.*\n\n&gt;#\n\n###What We Are\n[***A Roleplay of Ice and Fire***](https://www.reddit.com/r/arpoiaf/) is a roleplaying forum based here on Reddit, where users come together to write and collaborate in a shared world and their actions and decisions affect the people around them. It takes place after the events in the books have concluded, though in an alternate universe where the kingdom is split between kings Tommen I Baratheon and Aegon VI Targaryen following the War of Five Kings.\n\n###How the Roleplay Works\nThis is a reddit based RP - so all of the actual roleplay is done on /r/ARPOIAF. Basically, once you have your character approved and ready to go, you begin by posting to the sub - you write and describe what your character is doing, or going through, or thinking. Some people have storylines outlined before hand, and work toward some end goal. Others take in events around them, and develop their characters more organically. There is no right nor wrong way to go about it.\n\nThe key to any roleplay is interaction. Your character will be affected by the decisions and choices of other characters, especially those nearby. You can interact with these people by commenting on their posts (often called threads) and beginning a conversation. They will then reply, and so on, and so on. Its usually best to arrange such interactions OOC - use our [Discord chatroom](https://discord.gg/6UmrpB2) to get to know your fellow roleplayers.\n\nA big issue many new players have is grasping how the timeline works. Because this is a forum-style roleplay, and not everyone can be on all the time, our timeline works in a very fluid fashion. You're allowed to have more than one thread open, where your character is interacting with more than one person at a time. At this time there is no direct IC time - OOC time conversion. (More on how time works can be found below, in the TIme, Travel, and Distance section.)\n\nGetting the hang of reddit RP can take some time, but with the help of the ARPOIAF community, it won't be as hard as you think. All of Westeros and Essos is open to you - you, as your character, can interact with it however you see fit. Craft your character's story in a way that is meaningful to you - and watch as it meshes and builds upon the tales of those around you.\n\n###Creating a Character\nCreating characters on ARPOIAF is a simple two-step process, but before you begin you must first have a character in mind. Westeros, Essos, and the lands beyond are home to a wide cast of races, cultures, and civilizations, the vast majority of which are open for your choosing. You should, however, choose a character that you\u2019re interested in writing, and won\u2019t abandon. \n\nIf the house your character is from has not been established by another player in the RP, you\u2019re free to flesh out its family members. If a house you wish to play in has already been claimed, feel free to contact the player who established it, and talk to them about picking up a member. Most players are more than happy to share a house \u2013 but if they refuse, you must pick a different one. Though we do our best to make sure there are plenty of family members for new players to pick up, there are, of course, a limited number of members in each family. Late additions to Great Houses will not be accepted.\n\n###Character Skills, Abilities, or Traits\nARPOIAF is a \u2018roleplay\u2019 (RP) rather than a 'roleplaying game' (RPG); that means your character\u2019s traits ought to come out through your writing, not a list of skills. It's advised that you don\u2019t create a character based around a skillset, but rather choose skills that fit the character you wish to create. There is no skills-sheet here, but writers must make note of any advanced skills or exceptional characteristics their character may possess on their application for approval. \n\nAbilities involving magic are approved at moderator discretion for players who have already proven themselves mature and responsible writers - this includes the possession of special creatures.\n\n###Applications\nOnce you have your character in mind, you\u2019re ready to move on to the character creation process. Completing the application is a fairly simple procedure, meant to be thorough and detailed without being overwhelming. It asks for the most basic aspects of the character you have in mind (their name, house, titles. age, appearance, etc.), but also requires an outline of your character\u2019s history, family, and household, and which gets you to make decisions on just who your character is. A successful application needs two moderators' approvals. \n\nTwo characters may be applied for when a writer initally joins the roleplay. All others must wait until these characters are adequately established.\n\n###Alts\nAlternate characters, or Alts, are characters that are played by a person who already has one or more previously established characters. In ARPOIAF you are allowed to make as many as you wish dependent on your activity level, whether or not you have dropped any characters, and at the discretion of the mods.  No two alts may be of the same house, and we encourage you to branch out, trying your hand at different regions, personalities, and walks of life.\n\n###Jumping In\nOnce your application has been approved by two moderators, you\u2019re ready to begin! How you do that is entirely up to you. It's often a good idea to get a general grasp of what has been going on in your region \u2013 this can be achieved by visiting our State of the Realm page, or by hopping on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6UmrpB2) to talk with our incredibly helpful community. Once you have your bearings, the world is yours to explore. Go on an adventure, try your hand at court intrigue, or attempt to expand on the glory of your house. How you roleplay is up to you.\n\n###Time, Travel, and Distance\nBecause ARPOIAF is a roleplay, not an RPG, the focus is on the story, not \u201cwinning\u201d. Things like travel and distance and time \u2013 while important \u2013 are also fairly malleable. There is no direct correlation between IC time and OOC time, nor is there a hard and fast rule on how long you should wait between posts when traveling. Most often such decisions are left to the discretion of the player, though of course the mods will step in if they feel action needs to be taken. A good way to keep things aligned is to remember that you cannot \u2018win\u2019 a roleplay. Attempting to move too quickly in an effort to defeat your opponents, or skipping over long stretches of time or distance to gain an advantage, are both examples of metagaming, and are frowned upon. Do your best to keep your timeline in line with other players. Communication with the rest of the community and the mod team is a fantastic way of doing this.\n\nThe moderators will keep a watchful eye out for time-bubbles and will help to facilitate moving past them, making decisions for absent writers if the need arises. The moderators will also keep players abreast of when a new moon is due to arrive, so that everyone can attempt to stay on the same page/timeline.\n\n###Wealth and Conquests\nTo continue on with the theme of \u2018there is no winning an RP\u2019, wealth and conquests are two features that are often too strongly focused upon by new players. No one is saying you cannot be rich, or conquer plenty of lands \u2013 but the story is the focus here, not artificial gains. While the overarching fortunes of your family can absolutely affect how you RP, the gritty details are usually unimportant.\n\nConquests are similar. If you mean to take up a title in Essos, or Westeros, and immediately begin to conquer the world, you\u2019ll find your process slow going. Wars are not fought nor won in a day. They take time to build up, prepare for, and execute. While major shifts in borders are possible, expected, and even hoped for, try to avoid creating a character just to wage war on others. We cannot stress enough that the focus should be on your story \u2013 not victory.\n\n###Battles\nThere are two ways for battles to be decided. The first way is for the participants to settle upon an outcome between them. If both parties agree on how the events occur, they can write out the battle as they see fit, and post it on the subreddit.\n\nIf the combatants cannot agree, however, a Narrator-run battle will take place. This is facilitated by the Narrator, and will be an interactive battle post in which success and damage rolls are made that will produce a binding and final decision.  Players may lose their characters in such a battle, or suffer wounds or capture.\n\n\n###Where You Fit In\nEach story and character is unique. Every player that joins ARPOIAF brings something to the table that wasn\u2019t there before, and is a valued and appreciated member of a story we all work together to create. Whether you wish to play as a king or beggar, merchant or mercenary, your tale will contribute to the lore of ARPOIAF, giving it depth, purpose, and hopefully giving your fellow RPers an even more fleshed out world to expand upon. What you choose to do with your time here is up to you \u2013 but every story, no matter its size or scope, is welcome.",

I\u2019ve posted a few different times the last few days but I\u2019m having a hard time finding a consistent partner for a Game of Thrones roleplay so why not give it one more shot. \n\nI am a 22 year old female seeking a male or someone who would be willing to play a male. I am experienced with roleplay and while I don\u2019t expect a novel every post, I do want someone literate who can post a good paragraph or two. \n\nI usually use Discord or Kik. I am pretty good about replying but I understand that life gets pretty busy. If you won\u2019t be able to respond for a long time I prefer you let me know though. \n\nI have only read three of the books so I mostly prefer we use the show. Sorry if that\u2019s a deal breaker. \n\nI have a big of a plot in mind but I want to build one with my partner instead of have rules to follow. Characters I like to play are \n\nMargery, Daenerys, Sansa, Arya. I also have two OC characters I wouldn\u2019t mind trying out. I can tell you about those if you message me. I\u2019m also open to any other suggestions for characters you have. \n\nHope to hear from some of you! ",

I've written for that particular fandom for some time now and feel pretty comfortable with it. I'm open to just about any era, but would prefer something taking place within the time span of the films.\n\nUsing established or original characters can be discussed. I'm pretty open to either avenue. For instance, I think a Reylo narrative could be pretty good. Or something during The Clone Wars. I'd want to do this in 3rd person and with someone who could dedicate at least a couple paragraphs per post. I'm not by any means a grammar nazi, but you should be able to have a basic grasp of the language-- no posts filled with errors or posts that are not readable. \n\nWhen it comes to NSFW stuff, I'm cool with it as long as it makes sense within the context of the story. I don't want to force it, rather have things come naturally in the narrative.\n\nThe best means of communication for me are Reddit PM and email. If you think you would be interested, please send me a message. I'd love to hear from you.",

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n- I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\n- Real Life Romance\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- Sci-Fi\n\n- Mecha\n\n- Halo\n\n- Elder Scrolls\n\n- Destiny\n\n- Superhero\n\n- Apocalypse\n\n\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

            "selftext": "Your slightly cooky grandfather is always going on about past lives and ancestral memory, but it's mostly nonsense as far as you've been able to tell.\n\nGrowing up with a hard life, you always had a lot of anger. Sometimes it was a blessing, acting as the fuel for the furnace of achievement, carrying you through difficult times, and giving you courage when courage was needed.\n\nOther times it was a curse, making you lash out against people you care about, clouding your judgement when clarity was needed, and making people afraid of you. \n\nEven so, you've managed to do alright for yourself so far. But that's all about to change, for better or for worse.\n\nWalking home one night, a large man pulls a knife on you and forces you into an ally, where several other armed and dangerous thugs are waiting.\n\nThe moment the first one takes a swing, you just black out. A little while later, however, you come back to your senses. The bodies of the thugs lay scattered around, blood stains and wounds all over their bodies, and...are those bite marks? You are wounded in a few places as well, but no pain or discomfort seems to be coming from them.\n\nThen, as soon as you manage to take in the scene around you, everything changes with the next blink of your eyes.\n\nYou're standing in a misty field, with the same wounds as before, but wearing different clothes. You look like some sort of medieval re-enactor, being clad in a simple tunic and pants. In your hands is a large two handed axe, of the sort you used to see Vikings weilding in history textbooks.\n\nAround you are hacked up bodies of other people who are dressed similarly to you, but much more armored, with helmets and chainmail coats and shields.\n\nNearby are about ten or eleven other people much like yourself, sitting or laying down in the grass and seemingly either resting or cleaning their weapons. \n\n\"Well fought, you do the Allfather proud\" says the nearest one. \"Looks like I owe you a drink after all\". You realize he's speaking in a very strange language you've never heard before, but you can understand him without any problem.\n\n\"Are you alright? You don't look well, even for one of us after the spirits go away\". Says another in the same strange language, as a look of concern for you spreads among the rest of them.\n\nWhat will you do now?\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nHello everyone! This is a quick and dirty prompt I thought up, and is actually the summary of the beginning of a short story I'm writing.\n\nI would really appreciate someone who's like to do this plot with me and help me get the creative juices flowing so I can actually write a good short story. It would also be exceedingly good if you have some knowledge of history and/or mythology, but those aren't required by any means, everyone who finds the plot interesting is welcome aboard.\n\nSo if you'd like to try it out, feel free to hit me up in DMs with any questions. Hope to hear from you soon!",

Soon enough they will find out that certain parts of the galaxy had been taken over by a powerful and strong emperor.

            "selftext": "Hello! \n\nI\u2019m back at you again with a dark prompt! Hopefully you don\u2019t mind vampires, nor the up and coming New Orleans of the 1700s. \n\nPm me your rp response to this prompt and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I am able! \n\nI lol forward to your replies!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhen colonizing the colony of New Orleans in the even newer land that the French has began to settle into. It was rocky at first, the convicts of France sent, then nuns for the lack of females, and soon the ladies of the night followed. It took a while for everything to be settled, the middle and upper class soon made their way over seas to the land where, hopefully, they would be able to settle down. \n\nThough the city seemed to be a promised land for many, it had its fair share of dark secrets. While the leaders of the French colony were in search of occupants (female to be exact), the French government sent over girls who were prime marrying age, 11-15, who had been stuck in lost children\u2019s homes. When they arrived, however, their appearance shocked even those above deck.\nThe girls were pale, their gum bleeding from disease. Often their blood would drip down onto their white dresses, ones that were to be used as the one they were married in. The most stunning thing though was that these poor girls were made to carry their own coffin behind them. \nNow, many say that wasn\u2019t their coffin, but the coffin of their blood sucking shipmates. In one last effort France had sent along the vampires and other horrific creatures. For one they could rid the city of the... less than savory population it seemed like a wonderful idea. Once there the monsters were given land to build on and hopefully they would find a mate and create even larger population.\n\nClara was not one of the vampires that came on the boat. No, she had been turned into one by them. Now, in New Orleans, it is said that once you have been fed upon seven times, you are destined to become a vampire. This is what happened to the young, affiliate woman. She was widowed, her husband having died of *ahem* uncertain circumstances and now ran her own land. Though it was getting rather lonely living in that big house all by her lonesome, so started her search for a new husband.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! Mari here, hope you\u2019re all having a nice day/night wherever you are! Recently one of my closest friends went through both Life is Strange games, and I had to guide her through them. It was a fun time, especially when I started to fall in love with all of the cute girls in the game again. Anyways I figured I should do a RP to get it out of my system, which brings me here. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a detailed fun partner (at least one paragraph per response) who is willing to play any of the female characters in either of the games (the first and Before the Storm) in a longterm story that features both mystery and romance! We can either follow the original game\u2019s story, or come up with a brand new adventure! I\u2019m comfortable with any pairing, I have a preference to play either Chloe, Max, or Rachel.\n\nI should mention that I would like for the story to have dark undertones, and there definitely will be some NSFW bits like drugs, death, and smut. Of course the entire story won\u2019t be all dreadful, so don\u2019t be too deterred to message me. Anyways if you guys are interested please message and tell me on a scale of 1-10 how good of a protagonist Max is!\n",

            "selftext": "Greetings,\n\nI have been taking a break from roleplaying and have decided to get back into it again. At the moment I am currently entertaining one roleplay on the side but am looking to tackle on one or two more. Hopefully, I can find someone here that can collaborate a good story with - preferably long term.\n\nI have been writing for ten years, maybe more. I am not the best writer in the world but I feel as if I am not the worst. I am very detailed and can write as much as I feel inspired, meaning, the more inspired I feel the more I can generate in a post. \n\nI prefer plots that turn to the dark side of things. Anything dark and twisted - that\u2019s mg jam. I prefer to have mature elements in a roleplay which is why I request my partners are 18+. \n\nAs of right now, a craving I am leaving towards is:\n\nFormer Parient (F) x Psychiatrist (M)\n\nI have a plot for this which I can elaborate upon via Discord. This roleplay would have paranormal themes, disturbing content, and would most definitely be a horror genre. It centers around a past patient that claimed to see the paranormal and the once man that was assigned to her treatment. The Psychiatrist has stumbled into a chain of events which causes him to believe his patient might have been telling the truth while she was under his care. \n\nIf this doesn\u2019t sound like something that interests you - that is okay! I am open to formulating something else. You can shoot me a message and we can conjure something up of our own. \n\nLook forward to speaking with you!",

            "selftext": "Hi all, I'm Alex 23 from Zurich in Switzerland nice to meet you and thanks for reading my prompt. There'll be some context details and information about what kind of roleplay I'm looking for below, but first the story.\n\n\n---\n\n\nAfter all the billions spent on space exploration and monitoring, no one had seen them coming. Their gigantic ships, the size of whole cities, just appeared one day in the space surrounding the planet.\n\n\nThe initial excitement by the scientific community and wider people alike soon turned to uncertainty and fear, when all attempts to make contact with the first alien life that humanity had encountered failed miserably.\n\n\nSoon enough however, the intentions of this highly advanced alien race became all too clear. When their drop ships descended and the war began, it was obvious that they saw man as nothing but primitive wildlife.\n\n\nThe great and powerful countries and alliances fell in one day, not even the nuclear weapons stockpiled for decades seeming to make as much as a scratch on the alien forces.\n\n\nEarth and its inhabitants were quickly subjugated. As the whole of humanity was dreading what fate awaited them, getting used to their new position, no longer at the apex of life on earth, the new lords of the land began extracting resources.\n\n\nSoon enough, as quickly as they had arrived, the alien race disappeared again. Their ships vanishing as instantly as they had appeared only a few weeks before. They left behind a battered and confused people, who could only speculate that they had encountered a migratory race, who travelled from planet to planet in order to sustain their need for resources.\n\n\nNo one would ever know however that the aliens had taken more than that when they left. In all the chaos, disappearances had been all too common, so there was nothing unusual about a man and woman having vanished along with the gigantic space ships.\n\n\nThe extraterrestrial visitors had in fact chosen a male and female human at random, to add to their zoo, comprised of species they had subjugated in their millennia long conquest of the galaxy.\n\n\nTo sustain their exhibits, they performed complex procedures, replacing much of the degradable organic matter with synthetic equivalents, rendering the subject essentially unable to age or contract diseases.\n\n\nThe keepers of the collection were careful to maintain the outward appearance of their charges, before placing them in semi-holographic environments designed to mimic the conditions of the planet they had been taken from. And there they stayed, possibly for all eternity, as the ships that contained them continued their endless crusade through space.\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhen we wake up, we will find ourselves captives in this zoo of fallen species. We don't know each other of course, having been chosen more or less at random.\n\n\nOur enclosure is pleasant enough, appearing as a tropical island with a luxurious bungalow by the beach. Whatever food and drink we crave seems to appear in the fridges an pantry. There is a vast library and collections of music and entertainment. Truly our captivity would not be so awful, if it wasn't for the complete isolation, our only company being a complete stranger and the subtle but unnerving feeling that something about our bodies has changed...\n\n\n---\n\n\nFirst of all, if you've made it this far, well done and thanks for taking the time to read through the prompt!\n\n\nSo, I am looking for a partner for this romantic, sci-fi long-term roleplay. I highly value detail, literacy and high quality prose. My ideal partner would enjoy world and character building with me, as I find it makes for a much more engaging story. Thus, beyond a basic backdrop, I haven't filled in many details about the characters or world.\n\n\nIf you find the idea presented above interesting, maybe even inspiring, have questions, suggestions, comments or (constructive) criticism, please get in touch.\n\n\nInitially I'd welcome messages on here, but once I've heard from you, I'll happily chat, develop and roleplay on either Discord, Google Docs or via email.\n\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you\n\nLove Alex\n\n\nPS: As usual, the other posts on my account are also always open. Should you find one of them particularly inspiring, we can always discuss it and maybe get something based on that one going.",

Before anything else, I will ask that my partner be 18+ for potential NSFW scenes. \n\nThe themes I'm interested in are medieval fantasy (elves, rogues, princesses, etc), historical (Victorian, ww2, the 20s, pioneer), and I'm even open to something a little slice of life (high school, college, small town), and I do enjoy adult themes/dark themes/or even just gooey romance bullshit.\n\nI will most definitely roleplay F4F and F4M, I do have a job but I will try to give 1-2 posts per day if possible! DM me if you're interested, let me know you're discord in a DM if you'd rather carry it over to there for some plotting!  \n\n\nRandom pairings/themes that interest me (not required, just some starter ideas, these can be **any gender!)**\n\nWoodland elf/Hunter\n\nPrincess/Knight\n\nQueen/Knight (affair situation)\n\nHerb solitary woods witch/Woodland elf\n\nWW2 nurse/nurse\n\nWW2 era affair\n\nVictorian maid/lord or lady of the house\n\nPioneer setting (think Laura Ingalls Wilder with a dash of... adult)\n\nCheerleader/young early 20s Coach\n\nI'm inspired by; Elder Scrolls/Skyrim, Fallout, LOTR, Gilmore Girls, Overwatch, Sailor Moon, Disney... Jack of all trades.\n\nSo, don't be shy, throw me some ideas or we can go off random pairings!\n\nThanks! :)",

Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs\n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

Here is the basis of what I'm going for, I would really like a partner that can develop the pirate character and help me progress the plot.\n\nA cartographer treasure seeking pirate or sailor is swept overboard in a storm or battle at sea. A mermaid that had been watching from below the waves sees him sinking and manages to tow him to an island. \n\nThe mermaid has a way of temporarily giving herself legs and does so, greeting him as he regains consciousness. Though she speaks a language he cannot identify, he soon realizes the gravity of his situation: he is marooned on a strange island with a stranger woman.\n\nEventually the language barrier will be overcome, but until then some hi-jinx are sure to follow as they work together on the island. \n\nThere are many different ways we could go with this. Start a treasure hunt/monster hunt, run from a paranormal threat chasing them throughout the island, etc. Maybe she has violated a major taboo in her culture by helping him. Etc etc etc.\n\nIf this appeals to you please let me know! I would love to rp this. Please be over 21 and open minded :) ",

But crime manages to pay. Mankind\u2019s gangsters have run the street for years, ignorant of the Transylvanian Council operating in the shadows. A group made up of Italian, Jewish and British vampires, they\u2019ve had a stronghold in the underworld for generations. But a change is a-coming. The traditional gang is dying, giving way to new groups\u2014the Irish and their bikers, African immigrants, as well as werebeasts looking to stake a claim. As this goes on, mankind struggles to keep their spot, hunting for anyone not quite human, even resorting to war-crazed Vietnam veterans hired to hunt the menace. The lines are being drawn. Where does your blood lie? This is an old-school gangster play centered around the full moon. You can play as any family, gang, clan or tribe. There\u2019s a few options to choose from, and this will be an intensely historical piece.\n\nBERLIN\u2014Rio de Janeiro/Hong Kong, 1984: In the waning years of the Cold War, when tensions were highest, two entities were locked in a battle for control. Not the United States or the USSR, not even capitalists or communists. Intrepid is a well-known intelligence group, famous for their sponsorships of artists in the 1960s and the creation of the Alex Banks series of films. Stylish and sexy, Intrepid not only glamorized the life of the spy, but also legitimized the company as a private parallel to the CIA and MI-6. On the other end of the spectrum is UMBRA. The Unilateral Mission-Based Reconnaissance Agency hires only former military and handles the darkest of black ops assignments. No one really knows if this group even exists, but rumors have made them out to be the most brutally efficient team on the planet. Despite their differences, there is one massive similarity. They each work for the highest bidder, no questions asked, no morals in the way. The job must be completed. Pick a side; wars are fought by soldiers, but finished by spies. \n\nACID REIGN\u2014the former United States of America: 2XXX-In the old ways, humans, dwarves, elves, orcs and the like lived together. Not quite in harmony, but no planet belonged to any one group. During the Crusades, the Catholic Church accused the scientists of other groups to be demons, and these other groups were either exterminated or forced to flee. They sailed the stars before settling on the other heavenly bodies: Orcs on Mercury, Elves on Venus,  Dwarves on Mars. For millennia, they were myths and legends\u2014alien. But finally, humans have discovered how to meet again. There\u2019s still tension however. This is a universe where nuclear weapons were not used, meaning culture wasn\u2019t obliterated. There\u2019s a bit of supernatural on higher levels, but it\u2019s not necessary. We can make stories about the criminal underworld, blue-collar lower class trying to survive, a middle-class dreamer, the upper-class technocrats, even galactic explorers. Any story you want to tell, no matter how small or big in scope. I see this being a mature anthology, closer to Cowboy Bebop or Ghost In The Shell than Star Wars or Star Trek. ",

I\u2019m talking adventure, magic, overbearing evil, and lots of different places to go and people to meet. \n\nI don\u2019t really have a world or a plot built but that\u2019s where you come in! I love discussing and building with my partners and consider that to be just as fun as actually writing.  \n\nAll I ask is that you be over 18, have a want to write and create with me, and communicate if something isn\u2019t working or if you can no longer be a part of the story.  \n\nI mostly use Discord but can probably be swayed into google docs for the right person/story. I look forward to hearing from you! ",

We are simply trying to make a \"What if\" scenario regarding the following factions within the Fallout Universe:\n\n.New California Republic\n\nScorpions Gang\n\nEnclave\n\n&amp;\n\nDesert Rangers (Not to be confused with Wastelands Desert Rangers)\n\n.\n\nThe technological aspect of the RP follows a working RPG system, using the infamous Fallout S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system to determine what kind of advantage your character may have in any situation. If you S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is above 5, you get an additional 5 RB per level. If it is below 5, you get -5 RB per level, with each player being granted the ability to give him or herself 15 points to spend on upgrading their S.P.E.C.I.A.L.(45 points in total)\n\n.\n\nAs for Factions, players are permitted to create their own faction with administrative approval. This is just to keep things organized, however, things such as Uprisings against the controller of (x) town may occur under the condition they're fully confident they can overthrow the controlling faction.\n\n.\n\nFallout: Peace Valley 2280 is a Roleplaying Server on the Discord Platform, meant mainly for TextRP audiences which answers the question, \"What if the Enclave Remnant in the Mojave &amp; other areas regrouped and reformed the Enclave?\"\n\nThe RP follows a town along the Border between Oregon &amp; California. The town is built alongside a minor secondary highway, which brings in lots of trade. The town was originally founded by a group of traders from the Boneyard who were looking to settle down and create a new life. Prior to their arrival, the town was occupied by Super Mutants, and a Raider Gang, which proved troublesome to remove. However, once removed, the traders settled down in the town with limited resources, proving that self dependence wouldn't be a long-term option. While searching for someone willing to assist, one of the traders encountered an NCR patrol that saved them from a Raider ambush. After discussing the situation of the area, as well as stating the lacking of resistance in Northern California, the NCR agree'd to assist the town under the condition that they paid a larger portion of taxes, and that trade was redirected to areas like The Hub, Shady Sands, and The Boneyard. Unfortunately, by the mid 2270's the Enclave had managed to make major reforms within the Remnant Population, and somehow managed to take full control over Orlando, and portions of Northern Nevada, specifically New Reno &amp; area. By the 2280's, the town had become under siege by the Enclave, with the NCR being forced into retreat towards a nearby village. Now, it is up to you to rewrite the future of Peace Valley. Will you help the Enclave strengthen their control over the region? Or will you rise up and free your village from the Enclave?\n\nOnly **YOU** can rewrite the fate of Peace Valley.\n\nJoin with a discord account using this link:\n\n[https://discord.gg/nXwTP42](https://discord.gg/nXwTP42)",

Rather than the wish-granting benevolent beauties that are often times portrayed, what if they were living war machines? Only awakened when it's time to determine who is to hold the throne as the ruler of the genies. In order to do that each genie must find a master in order use their life force to power their own strength. In return their wishes are granted and upon victory, if the master still lives, they are given the opportunity to rule along side the victor. \n\nYou'd be playing the genie in this scenario! Frustrated that your master seems to have no interest in fighting, let alone ruling.

            "selftext": "I'm hoping to find someone who's literate in the actual sense- able to read relatively well and write coherently. I'm capable of multiple paragraph posts, as my pretty much inactive Tumblr blogs will display, but lately I'm more about quality of plot than quantity of words. I've been using a sort of hybrid of script and paragraph styles with my friends lately, as we simply start writing the first fun ideas that pop into our heads and see where they take us, focusing more on advancing the plot than weaving epic tales. To be honest, we're pathetic memelords 'til the end.\n\nI really want to make some more casual friends, as I actually met my BFF from this subreddit and we can't leave each other alone! If you're interested in lots of crossover RPs, using fandom OCs, some canon characters, and a few totally original content, send me a message and we can compare notes!\n\nMy main fandom at the moment is Team Fortress 2, of which I'm willing to educate anyone, but my aforementioned mysterious friend has also really gotten me interested in the original Sherlock Holmes series, plus I'm casually working on an original alien race... and before anyone brings it up, I don't know how I feel about Overwatch. I've had some good times and bad times... mostly bad, and I've sworn to never play the game for as long as I live. I sort of want a crossover RP, but there's that nice, solid rock that drops into my stomach every time I hear it mentioned.\n\n...Rambling aside, hmu if you might be interested in just gushing about our respective characters for a while before coming up with a plot. I'll give my info in PMs.",

With that in mind, I\u2019m looking for a Longterm buddy who\u2019d want to come up with some spooky stories and play them out together! \n\nI want these to be pretty gorey and visceral, along with some romance and smut on the side for moments of calm and peace. I would also like to have a group of characters, so partners who can play more than one character at a time would be awesome! Please DM me with your favorite horror movie and a little bit about yourself!",

            "selftext": "Hello~ \n\nI\u2019ll get this out of the way first. I\u2019m a female writer, and I\u2019m on PST time. I am *pretty* fresh to the scene, having picked it up again in June. That said, I\u2019m still a literate and well written person. I tend to post 2-5 paragraphs per reply in my Roleplay, with some exceptions (such as fast paced dialogue or action scenes being shorter, and descriptive scenes being longer). Ideally, I\u2019d like a partner who can post at least once or twice a day, and if they can\u2019t, a partner who lets me know. I understand life gets hard or busy! I just really appreciate being kept up to date as opposed to left in the dark! I\u2019d also prefer a partner who\u2019s okay with developing a personal connection (with *limits*) ooc. I will try my hardest not to absolutely spam you with music and RP inspiration posts. &lt;3 \n\nI highly prefer to do quite a bit of planning before jumping in to the action. I don\u2019t require us to have the entire plot and narratives outlined, but I need at the very least some basic, loose structure to work off of. So if you\u2019re trying to just start a Roleplay without planning, this won\u2019t work out. :/\n\nI only RP with players over 18. I love NSFW themes, including, but not limited to; drug use, violence, gore, sex, etc. I am really open minded with my Roleplay and ask that you be, too. As well as 18+. *Only* 18+ players will be considered! \n\nAs far as genre and time period go, I\u2019m very open on these. I love working with historic, modern and futuristic. I love sci-fi, fantasy, horror, slice of life... you want a space operatic sci-fi horror? Hell yeah! A modern, slice of life with romance and drama? Absolutely! I\u2019m versatile and enthusiastic about working with others ideas! However, I don\u2019t do fandom or cannon characters. I want to make something entirely our own. \n\nAs far as OC go, I can do male, female, and virtually any pairing. I do lean far more toward MxF or FxF, though. \n\nI\u2019m always open to hearing and discussing your ideas, too! Shoot me a message if any of this interests you, and we can discuss from there! I do my roleplaying and chatting on discord! ",

            "selftext": "I'm a big fan of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. I love it to death and I can tell get enough of the creative and original ideas for the Stands, characters, motivations etc... It's all just great. I'm also an avid roleplayer who has a habit of creating OC's for my favorite fandoms. Generally these two don't mix, but today I've decided to put them into a blender and present to you a smoothie titled 'JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Paint it Black'.\n\nSet in late 1960s to early 1970s, we get to experience one of my favorite time periods, the Vietnam War. The Tet Offensive has occurred, so the anti-vietnam war sentiments are either beginning to spark up across America. We follow the story of a few of my OCs, Jackson Staubton \u300e[DOG NIGHTMARE](https://youtu.be/m5teIOUNUKA)\u300fand Maria Voltan\u300e[INERTIATIC ESP](https://youtu.be/vzRFlXbq-cY)\u300f. To give some context, Maria Voltan is a member of the SpeedWagon Foundation who's had her Stand for awhile; Jackson Staubton got his while in Vietnam a few weeks prior to now. As a result, Maria has been forced to take him as a student.\n\nThat's all I wish to spoil, because the rest of this idea is up in the air. I want to come up with a plot *together,* something that we can tweak and change until we are both mutually happy with the outcome. \n\nWhat will happen entirely depend on what you are willing to go for, are you interested in playing one of my OC's? Someone entirely different? More than one character? Will the plot revolve around a romance around our characters? A rivalry? A friendship? \n\nCome one come all! Don't be shy, I'm always open to chat on many different platforms. Shoot me an envelope and we'll get something going!",

            "selftext": "*Gotta get back, back to the past - You know who I'm talking about.*\n\nHello! To be honest, I've been pretty dead when it comes to roleplay because of some personal stuff going on in my life right now, and I took myself a hiatus for a few to digest what's going on, but there's this craving that has been itching me for a good time - so I'm going to make an exception for myself, just in case someone might be interested in this. This is gonna be a shot in the dark since I don't think too many people in the forum (or the roleplay world) are interested in this fandom? But I really want to do a Samurai Jack roleplay.\n\nYes, I am in fact talking about of the childhood cartoon (at least for so many of us) that made an epic comeback last year. I re-watched the show, I watched Season 5, and oops, I re-found my old crush on the samurai - what now? I'm really craving to ship Jack with my OC for this fandom. So if you're willing to indulge a fan(girl), please, keep on reading.\n\nThe rules from this roleplay request are 100% copy-pasted from another roleplay request of mine in another site (slightly edited - deleted a few because they felt a bit off in this roleplay request), sorry, but in case you don't know who I am, let me introduce myself very briefly: I go by Xii on the internet, and I am a 21-year-old roleplayer from Chile, located in wonderful South America! I have 8-9 years of experience roleplaying, and when I'm not roleplaying, I am studying to enter medical school. I'm also very into Lolita fashion, and I'm studying Japanese on my free time, as well!\n\nAlright, having this part tackled, let's go to the rules.\n\n* **Grammar and Spelling:** I understand that oftenly we can make some \u2018typos\u2019, or that in various cases, English is not a main language for some, and it can be a huge struggle to us sometimes. Don't worry, I won't make a fuzz over a mistake you may have not seen, but all I ask is at least to apply basic spelling and grammar rules in the roleplay, like capitalization or punctuation. I'll assume that if you're a native speaker, you know how to type and write properly. Now, as not a native speaker myself, I request from you that you have a bit of patience with me when it comes for spelling, grammar and ortography things. I promise I write the best I can from my knowledge in the language, and I also proof-read and spell-check all my writings before sending them, but still, grammar horrors (yes, I said that right) might happen from once in a while. Be warned!  \nAs in for other things; Text talk? **NO**, thank you. I won't take you seriously if you roleplay (Or generally type) in text speech or shorten any words. I also won't roleplay with people that \u03b1\u03c1\u03c1\u2113\u0447 \u03c9\u03b1\u0447 \u0442\u03c3\u03c3 \u043c\u03c5c\u043d s\u0447\u043c\u0432\u03c3\u2113s when writing. It looks pretty, I agree, but it\u2019s not the proper way of writing when it\u2019s meant to roleplay.  \n\n* **Format:** I am a **Literate**, **Multi-para/Para** roleplayer who writes in **third-person**, **past tense**. That being said, I'm also looking **ONLY** for Literate roleplayers that are capable to roleplay in Paragraph form. I'm not really picky about length, I can easily adapt myself to whatever my partner is comfortable writing - but please, **NO one-liners**. My roleplays tend to be long of length (3+ long paragraphs average, but also able to get to novella length and format), but this is just because really love writing a lot. Please don't feel pressured to match my length if you can't do that. It's alright.  \n\n* **Doubling:** As I've said, I'm looking for someone that is willing to roleplay as **Jack** for a female OC (Original Character) of mine - I'm afraid I won't be willing to change my love interest choice, so, my apologies beforehand. I wanna make it clear that **I DOUBLE TO MY PARTNER\u2019S REQUEST** \\- This means that I'll be happy to roleplay any character you'd like for any OC you may have. Although this is not mandatory, this is something I very much like to do because, come on; it\u2019s only fair to return the favor to someone that has agreed to play one of my favorite characters. Now, if you don't have a love interest within this fandom (because let's be honest, there aren't too much recurrent characters on it) but you still want to receive your part of the deal, I'll be happy to return the action by **roleplaying as any character from any fandom**** that I have knowledge of**. Just pipe up.  \nBut again, this is not mandatory. If you just want to be a generous soul and roleplay as Jack for me without expecting anything in return, you can do that too. Bless your soul.  \n\n* **Adult themes and Limits:** To comply with the rules of this subreddit, these will be discussed through PM's upon discussion of the roleplay's plot and other stuff. That being said, **I WON'T DO ADULT-THEMED ROLEPLAYS OR ROLEPLAY SMUT WITH PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 18.** Underage partners are more than welcome, but if that's the case, I'm not doing any R-rated content with you, and our roleplay will have to be 100% clean. This is for my and your safety. I hope you understand.  \n\n* **Again, where do you roleplay?:** I fear I'm only available to roleplay through **Discord** for now. If you're I have no problem in doing OOC talk through Discord and doing the roleplay on a place like Google Docs, but if none of these are your preferred ways to roleplay, I'm very sorry.   \nFor any reasons want to stop roleplaying? Don't be afraid to tell me. It will hurt a little to see you part away, but I won't be angry with you, or ask you for any explaining if you don't want to. I will completely understand. I swear.  \n\n* **I have a life, too:** Please, be aware that I\u2019m not a person that instantly replies, or that is in the computer 24/7. Just like you (I assume), I have a life outside the internet: I study, I go out with my friends and family, and as well, I can get lazy, and I procrastinate a lot too ~~(Like, a real lot. Seriously).~~ And right now I have even less free time in my hands because I'm currently studying to take exams to enter college.  \nSo, all I request you to do is: **Be patient.** I will immediately cut off with you if you start bugging me by spamming the chat or ask me about our RP every 15 minutes. If you haven\u2019t received something for me in a period of 7 days (a week) or more, feel free to ask me how things are going. But please, be aware that I will answer ASAP. I will notify you regularly about my current status on the writing process, and tell you when I'll be (or not) available to roleplay, so you can have an idea about how much time do I have in my hands at the moment. If I have to take a hiatus from roleplaying, whether it is short or long, I'll let you know of it, too.  \n\n* **Have fun!:** The most important rule (although not exactly one) of them all: Have fun! After all, that's why we are roleplaying, right? Also, I would like to mention: I really, really, really like to talk and communicate with my roleplay partners while we are roleplaying. So don't be shy if you want to start a conversation! It will actually make me feel really happy. One of the reasons why I roleplay is because I love meeting new people and making new friends! \u2665\n\n\\---------------------\n\nI know the chance to get someone who might be interested in doing this with me is very slim, but if you happen to be that person, please don't hesitate to contact me by sending me a message or leaving a comment here!\n\nThanks for stopping by and reading! Even if you're not interested in this roleplay request in particular I really appreciate it from your part!\n\nSee ya'! \u2665\n\n\\- Xii",

Spoilers ahead if anyone is interested in the game but hasn't beaten it yet.\n\n\n\nSo in short Danganronpa is about a group of young adults who are accepted into the the prestigious hopes peak academy, each with their own \"Super High School Level\" talent but when they arrive they are trapped in the school and forced to participate in a mutual killing game by a mysterious master mind, and to escape the school they must commit a murder and get away with it.\n\nAt the end of the game it is revealed that the mastermind is Junko Enoshima, the Super High School Level despair and that she destroyed the world and forced the characters to participate in the killing game all for her obsession with despair. \n\nWhat I'm looking for is someone to role play as Junko Enoshima and I would play as myself, I don't mind time, place or canonicity of the situation. I just need a roleplay where for whatever reason Junko is obsessed with me and decides to have me one way or another, it can be pregame, post game, during, in another universe altogether, you get the point by now. This can be sexual but does not need to be.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this sexual I'm very open Kink wise, this can be consensual non-consensual, Junko can even be a futa if you would like, I have only a few limits like toilet stuff and snuff. I know it's a very specific wish but I'm looking and hoping there is someone out there who can help me out",

            "selftext": "So as you all might be aware Summer has bestowed itself upon us. College is coming to an end and that means I have more free time to mess around and improve my writing a little bit. Along the way I also want to meet some like minded people that maybe someday I can call friend or at the very least good acquaintance. This is really important to me, while I love to write talking with my writing partners is just as important.\n\nAnyway movie past that, I am a very lovely individual with a very vibrant and most of the times humorous personality. We will need to talk to see if we click but I click with most people as long as you are not some asshole and can take some jokes and teasing.\n\nI would love to talk to both female and males I don't mind so don't be afraid message me. For my writing I do love details, so if you like to do short replies I am sad to say we might not be compatible, but nothing is off table. If you like still contact me and if nothing we can be good talking buddies and just share ideas.\n\nI am not opposed to fandoms or new world. I can play canon characters but prefer OCs. I like to write third past tense but again this is not set in stone. I match my partner's writing length but generally 2 - 5 paragraphs. I am on most days and would like for you to be too even for a little bit just to chat. But I do understand people have lives, I do to and I will let you know when my plan changes or I can't do something.\n\nAlso I love to talk through ideas and problems. If there is something not working for you talk to me, I don't bite. Just don't vanish, that is a really shitty thing to do especially after there is some connection.\n\nI won't bore you all too much so I will leave it there. I do want this to take place over Discord so if you wish send me your usernames and I will add you on there. I love forward to all of your messages and will answer all of them (or try to).\n\n~Love Amy",

I'm willing to play either Erik or Christine, or even an OC, BUT---there are conditions:  \n\n\nIf you come to me wanting to play Christine or a female OC (because I only do MxF romantic pairings), she cannot be the typical doe-eyed, shy little dancer that everyone seems to want to play her as. I want to see a certain amount of strength and intelligence. I'm bored of the way these stores usually pan out.  \n\n\nSome other things to note:  \n\\- I aim for 2-5 paragraphs per response. Please do the same.  \n\\- I try to reply once per day, but tend to get busy during the week. Please be patient.  \n\\- I want this to be collaborative. Please come to me willing to help plot.  \n\\- Just to reiterate--MxF pairings only.  \n\\- I feel like this ad is coming across a little aggressive. I'm really a friendly person and would like to be able to chat OOC with you!  \n\n\nSome ideas for pairings:  \nErik x Christine  \nErik x OC Dancer  \nErik x OC Dance Instructor  \nErik x OC Manager  \nErik x OC Patroness  \n\n\nWe could also attempt something more modern.

I can definitely control any Canon character you want to be with your OC, as long as you do the same for me. I have not really watched anything past the main series, but it doesn\u2019t even have to follow the story of the main series either. We can be creative with this!\n\nI typically do 3rd person, quick responses. I may send more text in the beginning, but it\u2019ll probably thin out.

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters.  I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi** and **Cyberpunk RP** in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars, Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. I am not looking for group games or communities, nor am I looking for system games.",

A crowd of murmurs and discussions began to fill the air,  as it was finally lunch for the majority of the student body. Gwen Stacy passed out of her social studies class, with text book in hand and her slightly worn out book-bag hanging off her shoulders over a baggy white hoodie. The blond kept a calm look over her lips, as she met the large crowd within the hall, and aiming her path towards the cafeteria of *Midtown High: School of Science and Technology.*  \n\nIt wasn't too long ago, that sixteen year old student's life changed forever. A field trip lead to a rather painful bite from a modified spider, and Gwen's life was never the same. New abilities formed in her, and she took cue from a role-model of hers, and decided to be come a self-proclaimed hero! No on e really knew, except her best friend Peter Parker. \n\n\"Yo!\" \n\nThe blond playfully let out, taking a set on the metal bench of her regular lunch table. The cafeteria filled, as voices from all around flooded the air. She smiled though, and looked over to the brunette who sat across from her; who offered a spiked brow, as he pulled out a small brown-bagged lunch. \n\n\"What?\" Gwen rose a brow back in return, as she dug into her own bag, tugging a plastic bag out and setting it before the two. \n\nPeter sighed, shaking his chin. \"Are you really going to make me ask?\" The blond across from him kept her brow up, as shook a small bottle of power-aid. \"How was it fighting with the Avengers?!\" \n\n(Hey, thanks for reading!  This is inspired both by the Spider-Gwen comics, and Spider-Man:Homecoming. Think more as Spider-Gwen:Homecoming; incorporating aspects from both. Gwen as the web-heroine, Peter as the Ned like friend. We can decide smaller details, like who Gwen teamed up with in Civil War and so on!  \n\nIf interested, feel free to send a message!))",

If you have any other ideas of worlds/timeframes that you want to have our RP take place in, please let me know!\n\nThe Characters we would play would most likely be OCs of sorts that fit in the universe.

I dont bite!\n\n**ONLY LOOKING FOR 18+**\n\nWe would be doing this via Reddit PMing or Discord so I can't wait to see some red envalopes in my mailbox today and I hope we can write great RP together!\n\nThanks for Reading!\n\n-Chris",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful day/night wherever you are! So I wanted to preface this post by saying I actually don\u2019t like most of the movies that have come out as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I feel that they\u2019re rushing these big comic storylines out and not letting them build up properly (felt like Age of Ultron had this problem the worst). \n\nWith that in mind, I always find myself thinking about ways or things that Marvel/Disney should push and add into the universe that would keep me interested in the long run. That whole Fox buyout got me thinking about how cool a proper Dark Avengers or AvX movie would be. \n\nThose ideas seem far fetched (and a bit too D A R K for the House of Mouse) to make into movies currently so my daydreaming takes me to the logical next step, putting other heroes and villains that they have the licensing for into the MCU. Spider-Gwen in particular was one thing I was never too into, but ended up falling in love with her over time. \n\nWith all of that said and done, it\u2019s time to talk about the actual RP prompt in question. I would love a dedicated and detailed partner that would share my interest in writing an AU of the MCU where Spider-Gwen is a major character alongside the rest of the heroes. Ideally this would be post Civil War, but we can definitely place our story during CW if we can come up with something cool!\n\nMaybe Captain America seeks help after Thanos\u2019s victory at the end of Infinity War, leading him to discover there\u2019s someone else who has spidey powers? Perhaps after the universe is restored (by time shenanigans most likely haha) Peter goes back to school and tries to readjust to life, only to meet the cute new girl who\u2019s part of a band? Maybe Peter faces off against Gwen in Germany as she\u2019s recruited by Hawkeye or something? These are just a few ideas, but if you have your own I\u2019m all ears. \n\nDepending on the plot we take, there would be a focus  on a central story or maybe a slice-of-life styled adventure, both having a healthy dose of action and spectacle like the movies. I would definitely like romance involved in the story, with smut happening after there\u2019s build up in the relationship between our characters. As for character preference, I\u2019m generally all ears to any one of the heroes currently active in the MCU. I personally have a thing for good ol\u2019 Captain America, but I won\u2019t say no if you want to play Peter or Widow or anyone else for that matter. \n\nNothing else to say, other than for detailed I like at least a paragraph per response, and that I have summer class in the morning (dat college grind tho) so hopefully our schedules won\u2019t clash too much. I\u2019m located in US West Coast is that should give you a good idea on the hours I\u2019m active, which is usually all day after 2 PM. Anyways if you guys are interested please hit me up with your favorite MCU movie and why! Before you ask my favorite is Winter Soldier hehe~ :p",

            "selftext": "*The young woman stood on the dock, looking out over the great sea. A slight wind pushed past her, swaying her long, curly, auburn locks of hair around her shoulders. She wore a simple white robe, a golden tiara in resemblance of an olive branch sat atop her head. Her honey colored eyes lingered on the horizons for a few moments more before she tore them away, looking up to the sky now. Audible to no mortal being, she cursed up at the sky. Cursed the Gods and the Goddesses that sat there as her world fell into turmoil, as every one she had ever known as family, friend and lover lie dead in the earth. She swore one day that they would regret sitting by idly as the mortals tore each other apart, one by one. She swore that she would be the one to deliver vengeance upon them. Her, and the help of another, from a far off land, with the same vendetta, though she was not yet aware she wouldn\u2019t be making this journey alone.*\n\n\nHello~ \n\nI\u2019ll get this out of the way first. I\u2019m a 22 year old female writer, and I\u2019m on PST time. I am *pretty* fresh to the scene, having picked it up again in June. That said, I\u2019m still a literate and well written person. I tend to post 2-5 paragraphs per reply in my Roleplay, with some exceptions (such as fast paced dialogue or action scenes being shorter, and descriptive scenes being longer). Ideally, I\u2019d like a partner who can post at least once or twice a day, and if they can\u2019t, a partner who lets me know. I understand life gets hard or busy! I just really appreciate being kept up to date as opposed to left in the dark! I\u2019d also prefer a partner who\u2019s okay with developing a personal connection (with *limits*) ooc. I will try my hardest not to absolutely spam you with music and RP inspiration posts. &lt;3 \n\nI will require that we do quite a bit of planning before jumping in to the action. I don\u2019t require us to have the entire plot and narratives outlined, but I need at the very least some basic, loose structure to work off of. So if you\u2019re trying to just start a Roleplay without planning, this won\u2019t work out. :/\n\nI only RP with players over 18. I love NSFW side themes, including, but not limited to; drug use, violence, gore, sex, etc. I am really open minded with my Roleplay and ask that you be, too. As well as 18+. *Only* 18+ players will be considered! (For clarification, I will NOT do a NSFW sex centric plot. I prefer to keep that as a side thing, and not every other scene.) \n\nAs you can see, I\u2019ve posted a short, vague prompt above. I\u2019m looking to do a story that\u2019s a seafaring adventure of two normal humans who try their hand at seeking vengeance on idle Gods/Goddesses. Along the way, they encounter mythical and magical creatures, lands, artifacts, etc. Alliances will be formed, enemies will be made, and it will be a battle of pride, wrath, temptation, the unforgiving sea, the powerful deities, and so much more. I don\u2019t do fandom or cannon characters. I want to make something entirely our own. \n\nAs far as OC go, I can do male, female, creature, deity, and virtually any pairing. I do lean far more toward MxF or FxF pairings, though, and generally main F characters. I\u2019m not opposed to playing multiples, but do prefer to have a main. :) \n\nAs always, I am open to hearing and discussing your ideas, too, but this is something quite specific I\u2019m wanting to do.Shoot me a message if any of this interests you, and we can discuss from there! I do my roleplaying and chatting on discord! ",

It's [http://michigohq.tumblr.com/](http://michigohq.tumblr.com/). The RP is centered around the Michi-Go resort town on the outskirt of Seoul, South Korea, and explores the shady things that go down. There's plenty of more mature themes, so if you are underage or uncomfortable with that, this roleplay isn't for you. However, if that seems like something you're interested in, come join us! We heavily encourage applying with POC faceclaims, and we do have a lot of FCs from the Korean entertainment industry, but you can apply with absolutely anyone that you want! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me here or on the main. \n\nAlso: Admins, I posted this a couple minutes ago, but deleted it because I kinda...forgot to post a title on it. Please forgive me, I'm not trying to circumvent the '7 day posting' rule, I just made a little mistake ; A ;",

            "selftext": "Looking for a longterm roleplay partner who enjoys Fallout and would like to roleplay in its universe.\n\nHere are my scenarios:\n\n1) New Vegas has been quiet and actually in good hands after the New California Republic defeated Caesar\u2019s Legion. As humanity thrived, the NCR began to spread its influence as they expanded. Years of success and expansion helped colonization and influence. The year is now 2310 and the NCR has combined with numerous groups. The Brotherhood of Steel have put their differences aside and joined. The Boomers and other small New Vegas factions have supported the NCR. The NCR now has a new enemy - The Blood Army. This army is incredibly strong. They reside in the Texas Commonwealth in an area of very strong influence. They utilize prewar technology and even create their own based off prewar origins. Their influence is the entire Southwest, Gulf, and parts of the Great Plains Commonwealths. \n\nJay West (my character) is an NCR soldier of the Tiger Company, 121st Battalion. He\u2019s quite a respectable soldier. He\u2019s a staff sergeant and leads his own squad, the Delta Squad. Jay\u2019s squad got the nickname the Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks are quick and lethal, taking no disrespect.\n\nSergeant West has been tasked with taking settlements under Blood Army control. West and his right hand man/woman (your character) have taken over a decent amount of settlements and even made their own with the help of other NCR squads. Things began to look good for the NCR in their fight with the Blood Army. That would soon change.\n\nOn June 6, 2311, the Blood Army launched a huge attack on the NCR and began the new war named the Great Commonwealth War.\n\nAs the war raged on, the Alamo was the holy grail of the war. Whoever held the Alamo had control over most trade routes and passage from settlements. As the war began to turn in the Blood Army\u2019s favor, West\u2019s squad was tasked to aid the mission to take the settlements again and take back the Alamo.\n\n2) The Minutemen have successfully wiped out the Institute as well as the Brotherhood of Steel. Synths were slowly but finally accepted by society and lived with humans in harmony.\n\nAs life went on, a government was finally put in place in the Boston Commonwealth. The first president, Henry Samuels, was a very great president and showed amazing similarities between himself and George Washington. As time went on, the Boston Government lost it\u2019s original democracy and was turned into a tyranny by Alexander Quick. He was terribly corrupt, exposed for working with Gunners and discrimination against synths.\n\nA rebellion was forming. The new rebel group was named the Sentinels, their objective to overthrow the Boston Government and restore the voices to the citizens. A rebel leader, Christopher Jacobs (my character), is planning on an assassination soon.\n\n3) Derek King (my character) , or \u201cKingslayer\u201d, is a raider in the Boston Commonwealth who is in charge of taking kidnapping people and forcing them to work. He learns of New Vegas and sets out on a job to take over settlements in the Mojave and set up new raider towns. His right hand (you), helps in this job. However, the NCR seems to be a huge obstacle. \n\n***\n\nI\u2019m open to your plots, tweaks to my plots, or anything you\u2019d like to change. ",

It would use the V3 Characters, and I\u2019d prefer if you would GM, but I could. Viruses have also rapidly evolved, with disease all over the world at a cataclysmic rate. Some of the viruses would actually infect certain characters, and some would be akin to viruses like the T-Virus for example, a mutative zombie virus. Both dead and alive characters would return, and killing games are common in the wastelands, but none like The Bear\u2019s. The Bear is this universes version of Monokuma, which is taller, and more intimidating looking. Small remnants of the past life of earth remain as husks of what they once were. Your goal is to find out, if you died in Monokuma\u2019s killing game, to find out why you are alive and for both, why you are here.\n\nPreset 1: Start with 2 characters in the Starting Group\n\nChoose two characters to start with in a group. \n\nPreset 2: Choose 3 or 4 characters\nChoose 3 or four characters to start with in a group.\n\nPreset 3: Uso Dayo!/It\u2019s A Lie!\n\nPlay only as Kokichi.

Your goal is the same as the others, but with another one that will be revealed later. \n\nPreset 4: Itsuki Oma\n\nItsuki Oma is the descendant of this Universe\u2019s Kokichi Oma. In this Universe, Kokichi successfully won the Killing Game and is much different than his predecessor. He is a hero.
