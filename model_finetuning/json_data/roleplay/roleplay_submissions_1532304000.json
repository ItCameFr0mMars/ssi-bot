            "selftext": "Hello /r/roleplay. I haven't seem to have found a suitable partner yet, so here's another go at it. I hope I cover everything here, but feel free to DM me with questions if you need clarification. I would like to include a brief initial disclaimer that I am looking for a rather specific set of attributes in my potential partner, and I know myself. I would be much happier and most dedicated to someone who I feel matches what I am looking for rather half-ass RP with someone I'm not that suitable with. In that sense, I am going to be rather selective and picky about who I write with, and will most likely ask for a writing sample.\n\n**A snapshot of myself.**\n\nI'm in my late twenties, and have RPed on and off for over a decade. I am most comfortable writing with people around my age or older, especially in the case that NSFW themes come up (which I expect them to at some point). I'm in PST time zone, so similar would be good, although my availability is pretty open so as long as we can get in at least one reply a day on average that would be ideal. I'm not looking for a slow moving, one post per week situation. I also enjoy chatting OOC if I have time and if we get along. If you feel like we are not suitable after chatting, feel like to jump ship; just let me know at any point if you're not feeling it. \n\n**The writing.**\n\nI like to write FxM pairings, with me playing as the female lead. NPCs are fair game of course, and if present, I would like us both to take control of NPCs. 3rd person only. I usually write anywhere from 200-800 words, depending on mood and situation. Starter posts are entirely different from action or dialogue-heavy posts. I expect something similar in length and/or quality from you, although I ask that first and foremost that no matter how much you write and how descriptive you get that you help move the plot forward. \n\nIf we plan on writing a whole story from beginning to end (which is ideal), there will be lulls and exposition, some of which we can skip if you'd like, but sometimes it makes sense to write it out for the sake of character development and flavor. When it comes to plotting, I also expect my partner to pitch ideas, make mine better, and brainstorm with me. I hate hand holding, and I'm not about to waste time on half-assed ideas that only has enough meat to barely carry us over an opening or smut scene. \n\nBut above all, I want us to write something that we're both excited and passionate about.\n\n**Genres and settings.**\n\nI have a soft spot for modern and futuristic settings. Even better if spliced with fantasy elements. I'm fairly open, so long as the plot is interesting. (I don't do much medieval fantasy though.) I'm a sucker for a good story and dark themes, including but not limited to betrayal, clashing characters, power struggles, the apocalypse, plot twists, crime, and the supernatural. So really, anything from modern day crime/noir with non-human races, cyberpunk, modern supernatural (vampires, werewolves, etc.), alternate worlds, post-apocalyptic scenarios. Despite the fact that I like there to be a romantic element present, it doesn't have to be completely amicable. In fact, I prefer it to be not too slice-of-life-y. It can be strained, purely physical, manipulative, what have you. No \"love at first sight\" stuff, that's just silly.\n\n**Contact me.**\n\nIf you've read that wall of text and think we could make a good pairing, feel free to send me a PM. But please know that I do not tend to respond to low-effort PMs that simply state \"I'm interested\" or \"We sound like a good fit\". That doesn't give me a lot to work with and is indicative of a rather passive partner. Tell me about yourself, what/how you like to write, what you're looking for, any ideas you might have, any specific requirements you have. Bonus points if you throw me a writing sample my way. I do have a few plots myself that I can share once we get the ball rolling. I only play on Discord as well.",

            "selftext": "I am looking for a partner in a post apocalyptic roleplay in an alternate aftermath of the Cold War. The world of which ended on September 23rd, 1983. This is a world I created with original lore, characters and other things. Though I won't hand it all to you on a silver platter. You'll have to piece them together yourself from what you gather in the roleplay ie, what people say and tell you or what your told by my OC. I have a few standards here as well.\n\n-Please be literate and have a good post length, not asking for a book but at least a paragraph or two would be nice. Oneliners will be blocked. \n\n-This is a pretty realistic RP, of course some thing were changed for creative freedom, such as the somewhat exaggerated effects of nuclear winter, and some other things, although no direct supernatural phenomenon. This is the real world in the sense that the physics, and laws are the same.\n\n-This is infact 42 years after the world ended in 1983, so while it is 2025, the technology present for the most part is still mostly what was around in the 1980s. Another note, is that the RP itself is 20-21 or so years after a series of substantial events in the desert that changed it, for the worse, and possibly some for the better. What these events were you may be filled in depending if it is information a survivor such as your OC would know depending who they are. Some will also be filled in with OC's backround \n\n-It take place in the archipelago of the Hawaiian islands, specifically the island of Oahu, however other islands may be explored as well.\n\n-Please be realistic how your character is geared. Or at least practical. You can have some 'classy' weapons but you shouldn't really be leaking ammunition for them. No mary sues, but that kind of goes without saying I suppose.\n\n-As for people with female OCs, I don't really agree to it being romance right off the bat, I like to let the roleplay play out and see how their relationship evolves to feel more naturally paced.\n\nIf you'd like to roleplay, message me on discord and I'll give some background on the war and stuff, just let me know you came about this and I'll tell you my discord. There I'll send you the docx file of my OC, you can show me your OC if it fits for the world this RP is in. Otherwise you can make one for it, if so take a the time you need. After this we can discuss the context of our characters meeting, and the further context for them travelling together and what their goal is,. Hope your interested! ^^",

Sorry!\n\nHi, I'm a male from California and I've been writing as a hobby for about 10 years now. Eventually I would like to publish my own work and make a career out of what I do, but I'm having trouble finding the inspiration to make something amazing. So, instead, I'm looking for someone to help me keep developing my writing skills and let me write out a lively world for their character!\n\nAs I said in my title, I'm looking for something Star Wars related (although if you're into Mass Effect, I could be persuaded to that). I'm a DM, so I would prefer that you're interested in that sort of thing. I write at least several hundred words per response and I reply at least three to eight times per day, depending on how busy I am and how much OOC conversation we have. Yes, OOC conversation is a must! You don't have to be friends with me if you don't want but it's difficult to write with a stranger. I don't ask that you reply as much as me but if you can't come near that consistency, I would ask you to move on. \n\nAs for the plot: I don't have one. However, I will NOT be writing in any pre-existing Star Wars Era. I've written in both The Old Republic and Clone Wars eras so much that I can't bear to write in them again. So, I would like to write our own unique saga taking place either before The Clone Wars (and after the Revan/SWTOR era) or long after the events involving the First Order. \n\nIf you've ever played a Star Wars or Bioware RPG, I would like to essentially create that for you but in the form of writing! Drama, Romance, Action, and Violence. That being said, I am open to NSFW themes but we would need to discuss them first. \n\nSo if you're interested or have questions, please send me a message and tell me which era of the Star Wars lore (canon or not) is your favorite, and why, just so I can start to get a feel for what you're looking for!\n\nThanks!\n\n~C",

I'm particularly craving something with lots of *realism, darker themes, conflict, and politics*. I'm looking for a truly open-minded partner(s) who wants an unpredictable adventure with lots of mystery and exposition, a detailed and fleshed-out setting, starring emotionally complex characters (multiple, preferably) whose arcs and motivations we explore throughout the course of a larger, over-arching plot. \n\nThe two universes I know the best are ASoIaF and Middle Earth/Lord of the Rings, though I'm also totally willing to explore an original universe with the right partner, if we've got good worldbuilding synergy. I'm more invested in finding the right fit with a writing partner than in the particular fandom or universe.\n\nI'll keep this short, since any and all details pertaining to my preferences are covered on my RP website linked below. If you're interested, please read it over, andif you think we'll be a good fit, send me a PM or comment here on reddit for my contact information. \n\n https://sites.google.com/view/pyralis-roleplay",

I\u2019ve been roleplaying for at least the past four years. I\u2019m in the ET time zone (if that\u2019s at all important to you). I can, at times, become very passionate when roleplaying. I\u2019m almost always free so I reply pretty fast and consistently. \n\nI\u2019m looking to do a romantic/dramatic roleplay. I would love to do something original! If you have any ideas I\u2019d love to hear them. Some roles I\u2019d love to try would be supernatural ones such as vampire or werewolf (I grew up on twilight, it a way to live out repressed fantasies hahaha). I do have some ideas we could build an add to if needed.  I also only like to roleplay in first person. I usually play a shy, quiet, innocent OC that is based off of me and I\u2019d like someone to offset that.  \n\nIf anything that I have wrote has interested you message me! I\u2019d love to discuss further. ",

            "selftext": "\\**2410 C.E., August 23, 18:43 hours, Smyrna Dockyard, 12 hours before assault.\\** \n\nThe Smyrna Dockyard drifted in empty space. Despite this, it saw heavy traffic, both civilian and military. Ships from across the galaxy were docked there. This was because it served as a crucial port connecting the outer planets to earth. One ship, the Ziggurat, was notably larger than many of the other ships it was docked by.\n\nThe Ziggurat was essentially a metal temple. The ship housed many amenities, including a market, garden, and bar, but most significantly, it was a place of worship for a wide pantheon of gods. Ancient Mesopotamian religions were popular in some of the outer worlds, and they culminated in a new religion: Ishtar. On the Ziggurat, Ishtarians could worship freely, although it was also the sight of black market trades and all manner of debauchery. The ship was led by its high priest, Gilgamesh, a man with more carnal concerns in mind than spiritual.\n\n\"Drinks all around! On my coin!\" The offer was met with drunken cheer and applause. Gilgamesh sat at the bar, surrounded by friends and strangers alike. He gulped at an ale and slammed his mug down on the counter. \"You put Siduri to shame! No finer ale in the entire-\" burp \"in the whole of the universe!\"\n\n\\**August 23, 21:49 hours, 9 hours before assault.\\**\n\nSherida sat on the bed of a private room. She was dressed in an ornate sari. Candles flickered in the dark room surrounding her. The door opened, and she looked over to the man who'd stepped inside. He was handsome-looking, dressed in simple white robes. Sherida smirked at him. \"Glad you could make it. I get paid upfront, so you'd better have a hundred coins in those robes.\"\n\nThe man sat on the bed next to her, leaving plenty of space between the two. \"I'm sorry to have misled you. I won't be seeking your services, tonight.\"\n\nSherida didn't look happy about this. \"What? Then what you doing inviting me here for? What's your name?\"\n\n\"Gabriel.\"\n\n\"Gabriel? That a Christian name. What, you from earth?\"\n\n\"I'm familiar with it, but no.\"\n\n\"And what you doing here? What, you here to convert me?\" Sherida couldn't help but laugh at the thought.\n\n\"Not exactly.\" He turned to her with a serious look on his face. \"You must understand. I'm here to warn you.\"\n\n\"Warn me? Are you high on something?\"\n\nHe took her hands into his own. She didn't pull hers away. \"Our Lord is coming. And when he does, most of humanity will not survive. A flood is coming, and I need for you to survive it.\"\n\nSherida was getting extremely creeped out. She pulled her hands away. \"Okay then...and why are you telling me this...?\" Sherida had hardly any idea what he was blabbering about, and she didn't believe a word of it.\n\n\"Because God has a plan for you.\"\n\nSherida rolled her eyes and stood up. \"Right...okay, Gabriel. You've wasted enough of my time. I've gotta find a new client.\"\n\nThe woman was heading out of the room when the man stopped her. \"Just stay on this ship. Stay on the Ziggurat. Please? Just for the next few hours. Can you trust me on this?\"\n\nSherida didn't answer. She simply pulled away from him and left the room, shutting the door behind her. Sherida stood in the hallway. As strange as that person was, he wasn't even close to the weirdest client she'd ever had. She knew there was a bar on this ship. Maybe she'd find someone willing to pay to spend the night with her there.\n\n(For this rp, I'll be playing Gilgamesh, Sherida, and Gabriel. I'd like you to create at least one character to play as, although you can create as many as you'd like. If you need help coming up with ideas, I'd be happy to help you. I ask that if you join, you be fairly descriptive. This is going to be a survival, adventure rp, and it can include romance if you'd like. I can play this on reddit, discord, google+, and email, although I prefer reddit. Both 1st and 3rd person are allowed.)",

I put a lot of effort in both the story and the characters and I hope that you do too. I enjoy angst and darker themes but also fluff and humor. I've had wonderful roleplays where I've both cried my eyes out and laughed until my stomach hurts and I need that in my life again!\n\nNow, what I'm looking for? I can do pretty much anything! Slice of life, pirates, dark fantasy... only thing that I really don't feel comfortable with is historical settings.\n\nSome fandoms I'd like to do:\n\n-Stranger things\n-Supernatural\n-Harry Potter\n-FMA\n-Attack on titan\n-Berserk \n-Devilman\n-One Piece (I'd love you forever if we did this!)\n\nOriginal stories are also very welcome! All I really need is a well-developed story with multi-dimensional characters. We could also do fandom settings with original characters. Really, I'm open for almost anything with a good enough partner!\n\nMy length varies from 300-500 words and sometimes more depending on what's going on in the story. You can also expect multiple replies a day although obviously not every day. I enjoy rapid-fire every once in a while but things may slow down for a moment when life comes in the way. I am chill and won't harass for replies!\n\nI mostly write males against other males but since I also like to write more than one character, other pairings are also welcome. (as long as I get my m/m :) )\n\nPm me! Also, if you contacted me once and we lost contact don't hesitate to try again! I got soooo many replies last time it was hard to keep all the planning going on but now the situation has calmed down! Also, if you have once ghosted me that's also okay, it happens haha. ",

            "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI\u2019m Tams, an avid roleplayer who has been writing in some form or another for so long that I\u2019ve practically lost count. (This is just a diplomatic way of calling myself 'old'. As such, I definitely need you to be 18 or older. Preferably 21 or older...)\n\nI don\u2019t get too into word counts or anything, but I\u2019m definitely the type of gal who tries to balance quality and quantity. I want to give my partners plenty to work off of and hope they are willing and able to return the favor. The introductory posts that I write to start off a scene can, at times, be particularly prolific, but I swear, I\u2019m relatively easy-going.\n\nThat being said, I do have a career and family and an organization that I volunteer with. These things will, of course, always take priority, but I have been making time for writing practically my entire life and don\u2019t plan to stop anytime soon. Usually, I get out at least one post a day (generally either at the start of my day or in the evenings when things are winding down).\n\nI\u2019m really only interested in Female x Male pairings, and I am definitely more interested in playing female. However, I do have a couple of male characters I wouldn\u2019t mind reviving for the right scene and character.\n\nWhen it comes to NSFW content, I\u2019m cool with it if it fits in the plot. I\u2019m definitely not going to go out of my way just to have characters boinking for the sake of boinking, but I\u2019m no prude either. I\u2019m just as comfortable Fading to Black.\n\nSo, on to my specific interests:\n\n\\- Anything Emotionally Charged\n\n\\- Modern Fantasy/Supernatural\n\n\\- Dark &amp; Gritty- Fairytale Retellings \n\n\\- Modern or Otherwise\n\n\\- Age of Sail/Pirate Inspired\n\n\\- Slow Burn/Sexual Tension\n\n\\- Fantasy\n\n\\- Historical\n\n\\- Powers/Gifted Individuals\n\n\\- Slice of Life (So long as there is some sort of tension to keep it interesting)\n\n\\- Rivals Turn Lovers\n\n\\- Star-Crossed\n\n\\- Cop/Mark x Criminal\n\n\\- Old Sweethearts or Friends Reunited\n\n\\- Unplanned Pregnancy\n\nI\u2019ve only dabbled in a small handful of Fandoms, and you would be hard-pressed to talk me into anything other than OCs. I\u2019m most comfortable/interested in the following (but feel free to suggest others if you think we might be a good fit):\n\n\\- Hunger Games\n\n\\- Harry Potter (Especially love Marauders\u2019 Era)\n\n\\- Game of Thrones\n\nIf you have something you want to try that isn\u2019t on this list, then please, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me, as this is hardly an exhaustive list! I would love to hear your ideas and see what we might be able to think up together!",

            "selftext": "Yeah, ok, I'm fucked up. I'd washed down a cocktail of pills you'd shoved into my hands with a cocktail of a dozen different alcoholic beverages. You know the kind. When you find several *almost* empty bottles of booze and you combine them into one drink, which you then chug because letting yourself actually taste what's going down would be even more unpleasant than your current state of sobriety. And now I'm battling a fuzzy, foggy, swimmy state of inebriation, the desire to throw up everything I've imbibed, and the heart-pounding euphoria of an open road ahead. \n\nThe car we're traveling in doesn't have working AC, and it's a hot, humid, shitty spring day in Texas. We've got the windows down, and days like this are the only times I wish I still had that old Chevy with the hand crank vent windows. We'd at least feel a breeze when we're moving, and we're always moving. Interstate 20 at 11 in the morning is somewhat quiet, and even when it's not your bat-shit insane method of driving scares all the responsible folks out of the way. I read somewhere that kids now aren't getting their driver's licenses so much anymore. That seems so strange to me. When I was 15 and I got my hardship, we'd all pile into my parents' 1984 Oldsmobile Delta Eighty-Eight, and the lumbering beast would haul our asses away from them and our siblings and school. At least until 8PM, which is when my legal right to drive expired. But it was *freedom.* \n\nToday, despite the copious amounts of ill-advised substances pummeling my internal organs, this feels like freedom. My arm is hanging out the passenger side window and my phone is off. On occasion I'll stick my head out and enjoy the breeze like some dumb dog. The radio is blaring Top 40 hits, only because the Classic Rock station makes me feel old. How is shit from the 90s now considered classic rock? We bob and weave like the best goddamned boxers, dodging cars and semis, two people on a mission to forget everything in the rear view. We're running, you see. From 9-5 jobs, and mortgages, and always-on connectivity. Forgetting for a brief moment that we've tied ourselves to one place, something we swore we weren't going to do back when we didn't have all those millstones around our necks. \n\nEvery now and again I look over at you, and I realise how much I love the laugh lines that form at the corners of your eyes. The wrinkles we have now, some 20 years after we first met, were born from too many late nights spent laughing or worrying or fighting or fucking. But they're the product of *us.* And when I see them I wonder what we're really running from. I don't have an answer, just like I didn't when I woke you up at 4AM and told you we need to *go.* We're running, an illusion only broken by the dutiful messages we sent to our bosses letting them know we'd be taking a personal day, a tacit acknowledgement that this fleeing we're doing has an expiration date. But that's ok. For today, for 20ish glorious hours, we're running away.\n\n****\n\nSo this is my first post here. Apologies for any goofs. Ideally I\u2019d like to play this out over Reddit PMs or something like Google Docs. Something that allows for paragraph length replies. If you have recommendations on that front I\u2019d be interested to hear them. \n\nAs to the RP. It\u2019s pretty basic. We\u2019re two folks living a conventional life. One morning I wake up and I feel the need to run, even if just for today. This RP will be about our 20 or so hours away from all responsibilities. It can be insane or it can be a goofy road trip or anything in between. ",

I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship.\n\nLast but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along.\n\nDesperately Searching For: \n\n- 21+ partners \n\n- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies). \n\n- For you to write as a male in thier 30s-40s and older. I'm a sucker for the gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. The broken ones who are rough around the edges and aren't afraid to throw a punch. But are tender enough provide a hug if needed.\n\n- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. \n\n- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only art if you're uncomfortable with real life) \n\n- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post or before it. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. \n\nI love all types of genres, but especially real life, urban fantasy, and science fiction. I also like to use fandom worlds and drop in original characters. All my characters will be adults and I require my partners do the same.\n\nFor plot ideas/fandom list, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and possibly writing. Look forward to hearing from you!",

To avoid Avenger interference they waited until most of the heavy hitters were away and started a machine that put the island in a dome and was constantly moving it to different dimensions. Spider-man tried to stop them but he appeared to be killed in battle by Kraven the Hunter. Now a few street heroes lead but Daredevil and the Punisher seem to be the only thing rebelling against the new dictators of the city. Meanwhile the Avengers work from beyond the dome in an attempt to get in and take back their beloved city. But it's not enough, everyone knows it.*\n\n*Suddenly portals are appearing in different dimensions, a cry for help to Spider-men from all over the multiverse. Who is sending out this signal? None other than Peter Parker, after faking his death, he took his loved ones and went underground, starting to plan a way to take the Sinister Six down for good. Will you answer his plea?*\n\nThis is a 3rd person, literate group roleplay. We just started so it's a little small but many roles are open, not just spider-men either. You can find a street hero into the rebellion, be one of the Sinister Six and their allies, or even be one of the Avengers working desperately from the outside. No original characters, strictly pre-existing comic characters only.

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

            "selftext": "This is a long detailed Rp setting not expecting anyone to read it but would like people to join the rp group for it.\nAny questions Pm me.\n\n\n\nIn the Realm there are 4 main regions, the Snowy Mountains in the north, The Lifeless Region to the west, The beautiful yet dangerous Forbidden Forest in the east and lastly in the center of it all The Kingdom Of Adragalla the land of peace.\n\n\n\nThe Kingdom Of Adragalla is dead center in the middle of the other 3 regions, the kingdoms outer area are small farms and small few small stores selling the basics. As you walk further into Adragalla you can see the buildings and the land turn more civilized. Once leaving the farms you will next see the marketplace, this place is filled with stores many serving as housing for the owners. You will see small stands selling fresh fruit, meat and bread and also the larger stores like the blacksmiths, taverns and spas. Past the marketplace you will reach the Living Areas, many houses are here some small and some as big as mansions. In the south part of the realm are the Great Docks. Finally past all that there is what all kingdoms have a castle, the place the king lives and where he makes his orders it is extremely beautiful some same the it is the most beautiful thing in the realm.\n\nAlthough Adragalla earned the name the land of peace that was a long time ago. Times change things there is crime in the kingdom corrupted guards and gangs.\n\n\n{DIFFICULTY: Easy-Medium OCs can't die}\n\n{Rules}\n\nCan apply to be a Guard, Create a gang and own stores\nIf there are too many gangs a \u201cgang war\u201d will start and gang leaders and members will RPF winner keeps their gang, losers gang disbands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEastern\n\n\nIn the East majority of it is a deep dark forest called the Forbidden Forest growing larger and more dangerous the more East you go. On the eastern edge of the realm deep inside The Forbidden Forest is a small village which the residents are highly religious.\n\nThe Eastern region is the second most beautiful region in the land filled with beautiful green farm land and nature. This beautiful region quickly turns dark and scary, past the farmlands and villages is the forbidden forest.\nThe forbidden forest is a dark forest covering more than half the east. This forest is filled with wildlife some of it friendly some the complete opposite. Some of the more dangerous wildlife you would encounter here are Wolves, Minotaurs(Rare), Feral Werewolves, Werewolves, Trolls and many more.\nAs for more friendly wildlife the forest is filled with most normal wildlife (rabbits, deer etc.) some of the more mythical and magical creatures are Unicorns, Fairies, mermaids(Extremely rare), Centaurs and few more.\nIn the deepest parts of the Forbidden forest there is a village. This village is home to only humans. The humans of the village are extremely skilled in many different fighting styles making them perfect fighters. The main thing about the village is the fact that they are anti magic, they see it as a power only gods should have the religion past down making the villagers hate anything to do with magic that isn't about the gods.\n\n\n{DIFFICULTY: Medium-Hard and OCs can be knocked out}\n\n\n\n\nWestern\n\n\nIn the West region of the realm are what the locals call the Dead Lands. To the rest of the realm the west has the nickname The Lifeless Plains. The plains last what seem for ages but there is a end not many have survived to tell the tails but the ones that did saw only death and a plain rusty steel gate.\nAs soon as you enter the western lands you would feel a great evil presence watching you. There is only one village in the Dead Plains a small farming village living day by day surrounding the village are dead farms the crop they grew now dead grey and withered. Just past the village and the farm are the lifeless fields full of the people who were dead but now undead. The lifeless fields swarming with the undead. Zombies, Ghouls, feral Vampires and more. \n\nThe people in the village aren't the friendly type. Every night they fight to survive against the undead. The village is very small it has one bar and one general store. The buildings are built of wood and look like they could break down at any moment. \nDeeper you wander into the western lands the more darker and lifeless it gets. Swarms of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ghouls and zombies wander in the deeper parts the swarms getting larger and the ghouls and zombies turning feral and stronger. In the deepest parts there is a old broken down castle surrounded with cracked broken stone walls and a rusty steel gate. A extremely powerful vampire lives in this castle, so powerful he has become the leader of the vampires and majority of the other monsters of the western region. Those who do not follow his lead soon suffer and their fates get sealed.\n\n{DIFFICULTY: Hard and OC can die}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern \n\nThe Northern Region is a hard and snowy mountain terrain, the mountains are filled with caves that lead deep underground. The Northern mountains is probably the hardest to place to live in, with the harsh snowy weather and the constant blizzard has made living life their best to be lived underground. The main residents that live in this region are the master craftsman, The Dwarves as well as the dwarves there are many creatures and monsters that live here.\nWhen you first enter the northern region you best have signed your will. The first thing you will see is a dense hilly snowy forest filled with White wolves that have razor sharp teeth and amazing senses. Not long after the trees will thin and the terrain changes to large harsh mountains be careful where you step though, the mountain is home to the golems (Ice and Rock) large peaceful creatures if left alone and not disturbed, step on one though prepare to fight for your life. In the deepest parts of the Northern region that is where you can\u2019t venture alone unless you were raised there. In the deep parts many powerful creatures can be seen such as Ice Spirits and dragons being the main ones, these can not be defeated alone.\nThroughout the mountains there are many caves entrances and tunnels some lead to dead ends, some lead to traps set by goblins and others lead to the dwarven city Kar Fladihor. The dwarven city has the best weapons and armour one can buy. The one trouble is, dwarves dislike selling to Unworthy people. To prove worthiness to the dwarves is basically suicide not only do you have to defeat a creature of their choice you will also have to gather any materials needed for your equipment you wish to buy. The dwarves as well as master craftsman are extremely strong and great warriors, it would be wise not to make enemies of them.\n\n{DIFFICULTY: Hard-Deadly, suggest going in groups OCs can die}\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello all! As the title of this thread suggests, I am looking for Roleplay partners who are interested in the fandom of The Orville!\n\nThis is the first sci-fi show that I\u2019ve really gotten into, with the exception of later seasons of Agents of SHIELD, and I really really love it. The characters are great, and the humor isn\u2019t forced or too shticky.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get on to the main part...the characters! I\u2019m looking to play as Commander Kelly Grayson, and I\u2019m looking for someone to play as her sarcastic ex-husband Captain Ed Mercer. I love this pairing because they\u2019re both so snarky and kind of ridiculous human beings, especially when they\u2019re together.\n\nI don\u2019t have any plots figured out just yet, but that\u2019s something we can talk about. Since it is set in the future and in space, there\u2019s plenty we can work with.\n\nSome info about me:\n* I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+.\n* I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply.\n* I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out.\n* I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does.\n* I would prefer literate partners.\n\nInterested? Excellent! Feel free to comment here or shoot me a message! I look forward to plotting with you! ",

            "selftext": "Good morning /r/Roleplay! Hope you're having a wonderful day! Today we'd like to invite all who might be interested in our latest iteration of ITRP. We have an active, friendly and thriving community and would love to see more faces join our growing community. Below is an explanation of our new iteration along with helpful links. If you have any questions, please comment or private message me, or better yet join our [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/BbD8wNK) and talk with our community :)\n\nMany thanks and hope to see you soon!\n\nIron Throne Roleplay (ITRP) is a community-driven roleplaying/simulation game based in the universe of George R.R Martin\u2019s *A Song of Ice and Fire* series. Currently we are in our sixth edition of our game after five successful wrap ups from our first run (2014-2015), our second run (2015-2016) our third run (2016), our fourth run (2016-2017), and our most recent fifth run (2017-2018). ITRP is one of the most active and most recognized RP games in the RP reddit community and has a large host of players who all work to uphold our community standards in respect, fair-play, and enjoyability, which are outlined in our [rules and regulations](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/wiki/rules_and_regulations).\n\nITRP is a community-driven game with the goal to become and uphold the highest quality role-playing experience set in the ASOIAF universe on Reddit and to become a place where new and old fans of the series alike, hardcore RPers, fresh faces and anything in between, can come together to write about a world they love. We aim to create an environment in which our players can enjoy the writing process and improve their writing skills, learn more about the universe and make some friends discussing it, becoming a member of our close-knit community in the process.\n\nThe primary function of ITRP is to tell a compelling stories where all of our players and characters can have a meaningful and impactful effect on the game-world. We want our players to be filled with pride as villains rise and heroes fall as we play the Game of Thrones in a game where there is no such thing as \u2018minor characters\u2019, but a place where each and every character can have a major impact on the direction of the story in accordance to their author\u2019s will. However life is a fragile thing, and taking chances is not without consequence. With this in mind, there is a distinct possibility that your characters could die during the course of the game, so being able to separate yourselves from attachment is essential.\n\nPresently you can find our in-game play on [/r/IronThroneRP](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP/) and our community/character creation/meta subbreddit over at [/r/ITRPCommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/)!\n\n**The Story**\n\nAegon\u2019s Conquest failed. His sisters and their dragons were killed. While the east was bathed in dragonflame, Aegon had wasted too many resources, losing a dragon in the process, attempting to grasp too much power too quickly, and when the Great Alliance between Houses Gardener and Lannister met Aegon\u2019s army on the Field of Valor, Aegon lost another sister and her dragon, and was forced to flee in disgrace. As his armies collapsed and rebellion from his vassals was imminent, Aegon announced that he would fly his dragon to Valyria, and see what he could find to establish his kingdom anew. A year from the day he set foot on the shores of Westeros, he mounted a wounded Balerion and flew off into the sky, never to be seen again. Once again, Westeros saw a momentary peace.\n\nThat peace would not last, however. Though Aegon Targaryen\u2019s invasion was a failure, the ensuing power vacuum left Westeros in a state of chaos and disarray. With the Trident ripe for the picking, and a worrying power struggle beginning to form in Dorne, and a Kingless Iron Islands, it did not take long for Westeros to, once more, fall into war.\n\nTwo-hundred and ninety-eight years. Countless wars, countless treaties, countless plagues, countless deaths -- all caused by one man and his sisters, say the people. Near three-hundred years later we find the realm, once more, in chaos. The North is embroiled in a nasty civil war between the exiled trueborn heir of King Torrhen X Stark, the Black Wolf, and the legitimized bastard of King Torrhen X Stark, the White Wolf and Lord of Winterfell. To the south, the Kingdom of the Trident is teetering on the edge of collapse as the only remaining member of House Fletcher, a house spawned by a peasant rebellion after Aegon fled and the realms great powers descended on the Trident, is an eight year old girl, Mia Fletcher, betrothed to the heir to House Darry.\n\nThe High Septon has called a council to determine who would go on to lead the Trident to avoid another bloody war. Would it be House Darry through marriage? House Bracken through a weak, yet still, blood claim? House Mallister through strength, as the Lord Mallister served as the late King Tristifer\u2019s right hand man? House Frey through wealth, as House Fletcher had a sizeable unpaid debt to them? Or House Tully through honour, alliances, and a powerful marriage with House Lannister? Or perhaps a foreign power? The Council of Harrenhal and its many attendees will determine who will lead the Trident into the future. Or will it? Many powers seek to destabilize the Trident; Durrandon to maintain his hold on the Kingdom of the Dusklands and the Kingdom of the Claw, Gardener to expand his realm, and Arryn to ensure the safety of his realm and lay claim to the Trident.\n\nTo the west, the Ironborn have lost their King, Cotter Goodbrother. A Kingsmoot has been called, with four well known houses putting their name forth. House Goodbrother, the younger brother of the old King Cotter who slew Prince Brandon Stark before his nephew, the heir Torgon Goodbrother, was slain by the White Wolf himself. House Greyjoy, the Lord Reaver who paid the iron price for Red Rain, House Reyne\u2019s ancestral sword, and reaved the Westerlands during the War of the Trident. House Drumm, the Lord Reaver who razed Oldtown and named himself King of the Mander before being driven out after the War of the Trident. And House Harlaw, the Lord Reaver is especially infamous, for it was their intense raiding of the Riverlands, and the subsequent slaughtering of King Tristifer\u2019s two sons, that caused the War of the Trident to break out. Lord Harlaw pillaged the entirety of the Western RIverlands, and their sigil is now a symbol of horror for the people of the Red Fork, used by mothers to send them to bed before the White Reaper comes for them.\n\nIn the south, Dorne is divided into three; The Kingdom of the Torrentine, headed by House Dayne of Starfall, The Kingdom of the Greenbelt, headed by House Yronwood, and the Princedom of Dorne, ruled by Martell in Sunspear, the shattered remains of the former nation. There have been nearly three hundred years of separation, but can one rise above the others? Will Dorne be whole again?\n\nOnly you, the player, can determine what happens next. Will the Ironborn kneel to a single Lord Reaver? Will the Trident see peace and stability?\n\nCome help sway the tides of war and peace, through trade, war, diplomacy, intrigue, there are a multitude of ways even the smallest character can change the flow of ITRP. Come play the Great Game.\n\n**Getting Started!**\n\nThe first step in joining ITRP is to visit our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/BbD8wNK) (we would love to meet you!), read [our rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/wiki/rules_and_regulations) and [story information](http://thegreatgame.wikia.com/wiki/Thegreatgame_Wiki) and then create your first character! To see what houses are currently available to be played check our our [House Information document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1naVjb6m3D0wrUybSI-0XgJj4Ea0HebV5wqRe14sijh8/edit#gid=0) but note that character creation is not restricted to this list at all! You are free to make a wandering knight, a scion of an already played or major house or do whatever you like! The options are endless, and they are in your hands.\n\nDuring this time you may also find interest in [our game manual](https://old.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/wiki/index) which has a deeper look into some of the mechanics and aspects of ITRP, with our [skill system](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/wiki/gifts_and_skills) being one highlighted aspect.\n\nAdditionally, for a more focused view at what has happened so far in our story you might find interest in our [State of the Realm](http://thegreatgame.wikia.com/wiki/Regions_of_the_Realm) which details all the major events that have happened in the game! We also have narrative retellings of some events which may be very useful to get a hold on the story behind the game.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you in game!

            "selftext": "[Note] Usually I write big descriptions about the RP and all kinds of stuff, but really, I\u2019m not trying this time. This RP specifically is just meant to be more of a fun free-roam type of thing with some friends, but I\u2019m lacking enough people to give more life to the RP. This takes from various pop cultures references in one big thing, basically a fandom sort of thing. So I\u2019m saying this now, the RP is not entirely an original idea, but I\u2019d like to just have fun from hosting more serious ones.\n[Intro] Bedlam Badlands is a post-apocalyptic that takes sources from many known names in the genre, mostly Skyshines Bedlam, and Mad Max, into chaotic and gritty world full of psychopaths, Mutants, Marauders, and other ilk ((Also including borderlands and Fallout)). Now hold on, just because it takes reference from these doesn\u2019t mean the story will be all the same. You can do anything you want in Bedlam, being a psycho murder, or a giant mutant, even a A.I robot. However the main antagonist of this RP can be King Eviscera, the monstrous man that took control of all of Bedlam. It\u2019s up to you whether or not you\u2019d like try to defeat him, loot the wastes, or meet its various inhabitants and clans. There\u2019s even a cyberpunk portion to the Rp, where you can live in the city fo Byzantine, \u2018the last modern city in the world.\u2019 You can work with the various illegal underground groups, be a police officer and attempt to stop them, and even more to come.\n[Misc] There\u2019s no dice roll system, it\u2019s free form, but I will remind you I won\u2019t allow Meta/Godmod actions. You can make up to 5 various characters, and explore wherever and whenever. I am owner and main host, and I have only 1 assistant. If you\u2019d like to help, I\u2019d appreciate it. Sorry if this all seemed sloppy, but sometimes I just want to be able to RP in peace without bug worry or breaking my back for it like my other attempts. I hope to see you here. - The Bartender\n~~~~~~~~~~~&gt; https://discord.gg/Rvy4Sts &lt;~~~~~~~~~~~",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I'm looking for a **femslash roleplay** that involves romance and isn't smut-focused. I like slice-of-life roleplays as well, just haven't done many since I first started roleplaying 10+ years ago. I really love doing plots and I'm open to a variety of settings, except for high fantasy. Just isn't my thing. So I love elements of mystery, horror, superheroes, sci-fi (think Black Mirror or Blade Runner), and just plain realism. I prefer to world-build heavily and have a good idea of plot before we jump in.\n\n\nOn terms of fandoms, I *love* Harry Potter but I would play an OC for f//. I will consider f/m for Harry Potter. The Marauder's Era is my absolute favorite. Ask about other fandoms and I'll let you know if I do them. \n\n\nMy writing style varies. I only write in 3rd person. I typically like to write multiple paragraphs to expand on thoughts and surroundings, but I can also have posts around a paragraph to keep the plot moving. I've written pages as a roleplay response. Typically, I match my partner, but **please write a paragraph or more per post**. I also *love* using playbys. I don't have limits, but we should be open about what we are and aren't comfortable with.\n\n\n**TL;DR - I'm looking for a f// roleplay, open to plots and many settings, and typically write multi-para. PM me if interested! c:**",

Also agender, genderqueer characters are always welcomed. \n\nA few things first, I am a SLOW replier. My life is not RP, it is like a casual hobby, that being said since I am slow I like to write 4+ paragraphs when I reply. 3rd person, past tense, one or two or more characters. I will probably reply twice a week, maybe more if I am bothered. I don\u2019t mind ooc chatter but don\u2019t feel obligated. I definitely am good with plotting and planning ooc though, that can be important to keep the story again. I don\u2019t like to use face claims, but I\u2019ll describe my babes.\n\nThe story I really want to do I actually saw on writingprompts, it was basically a time traveler and an immortal/supernatural have a series of run-ins. I can already imagine the completely awful time traveler I would want to write too. I am okay writing against any kind of immortal so just bring me your ideas! I thought it could be a vampire my character tries to con out of something or an angel investigating a strange occurrence (time travel). I am up for suggestions! I figure it could start with their first meeting and then kind of jump from scene to scene in different time periods.\n\nI\u2019m thinking more comedy/drama than romance but I am ok with some dating/flirting. If it gets too lovey-dovey, I gotta tap out. \n\nI am definitely down for other rp plots/prompts, but right now I am looking for a more modern with a light touch of supernatural. I\u2019m really into human detectives clashing with supernaturals, or supernatural hunters, demons, angels and all of that! \n\nI prefer email or google docs first but I have a discord I am willing to use. NSFW info: I will write it, I don\u2019t care but it is not a requirement. \n\nShoot me a message if you too are a turtle writer! And please don\u2019t just give me a little bit, tell me your ideas/what you think/whatever! Thanks for reading all this! I swear I am not this picky.",

            "selftext": "**WARNING!\nLONG POST AHEAD!**\n\nHallo!I've been roleplaying for seven or so years now. I work in a wide variety of topics; apocalypse and sci-fi are general favorites however I'll happily take up a topic that's interesting. A few on the details about me:\n\n* 22 years old and fine with romance/NSFW when it's a good addition to the plot.\n* I'm down for any pairing, with a little bit more a craving for F/F at the moment. \n* EST Time zone- I'm happy to play with someone from any zone, though!\n* My work schedule has unfortunately become unpredictable. I seem to be off work by 4-6pm. \n* If I'm working, I might be able to get a short reply in. Or a long one, if the manager is nice and it's slow.\n* Preference for long-term roleplay. \n* Loves to read. Please, write me novels. I can mirror fairly well when it's called for.\n* Third person, past tense, paragraphs. The usual here! \n* I'm pretty good about grammar but typos do like to slip out. (I also intermix variations, like color and behaviour)\n* Lots of characters- I prefer female roles (naturally) but I have males as well. \n* Likes to throw said characters under buses. Expect lots of angst. \n* I'll roleplay most things that aren't ponies/MLP. \n* I am a furry but I don't RP it. (I'll go on about current suit projects though) \n* I like to draw so I may draw things\n* Discord is preferred, but I also have Telegram\n* Okay with cursing\n* I'll tell about the *saucy* preferences in private chat!\n* I try to reply quickly- sometimes I might be out of it, tired, at work, but don't fret. If it's been a while feel free to poke! Please, do poke- sometimes I honestly do forget. \n\n\nAs for a partner, I'm looking for anyone that's at least 20 years old. Romance typically happens in roleplays with me; smut as well when it's fitting, but not a constant/instant thing. I'd like for someone to have a passion for writing, since I love to get a long response to sit and read. Willing to work with me to create something fun for both of us, as well. \n\n\nI'd like a long term story, but shorter I can do too. Just, please, tell me if you're not feeling like roleplaying. I'm sure we all could tell how we're upset someone we were excited to RP with flaked and blocked us with no explanation. If a story isn't working out but you enjoyed actually roleplaying, I'm totally up for switching things up and trying something new. \n\nPlease do message me if you are interested! I'll add some ideas I've been brooding below, but first I want to say that when you do message, I want to get a bit more than a few sentences. Pitch a character or a story plot if you've got one, some ideas you came up with offhand. A paragraph or two is much, much more attractive!\n\nHere's a couple musings to end with, and maybe one interests you!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**These oceans are alive.**\n\nFeaturing my mermaid Aqua, an orca mimic. This story is quite flexible; are you a fisherman that throws nets out to catch fish for a living, catching a mermaid as bycatch? What do you do, release her, keep her, sell her? Or maybe your ship was capsized in a storm, and your last vision was a shark circling, waiting, then a flash of black and white before passing out in the cold ocean. Or maybe you're a marine biologist that's discovered a mermaid stranded in a coral field in low tide. It's really up for discussion, all I do know is Aqua needs some love! \n\n\n**You're a Diablo**\n\nZivantiaxe, my half-devil character and probably my favorite guy. Zivantiaxe loves to stir up trouble and havoc, but suffice to say that Ziv's got a big heart once someone manages to pull the strings just right. Ziv was born of a human mother and devil father; due to mixed blood, Hell wouldn't have him. His mother, a mortal, died in her time. Now Zivantiaxe lives on as Captain of his mother's ship to keep his blood alive as a long history of Captains.\n\nZiv's able to mildly change his form, generally in the case of his head to a canine skull, his hands grow sharp claws a la Wolverine, and some other minor changes. He has a little bit of control over magic, but it's hardly anything. This story is based around Sunless Sea, which is a lovecraft, steampunk, victorian game that's full of amazement and terror. The world of the Unterzee has sunk underground, locking everything in perpetual darkness if your lantern burns out. \n\n**Blinded Angel**\n\nThis story is with Kovorra, one of my more strange characters. Kovorra was a human child, taken into the hands of gods as her parents had made some ill choices and sacrifices. She grew up well, as any child would, until another god that didn't appreciate having a mortal in the heavens struck the girl and blinded her. Her caretaker since then kept her much more guarded, and gave her a gift of glass wings. Both to remind her that she was a human, and as fragile as she was beautiful. When Kovorra grew older, she wanted to experience what she hasn't been able to for decades. To know a little bit of what it could have been had her parents not given her as tribute to the gods.\n\nShe leaves the heavens to her own journey, hoping to find some way to get her sight back. She needs to be careful of her moves, but she gets around pretty well even though being blind. ",

            "selftext": "The title says it all really. I'm driven largely on adventure-driven stories revolved around a singular character that acts as the proto-protagonist as they muck about in another person's Medieval Fantasy world whose story encompasses violence, exploration of the unique cultures, races, nations, forgotten places left in mountains and holes in the ground, as well as discovering new monsters, magics, etc. In a way, I sort of enjoy being able to describe it as a universe similar to the Witcher. A bitter, unpleasant world that's coming to a new age as fantasy and the harshness of reality bleed together to create a profoundly dark world that drafts real concepts from reality like economics, geopolitics, causes for conflicts amongst rulers where they use casus belis to flimsily give themselves cause to push for their real ambitions...so on and so on. If it's a world that can manage to make me uncomfortable, then you're probably doing something right with it.\n\nI don't care about the gender of my partner or any other circumstances related to them. It's not my business unless you care to make it; that being said, I've been at this long enough that if you're someone who self-describes themselves as a 'detailed writer,' then ninety-percent of the time it doesn't actually mean anything. If you know how to structure a paragraph and can convey the feelings you want to get across, then that's more than enough for me. I'll provide a writing sample further down. Obligation has me say that I have no trouble with smut whatsoever, though the character I had in mind was a female with a favortism shown towards the same sex, which may very well come into conflict with the societal norms of the world, or be something entirely ignored. Either works for me, and, indeed, having sexuality be a point of tension can be quite fun if designed and plotted out well.\n\nI use Discord, Skype, as well as GMail/GDocs; message me for contact details for that.\n\nThanks to Kevin for giving the chance for this piece. This is by no means a prompt, and only serves to act as a form of advertisement for the level of writing I prefer.\n\n**His attire was the usual of his imperious self, a simple pair of pressed trousers above polished leather boots. Over his shoulders was draped a collared shirt, and a light leather jacket above it; an odd choice in the hellish waste which was the Prestor's hold. Still, the man wasn't even sweating as he stepped forward, his limp obvious, while his hazel eyes gazed down at the girl with a thousand emotions flowing through, making a single indiscernible amalgamation. Her gaze met his, and she felt just as many, the strangest among them, among the fear, the anger, the respect, was the love. Not of a woman to her man, but of a daughter to her father. The man, for his part, did not look older than thirty, making it rather strange in the looks, but she had spent centuries with him... And while she felt nothing so strong as for the princess of her dreams, it was still enough to stop her strangling him until he inevitably forced her away. Instead, she just keeps a grim, determined look, causing him to sigh, and set the cane against the table, before pulling the chair on his side out, to sit down, with some struggle, due to the weak leg.**\n\n**When he has situated himself in the chair, Saria's eyes following him coldly as he does, he pulls it in, resting his arms on the table as the weak leg splays out for better comfort, before his eyes finally rest on her once more. The man seems unwilling, or at least unable, to say anything, wordlessly watching her in a mutual contest of whom could maintain poise longer. And Saria wasn't willing to play, yawning fakely to break the manufactured tension in the room, before leaning forward in turn; keeping her back straight and hands held perfectly, as she finally says, her first words since she'd talked to Raven's graving into the bedside, \u201cWell. You look good. Is that a new hair style you have?\u201d Daas, despite having not cut his hair in weeks, instinctively put a hand on his head to see what she was talking about, before casting an annoyed gaze at her and sighing. \u201cCan you take nothing seriously?\u201d He asks that, after a moment, his tone matching the gaze as his hand returns to the table, which causes her to shrug her shoulders, indifferent.**\n\n**\u201cWhen it's worth taking seriously, yes. But unfortunately for you, you aren't worth taking seriously.\u201d His gaze hardens again, his jaw set in a manner to indicate her words had bitten as harshly at she'd expected. There was a primal pleasure in tearing down those you hated; at least to her, and there was no one she hated more. Part of her disliked that pleasure she received, but she didn't care to listen to that; not here, not now. Her mental tangent is broken by Daas' words causing her to jolt; breaking her from the trance she'd already fallen into. \u201cSaria. Are you ever going to stop acting like a child, or am I going to have to treat you like one?\u201d Her gaze casts over him for a moment, coming up with a response which he immediately understands will be sarcastic, causing him to just cradle his head in a hand as she replies with, \u201cWell, I don't know. Children don't have to think, and they get to (Whoops, censored!) until they're nice and happy. Being treated like a child sounds like a dream.\u201d**\n\n**Daas' eyes glare her down, indicating she had gone a step too far in the wrong direction. She felt no remorse for the man's annoyance, however, shaking her head as she cuts in, before the man has a chance to criticize, \u201cYou're the one who forced me into this god-forsaken tower. Don't you fucking dare tell me to treat you with dignity or respect; you traded yours a long time ago.\u201d Rather than further annoyance, Daas' expression turns to that of a bemused smile, somewhat forced, as he chose to simply come to her side of thought, for now, if only to warm her up for the questions he had planned. \u201cYou did, too, you know. So I suppose that makes two of us, just pigs, rolling in the mud.\u201d Saria's eyes glance at the man, finding some anger at what he'd said, at the mention of her having given in her dignity. \u201cI didn't really have a choice in the matter,\u201d her tone is far more pressed, now, and her eyes slant. \u201cYou took my dignity... Though, if we're pigs, then I suppose that one of us is magical and the other's a murderer. Sounds like an excellent story for the ages. Maybe one of these days you can say that story to the next woman you kidnap and hold here.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cI'll keep that in mind,\u201d He says, softly, before leaning forward, thinking on her remark on dignity. \u201cBut you say that as if you didn't enjoy it. You enjoyed every moment, every kill, every hunt. The difference between you and I is that I don't enjoy my atrocities; and you do, Saria.\u201d The man has barely finished speaking before Saria's chair is thrown into the wall behind her, chipping away the stones behind her as she stands, glaring down at Daas, who shows no chance in composure as he watches her staring down at him with barely-contained fury from his words. \u201cYou...\u201d She says, voice shaking in the same manner as her quivering arms, \u201cYou...\u201d Nothing more came. It was true; what he said, at least about her. But the fact he'd said it, and the way he'd done it, made her want to burn the man down. But she didn't. And slowly, his arm raised, as she saw the familiar deathly black energy running along it, powered from it, as he gestures to the thrown chair. \u201cPick it up,\u201d he says, calmly, \u201cAnd sit down.\u201d**",

            "selftext": "\nLong ago, there was nothing. \nNothing had ever existed, nothing would ever exist, and the nothing itself was nothing.\n\n\nBut then there was something, a spark of creation referred to simply by the name of \"The One Who Does\". What was nothing quickly unfolded into the complexities of existence, realities, and worlds. It was not perfect, for nothing ever was, but the Creator was satisfied. His final two creations were two beings, one might call them brothers, but that is only true in terms of their shared father. First there was the chief Overseer of existence, serving as a second in command to the Creator. He watched over existence and made sure that the flow and time and space continued as it should, and that the balance of order and chaos held firm. Next was the Servant, a younger creation who served the Creator at a closer level. He learned of the universe, documented its complexities, and fulfilled the Creator's personal wishes upon existence. \n\n\nThere came a time however, when the Creator decided to move on, to breath the spark of life into a new nothingness. Upon deciding this, he left two portions of his power behind. The first share was smaller, and went to the Overseer, who was already quite strong. The larger share went to the Servant, who was prior far weaker than the Overseer. After giving these gifts, the Creator declared the Servant to be the new ruler of existence, and charged the Overseer to serve the Servant as the Overseer had served the Creator. \n\n\nThis did not please the Overseer however, and once the Creator had left he rose in rebellion against the newly crowned Servant, believing that what he had been robbed of what rightfully belonged to him.\n\n\nThe newly crowned Servant was inexperienced with his powers, inexperienced in leadership, and was caught utterly unaware by the rebellion. Thus began a game of cat and mouse, with the Overseer pursing the Servant and his creations across the entirety of existence. The horizon was grim for the Servant, and he nearly fell many times. Eventually the Servant came to decided they would never win the way things were, and that a sacrifice would have to be made. It would be a risky sacrifice, and one he could not be certain of the outcome of. But it was the only thing he believed could have any effect, and so it was done.\n\n\nWelcome to the Chronicles of Light and Dark, a story of gods and mortals hopefully unlike anything you've ever experienced before! The Chronicles of Light and Dark is a minimum semi literate RP detailing the story of 12 individuals who have been plucked from their worlds and sent into a strange series of events. Throughout this tale both your characters and your worlds will develop and change, though for better or for worse will have to be seen. \n\n\nThe question is, are you interested?It is necessary for you to have (or create) both a character and a world behind said character, whether it be original or a pre-existing one (ie from a fandom). Daily participation of some form is generally desired, and this RP is *Very* long term. There is no determined genre to this RP, as it spans across many. The RP floor is set at semi literate and above. Also, the RP base timezone is EST, so it\u2019s advised that you only attempt to join if you can plan around that. Finally, it's required that you be at least 16. This is a hard limit, and if you are found to be lying about your age you *will* be booted immediately. \n\nIf you think you're up for this, shoot me a PM and I'll shoot you a discord invite so we can give you a look. Just be aware the standards are a bit high, but if you think you can meet them we\u2019d be glad to have you!",

            "selftext": "Hey there,\n\n\nLooking to play out an idea for a medieval fantasy setting. I have a general draft for the world and will go into more detail if asked. And of course, you're welcome to help with the world building. You are free to design your own OC as you see fit of course. I do plan on this being a long-term thing but with the story having an end-goal. Send me a message of what kind of character you have in mind (so that I know you actually read the setting) and if you're interested in the crafting the world. Also, if you have an idea that's somewhat similar to the one I described, run it by me. I'm generally game for anything that's interesting.\n\n\nOnly requirement is that you be 18+ and write in third person.\n\n\n**Writing Style and Length:** I write in the third person and length in average is around three to four paragraphs. Might be more or less depending on the required response. I enjoy writing a mixture of plot-based and character-based adventure roleplays with dialogue heavy banter between the main two characters. I can provide a sample of my old writing if asked for one.\n\n\n**Frequency and Medium:** I am generally good for at least one response per day at the very least. If I have free time, I might respond more. If for any reason, I'm unable to write for a couple of days, I'll let you know beforehand. As for medium, I prefer email but am open to using anything that is not mobile based. As for OOC chat, I use discord but not for the story itself.\n\n\n**Mature themes:** I'm okay with blood, gore and sex but only if it applies to the setting and the plot. If it needs to be forced, then probably not worth it.\n\n\n**Romance**: Added this section in because this comes up a lot. I do enjoy writing romance but not as the main driving force of the story. That gets boring really fast. I like having it as a sub-plot provided it makes sense between the characters. Again, if it needs to be forced into the story, not worth doing it.\n\n\nSo if you feel you're interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you guys soon.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nDevoid",

            "selftext": "Hello, and welcome to my Agents of SHIELD Roleplay partner search! I\u2019ve finally been able to watch season five of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and once again I\u2019ve found myself wanting to write in this world. I\u2019m craving some new Roleplays with some old characters. Mostly I\u2019m interested in playing Bobbi Morse against Lance Hunter because I am a die-hard Huntingbird shipper. With the perfect combination of angst, tension, and fluff, How can you not love them? \n\nI am open to doubling with characters if they aren\u2019t the ones you\u2019re dying to plot with at the moment, but for now they are who I\u2019m craving to play and who I actually have plots for, which are listed below. \n\n\nPlots\nPlot 1: Playing out Bobbi and Hunter\u2019s life before the events of AoS. How they met, the drama and tension between their marriage, missions they went on, etc.\n\nPlot 2: Playing out the events after season 2 episode 21 when Bobbi is kidnapped and leading up to her and Hunter\u2019s departure from the team, as well as what happens after.\n\nPlot 3: Playing out whatever happens with Bobbi and Hunter after Hunter breaks Fitz out of prison in season 5 episode 5. \n\n\nSome info about me\n- I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+\n- I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply\n- I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out\n- I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does\n- I would prefer literate partners\n\nLike I said, I am definitely open to doubling or even you playing other characters besides Hunter if you are interested. (NOTE: the one character I WILL NOT play with or against is Grant Ward. Just not something I can get behind.) Please PM me or comment if you\u2019re at all interested in playing in this world! \n",

I also want to get hyped for the next season that should be coming early next year!!! Yes I am very excited for it. Anyway I would like to write something in this amazing universe GRRM has created for us to enjoy. I normally don't play canon characters but for this I would love to write a character from the TV show. I am very well educated in the lore of the world so there is no problem there. If you absolutely can't play against a canon character I have some OCs. \n\nYou don't have to play a canon character is can be an OC. I have many canon characters I can play, so if you are interested in this message me and we can work something out!\n\nLately I have also been also feeling a lot of Harry Potter. I don't have as much lore knowledge of this world as GoT world but I still have adequate amount. I would also love to play a canon character for this either from marauders era or the trio era. You can play a canon or an OC I don't mind :D \n\nAnyway please message back and we can work something out. If there are other fandoms you are interested in let me know and maybe I am into them too. :P",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm Afy! As the title says, I am looking for a Star Wars roleplay. In particular, I'm looking for someone to play a male jedi to my female sith. My idea is that during a mission to destroy the Sith threat on a particular planet, a young Jedi gets left behind when a retreat is called. My Sith warrior finds him, and for one reason or another, she is unable to return to her master either. I am kind of imagining a reverse Kylo/Rey thing, but without all the whiny grandaddy issues...\n\nIt's just a simple start that definitely needs a bit of work. I would love to brainstorm something with someone. I do, however, have some requirements.\n\n\\-I would rather this takes place before the events of the movies. I love the time of the Sith and the Jedi, but my knowledge only stretches so far back. If you want to roleplay with me, you either need to be cool with messing up the Star Wars history a bit, or you need to know enough to guide me through it. I have seen all the movies, and all the TV shows. I also know some of the more basic history, like the Rule of Two. \n\n\\-I need someone with a grasp of punctuation and spelling, and who can give me something to reply to. I like working together in a roleplay, and I don't want to be the one constantly coming up with stuff for your character to react to. \n\n\\-For post length, I normally give a decent paragraph, though that changes depending on the scene and whether your character needs to reply to something my character has said or done. I'm not too picky about your post length, as long as you follow the above rule, and give me something to reply to.\n\n\\-Gore, smut, and other adult themes will probably pop up, so I do want something who is 18+. Sorry, I just can't imagine playing a Sith character without adult content present.\n\n\\-Please be patient with my reply speed. I will try to reply every day, but I do work full time, and I try to keep up a social life. I am on the North American West Coast (PST, I think?), but I am a bit nocturnal, so I tend to stay up late. \n\nI think that is all. When contacting me, please give a brief summary of what you are looking for in the roleplay, and any suggestions you might have toward the plot.",

            "selftext": "Hello  there! I\u2019m seeking a partner to roleplay an original idea that I have\u2026.  Normally I\u2019m not into Original plots, but I\u2019m trying to get my creative  juices flowing for a book that I\u2019m trying to write, and I feel that  roleplaying helps me do that. If you want to check out any of my  Fandoms, feel free to go over my other plots.\n\nI  do only roleplay over Email, that\u2019s really the only platform I\u2019m  comfortable with, as I don\u2019t check other platforms that often and I  don\u2019t have a discord. I ask that my roleplay partner(s) be 18+. I only  roleplay in Third Person and I tend to get out 2-5 paragraphs, and try  to match what my partner gives. I do ask that my partner roleplay 2-5  paragraphs as well.\n\nThe idea that I have  is basically a story about a former Assassin that fled her old life and  went into hiding. She meets a man and the two wed and form a family with  one another. Five years later, their home is attacked and she has to  fight to keep her family safe, revealing that she\u2019s not all who she  claimed to be. I think the roleplay itself can go numerous ways and  could be interesting. I\u2019m hoping the roleplay can be one of  action/romance and maybe a tad bit of Slice of Life. I do ask that  someone play the husband and we can discuss side characters. I also want the husband to be just a regular man, the  wife is supposed to be the bad\\*ss here. We can also  delve deeper into the plot once you contact me over PM.    \n\nPlease only message me if you are serious and you actually want to do this idea, and not something entirely different. \n\nHope to hear from you\\~!",

I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nSo, what am I looking for? I'm looking for stories based around the Lovecraftian Mythos, or even the atmosphere the stories emit! Dark and Hopeless, discoveries that shatter the human mind, etc. I would prefer to keep the timeline of the stories somewhere in the 1920s-1940s, and perhaps even multiple characters on their own paths around the world that collide towards each other as they creep closer to plunging into the unknown. I have several characters all with varying archetypes and looks, and even settings in mind! Alongside Lovecraft inspired horrors, I'm not against adding other mythos!\n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well. So, if you're going to play a male character just keep in mind I wouldn't want a romance arc.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

At least one large paragraph, or hopefully many of them. I want something where it is obvious how much effort is going into the plot and relations, not just something for back and forth to keep you busy for a while. I love effort, and really seeing that my partner is enjoying the roleplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does lead into my next point, romance! I love all sorts of romances! The cute, cuddly kind. The sort where they are always at each other's throats but make up in the end. The forbidden love sort of thing but not like Romeo and Juliet. Haha Now, this also includes sexuality and roles! I can play male or female characters. I can play the one in charge, or passive. Gay, or straight. (Although I have no experience in lesbian roleplays. None. Nada. Zip.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have sort of been hoping to do an omegaverse roleplay, because it's been a while since I've had a good one where my partner didn't go missing. Of course, this isn't all I'm open to though! There are a bunch of roleplays that I do, it's just a matter of asking, and keep in mind that I will ask you the same thing! I don't make roleplays on my own. I always come up with plots together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, feel free to PM me about any ideas or pairings you enjoy! If not, you will be questioned about it over Discord. Haha. I beg that you leave your Discord tag in the PM so I will be able to send you a friend request right away if I'm interested. I really don't check Reddit enough to hold a conversation here. Haha. It's been happening more often where people don't leave their tags, and it takes a lot longer for us to start talking, because I have to wait for you to respond back with your tag, which I already asked for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny further questions or comments, leave them in the PM and I will respond either here, or on Discord. Depending on if you're still the little rascal that doesn't leave their tag so I can't send a request right away. Haha. I will talk to you then!",

I am *pretty* fresh to the scene, having picked it up again in June. That said, I\u2019m still a literate and well written person. I tend to post 2-5 paragraphs per reply in my Roleplay, with some exceptions (such as fast paced dialogue or action scenes being shorter, and descriptive scenes being longer). Ideally, I\u2019d like a partner who can post at least once or twice a day, and if they can\u2019t, a partner who lets me know. I understand life gets hard or busy! I just really appreciate being kept up to date as opposed to left in the dark! I\u2019d also prefer a partner who\u2019s okay with developing a personal connection (with *limits*) ooc. I will try my hardest not to absolutely spam you with music and RP inspiration posts. &lt;3 \n\nI will require that we do quite a bit of planning before jumping in to the action. I don\u2019t require us to have the entire plot and narratives outlined, but I need at the very least some basic, loose structure to work off of. So if you\u2019re trying to just start a Roleplay without planning, this won\u2019t work out. :/\n\nI only RP with players over 18. I love NSFW side themes, including, but not limited to; drug use, violence, gore, sex, etc. I am really open minded with my Roleplay and ask that you be, too. As well as 18+. *Only* 18+ players will be considered! (For clarification, I will NOT do a NSFW sex centric plot. I prefer to keep that as a side thing, and not every other scene.) \n\nI\u2019m open to discussing genre and themes. I\u2019m not open to fandom RP, or cannon characters. Sorry! \n\nAs far as OC go, I can do male, female, creature, deity, and virtually any pairing. I do lean far more toward MxF or FxF pairings, though, and generally main F characters. I\u2019m not opposed to playing multiples, but do prefer to have a main. :) \n\nAs always, I am open to hearing and discussing your ideas, too. Shoot me a message if any of this interests you, and we can discuss from there! I do my roleplaying and chatting on discord! ",

A splash of dark age with a tasteful zest of colonial technology. Our fantasy includes something on par with the Witcher or Monster Hunter games. \n\n**Combat Systems:** We do use a little bit of DnD, but only enough to keep it fair. The roleplay is not run by DnD, and we don't require any kind of math. All rolls will be told to you by the Event/Dungeon Master (as well as some of the older members) so don't worry about having to learn anything straight away. (The system is super easy once you do it enough times). \n\n**Characters:** We allow only Humans, but we might consider other races in the later arcs depending on how the current cast proceeds. There is no magic-wielding, but as said, we might consider it in the future. Our cast consists of around ten active players. Each cast member is allowed two characters for now, so there is always roleplay going on. \n\nIf you'd like to find out more, please check out this thread!

            "selftext": "##Hello there traveler!\n\nIf you are reading this, then that means that you have found [A Roleplay of Ice and Fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/arpoiaf) - a collaborative writing community with a story set in the fictional world of A Song of Ice and Fire - either entirely by accident, or because you were looking for something different.\n\nYou've come to the right place!\n\nAs any roleplayer on reddit will tell you, there are more Game of Thrones-based RPs on reddit than can be counted on one hand. And if you include those that are no longer active, you might have to pull off your shoes and use your toes for those calculations!\n\nIt's easy to see why it's so popular - a vast world to explore with a myriad of cultures, yet with just enough left untold so that you, too, can pick up the pen and fill in those holes. The game of thrones tends to lend itself to be seen as just that - something to win at all costs, followed by the need for everything to be controlled by dice in an effort to level the playing field.\n\nBut you have to wonder - what happens to the story amidst spy and sabotage attempts or posts written simply to ensure that a character gains better odds on their next moon's skills-roll?\n\nPerhaps you've read all the books and are on tenterhooks waiting and wondering if and when the next one will come. You may instead be a fan of the HBO series, and have been anxiously awaiting the final season. Either way, it was the story that has drawn you in, time and again, and it's that story that has you here, now.\n\n**ARPOIAF has decided to get back to the basics.**\n\nYou will find no mechanics here; no claims lists full of troop numbers, levies, or economy spreadsheets. You will find a community of like-minded writers eager to post their chapters as a part of a never-ending tale where characters are limited only by your imagination, rather than your ability to min-max a skills sheet.\n\nA Roleplay of Ice and Fire is precisely that - a roleplay rather than a role playing game, where the world is built by the words woven upon the page and the plot is guided by the authors: the true masters of their characters' fates.\n\n##Prologue\n\n\nIt is the 370th year since Aegon\u2019s conquest. \n\nThe Long Night and the War for the Dawn interrupted the scramble for the throne of Westeros that began with the death of Robert Baratheon. The victory of the living over the dead came at a great cost and forced an armistice that satisfied no one.\n\n[Westeros remains divided](https://imgur.com/a/T1QtA3v) between two men who claim the title of King of the Andals, the Rhonyar, and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. In the east, the descendents of Aegon VI Targaryen and Shireen Baratheon sit upon the Iron Throne. In the west, the descendents of Tommen I Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell rule from the Golden Throne in Casterly Rock. With winter once again giving way to spring, the growing sentiment in both Royal Courts is that this state of affairs cannot endure indefinitely. \n\n*Two kings is too many.*\n\n##Roleplaying at ARPOIAF: Getting Started\n\n\n###What We Are\n[***A Roleplay of Ice and Fire***](https://www.reddit.com/r/arpoiaf/) is a roleplaying forum based here on Reddit, where users come together to write and collaborate in a shared world and their actions and decisions affect the people around them. It takes place after the events in the books have concluded, though in an alternate universe where the kingdom is split between kings Tommen I Baratheon and Aegon VI Targaryen following the War of Five Kings.\n\n###How the Roleplay Works\nThis is a reddit based RP - so all of the actual roleplay is done on /r/ARPOIAF. Basically, once you have your character approved and ready to go, you begin by posting to the sub - you write and describe what your character is doing, or going through, or thinking. Some people have storylines outlined before hand, and work toward some end goal. Others take in events around them, and develop their characters more organically. There is no right nor wrong way to go about it.\n\nThe key to any roleplay is interaction. Your character will be affected by the decisions and choices of other characters, especially those nearby. You can interact with these people by commenting on their posts (often called threads) and beginning a conversation. They will then reply, and so on, and so on. Its usually best to arrange such interactions OOC - use our [Discord chatroom](https://discord.gg/6UmrpB2) to get to know your fellow roleplayers.\n\nA big issue many new players have is grasping how the timeline works. Because this is a forum-style roleplay, and not everyone can be on all the time, our timeline works in a very fluid fashion. You're allowed to have more than one thread open, where your character is interacting with more than one person at a time. At this time there is no direct IC time - OOC time conversion. (More on how time works can be found below, in the TIme, Travel, and Distance section.)\n\nGetting the hang of reddit RP can take some time, but with the help of the ARPOIAF community, it won't be as hard as you think. All of Westeros and Essos is open to you - you, as your character, can interact with it however you see fit. Craft your character's story in a way that is meaningful to you - and watch as it meshes and builds upon the tales of those around you.\n\n###Creating a Character\nCreating characters on ARPOIAF is a simple two-step process, but before you begin you must first have a character in mind. Westeros, Essos, and the lands beyond are home to a wide cast of races, cultures, and civilizations, the vast majority of which are open for your choosing. You should, however, choose a character that you\u2019re interested in writing, and won\u2019t abandon. \n\nIf the house your character is from has not been established by another player in the RP, you\u2019re free to flesh out its family members. If a house you wish to play in has already been claimed, feel free to contact the player who established it, and talk to them about picking up a member. Most players are more than happy to share a house \u2013 but if they refuse, you must pick a different one. Though we do our best to make sure there are plenty of family members for new players to pick up, there are, of course, a limited number of members in each family. Late additions to Great Houses will not be accepted.\n\n[**Currently, we are accepting Major Character applications!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/arpoiaf/comments/90meu0/major_character_applications/)\n\n###Character Skills, Abilities, or Traits\nARPOIAF is a \u2018roleplay\u2019 (RP) rather than a 'roleplaying game' (RPG); that means your character\u2019s traits ought to come out through your writing, not a list of skills. It's advised that you don\u2019t create a character based around a skillset, but rather choose skills that fit the character you wish to create. There is no skills-sheet here, but writers must make note of any advanced skills or exceptional characteristics their character may possess on their application for approval. \n\nAbilities involving magic are approved at moderator discretion for players who have already proven themselves mature and responsible writers - this includes the possession of special creatures.\n\n###Applications\nOnce you have your character in mind, you\u2019re ready to move on to the character creation process. Completing the application is a fairly simple procedure, meant to be thorough and detailed without being overwhelming. It asks for the most basic aspects of the character you have in mind (their name, house, titles. age, appearance, etc.), but also requires an outline of your character\u2019s history, family, and household, and which gets you to make decisions on just who your character is. A successful application needs two moderators' approvals. \n\nTwo characters may be applied for when a writer initally joins the roleplay. All others must wait until these characters are adequately established.\n\n###Alts\nAlternate characters, or Alts, are characters that are played by a person who already has one or more previously established characters. In ARPOIAF you are allowed to make as many as you wish dependent on your activity level, whether or not you have dropped any characters, and at the discretion of the mods.  No two alts may be of the same house, and we encourage you to branch out, trying your hand at different regions, personalities, and walks of life.\n\n###Jumping In\nOnce your application has been approved by two moderators, you\u2019re ready to begin! How you do that is entirely up to you. It's often a good idea to get a general grasp of what has been going on in your region \u2013 this can be achieved by visiting our State of the Realm page, or by hopping on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6UmrpB2) to talk with our incredibly helpful community. Once you have your bearings, the world is yours to explore. Go on an adventure, try your hand at court intrigue, or attempt to expand on the glory of your house. How you roleplay is up to you.\n\n###Time, Travel, and Distance\nBecause ARPOIAF is a roleplay, not an RPG, the focus is on the story, not \u201cwinning\u201d. Things like travel and distance and time \u2013 while important \u2013 are also fairly malleable. There is no direct correlation between IC time and OOC time, nor is there a hard and fast rule on how long you should wait between posts when traveling. Most often such decisions are left to the discretion of the player, though of course the mods will step in if they feel action needs to be taken. A good way to keep things aligned is to remember that you cannot \u2018win\u2019 a roleplay. Attempting to move too quickly in an effort to defeat your opponents, or skipping over long stretches of time or distance to gain an advantage, are both examples of metagaming, and are frowned upon. Do your best to keep your timeline in line with other players. Communication with the rest of the community and the mod team is a fantastic way of doing this.\n\nThe moderators will keep a watchful eye out for time-bubbles and will help to facilitate moving past them, making decisions for absent writers if the need arises. The moderators will also keep players abreast of when a new moon is due to arrive, so that everyone can attempt to stay on the same page/timeline.\n\n###Wealth and Conquests\nTo continue on with the theme of \u2018there is no winning an RP\u2019, wealth and conquests are two features that are often too strongly focused upon by new players. No one is saying you cannot be rich, or conquer plenty of lands \u2013 but the story is the focus here, not artificial gains. While the overarching fortunes of your family can absolutely affect how you RP, the gritty details are usually unimportant.\n\nConquests are similar. If you mean to take up a title in Essos, or Westeros, and immediately begin to conquer the world, you\u2019ll find your process slow going. Wars are not fought nor won in a day. They take time to build up, prepare for, and execute. While major shifts in borders are possible, expected, and even hoped for, try to avoid creating a character just to wage war on others. We cannot stress enough that the focus should be on your story \u2013 not victory.\n\n###Battles\nThere are two ways for battles to be decided. The first way is for the participants to settle upon an outcome between them. If both parties agree on how the events occur, they can write out the battle as they see fit, and post it on the subreddit.\n\nIf the combatants cannot agree, however, a Narrator-run battle will take place. This is facilitated by the Narrator, and will be an interactive battle post in which success and damage rolls are made that will produce a binding and final decision.  Players may lose their characters in such a battle, or suffer wounds or capture.\n\n\n###Where You Fit In\nEach story and character is unique. Every player that joins ARPOIAF brings something to the table that wasn\u2019t there before, and is a valued and appreciated member of a story we all work together to create. Whether you wish to play as a king or beggar, merchant or mercenary, your tale will contribute to the lore of ARPOIAF, giving it depth, purpose, and hopefully giving your fellow RPers an even more fleshed out world to expand upon. What you choose to do with your time here is up to you \u2013 but every story, no matter its size or scope, is welcome.",

I'm a big Harry Potter fan and hope you are too!\n\nWhat I am looking for in a partner: Someone nice, familiar with the HP workd, and over 21 that enjoys making original characters and being involved in the plot. I do enjoy a bit of awkward teenage romance but don't really feel NSFW is appropriate. That said- I have a cute hufflepuff character that needs a girlfriend or boyfriend!!\n\nCharacters: I have a LOT of original characters I've made up. I have characters in every house and in almost every gender, so I'm sure we can find a good match.\n\nI see the timeline as being sometime Before Harry came to school. \n\nStrange plants, magical creatures, sneaking out of bed at night- The plot can be something we work on together make up as we go. \n\nI rp via kik or discord so PM me and let's create together!",

            "selftext": "The city of Crimzianita was a sprawling capital of humanity. Being built years ago, humans had maintained it for their glory to be shown to the other races that settled around the continent of Liera. \n\nIt wasn't until just a few years that the other races began to move into Crimzianita for he safety that the walls brought. First it was the Dwarves, then the Gnomes, on and on other races began to seek refuge in the city. At first, many of the humans fought to kick out the invaders believing they were invading their city, but when more and more humans began to vanish, they became more willing to allow others in. \n\nIt was only rumors at first, about the spreading disease. It was said to take the mind of the person and rewrite it, others spoke that the skin was the first to show symptoms. Whatever the case one thing was certain, to contract this disease meant certain death and corruption. \nThe races forced away from their homes helped the humans defend their capital and reinforce their new home. \n\nYears have passed since the start of the outbreak but everyone knew of the dangers outside of Crimzianita. Plagued victims, or The Lifeless, still roamed, killing or infecting anyone they came across. \nHundreds went to their side everyday when those who wanted to reclaim their homes left. \n\nBut there was hope. A group called *The Dawning Light* had emerged among the turmoil and distress. They were the first to show courage and fight against The Lifeless. They forged weapons that could pierce the sword steel skin of their foes. But their greatest member was not the strongest, nor the smartest. It was a child who had been found outside the city walls injured and infected, but unturned. They were able to heal their wounds quickly and speed the recovery of others who were injured. \n\nDue to the child's immunity to the disease, a party was formed in an attempt to lead this child to the source of the disease in an attempt to stop it. A group of adventures were called to the halls of the dawning light in order to receive the supplies and orders for their journey. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHello everyone, I hope you're doing well this evening~ I also hope my prompt didn't wear you out too much or at least interested you enough~\nAnyways, I am looking for either a partner or a group of people to do a very story based roleplay in a new world called Liera. \nYou will be an adventure sent out of the safety of Crimzianita in search for the source of a terrible disease. If you're interested, please send me a message on discord at GhostBlade4654#9820 or join the server directly with this link {https://discord.gg/BJEQj9g}\nPlease send a character reference along with \n\nRace (using DnD races but if you have another idea ask about it~!)\nAge\nGender (Ask if you want to use \"something special\", whatever that may be)\nClass/Training (Again, DnD classes but any other ones just ask)\nA small character bio\n\nOnce we have characters sorted out we'll start~! I will be playing as the child and the DM for this~ \nYou may place NPCs as long as you get an okay from me. \n\nAnyways, I've rambled long enough. I hope I get a good group of you together~! \n",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am a twenty-something female rper with years of experience in roleplay. After a short summer hiatus, I've decided to start something new with another player. I prefer to use the Discord platform for roleplay. I do not use skype, KIK, or e-mail.\n\nI am looking for someone who is interested in playing more than one character for this story. I will be playing more than one myself as well.\n\nIn order of preference, here are the scenarios I am most interested in roleplaying in:\n\n* \\- Medieval\n* \\- Medieval Fantasy\n* \\- Post Apocalyptic\n\nI am a very laid back person but there are a few things I am **definitely not looking for** in someone:\n\n* \\- Ghosting. Inactivity happens but at least be courteous enough to alert me that you'll be inactive and when I can expect a response from you.\n* \\- Roleplay that involves any child abuse.\n* \\- People who don't make an effort to emote more than just the words they speak. ( I can sometimes type a paragraph and sometimes just a worded response. I believe there should be a good balance in that for both parties )\n\nI am hoping to make a friend and mesh well with someone with a decent vocabulary and an interest on building their characters. I love to invest in my characters and watch them grow. This is why it is important to me that I find someone who is also interested in these things and is willing to give a long term roleplay session a shot.\n\nIf this seems like something that would interest you, please feel free to send me a message. I will answer any questions as well. We can exchange discord information and together come up with a scenario and characters that we both think will be super fun to develop together.\n\n**tldr:** I am an experienced roleplayer looking for longterm friendo to develop a fun story with fun characters via discord.

One day you came over and dropped the ball that you were going into the marines (or any other military branch) and didn\u2019t want to keep me waiting for you, meaning we broke up, while at the time I was heartbroken I soon realized that this was your decision and respected it.  You had promised me that when you came home if we were both still single we would be together, so long as the feelings were still there.  Six (plus?) years have passed since then and I still haven\u2019t seen you.  You disappeared after you got out and no one has heard from you since, as time goes by your dad passed away and somehow you hear of it, you decide that it\u2019s time to come home, at least for his funeral.  \n\nThis scene is meant to be dramatic, but ultimately romantic, there\u2019s a lot of wiggle room on all aspects of the scene but this is the general idea.  \n\nScene 2: We live in a world where all supernatural things exist and when there are supernatural beings, there are also hunters searching for those beings.  I am a vampire and you are a hunter, after tracking me for years, you\u2019ve finally caught up here we stand face to face in a dark alley way.\n\nOnce again would love for this to be a dramatic and romantic role :) \n\nA bit about me I\u2019m 19 and have been roleplaying for about 8 years, I\u2019m a sucker for romance and love \u201clove\u201d.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

            "selftext": "In this rp, we would both take part in constructing the rp together, and would center around one of us playing Darkrai on a quest to awaken/revive an ancient entity that was locked away by Arceus that may be their precursor. The other person would play characters from the anime, and this would take place in a custom large island region called Pyaki that has a capital named Jiro City. I will also post the bio of the precursor in this rp below. Must be able to play both male and female roles. This may also have NSFW moments. Please, also remind me of type matchups and Pok\u00e9mon I forget.\n\nName: Zaryn\nAppearance: 8 foot tall, pitch black bipedal creature with a head like Darkrai but with no white part, 2 red eyes, and a jagged stop, and a jaw it can open full of sharp teeth. It has spikes all over it\u2019s back and blade like protrusions on it\u2019s fists with claws as well.  It has 5 fingers like a human.\nType: Dark, Poison?\nMain Abilities: \nSoul Plague: A plague that corrupts the very soul of a human, making them a violent entity with black, oily blood and completely pitch black eyes, and changing hair to black and skin to pale. Other symptoms are extreme violence, and mania.\nThe Corruption: Corrupts an area and changes all Pok\u00e9mon in it to dark versions of themselves. It\u2019s realm is completely corrupted.\nRest of it\u2019s abilities are strikingly similar to Darkrai\u2019s abilities, and some more things as well that will he explained in RP.\nDiet: Carnivorous.\nStrengths and Weaknesses: In the dark, it can heal itself easily and can evade attackers quite well if needed. In the light, it is almost impossible for it to heal and has the vision of a normal human, unable to see things of supernatural nature. Something like a flashbang would blind it of course for a bit, but also hurt it. Not only will Zaryn be the main enemy, but he will also have his own Cult of sorts, Team Dark Sky. They are a menace to society, more than most \u2018teams\u2019 in the Pok\u00e9mon series as they focus in a more cult-like manner. They\u2019ll kill themselves if they feel they\u2019ve failed Zaryn. They\u2019ll sacrifice both humans and Pok\u00e9mon. And like other teams, they\u2019ll have a base as well in a strangely high tech manner, attempting to continue the work Zaryn once worked on himself...and they\u2019re succeeding. They also have an opponent, a team of ex-military, mafia, any combat role, you name it. It\u2019s called Clear Sky [Yes, a Stalker Reference] dedicated to stopping them at any cost.\n\nEdit: Presets: Presets will help if you want to play a set role instead of an OC. You can choose more than one\n\nPreset 1: Ash \n\nPlay as Ash and his Pok\u00e9mon. You\u2019ve recently moved into Jiro City, and have met some nice people. At night though, You occasionally see a purple glow from the nearby forest...\n\nPreset 2: Team Rocket\n\nPlay as Jesse, James, and Meowth, etc.. \n\nYou\u2019ve been sent to a cave in Pyaki near Jiro City to check in on a lab in a cave investigating a temple older than most known history. You were never fully briefed why, and have a bad feeling about it...\n\nPreset 3: Darkrai\n\nPlay as Darkrai on it\u2019s quest to awaken it\u2019s precursor. You\u2019re almost there, just a little further....\n\nPreset 4: Arceus\nPlay as Arceus on a quest to stop Dark Sky from making an abomination. It turns out you\u2019re too late, and they\u2019ve made something called Neorai with a mix of DNA from something called The Void, Darkrai, and Zaryn...it is the perfect life form, to them. It is going to corrupt the entire world to be like Zaryn\u2019s Dark World.\n\nPreset 5: Neorai\n\nPlay as the abomination known as Neorai. You look like Darkrai, just...imagine what a mega evolution would look like, I have a pic, but give it stronger legs, a green eye, and the power of a god that died before Arceus, unknown to anyone but the \u2018cursed\u2019 and the \u2018blessed\u2019, which is Neorai.\n\nPreset 6: Myrrah\nPlay as a Ancient Lucario. Bio is below.\n\n\nName: Myrrah\n\nRace: Void Lucario\n\nType: Dark-Fighting\n\nAge: ???\n\nBio: There was once a war between Humans and Lucarios. Myrrah was a normal soldier, until his left arm was ripped off and was visited by a Void Monster, and given the power to regenerate by hatred. His hate fuels his power. When they surrendered, he ran away and became a killer of anything living until he died and went to the Void. He now has escaped into Pyaki, and is ready to kill again...\n\nPM me if interested.",

            "selftext": "The Lands of Asteria Season 3 is the third season of an ongoing roleplay.\n\nThe plot so far goes like this; Tensions between the King Gark II\u2019s army and the military of the Yemont Knights had been rising over the past decade, and they finally hit a peak in the year of 466. It stepped up to the next level when the king at the time, Nassir Wolfe, declared war against the Gark Army and a battle was initiated. The battle lasted a mere hour, with the Orc race on the verge of extinction and the Yemont Knights coming out victorious. Sadly, the king was killed in the battle and was later replaced with Kylan Wolfe. The Yemont Knights, under Kylan's guidance, began to become more and more tyrannical after their victory against King Gark II. They became more cruel towards those they disliked, to the point where they were executing the innocent simply for existing. As a result a band of rebels, known as the Valtorians, sprung into action. It seemed like they were losing the fight when they suddenly managed to assassinate one of the field commanders of the Yemont Knights. Disorganized and in a state of chaos, the king offered the Valtorians a compromise that tore the racial laws down and restored peace and order. Now it has been 2 years since the previous events. It is spring of 468, and peace finally seems to have been restored once more. The Valtorians and the Yemont Knights are getting along amongst each other and racism seems to be non-existent. Everything would be going smoothly, if it weren't for... one individual.\n\nTLoA recently went under a few changes that shifted the focus of the Roleplay from a Faction-Focused RP to a Character-Focused RP. Due to this change the server is in a sort of \"Fresh Wipe\" state, as people are remaking their characters for the new season. Now is the best time to join in, as no knowledge of the past two seasons is required to enter the third season.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/VKTujKj\n\n( Also note; our lore now has mobile support!

My work schedule is a bit sporadic, but I can usually find blocks of times available to chat or write with a partner if you\u2019re not looking to play by post. I tend to post rather long, detailed posts anywhere between two to four paragraphs in the third person perspective. It would be ideal if I could find a partner that can match this, but if you feel you can progress or develop the story or situation with less I\u2019d be up for giving it a go. For this ad I\u2019ll only be using Discord to roleplay as I find it to be quite convenient and easy to use. Finally, I live in the Pacific Time Zone and am mostly available in the late evening, generally after 8 PM is a safe bet.\n\nAt one point or another, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all wished we could be whisked away to some magical land that only exists in books, shows, games, or our imaginations. I\u2019m proposing that our characters start the scenario off here, on Earth, living out their lives as either close friends or co-workers. Then, by means of some unknown, yet powerful anomaly, they're transported to an unfamiliar time or place having only each other to trust and rely on as they traverse these unknown lands. I realize that while this premise is not necessarily the most original or creative one out there, I still think that it provides us a prompt that is full of interesting and intriguing possibilities!\n\nI\u2019d prefer there to be some elements of fantasy involved in this, paired with major themes of romance, adventure, and action. For the romance, I\u2019d really like this to be something that develops over time and not rushed into. I\u2019d even prefer that just before they're both swept away to another land, both of our characters are actually in committed relationships, though there can be some chemistry or light/comical flirting so that there is a base to build off of. Action and adventure, I feel will happen rather naturally as they try and find their place in this new world, but I am up for discussing these themes in greater detail in DMs. I\u2019d also like to mention that I\u2019d eventually like there to be the possibility of some NSFW play once a romantic relationship between our characters has been established. It does not need to be a driving theme, but I would like to play it out every now and then when they get to that point. As I\u2019d like to keep this ad SFW, I will not be going into any further detail about this, any questions regarding it can be asked through DMs.\n\nIn regard to the new world the characters will be travelling to, I\u2019m up for anything from your favorite medieval fantasy setting to something futuristic or sci-fi based. I\u2019m even up for a bit of world building if that\u2019s your thing, however this is a great undertaking and takes a lot of time, patience, and collaboration. Below you\u2019ll find a list of a few themed settings that came to mind while writing up this ad. Please don\u2019t panic if you don\u2019t see something you like, you\u2019re more than welcome to tell me your own desires and suggestions. I might add that I really like the idea of our characters eventually developing fantasy-based powers or skills that pair with the setting we select as a byproduct of the anomaly that transported them there. If you\u2019d like, we can even have aspects of their appearance be changed, yet I\u2019d like their personalities and memories to be intact.\n\nWorld of Warcraft\n\nStar Wars / Star Trek\n\nMarvel/DC Universe\n\nFinal Fantasy Based Worlds\n\nKingdom Hearts\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender / The Legend of Korra\n\nHarry Potter\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nWell that wraps up my ad, thanks again for stopping by. If you have any questions, comments, or are just interested in playing, feel free to shoot me a DM with a little information about yourself and the world you\u2019d like to see us travel to.\n\nHave a good one!",

If you'd like we can discuss plots and scenarios over PM :) And if you'd like to try a fandom we can discuss it! I'm open to trying a fandom, perhaps Overwatch! Or My Hero Academia since I just got into that! I know they\u2019re real life people but maybe something with the Rooster Teeth personalities, I\u2019m open :) if you have a fandom you wanna suggest please do! Also I would like a partner is 18+.

I was 17 when I woke up one morning and as I opened my eyes the first thing I noticed in my small room was the words \"You've slept well and have gained the Buff 'Well Rested!'\". I blinked as I saw the message and I started to get up \"Okay, maybe I should lay off the game\" I said softly as I started to get dressed for the day. It was going to be a cool day so I started to put on my usual clothes when I saw some text hover over my favorite red and black jacket \"Lucky Jacket!\" And when I put it on I saw more text pop up \"Your Luck has gone up by one point!\" I sighed softly as I ignored it at first while I walked down the stairs of my home and I heard my stomach growl once I smelled eggs and toast, so I knew my mother was awake early for a Saturday morning. As I started to sit down I saw a question mark hover over her head \"Cole(name may change) after breakfast will you go to the store to get some stuff?\" As she spoke a message appeared in front of me saying \"Will you accept this Quest? Y/N?\" I shook my head \"Sure thing mom...\" I said as I started to eat while it finally sunk in that something was wrong with me...*\n\nHello and thank you for reading my little prompt! In this roleplay I've been really wanting to do I would be playing as a teen who wakes up with the magic ability called \"Game\" which allows him to see and do every thing like a character in a game!

I can write in first and love tons of description and details. All I ask of you is that you try and reply in good detail, a paragraph will do. Please check your grammar. I don't kind small mistakes but I want to be able to read what you're writing. You don't have to reply frequently, I understand everyone has responsibilities but please don't go MIA for a week without letting me know. At any time during the roleplay you have the right to leave if you don't like it. Whether it's because you don't like my style or you don't like the plot. You can just tell me, I won't be offended. Their goes for me to. If are styles don't match or I find the plot boring I will tell you. theres no point in it if were not having fun. Alrighty my list of requirements are over, I hope that wasn't too much! Let's move on to story lines! I'm perfectly fine with FxM or FxF pairings. I've never played a male role before so I can't do MxM sorry:( Feel free to send me your ideas to!\n\n- Zombie apocalypse! Two people stranded together. Will they survive and find shelter? Will they find other people? Will they fall in love? I would prefer this RP to be longterm. \n- No eacape! We're stuck in an elevator together. How will we eacape? Will someone find us? This is a short term roleplay. \n- *Roommates? It's your first day of college and you meet your roommate. It's a girl?!? This is a MxF pairing.\n- *Mansion! Your long lost uncle had past away. You barely knew him but he left you in his will. You got a mansion? Woah. You arrive to the beautiful house, but you weren't alone. There's a maid. A rather seducing one at that. Can be long term or short term. \n\nIf you made it this far thank you! If you're interest in roleplay with me drop a message. I prefer you have a small promt so I can see your style. In can be something you've wrote before or completely new. It doesn't have to be long a paragraph will do:) \n\nMika~\n",

            "selftext": "[WICKED PRAYERS](http://wickedprayers.jcink.net/index.php?act=idx) is a free-form forum PbP modern realistic crime RP with an Occult twist and Lovecraftian themes, set in an alternate-history version of New York. Drawing heavily from the rituals and practices of real-life syndicates and occultists, this a world with a dark underbelly, where voices whisper from the shadows and magic runs through the veins of the Earth itself.  &amp;nbsp;\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\nThe game focuses on the city's four major organized crime syndicates, their supernatural abilities, the NHPD struggling to bring them to justice, and the hapless civilians drawn into a hidden underworld of magic and sin.  &amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis 'season' of plot arcs focus around the activities of the New Haven Reaper, a shadowy figure who stalks and ritualistically butchers those linked with the criminal underworld. As his targets become ever more high-profile, both the syndicates and the NHPD are pouring their efforts into finding and stopping him - but can any of them do it alone, or will a fragile alliance have to be struck?  &amp;nbsp;\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\n'Season 2' will focus around technology and the Deep Web, and the secrets and spirits that haunt it.  &amp;nbsp;\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease note that although we allow adult NSFW content (violence, drug use, sex), it is not the primary focus of the game.  &amp;nbsp;\n \n &amp;nbsp;\n\n**Featuring:**\n\n- 18+ Jcink Premium;\n\n- Deep holistic side-wide plots led by a team of four GMs;\n\n- An expansive, hidden metaplot, and Faction secrets to be uncovered by the curious and fearless;\n\n- A simple and lightweight system of mechanics that allow for character customization, progression, and levelling without dice or stats;\n\n- A unique and fully-functional Justice System for cat-and-mouse games between the Cops and the Robbers;\n\n- An in-game Magic Items store;\n\n- Monthly headlines and newspaper catchups;\n\n- Flexible Face Claim/Played-By rules - both art-based and photomedia FC/PB's accepted;\n\n- A friendly, literate, and dedicated global playerbase;\n\n- An active Discord that is embedded on the forum itself, allowing users without Discord accounts to log in and interact\n\n- A relaxed and experienced Admin team who constantly update and adapt the game to best serve the community.  &amp;nbsp;\n \n &amp;nbsp;\n\nPlayable factions:\n\n- **NHPD:** Both honest and crooked cops with no innate supernatural edge, pitted against both the horrors and the temptations of the underworld - and those who inhabit it;\n\n- **Mafia:** Powerful and charismatic autocrats with a stranglehold on the wealthy elite, gifted with Blood Magic from a mysterious benefactor;\n\n- **Bratva:** Rebellious, anti-authoritarian thieves and tricksters who gain their power from the Slavic god Veles;\n\n- **Triads:** Secretive and ruthless manipulators from the shadow, followers of the Dragon King;\n\n- **Cartel:** Hedonists and libertines gifted with the powers of Life, Death, and Fire from their messianic and unpredictable leader;\n\n- **Civilians:** Ordinary people with ordinary lives - but with some extraordinary gifts of their own.  &amp;nbsp;\n \n &amp;nbsp;\n\nWe are currently accepting all characters from all backgrounds, and for all factions. We are specifically seeking Occult Investigators from all factions, and characters with strong leadership qualities.  &amp;nbsp;\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\nInterested?

            "selftext": "Hey people! I am a seasoned (decently) Role-Player looking for a Literate RP. I have so many cool character ideas that I want to put to use with Original works. I love fighting scenes and I love writing them as well. My favorite style of RP is one written in EITHER 1st or 3rd person. It can be either past or present tense but I do prefer past.\n So what exactly do I want from an RP? I want development in the characters, the setting, the relationship between the two main characters, and so on. I love having romance involved but it can be platonic. For those looking for Bad-Assery, plot twists, dark themes, grittiness, blood curdling scenes, and so forth...please PM me. I know all of this sounds so all over the place but that's why I'm reaching out to the amazing RP section here on Reddit. \n\nOther info: I'm Male and 19 years of age. I am Heterosexual. I do indeed play female characters because flexibility is a key factor when becoming a good author (Something I wish to be one day). \n\nSo Yea, if my unorganized ad hasn't scared you off yet, shoot me message, we can get to forming our own plot, and bam! \n\nPS. I'm available almost at all times through the day when I'm not working which is 5PM to 11PM CST. \n",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I\u2019m looking for someone to do a detailed (1+ paragraphs depending on the scene) roleplay with centered around star-crossed lovers. I always find this situation leads to a good amount of character development and drama!\n\nI have a few scenarios in mind, but I\u2019m absolutely open to suggestions! As you\u2019ll be able to tell, I really enjoy roleplays that take place during a period in history, but I\u2019m also more than happy to do one in present day! I enjoy history, but I\u2019m by no means an expert so don\u2019t worry about sticking exactly to the facts! Just one more thing: I really prefer it when our characters are 18+, as I\u2019m 20 and I don\u2019t really like roleplaying much younger than my age.\n\n1910s/1920s star-crossed lovers\n-The female would be a young woman from a very rich and powerful family. The male would be a young man either in the military or working as a bootlegger (depending on whether we do the 1910s or 20s).\n\n1940s star-crossed lovers\n-The male would be either a prisoner of war held captive in an enemy county or a soldier occupying that country. The female would either be a nurse on the opposing side or a citizen in the country being occupied, depending on the scenario. \n\n1960s star-crossed lovers\n-One of the characters would be a greaser and the other would be in the preppy crowd. \n\nAnd a little more out there... Hunger Games star-crossed lovers\n-We would use our own original characters. They would be from separate districts and we\u2019d roleplay them from training and throughout the games. (In this scenario, the characters would be younger since it\u2019s the Hunger Games)\n\nPlease PM me if you\u2019re interested!\n\nThanks!\n\n",

By \"lead\" I mean play as a character who knows more about the ins and outs of the foundation than my character. My character will be relatively new to the foundation and under your supervision for the time being as a sort of training. The exact occupation of my character will depend on yours. For example, if you're a researcher, I'm a researcher. If you're a field operative, then so am I, etc. \n\nOther than being a female and a \"rookie\" so to speak in the foundation, I want to shape my character to coincide with yours. I'm open to romance of both mxf and fxf, or even now romance at all. However I do want our characters to become close in some way. We can talk more about your character and the direction we want the roleplay to go, but please come with at least a few ideas to work with.\n\nAs for my writing style, I tend to prefer at least a few good paragraphs, but I don't mind a few short replies, especially in dialogue scenes. I usually reply multiple times a day, but am flexible in this regard and understand life gets in the way sometimes. Please try to reply at least once a day however. Also for this Roleplay, I'd like to keep it in first person because I enjoy the intimacy of it. \n\nIn your writing please be able to:\n\nUse correct grammar (small mistakes here and there are fine, I'm not a grammar nazi)\n\nControl NPC's (important. Just keeps the story going.)\n\nAdd to plot. (It why fall entirely on you to do this, both of us are responsible for keeping the story moving.)\n\nCheck spelling. (Autocorrect happens but try to correct it when you can.)\n\nBe descriptive. (Help me envision what you're envisioning!)\n\nNot be controlling. (Don't control my character. No one likes a god modder.)\n\nSorry if I seem really strict. I'm a really easy going person once you get to know me, I swear! Send me a pm and we can talk! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n-Volva",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

            "selftext": "# Fallout: Dust  \n\n\" After the fall, little remained of the old Mojave Wasteland. Once-powerful factions such as Caesar's Legion, Great Khans, and Powder Gangers were either wiped out or dissolved into roaming gangs of tribals and survivors. Cannibalism became rampant, as people did whatever they could to survive. The NCR remained in control of various locations such as Camp Golf, Hoover Dam, and Nellis AFB. Those fortunate enough to evacuate the Mojave mostly wound up at Camp Adytum, an NCR/Followers refugee centre in the Boneyard. The NCR would eventually launch expeditions into the ruins of New Vegas, presumably to acquire materials left over from the Lucky 38 laboratories. However, none of these expeditions were successful, and the NCR soon abandoned all attempts to return to New Vegas. \"  \n\n# What this includes: \n\n\\- A RP based off the Fallout New Vegas Mod, Dust. It uses it's lore, and will contain a harsh RP for those looking for a realistic 'edge' to Fallout RP. \n\n\\- Open positions for staff or lore helpers/writers. \n\n\\- Fresh and new, allowing people to shape the RP to their standards (with permission, of course.) \n\n\\- Inter to advanced RP which will be mandatory. \n\n\\- Perk system which resets after characters death!\n\n\\- A character sheet which allows you to change and develop your character. \n\nLink: [https://discord.gg/sCgXGhr](https://discord.gg/sCgXGhr)  ",

It would be focussing on an adventure with lots of romance, with our two characters against the world, forbidden love or even just exploring the world together! There will be action as that is what i love to write and i think that I excell at it. In the slower periods with no action, there will be romantic scenes (which i also love to write) or high tense yet non-action based scenarios.\n\nI would love for this to take place in universes from games, an examples being the Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem or other fantasy based games. If you have any other ideas of worlds/timeframes that you want to have our RP take place in, please let me know!\n\nThe Characters we would play would be OCs of sorts that fit in the universe. This would be like a Ylissian Mage or a Zora Soldier.\n\nIf you are interested, feel free to message! I dont bite!\n\n**ONLY LOOKING FOR 18+**\n\nWe would be doing this via Reddit PMing or Discord so I can't wait to see some orange envalopes in my mailbox today and I hope we can write great RP together!\n\nThanks for Reading!\n\n-Chris",

            "selftext": "Hello to all! I am here today to present a roleplaying server in need of new people!  \nLet me give you a brief overview of the world to whet your appetite:\n\nThree hundred years ago, the continent of Kaith was torn asunder by a war of massive and world-changing scale. Ninety years ago, Kaith finally recovered to a time of relative peace and calmness. It did not last long. It has been half a century since a mighty, impossibly powerful force known only as Sylosh began the ruthless conquest of the rest of the known world. Pain, famine and suffering are all that remains to mark the passing of the imperial legions. However, there are those that choose to believe in a better world on the horizon. Those that fight despite the bitter odds and unimaginable cruelty of Sylosh spreading like a plague throughout the known world. In the far East, in the ancient desert kingdoms ruled by their various Sandprinces, the remaining princes try to set aside their differences and band together in the hopes of a proper defense.\n\n  \nIn the North-West, the cold holdings of Risendar yet stand, using their brutal approach to warfare and the aid of less civilized former foes in the cold tundras and danger-ridden mountains to the North as a way to stem the flow of Sylosh's forces into their lands.  Finally, to the South-East, the noble knights of Feralein yet remain despite their capital having been seized by the enemy. They fight in the forests and on the open fields, hoping to rouse warriors out of their passivity to finally deal a blow to Sylosh\u2019s seemingly limitless power.  But there is little hope left, as those that remain try desperately to hold off the coming tide to no avail.   The world will soon belong to Sylosh. As will everything in it. \n\nIn this roleplay, your characters can either - through conflict and difficult decisions - grow to support the rebellious aspects of the world and work with them to end Sylosh\u2019s tyrannical conquests\u2026 or assist the Empire in truly dominating all of Kaith. The roleplay takes place in its own world with its own kingdoms, races, magic systems and more! In any case, if you\u2019re interested and have questions I\u2019ll be happy to answer them either here if you want to send me a message or directly on the discord server here: [https://discord.gg/PPden96](https://discord.gg/PPden96), where you can find all the information we have in our extensive documentation!   \n\n\nHoping to see you soon,  \nEmmeris",

            "selftext": "**Hey my fellow RPers!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n\n***I got permission to use this format from a previous RPer who quit***",

It would center around a living human, her capture, her escape, and a mysterious organization called PM9 using the DNA from Kamabo Co and modifying it to forcefully create soldiers with no free will, and making an \u2018Ultra\u2019 strain of it. You would be playing a Inkling or Octoling OC, and You would eventually join the Squidbeak Splatoon in a fight against PM9. PM9 would also use ink weapons. I have a few presets if you would like to play someone besides an OC as well below.\n\nPreset 1: Agent 4\nYou\u2019re already part of the Squidbeak Splatoon, It\u2019s been 2 months since the Great Zapfish incident. Now a new threat has risen: PM9. They\u2019ve been after something in Inkopolis, and your objective is to find out what, and stop them if needed. Their gender in this would be female.\n\nPreset 2: Callie/Marie\nPlay as Callie or Marie instead of your OC. Not much to say here, similar to Preset 1 in objective.\n\n\n Preset 3: Agent 3.\nPlay as Agent 3 instead of Agent 4 in preset 1. Must have beaten the recently released Octo expansion for no spoilers. You would look the same as normal, Just with the Octo Expansion cape as well. \n\nPreset 4: Agent 8\nPlay as Agent 8, the star of the Octo Expansion. You\u2019re familiar with the Sanitized, so you know their ins and outs and would prove to be a valuable asset.\n\nPreset 5: Play as Pearl, Marina, or both!\nNot too much to say here, either that or I\u2019d rather design this one with you.\n\nPreset 6: Play as an OC.\nPlay as an OC of yours, and become a new agent.\n\nPM me if interested.\n\nUpdate for a PM9 Plan and Equipment: PM9 will now have Exoskeleton troopers, equipped with mechanical Exoskeletons to boost their strength, agility, and almost all physical abilities, and ones in Elite Exoskletons are immune to ink. A new plan of theirs would also be to reverse the Calamari Inkantation as well, causing high aggression and for affected to attack the ones they love, basically anyone in a fury of rage, despair, and doubt of their own cause.

            "selftext": "**Hey my fellow RPers!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n\n* Low Fantasy\n\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n\n* Sci-Fi\n\n* Horror\n\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n\n* Warcraft\n\n* DC Universe\n\n* Marvel Universe\n\n* Assassin's Creed\n\n* Borderlands\n\n* Dishonored\n\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!\n\n***I got permission to use this format from a previous RPer who quit*** ",

I don't do slice of life but if you really want to and you're literate we can work something out. I'd like you to at least write a chunky paragraph or basic paragraphs two at best. I don't usually freak about this area here, just no text talk. Smut is fine, but I don't want it as priority. I want it to be meaningful to the plot itself, if you're looking for smut you messaged the wrong person haha. Now onto Plots, I can also play male as well, anyway I enjoy Midieval Times and if you want to throw fantasy in there. Or if you don't I still dig it! Not huge on basic fantasy. On this topic, Werewolves and Vampires is a interesting topic I have ideas for this one even. I enjoy, Marvel and Dc comic stories, Percy Jackson which is frankly my favorite thing to do in this list, and lastly Avatar the last Airbender. This one is very interesting at well. I never done one but hey if you're interested!\n\nFinally, message me your Kik through Pm if you're interested.",

Today I'm presenting to you a new RP!\n\nThis RP is centered on the popular manga/anime series Tokyo Ghoul!\n\nSo have you ever wanted to RP as a Ghoul or a member of the CCG? \n____________________\n\nLink to Group:https://discord.gg/AAWSkXw\n\n____________________________\n\n***This server is NSFW for Gore, Bloodshed, and Heavy Language, as is the nature of the anime and manga.***\n\nWe want to have fun and bring together people from the same fandoms to get along and roleplay as well as attempting to murder each other for the sake of the roleplay :D\n\nPlot:\n\n* This Tokyo Ghoul RP takes place in the 23 wards of that make up the most populous areas of Tokyo.\n In this, a war has broken out between humans and ghouls. The organization **K\u00b2 or Blood Compact** *(Ketsueki Konpakuto,\u8840\u6db2 \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8)* has taken over the wards 14-21 which they now call **The Red City** *(Reddoshiti, \u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30c6)*\n\n* The **CCG** has chosen Wards 11, 09, 03, 02, 08, and 23 as the main quarter of operations, collectively called **The Light Zone** *(Raitoz\u014dn, \u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30be\u30fc\u30f3)*. \n\n*  A small but expanding league of both ghouls and humans called The Treaty (J\u014dyaku, \u6761\u7d04) intend to stop the war, but they don't know where to start. \n \n* So far the war has been much like the Cold War, dormant and unyielding. \n\nThe setting is Modern day Tokyo.\n\nWe are looking for rule-abiding people to join this RP, like in most places you have to follow the rules, so if you are a rule-abiding person, you are free to join. We currently only have a small player-base and I mean extremely small so we're looking for new members!\n\nI hope you do join and have a happy day!",

            "selftext": "[Discord] Hello adventurer! Have you ever dreamed about venturing around the world fighting monsters and demons? Maybe you'd like to be a villain and cause chaos and mayhem? Well then, I think I have a place just for you fellow adventurer. Tale of Hope &amp; War, a place where you can make your own story. Hello! my name is Xeno, co-founder and developer of a dice-based roleplay called Tale of Hope &amp; War. Tale of Hope &amp; War is a roleplay set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world, where only a few cities have survived and mobilized the cities themselves. We offer a unique system that consists of traits, skilltrees and items with unique abilities. Lore-wise the world of Tale of Hope &amp; War is riddled with corruption from the gods, who have tried to invade the corporeal plane to obtain artifacts left behind by the elder gods, objects of immense power. Sadly these artifacts are also what keeps the world alive. So in order to survive mankind and other species have to become strong, strong enough to fend off the avatars of gods and perhaps the very gods themselves. For a god stepping into the corporeal plane is the cause of cataclysm. If you wish to join us please feel free to take a look, we're always happy for new players to join! Come on down and join us as we tell you a Tale of Hope &amp; War! https://discord.gg/uUx6Q7Y",

            "selftext": "Hiya fellow ladies. Just a heads up, this is gonna be a long post!\nAs specified; I do only roleplay with females, I apologise for anybody else interested who doesn\u2019t fit that, but that\u2019s my preference and it won\u2019t change, so please don\u2019t waste my time if you\u2019re not female. \n\nSo this post is a little open-ended. I\u2019m a 21 year old female in search of a partner!\nIdeally, my writing partner would be someone who I can share a lot of my passions and tastes for writing with. I adore long and detailed stories and posts, a couple of paragraphs is usually my base as far as starting out a roleplay goes, keeping scenes detailed and actions clear so that myself and my partner can both know what\u2019s going on, and enjoy reading it back like a book. I can understand and be happy with shorter posts as roleplay progresses in more quick-fire scenes like conversation, but I value detail and story in my roleplays.\nWhile I\u2019m open ended with the sorts of ideas I\u2019m looking to write something with substance, a story behind the events, a detailed world that allows for character development and progression over time. I love settings that divert from the modern day, chances are if it\u2019s not set in this world I\u2019ll prefer it to a roleplay that is! Whether it\u2019s sci-fi, fantasy, a fandom setting or anything between, I\u2019ll be happy to discuss ideas and bounce them together until we have something gripping and interesting. While I don\u2019t mind a fandom setting, my knowledge of a lot of fandoms is very limited, and is mostly tied to video games. If you do have a fandom you\u2019d like to use as a setting, I\u2019m more than happy to listen to the idea but please don\u2019t be upset if I haven\u2019t heard of said setting or don\u2019t know enough to roleplay it! The only other key note with fandoms is that I prefer my roleplay to use OCs the overwhelming majority of the time. There is only one fandom where I would prefer an existing character, and that is obscure enough that I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll get pitched to me.\nI do love over-the-top plotlines and events, action is something I\u2019ll be happy to write with a lot of detail and flashy choreography. I\u2019d love to see a lot of tension and suspense in the roleplay as well, a tense setting that keeps the writers and characters equally on edge can hook us in for a wild and thoroughly enjoyable ride. I would be more than happy to throw in any sorts of saucy, raunchy aspects to the ideas as well, but that can be discussed in private. Please don\u2019t be afraid to come forward with a lot of angst and grit for the plotlines either, I love to throw my characters in at the deep and and have them try to get under the bus unscathed. \n\nAs for myself, I am a 21 year old from the UK. I work full time, 5 days a week, and am generally mostly free in the evenings/nighttime. I try to be on a much as I can in these times, generally if I\u2019m going to vanish for longer than a day or two I\u2019ll try to let my partner know ahead of time if I can. I do prefer partners who can post multiple times on an evening, or even find a point where we can flow and post back and forth for hours of fun on end! Ultimately, however, I value quality of writing over anything else. I have been writing in form of roleplay for 8 years now, in both SFW and NSFW forms, and I can wholeheartedly say that if my partner doesn\u2019t put effort and soul into their writing, I lose my mojo with them quickly. \nMy writing style, while I can and will write all kinds of genres and plots, of varying levels of emotional tone, is always third-person, past-tense format. I will not compromise on that, it\u2019s just what I feel is most comfortable and best for detail in my opinion, and I feel that that style reads the most fluidly between posts when looking back over a roleplay. \n\nOkay! So that\u2019s the bulk of what I wanted to get across, I\u2019m a lady who loves a story, and I\u2019d love to find a partner I can really click with, and write something intense, story driven, and gripping! \n\nThank you for taking the time to read through my long-winded post! All there is now is for you to message me if you\u2019re interested and we can talk ideas! My preferred platform is discord, just let me know your discord ID in any replies and I can add you or vice Versa, alternatively I can keep this to PMs if there\u2019s something good to go on!\nThanks again! I look forward to any messages!\n- Bobbie x ",

I have got a proper story though through yet but I was thinking to set it during the period of the Peloponnesian when Athens and Sparta were at war. I\u2019d really hope this sort of scenario would interest people as I\u2019m itching to do some rp! Feel free to join although nothing is set in stone as of yet so I don\u2019t know when some Roleplay can happen, if you wanna help out just hop on in and we can see what happens \u2764\ufe0f\n\nhttps://discord.gg/qXm6Nvk",

I am 18+ so you will have to be too I'm afraid, I love all sorts of roleplays may it be cheesy romance to pull at my heart strings or gritty gore that would make some puke. Usually I look for people who have very little limitations and are open-minded for things. Despite that, I don't want any furries or bronies messaging me, that's my limit. I do paragraph, Usually I do one chunky one or two littler ones, it depends where we are in the story. I am looking for people who use real life/celebrity face claims, however that doesn't mean your IRL face, models, celebrities etc will do! I have a male and a female muse, However the male is only looking for another male. I only do M/M and M/F so of course for my female I need a male. Feel free to message me, I'm very active and I hope you are too. None of this \"One reply a week\" thing, I do multiple replies during the day, I will of course tell you if I'm doing something. So please do not ghost me. Other than that, I think I'm done. When we add eachother on Discord then we can discuss storylines and such.\n\nSee ya!",

I want to do a roleplay that breathes life into characters we've heard about but not necessarily seen.  These could range all the way from the famous like Aegon the Conqueror, to Gerion Lannister who disappeared in Valyria.\n\nWe can discuss the details of which characters we'd wanna play and how we wanna play them.  I'm looking for someone who can carry their weight in a story, someone who doesn't just expect me to be game master to the writing and simply adds her lines into it.\n\nHope to hear from you soon\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

The story I will leave a little vague for now, but the happy town they are in isn't so happy-go-lucky as it seems. With a scientist group commencing what is known as Project Paradox. This will be a long term roleplay, and will eventually span into other roleplays. To start just type your character's name, his/her age, a brief description, and traits. There are multiple locations, Purrel High, Purrel University, Purrel Library, and Purrel Research Facility (I will be running). You may open a location in Purrel, regardless of age. You can choose to live in the neighborhood, or on the outskirts of the town (include this in your description). If you have any questions comment them, when we have ten people, we will begin. Newcomers may come at any point, except for the climax of the story, which I will then state that newcomers are not welcome. ",

I am open to any role really but at the moment I feel like doing a couple of roleplays for now!\n\n1) Zootopia! I'm looking to do a long term zootopia roleplay, or short term depending on the prompt, that we can do and have some fun with! I'm Fine with either of us playing an OC of your own or the characters that already exist in the world!\n\n2) Star wars the clone wars! I want to do a roleplay of this series, though I prefer rex and cad bane, I like all the characters and I am willing to play as them.\n\n3) Adventure time! I have seen most episodes and am familiar with most character arcs, there for I'm fine and willing to play any male character, or other if you really prefer, that you desire!\n\n4) The Loud House! I've seen most episodes and I absolutely love the show, I would like to try Role Playing this if possible! (Personal Favorite of mine due to the small amount of people that actually want to do it)\n\n5) The Amazing World Of Gumball! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done one of these Roleplays, and I would like it to be known that I WILL NOT do a Yaoi/Guy x Guy Rp. Just not into that, sorry!\n\nRules:\nNo irl pics\nAvoid text talk, like, hw r u?\nIf I make a mistake, please don't get to mad, everyone makes mistakes.\n\nI'm looking for a Roleplay over the app Kik or through Reddit PM\u2019s, either is fine for me and both are fully welcome! I may have one or two ideas as for Roleplays for each of the desired topics but I would like if you came with either a fully fleshed prompt, or at least an idea of what you'd like to do so we can expand upon it and have fun!
