It would\u2019ve been fine too, but he calls himself \u201cDragonborn\u201d now, and Tolfdir seems to think Anya should journey with this man on his journey. \n\nAnd so an unlikely duo forge an uneasy friendship, with Y/C being hailed as Dragonborn and Anya becoming known as the Sorceress of the Tundra. \n\n(Yo!

The slice of life itself is something we can work out together but I can provide a few starter ideas if you'd like.\n\n1: High School romance, my character is the new kid on the block and has no idea about your characters little secret. We can go about this any way, but it leaves a lot of options for fun moments and sappy romance.\n\n2: Coworkers, this could be a bit more drama based as we could flirt around the edge of romance but our characters also want to  remain professional. \n\n3: Fantasy/Scifi, this could be anything, let's go on adventures, slay sick ass space demons. The options are limitless.\n\nIf you think this fits what you're looking for, we can talk a bit in Reddit PM before moving on to Discord if we feel like we'd both be a good fit for each other.",

I prefer OCs but I'm fine playing in a fandom setting if it fits the theme.   \n\n\nI play in 3rd person, in past tense. I prefer 3-5 paragraph turns, but I do understand that sometimes answers are longer or shorter depending on the situation. I understand typos and mistakes, but I'd like you to have a good grasp of grammar and write with full sentences. Because of mature themes, you have to be over 18.  \n\n\nNow, as for what I'd like to roleplay: A romance story with a plot we would create together. I would like the romance to develop as naturally as possible and not rush it. For some reason, the relationship would have to be hidden. Why? Maybe they are from some sort of homophobic culture? Maybe they're from rivaling factions? Maybe they are some sort of public figures who can't afford to come out? Famous? Royalty?\n\nThe roleplay would explore rather heavy themes of developing and maintaining a relationship when you can't really tell anyone, having to lie to people you care about etc. I would like to explore those themes as realistically as possible. However, I don't want the roleplay to be PURE angst.\n\nDepending on what reason we choose for them to have to hide their relationship, we can build a larger plot around it.  \n\n\nI'm fine with pretty much all genres, fantasy, modern, sci-fi, whatever we can use to build a plot around. I don't mind smut (Quite like it), as long as it's not the focus of the story.",

I love the back and forth volley of ideas that we can come up with, challenging each other and bringing out the best in each other. I find that roleplaying works best, in this sense, when it's built more on a friendship of sorts than just two partners sending messages each day about the roleplay. \n\nRegardless of how you may feel in that regard, I am looking for a good partner: someone who has good grammar, spelling, and is willing to put in the time and effort to creating a fleshed-out and vibrant world. I am impartial when it comes to Established Universes or Original ones. The same goes for Canon or oc characters, though OCs provide us as writer's with much more freedom. \n\nThe genres of stories I like:\nSuperhero\nForbidden Romances\nMedieval/Fantasy\nSciFi\nSlice of Life with Supernatural Elements\n\nI do have ideas for certain pairings for eus like The Legend of Zelda and such, but it's ultimately up to what the both of us decide we want to do! I am always okay with NSFW content, but it will not be the primary storytelling mechanism for this story. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\n",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nFirst off,I'm 21 y/o female, I'm looking for a female partner that's open to a relationship when the story moves that way. Post length for me depend on what fits with the story,I'd be happy with 2-3 paragraphs to 5-7; no one word/sentence replies please,but a few sentences while dialog is taking place makes sense. I tend to reply a few times a day which is \u00a0kinda what I'm looking for but I get if you can't. I'm fine with NSFW stuff but not the main focus and only when it fits in the story.\n\n\nI'm looking for a partner who is happy and willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. I want these character to eventually care for one another over time. I don't want to rush the romantic relationship aspect, a slow build pays off better for me personally. All prompts will have a romantic/angsty theme to it but apart from that. Any type of genre is open.\n\n\nFor your character. It's mostly up to you. I'm a big fan of unique characters that aren't just a cookie cutter version of every other character. Another point is that I'm more then happy for doubling; I'll most probably be using it for a few of the prompts. Face claims are also welcome, I will be using them with my characters.\n---\u2013------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPROMPTS:\n\n~Young Adult Romantic/Supernatural Prompt~\nSo the main idea I had was that we start in a small town in America (possibly the west coast). Some sort of strange mystery surfaces (I'm thinking missing persons but that's up in the air) which causes our characters to come together and investigate; think teenage sleuths. Something in the vain of Life Is Strange.The romantic element can grow as the story unfolds. I'm happy to head the story forward with this one as I have a few ideas for where the story could but your input is most definitely welcome. I'm thinking that with could take a more darker tone.\n\n~Summer Camp Prompt~\nTwo teens are sent to a boring summer camp by their parents. the two quickly bond over the fact that they both don\u2019t want to be there, and overtime develop feelings for one another.\n\n~Catholic School/Conversion Camp Prompt~\nTwo teens attend an all girls catholic school, where they are brought up to believe that homosexuality is a sin and it\u2019s wrong. despite this, they can\u2019t help but fall for each other, even if they may suffer consequences.\n\n~Pre-apocalypse Prompt~\nThe apocalypse has just happened. Could be disaster based or virus based,both work. Our characters are caught slap bang in the middle of it and have to work together to survive. The relationship can move from there; maybe our characters disagree to start.\n\n\n(These are just the barebones of each story which leaves plenty of room for alterations. \u00a0I'm definitely up for any prompts you may have if none of these work)\n---\u2013------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for making it this far. Feel free to send me a message. Could you included a bit about yourself,what prompt your interest in and what sort of thing you'd like to include.\n\nHope to hear from you all soon:)\n\n",

            "selftext": "(Warning,long post ahead)\n\nHey all,\nSo I'm setting up a D&amp;D campaign and I'm looking for a few players that would rather a campaign that's heavy on the roleplay. Everyone is welcome, newbies, experienced players...just be willing to adapt to the loose system.\n\n~Campaign~ \nThis campaign won't have many stats, only the essentials that I'll go over in more detail on Discord; but the basics is that the stats that I'll be using (advantage/disadvantage, some combat stuff\u2026) will be for roleplay purposes. The lack of stats is also because number crunching tends to slow down a text-only campaign. It's super easy for people who are new to D&amp;D or would just prefer roleplay heavy D&amp;D storytelling. This will be all over Discord with a dice bot and is text only.\n\nThis will be done in sessions (not PBP). I'll discuss with you to sort out a specific day that each session will take place. It'll probably be weekend sessions as this usually work for most.\n\n~Story~\nThe campaign will be set in the main Dungeon and Dragons setting 'the forgotten realms\u2019; more specifically 'the Fear\u00fbn\u2019 and to start us off, the island of Chult. I'll provide more information on each of the locations if your not familiar. So details and character associated to locations may be changed but I'll explain that as we go. Here is a quick synopsis of where the campaign will start\u2026\n____________________________________\nThe peninsula of Chult is a tropical wilderness composed mostly of jungles, plateaus, impassable mountains, and belching volcano. The perfect place for the low lifes or excitable adventures to gather. All your characters have been summoned by one of the nobles of the largest port in Chult \u2018Port Nyanzaru\u2019. You all reserved a letter and a iron token with a beasts skull printed upon it. The letter mentioned that this noble has fears that something ominous is brewing in the deep dark crevices of Chult\u2019s vast jungles and needs a brave band of adventurer to investigate. Being brave adventurers is still yet to be seen but you all must be important to have been chosen.\n\nThe campaign will start in Port Nyanzaru as you all have arrived from the mainland of Fear\u00fbn.\n____________________________________\n\n~Characters~\nSo for your characters. I'm not going to tell you what I want you to play. The whole campaign (system and story) is set up for you to create whatever character you want. The only thing I ask is be unique with it. I don't want four characters that have similar and bland backstories. Think big and unique... maybe your a half-elven pirate that worships a forgotten sea God and is scaredy a cat or a blind Aarakocra monk who refuses to kill...etc. This is Dungeon and Dragons so go wild. You can most definitely pick from homebrew races as it opens up to those unique Characters I keep bringing up but probably just stick with the main classes (I am willing to make exceptions).\n\nOk, so there we are. I think I mentioned all the important info. If your interested in joining, private message me anytime. Could you possibly include your Discord username and maybe a bit about a possible character you'd like to play (if you have an idea of course). Please don't just send \u201cI'd be interested in joining\u201d. Give me some details about you so I don't have to ask. \n\nAnyway...thank for reading to the end, I hope to get a great group of characters formed and get into some fantasy shenanigans with you;)",

            "selftext": "*I have always been known as a lazy nerd because of my love for video games, no one ever believed I would be smart or athletic and I even believed them.... I was 17 when I woke up one morning and as I opened my eyes the first thing I noticed in my small room was the words \"You've slept well and have gained the Buff 'Well Rested!'\". I blinked as I saw the message and I started to get up \"Okay, maybe I should lay off the game\" I said softly as I started to get dressed for the day. It was going to be a cool day so I started to put on my usual clothes when I saw some text hover over my favorite red and black jacket \"Lucky Jacket!\" And when I put it on I saw more text pop up \"Your Luck has gone up by one point!\" I sighed softly as I ignored it at first while I walked down the stairs of my home and I heard my stomach growl once I smelled eggs and toast, so I knew my mother was awake early for a Saturday morning. As I started to sit down I saw a question mark hover over her head \"Cole(name may change) after breakfast will you go to the store to get some stuff?\" As she spoke a message appeared in front of me saying \"Will you accept this Quest? Y/N?\" I shook my head \"Sure thing mom...\" I said as I started to eat while it finally sunk in that something was wrong with me...*\n\nHello and thank you for reading my little prompt! In this roleplay I've been really wanting to do I would be playing as a teen who wakes up with the magic ability called \"Game\" which allows him to see and do every thing like a character in a game! This would be very similar to the web comic The Gamer! But I'm only looking for a DM/GM to control the world, people, and everything else around my character! There will be almost everything in this roleplay from Adventure to Romance!\n\nIf you want to roleplay with me please message me with your Kik!",

            "selftext": "### Realm of Angarak\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What is Angarak?\n---\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What makes it unique?\n---\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What are the 'requirements'?\n---\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### Tl;Dr\n----\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj",

I don't really delve into fandoms much, some parts are toxic and I just rather not get involved. \n\nSome stuff I like is Avatar LoK/TLA, HunterxHunter, Elderscrolls, Walking Dead (I read the comic books), Firefly, Star Wars, Hellboy, DC comics and superheroes in general and Samurai Champloo. That's really what I could think of at the moment.\n\nFor fandom stuff, I don't really like using characters from the thing, I like making my own if that makes sense.\n\nI prefer using Discord, I also have Skype.",

I've been itching to roleplay in the Mass Effect universe of the original trilogy, but as I haven't had luck with forum roleplay in the past, I wanted to try and find someone who might want to plot and write with me on Discord!\n\n* **SEEKING:** Intermediate-level female roleplayer in similar age range. More details below.\n\n**Details:**\n\n* Female, upper twenties\n* Roleplaying on and off for 16 years\n* 3rd person past tense, maybe present tense if its fitting\n* Willing to write mature content with the exception of sexual content\n* Not seeking character romance, but willing to let it happen naturally in the story \\[M/F maybe F/F\\]\n* No canons unless very minor like Rolan Quarn, etc. \n* Want to roleplay within the timeframe of the trilogy\n* Like to keep to the lore, but minor tweaks and creative liberties are fine!\n\nI didn't have a specific idea or plot in mind as I'm a fan of both slice of life and adventure, this is something I was hoping we could iron out together. I have a good handful of alien and human characters to play, and if necessary, I'm willing to create whole new ones for the story. Character-driven plots and interaction are my bread and butter, everything else is gravy on top.\n\nMy skill level would likely be seen as intermediate. I don't like long, drawling responses because, not only do they take a long time, but roleplay is about action and reaction and I don't find 5+ paragraph posts to be conducive to this. Sometimes a post only needs to be 3-4 sentences long. I'm hoping to find someone intuitive and flexible to know when a narrative needs a lot of thoughtful description and when a smaller response is more fitting. \n\nI can provide examples of my characters and writing upon request, though keep in mind I haven't done anything with Mass Effect or written in a while, so I will be a little rusty on both those fronts. Also, I obviously want to roleplay with someone I get along with. For this reason, I want to avoid most ooc discussion of a political nature (social, gender, economic, etc.) to help keep things comfortable! (IC mentions of these things are totally fine!)\n\nThanks for your time! ",

            "selftext": "The discovery and defeat of Necromancy were both so sudden, it's not entirely understood which came first. A good ol' fashioned \"What came first\" question that has baffled scholars trusted enough to be allowed to study the history. They aren't getting the full story...more on that later.\n\nTo make a long story short, a group of scholars, armed with a will to discover and recklessness of youth, began to explore the Plains of Ecro. It was understood that once someone died within these barren charred plains the soul would be replaced with an unknown force. It turned these bodies into sacks of meat wandering aimlessly amongst the dry grass for eternity. They weren't hostile and ignored all attempts to get their attention.\n\nFive scholars set an expedition deep within the abandoned land...only one made it back five days later on deaths doorstep. And what could possibly be on his heels? None other than the skeletons of the long dead shambling with one purpose in mind; kill the surviving scholar. \n\nThe only thing that could be brought out of him before he expired was that one of his 'friends' \"Read the Stragic Scroll...\" before succumbing to his heavy wounds. As a result, once the news was brought to the wider public they were titled 'The Scholar.' \n\nThings only degraded from there, for more Necromancers (a term coined later on, at the time they were just referred by curses) began to pop up. Nearing the end of the reign, there were twelve at a time working together to conquer Titus. Even worse, people were *pledging* themselves to the twelve, being their loyal servants. I'll spare you the details, all of the brave souls that only slowed the armies of the Undead, and get to how they fell. \n\nParanoia, greed, and Necro-Rituals. When conquering  as a bloodthirsty warmonger working with other equally bloodthirsty warmongers, one tends to size up the others. No matter how good of a friend they are, there's a good chance they are just waiting for the opportunity for you to mess up. Such was the case with these Necromancers, but throw those fucking awful Necro-Rituals and you have the worst case scenario.\n\nA Necro-Ritual was the effective attempt to gain power, by sacrificing a part of someone's body they will gain more power by a small amount each time. For Necromancy, this meant the ability to control more Undead and keep control over a longer range. Let's just say by the end of it all, they were blind, desf, insane, quadriplegic, bloated, disfigured, and basically a corpse with a heartbeat.\n\nYou can see why betrayal seemed like a sane option. \n\nIn the end, the twelfth Necromancer killed the eleventh, and was...well, it depends on if you want to die or not. Sure you could just be a coward and accept the 'truth' shoved down your throat. Be apart of the majority. Or you could take a deep look behind the scenes and realize that the claim that the Trikien (The Rebellion in those times) slayed the final Necromancer was *false.*\n\nI'm fact it was far from the truth; the twelfth Necromancer decided to hide in an isolated location with his loyal servants. They got a ship ready for them, brought them to an isolated island, put them in a stone coffin surrounded by Healer Runes (the problem of needing living human beings in order to create them, which resulted in the death of said human, was obviously not an issue for them) and put to sleep to heal every part of their body. \n\nSounds crazy right? \n\nBut here's the thing, you remember this. Why? Because *you are* the Twelfth Necromancer silly! Why you've been in the coffin for about 200 hundred years now! Your body and mind should be fully healed, but the question is; what are you gonna do when you get out? \n\nAnswer me that before you decided to pry your fingers into the lid of your 'bed.'\n\n(Be as evil as you want or as nice as you want, I don't have limits so go crazy.

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters.  I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi** and **Cyberpunk RP** in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars, Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. I am not looking for group games or communities, nor am I looking for system games.",

As started in the above title I am in a creative slump, as it were, and would appreciate a roleplay partner to get the creative juices flowing in a manner of speaking. I\u2019m 25 and specialize in modern day crime dramas but am trying to branch out into historical/the American West type settings as well as medieval style fantasy role plays but anything I do has darker and more adult themes I don\u2019t like fandom role plays but am open to them in the right circumstance. I\u2019ve been role playing for the better part of 6 years and much prefer 3rd person and literacy. If you would like to chat or bat around ideas you\u2019re more than welcome to send me a dm.

            "selftext": "Galaan is a high-fantasy dungeonpunk server filled with various races, creatures, and cultures. The following are the primary nations in Galaan.\n\n**Ruddahara** is a barren, desert continent located in the Southern parts of the known world. Ruddahara is known for its luxurious spices, its abundant supply of mithril, and its unique matriarchy. in Ruddahara, the women are the primary social presence and are both taller and physically more powerful than the Ruddaharan men. They are known as some of the best warriors to walk the planet due to their natural agility and endurance.\n\n**Kroslavia** is a nation located North of Invictus. It's a frigid, wild land with giant animals, plants, and terrible snowstorms. The Kroslavians are equally giant, in order to survive. Most stand at around 3.5m on average and possess skin tones on a monochrome spectrum. Kroslavian culture is based on the concepts of survival of the fittest and \"might makes right\". It has various Slavic and Alaskan native influences, in terms of it folklore, architecture, and language. In most lands, they are seen as being 'barely' human and are often feared and shunned.\n\n**The Ren'Do** is a massive jungle east of Invictus. Not much is known about the Ren'Do other than the fact that no machine was able to fly over it, and it is impossible to map, as the locations and landmarks in the jungle shift at a seemingly random process. The Ren'Do is home to various beastfolk tribes that live inside it. It is rumored that, while in the jungle, they have free reign over what form they may take, as long as it pertains to their tribal 'animal'.\n\n**Invictus** is *the* largest military power in all of Galaan. Known for their war-centered culture and rich architecture, music, and appreciation for the fine arts, Invictus has became the cultural center of the world. They are known mainly for their history of repetitive victories and superiority in any organized event. In fact, the word 'Victory' in other lands derives from this nation. Invictans are a brutal people, however, as gladiator battles are still considered to be prime entertainment in the capital.\n\nThe Twin Islands, **Yarelle** and **Ganderfell**, are the technological and magical superpowers of the world. Existing as a pair of floating islands as of the past hundred years. Yarelle and Ganderfell are the only nations in the world to have developed, and perfected, air travel. The people of these two islands, collectively known as Yarions, are renown for their innate ability to metabolize and generate magic, as well as their near-indefinite lifespan.\n\n**Teikoku** is known as the Spirit Land. It's an exotic and mysterious land that's often seen as the Eastern counterpart to Invictus. Teikoku is filled with its own groups of clans, ranging from the demon-associated Yakuma clan that dwell in the lowest valleys, to the mysterious and aloof Tatsu clan that live in the highest mountains. The most populated clan is the Otora clan, which is coined as the Invictus of the East.\n\nThe history of Galaan was shaped largely by the roleplayers in the server, with only a few nudges from the staff. Every roleplayer is given their own chance to make a mark in the history of Galaan!\n\nInterested?

So if you\u2019re interested in hearing them - we can discuss in PM. Capish? \n\nA bit about me. Im 20 years old, and have been roleplaying for the better half of 5 years. I love to read pretty much anything and everything. I also love swearing, avocados, puppies, coffee and mid day naps. I am obsessed with good dialogue and dudes whose writing can keep up with my prose. (I tend to be overly sarcastic, and like to think Im witty too.) I need of someone who can handle my characters (who tend to be sarcastic, sassy and stubborn, like myself) and can verbally spar and challenge me as a writer! \n\nI usually write over email - but I can be swayed to another medium with a good enough argument. Except kik. I despise kik. Gah, what else? I stray towards genres that are not slice of life - like fantasy pieces, anything dystopian or medieval is totally right up my alley. AS for ideas, I have a few but I'm more interested in creating something with someone that shoving my idea down your throat. All I really want is characters that contrast, possibly even hating eachother (at first) but need to work towards a common goal.\n\nSo let\u2019s get this thing going - I\u2019d love to meet someone who know\u2019s what they want. So if you have an idea - hit me up. If not, let\u2019s discuss what were looking for an we can create one together. Im all about original storylines, characters and content - so fandoms and such are not my thing. Thanks for the read, look forward to seeing you pop up in my inbox. \n\nxo ",

I'd like to do something in the SW Universe taking place during The Clone Wars. I've written for that particular fandom for some time now and feel pretty comfortable with it. \n\nUsing established or original characters can be discussed. I'm pretty open to either avenue. I just think it'd be interesting to \nhave it take place during The Clone Wars. It'd be a great era to write about considering the scale and lore involved.\n\nI'd want to do this in 3rd person and with someone who could dedicate at least a couple paragraphs per post. I'm not by any means a grammar nazi, but you should be able to have a basic grasp of the language-- no posts filled with errors or posts that are not readable. \n\nWhen it comes to NSFW stuff, I'm cool with it as long as it makes sense within the context of the story. I don't want to force it, rather have things come naturally in the narrative.\n\nThe best means of communication for me are Reddit PM and email. If you think you would be interested, please send me a message. I'd love to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "**About me:** Hello! I'm a writer in his 20's and, above all else, I love world-building and character writing. I've written several short-stories (some have been published anonymously) as well as some longer works of fiction that are currently in their editing stages.\n\n**Genre:** I usually stick to Sci-Fi or Fantasy. I love them both. Modern-day plots seem to always fall on the generic side of things for whatever reason, so Fantasy or Sci-Fi is always an easy way to spice it up in RP. Although, I wouldn't be averse to a modern-fantasy kind of setting.\n\n**Characters:** I create original characters for every single Roleplay. I don't re-use anyone. I tend to write darker characters, not in tone, but in execution. As in, characters with deep, deep flaws that aren't just \"he's sad because his mother died,\" or some schlock like that. I really enjoy crafting three-dimensional roles that challenge my partner, as well as creating for a story with no true heroes.\n\n**Plot:** To be determined. I do have ideas, as always, but I much rather create one with the partner. If you have an idea feel free to send it my way, as well, however, chances are we'll probably be going over things anyway. I just like being introduced to something new. I dislike unoriginal worlds that are fandom-oriented, they feel restrictive and honestly, kind of lazy. I do have a fantasy story i'm working on, however, if you have any original ideas as well, don't hesitate to message me.\n\nMy stories are often on the darker side as well, as in, 18+ themes. Gore, sex, drugs, and all that fun stuff! That doesn't mean they are doom and gloom, though. There will be plenty of comedy to go around, I assure you.\n\n**Partner Requirements:** Have fun! Love to write! Love to really engage! Have a passion for what you are doing. There is nothing more tedious and banal than a partner that seems to not care about what she is writing. You don't have to be George R.R Martin, just write something you care and are interested about.\n\nAlso, if we click and do create a fun idea together, I would like at least a modicum of commitment. Being ghosted is never fun. I will always show you the respect of telling you if the RP isn't interesting me or the characters aren't engaging. I expect the same from you.\n\n**Smut:** Ahh yes, we all love smut. Including myself. Smut is fun. While I don't really want a roleplay dedicated to it... usually, I quite like including it into facets where it belongs. Diagetically. I also enjoy partners that are creative, original, and unique when it comes to this. If your tastes are a little out of the norm, that is totally okay! We can discuss this further if you decide to message me.\n\n**Overall:** Don't be afraid to shoot me a message. Just tell me a bit about yourself. What ideas are wrapped up in that beautiful mind of yours? Lets have an awe-inspiring adventure together!",

            "selftext": "I can never seem to get away from BNHA roleplays, they're too fun! I have three characters down below and many others that I can make!\n\n*COUNTER*-When I was young I was declared \"quirkless\", so I pretty much got bullied because I didn't show any signs of having a quirk. But for some reason my brother with the quirk \"Tear\", the ability to rip a hole in one place and go through it to another place, always kept an eye on me. He even but these weird bracelets on me that were heavy but he never said why... until it happened. I was walking home one day when a random villain attacked me and a kid from my school, while my friend ran I was left behind with a man who had some kind of quirk that made him stronger-possibly as strong as All Might!- and he ripped the bracelets off me. I felt strange when they were off but I was more focused on the fist heading towards me. For a split second everything slowed down as I rased my hand grabbing his fist. My left arm hurt as the energy from his punch went into my palm... and right out my right fist as I punched him in the stomach, sending him flying backwards through a dozen walls... as my right arm shattered like glass I realized I had a quirk... \"Counter\"\n\n*SMOKE*-When I was born my parents were already planning on how their son would make a great hero, but when I turned 4 that all changed once they found out I was born with a dangerous quirk called \"Necrotic Smoke\" which made me create smoke that killed organic matter such ass wood, plants, and flesh. Horrified by my quirk they quickly got rid of me by dumping me in the streets, I didn't understand what was happening at the time, but I was taken in by a group of villains who tried to train me to be like them, but I never could bring myself to kill anyone... that's when it happened, when I saved that skinny blond guy (All Might) and a kid no older than 5 from the man I had once called \"Boss\"\n\n*ELECTRICITY*-I was born with the quirk \"Electricity\" which allowed me to absorb electricity like a flesh covered battery, but I couldn't use that electricity. You see, I was born from a woman who had an electric based quirk and my father... was the villain Zeus, a man who threw lightning and had killed twenty heroes, and when he learned he couldn't use me as a weapon he disowned me and tried to kill me... what he didn't know was that I could mimic other electricity based quirks\n\nDon't worry if your first language isn't English! \n\nNow, I only use Kik when I roleplay, so ask for my username or tell me your's in your message along with what kind of rp you're wanting!  If you are going to play as a character or as a gm/dm please tell me, and if you only use first person please give me your character bio in your first message! Also I am thinking about going into a group to help brain storm characters",

I'm kinda wanting to play a what-if character: Harley Quinn and Joker's kid.\n\nIt probably sounds very Mary Sue, although my plan isn't at all to play like that. There will be clear weaknesses that can't be just shrugged off or seen as a benefit. The child can be whatever age, but tween or teen is best for me. I'd prefer some willing to play one of the parents. It's not a guided storyline but could become one if you or I get an idea. I prefer 3rd person, and at least a paragraph, but I'm not strict about it.\n\nPlease message me if you're interested. This is something I really want to try.",

For example, a bipedal sub species of the Arachne race with 4 arms, a spinneret like a normal spider, with the spider like legs branching off the back that can fold in. You would play Kimihito Kurusu after moving, and was only able to bring Miia with him. We can later bring more back. More on the Arachne sub species, they are extremely hostile and cruel naturally. A kind one is unnatural and is usually killed by their own parents. We can set up more when you contact me by PMs. I haven\u2019t watched it in a while, so I may get things wrong.\n\nUpdate: New U.M.A! This new U.M.A is called a Syren. Their description is below.\n\nSo, the U.M.A has no official name to M.O.N except one thing they managed to get: the species name from a weird tablet left by one they managed to decipher: Syren. They\u2019re mostly nocturnal and harbor a hatred for all living life. Technically, it\u2019s not even alive as it has no physical brain or heart. It\u2019s made of an unknown, shadow like substance, and has 2 red eyes,a head with a jagged stop facing like this in direction: \\ but a bit tilted. It\u2019s around 8 feet tall for males, with claws as well able to puncture most metals. They are able to hop from wherever they are from to our world in a way, and hunt for prey to eat, and also to trophy kill. And those are the males. The females usually are much thinner, and more humanoid, with glowing white eyes. This is where they get the species name. They lure in prey with beautiful singing, and then brutally kill them in horrifying ways. The females also are nicknamed \u2018Shadows\u2019 and \u2018Ghosts\u2019 as well.\n\n",

So if you're down, heck yes.\n\nSame as before I'd like to discuss the rp before rushing in and starting, a little planning can't hurt right? It doesn't have to be elaborate and take days to do, it's just that I want an image of the world and setting first before diving in. If you've got a prompt, shoot! I'm always open for ideas and ready to add into it. Roleplaying is a collaboration, it ain't one sided so let's put our heads together and brainstorm. I'd like to get to know you better while we're at it as well, as I said I want to make more friends. I don't have a specific genre that I particularly like, so if you have some interesting and even unorthodox ideas, spill it. For now, I'm not looking for a fandom rp, let's make a story from pure imagination and see where we end up, it'll be like exploring.\n\nLike before as well, if you're interested in this, I want you to know that I like to be engaged in the rp. That means whatever your reply is, it's gotta be thought out and it's gotta be more than one sentence. That is, unless, you think that one sentence is one helluva sentence, you know what I mean. And the 3rd person perspective still stands, sorry. \n\nNow that that's all out of the way, let's get to the more serious and pressing matter here. Communication. Listen, through out this entire ad, what mental monolouge have you given me? Yeah, I don't know your answers but i do know they vary. It's sad and annoying that technology hasn't found a way against this hurdle, other than emojis and :). What I mean is, I don't have telepathy, nor am I superman. I don't know what you're thinking behind the words you type, and that's damn frustrating cause I don't know if you're enjoying the rp or not. So I'd like it if you please tell me in truth if it's getting dull or if you really don't want to go down that route, it isn't going to annoy me, it's going to make me cry with tears of appreciation. Cause I finally understand what you want. This is gonna be a long term rp, remember that, and I don't want you to endure and suffer all the way through or just leave and never come back. Both of those are cruel. If you don't express yourself, I'll pester you until you sing, that's just how I am.\n\nThis was long and if you stuck it out 'til the end, you're a cool cat, if you're still down hit me up with a pm. I've been having some issues with reddit chat so if you're gonna attempt to send a reply there, I won't see it mate so sorry.\n\nAs always, I'll be waiting if you're down. :D",

I'm always open to other ideas too. So long as it's got a good plot with it. \n\nI have a few rules when looking for a partner but I'm flexible mostly because I'm getting desperate. I have roleplayed and written many stories since I was at least twelve allowing me to fix my writing and allowing me to be literate and I ask for the same. Spelling errors always happen though. I ask for a minimum of two paragraphs unless there is a bump where it's hard to do so such as conversation. Just no one liners. I only ever do third person and past tense but that's it. That's all I got for rules. Other than that almost anything is on the table. \n\nIf you're interested message me! We can do it here on reddit, kik, or discord. It's up to you.",

            "selftext": "The Paradigm universe is one like no other. Imagine that fantasy world full of castles, magic, and elves. Now imagine for once that society managed to advance past the dark ages for once. Paradigm is that world, with opportunity to be whatever you want you are free to carve your own story with the inhabitants of paradigm. Do you want to be the Orcish space pirate, knocking down merchant ships in the depths of space? Go right ahead! What about an elvish aristocrat heading a successful business? Go for it! Or maybe you are a magic using soldier for one of the 4 major factions in the world. Nothing is stopping you!\n\nOn the topic of the four factions, why don't I tell you about them so you can get a bit more of a feel for the world.\n\n**The Republic Of Icarus**\n\nThe republic of Icarus is a lavish aristocratic faction striving to do nothing but accrue wealth and power in their quest to take over the galaxy. With the strongest economy of any factions and one of the most advanced militaries to ever be deployed they have always been a force to be reckoned with. Planet by planet they appropriate the galaxy for their own, conquering in the name of advancing Icarus.\n\n**The War Clans Of Ka'Esk**\n\nA miracle of sociological science with beyond a billion to one chance has led to the embodiment of civil war being the next largest faction, even rivalling that of the republic of icarus. Named after the home planet of the clans 'Ka'esk' the faction is comprised of 4 clans that all hold the same planets as eachother. Every single planet owned by the clans has one stark similarity however, no matter where you go within the faction, all 4 clans are at war. The cunning and sly Fiel clan sneak and steal from the other three. The smart and advanced Drall clan fortify their settlements and lock themselves away in mega cities of scientific development and technological advancement, developing new means to get the edge on their sibling clans. The Wise and nomadic Su'tum are masters of the magical arts, devoting their lives to ritual and study yet only lashing out in an act of war when the situation demands, neither pacifists nor warlords in their ways. And the brash and dangerous Krass clan live in a mad max like hellscape of anarchy and violence, sending war parties charging across the planets to command their territory, numbers over tactics.\n\n**The United Federation**\n\nA conglomerate of planets and solar systems in constant political dispute, all banding together for one reason. The safety from invasion. Every world leader has their own view on how the federation should be run, where the funding should go, what should be done with the military. In a community of such cultural and planetary difference everyone can find their place.\n\n**The Tressen Empire**\n\nThe studious and devoted faction of the Tressen Empire has one goal in their assistance. They are to find the technology of the old world so that they may reverse engineer it for their own use. They must protect the relics of old from the rest of the universe that they deem unworthy. The youngest faction of the four but the most formidable, with few to no military defeats, they pose more and more of a threat by the day.\n\nJoin up now and get ready to explore this wonderful world\n\n[https://https://discord.gg/pEZuJMq](https://discord.gg/pEZuJMq)\n\nIf you would like to look into the lore of the community we have documentation on the whole universe it takes place in.

            "selftext": "Greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...My Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Pokemon, Splatoon, and Legend of Zelda.  I can try other fandoms but that's a case by case thing and anything that holds ZERO similarity to what I am looking for is likely a hard no.  Some outlying ideas people have come to me with that I've been okay with being things like Dragon Ball Z, Kingdom Hearts, Skullgirls and Shantae for example.  With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",

            "selftext": "Hello!!!\n\nI have wanted to do this for awhile now... so here we go! I am looking for some talented individuals to roleplay with! I ask that you are atleast +18 years old. I would prefer if you played a male character, as I love to have romance in all of my role plays. I also ask that you be somewhat literate, as I feel quality is important... but I don\u2019t feel you can give quality without typing atleast +1 paragraphs.\n\nI prefer making original characters but I\u2019m always willing to play canon characters. I love romance, fantasy, slice of life and adventure. \n\nPrompts:\n\n1. Rivaling thieves of the night. Our characters would both be thieves who happen to run into one another during our big steals. Eventually, maybe one getting captured or what have you. A budding partnership or the greatest rivalry ever? \n2. Taming a Princess. A royal princess with a sassy attitude that keeps the suitors running back for more. Her family sets out invitations to a suitor ball, in hopes that someone will come along to tame their restless daughter.\n3. Harry Potter/Magical School. The idea of magic and learning is always fun. Exploring it with someone else.... even more! This one would require a more creative partner to help flesh out more plot and story.\nIf you have any story ideas, feel free to message me with them! I always willing to try different characters and plot ideas!\n\nOther things I\u2019m interested in: Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy 10,13 and 15, My Hero Academia, Code Geass, Tales of Series, RWBY, and etc\n\nSo please dm me if you are interested!!!! Thank you!!! I\u2019m a fun and pretty easy going role play partner~",

This post is for +18 only as some roleplays may contain adult themes depending if there is romance or not. \n\nA Quantico themed storyline is a big interest spot for me, especially spy based roleplays that aren\u2019t too cliche. If you happen to be a Quantico fan \u2014- here are some characters I\u2019d like to interact with: Alex Parrish, Owen Hall, The Amin Twins, Shelby Wyatt, Ryan Booth, Mike Mcquigg. \n\nGenres of Interest: Horror, Romance, Suspense, Thriller, Mystery, Drama, Action, etc. \n\nI even love Slice Of Life RP\u2019s with a thriller and drama twist to them! So please comment down below or send me a PM if interested. \n\n\nP.S. I am currently looking for Quantico fans to basically do a Quantico Roleplay with!

All of it. The progenies of cosmic ignorance that slumber among the dead quiet of the spiralling galaxies that attempt in futility to escape the ever ebbing and flowing madness of The Intelligence.**\n\n**A minor disturbance ripples through this vast sea of abominations. A stir of life on a small, insignificant speck of blue disturbs the maddening silence.**\n\n**Thus The Intelligence turns its horrid gaze toward the whisper. The audacity of an existence outside of itself. Millions of shuddering eyes cling to the silent song of this sinful life that dare to exist on the reaches of reality.**\n\n**When humanity will wonder why they will have already forgotten their sin by the time they are paying for it.** \n\n_When it comes to sci-fi anything with monsters is by far my favourite especially where kaiju are involved! I'm looking for a partner who loves kaiju as much as I do, to suit up and do battle against the mindless madness that has twisted its way to our world with the mission of utter destruction. The Kaiju will have two \"designations\", one in their native tongue and the nicknames that humanity has given them. Our knowledge of Kaiju comes from a book called Deus ex Lexicon that was found after the first attack 25 years ago. The military force created to fight kaiju is called \"The Pan-Earth Kaiju Defence Corp\" and mechs are called \"Archangels\". I will be playing my character Trent Challenger\" at this point--we may need to make some more. I have a few Kaiju in mind and we can make more if needed! Now, who is ready to bust some kaiju?_\n\nTrent Challenger\n\nOccupation: Archangel Pilot\n\nPhysical Description:\tTrent Challenger stands at an even 6\u20190\u201d. He\u2019s African-American, with hazel eyes, sandy-brown short hair and a goatee. Both of his ears are pierced. When he\u2019s not killing Kaiju he wears a black and red leather jacket, black jeans and scuffed boots. On his right hand is his father\u2019s class ring.\n\nPersonality: Trent is very good at coming up with ideas that are considered out of the norm to others. He approaches social standards totally different than others often having a lack of care for them. Because of this, he is able to see the endless possibilities of all (who, where and what is going on around him, not so much WHY) around him. Despite being able to find multiple resources for any plan, he is too focused on the world around him and what needs to be done for it and the people in it. He is very expressive and is even exuberant. He likes to be surrounded by people because its something that motivates him. He has a strong set of moral values that he\u2019ll stick by and will never stop fighting for. While he thrives to help everyone out he also likes to maintain staying true to himself. He\u2019s not open-minded to anything that goes against his moral code will do everything within his power to persuade the opposition to gain those values. It is his passion that drives him to be guided by his values more so than his emotions (ENFP). He is a \u201ctactile\u201d learner.  \n\nHabits/Mannerisms:\tTrent always says a short prayer before battle. He\u2019s also oddly obsessed with diner food.\n      \t\nBackground: The only reason why Trent joined the Pan-Earth Defence Corp at 18 was that he had no other option. He grew up a pastor\u2019s kid and his dad wanted him to be a pastor as well. This wasn\u2019t something Trent wanted to do. Trent had dreams of becoming a military SF author. Thus he was kicked out of his home. He spent five months moving from hotel to hotel, spending all of his money on needed expenses. He soon ran out of savings and was nearly homeless. On a night of drinking IPAs and buffalo wings\u2014the last of his money\u2014he saw a poster for the academy. With no money, no home the clothes on his back, and a coffee-stained half-finished manuscript Trent jumped at the chance and joined the academy. Trent had never put his body through so much mental and physical strain before. But over time he grows stronger and faster. He\u2019s not \u201cthe best\u201d Archangel pilot but set him behind the wheel of  Valkyrie-class mech and he\u2019ll lay waste to hordes of Kaiju. Trent pilots the Ron Stallworth\u2014a Valkyrie-class mech, specifically designed for stealth, recon and rescue. Armed with a ghostdrive (cloaking device), shoulder mounted Hush-rifle and a plasma blade Trent swoops in with blistering and disappears just as quickly as he appeared\n\nInternal Conflicts: Trent still has yet to make amends with his family. He doesn\u2019t view his situation as a bad thing anymore, but a stepping stone in his adult life. He talks to his family as often as he can and like good parents his mom and dad are always concerned for his safety. They ask if he\u2019s okay, if they need them to send a care package, and show a little bit concern for his occasional whiskey and cigar hobby.\n\nQuotes: \u201cYou can always tell a diner by their eggs.\u201d \u201cIf you drink that, you\u2019re gonna be gone. Like Malaysian airlines.\u201d\u201dOh\u2026my\u2026crap.\u201d",

The main antagonists in this are The Connections, and a shady Umbrella Remnant gaining it\u2019s money through B.O.W sales and crime. I have some presets for you to play, or you could suggest your own. I also have a custom virus as well, with the characteristic of heightened BOW and mutant intelligence and a telepathic connection to a slightly mutated girl who leads them, known as Okiku.\n\nPreset 1: Play as Leon or Claire\n\n\nPlay as RE2\u2019s star team, Leon or Claire. You could play them both or just one. Leon is working with the New Umbrella, the PMC that\u2019s dedicated to fighting Bioweapons. Claire is with the BSAA, and will be on a joint op with Umbrella.\n\nPreset 2: Play as Chris or Jill\n\n\nChris, as we know, is with the PMC Umbrella. Jill will be recruited by them if you play as her. We\u2019ll decide the operations later.\n\n\nPreset 3: Play as Ada\n\nPlay as Ada, the spy, on a mission from mysterious contractors offering big money for delivering something from an abandoned secret umbrella base. Of course, you have your own motives as well...such as information and hopefully a clue to the location of a former Umbrella USS soldier who in this rp, lived against G-Birkin and escaped Raccoon city. His code name: HUNK.\n\nPreset 4: Play as HUNK.\nIt\u2019s been so long since Raccoon City. Yet it\u2019s affects still haven\u2019t left. You\u2019re on the run from anyone and everyone: you trust no one, especially since a PMC is hunting you down with the same name as Umbrella. You\u2019ve been living in Japan with a new identity, but after Blue Umbrella Helicopters surround your apartment, it\u2019s time to don the armor once again for a possible final stand. It\u2019s about time anyway. G-Birkin still haunts you. You start with your armor and an CZ75 in a combat situation if you pick this one.\n\n\n\nPM me and we can work something out.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

As the title of this thread suggests, I am looking for Roleplay partners who are interested in the fandom of The Orville!\n\nThis is the first sci-fi show that I\u2019ve really gotten into, with the exception of later seasons of Agents of SHIELD, and I really really love it. The characters are great, and the humor isn\u2019t forced or too shticky.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get on to the main part...the characters! I\u2019m looking to play as Commander Kelly Grayson, and I\u2019m looking for someone to play as her sarcastic ex-husband Captain Ed Mercer. I love this pairing because they\u2019re both so snarky and kind of ridiculous human beings, especially when they\u2019re together.\n\nI don\u2019t have any plots figured out just yet, but that\u2019s something we can talk about. Since it is set in the future and in space, there\u2019s plenty we can work with.\n\nSome info about me:\n* I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+.\n* I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply.\n* I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out.\n* I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does.\n* I would prefer literate partners.\n\nInterested? Excellent! Feel free to comment here or shoot me a message! I look forward to plotting with you! ",

            "selftext": "It is the year 2119, and humans have done more than make first contact with other intelligent life forms. Several alien species have made Earth their new home, or at least their summer vacation destination. They flock to the watery planet to observe the natural flora and fauna, to ooh and aah over how humans interact, and to even sample some of the exotic cuisine (McDonalds is an overwhelming favorite). \n\nIn the midst of this new era of space exploration, a young alien is sent to Earth to marry the only son of a high-ranking military officer. This alien is classified as a Secondary Vlaxiun, a subservient species that hails from a strange, seemingly utopian planet without war. However, as Y/C grows closer with his fianc\u00e9, he notices a few things are decidedly... Off. \n\nPerhaps it\u2019s the strange grace in which the Secondary moves with, or the odd sadness in every smile he has, or maybe even in the way he never seems to meet Y/C\u2019s eyes...  One thing is for sure. Y/C finds himself enchanted by the seemingly shy alien, and yearns to learn more of his culture and himself. \n\n\nBasically, every arranged marriage plot, but it\u2019s gay and has aliens. I\u2019m fine with using Reddit, Discord, Kik, or Google Docs for the roleplay. I\u2019d prefer if my partner is literate, as I have spent a lot of time creating this world and I want to share it with someone who can match my passion. Will this be a steamy romance? A science-fiction drama? Who knows! ",

            "selftext": "Hullo alleged humans! I came today because I always thought it would be fun to use the same elements of your run of the mill medieval fantasy, elves, orcs, mages, kings, monsters, etc, and apply them to a different setting. I think this idea hasn\u2019t been explored to its full potential, at least that I\u2019m aware of, so I think it would be cool to give it a try.\n\n**Simply forwarding a couple of centuries**\n\nI think it\u2019s good to start with the one with the tamest changes. Imagine a world that has definitely changed with the introduction of gunpowder, but hasn\u2019t really phased out of the horses, swords and monarchies completely. Just imagine rangers running through forest with muskets instead of bows, orcs wielding mighty hand cannons and so on. This might be my favorite despite introducing the least changes, simply by the cool factor of it all, and it can even be combined with some of my prompts from the past, so you can check those out too. \n\n**Fantasy in SPAAAAAAACE**\n\nSpace and science fiction has been associated together almost for as long as the genre has been around, and even though space fantasy has been done, it hasn\u2019t been done like this as far as I\u2019m aware of, even tho I\u2019m sure someone somewhere already did. Either way you just need to think how your generic alien races would be instead your elves, orcs and so on, knight armors would become exosquetelons of varying levels of defense, swords would need to add laser edges to overcome force shields, horses would be traded for space jets, and so on. We could even go as far as keeping the feudal system, with dukes and lords in charge of whole planets, like in the book dune.\n\n**Medieval japan**\n\nNow, now, I know I said without the medieval part, but honestly it was just because I was looking for quick way of getting my point across that it wouldn\u2019t be your usual medieval european setting, so this is still within the rules technically, just don\u2019t think too much about it and it fits. Now that that is out of the way, I\u2019m not sure if this would change stuff significantly beyond surface level, but c\u2019mon, samurai, ninjas, clan wars, and civil wars, I mean, it does sound cool right? \n\n**Modern times**\n\nI guess I always have been more of a grandiose, high stakes roleplay, but it should also be interesting to do some slice of life I suppose. \n\n**Anyhow**\n\nNow these are some ideas that I\u2019m throwing around for the sake of filler, so don\u2019t be afraid to let me know about yours if you decide to reply, everything is fair in love, war and this prompt. Also, if you really want to do the medieval stuff either way, hey! I won\u2019t complain, I do love it, so you can check out my past prompts about it. With that said hopefully I will hear from you soon!",

I don't do slice of life but if you really want to and you're literate we can work something out. I'd like you to at least write a chunky paragraph or basic paragraphs two at best. I don't usually freak about this area here, just no text talk. Smut is fine, but I don't want it as priority. I want it to be meaningful to the plot itself, if you're looking for smut you messaged the wrong person haha. \n\nNow onto Plots, I can also play male as well, anyway I enjoy Midieval Times and if you want to throw fantasy in there. But lately, I find rather boring ones. So it's hard to be entertained with this one.Not huge on basic fantasy. But I CAN take you up on that. Just don't message me with a role you set for me. On this topic, Werewolves and Vampires is a interesting topic I have ideas for this one even. I enjoy Marvel and Dc comic stories, Naruto, Vampire Diaries, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, which is frankly my favorite thing to do in this list, and lastly Avatar the last Airbender. This one is very interesting at well. I never done one but hey if you're interested! Come on, I don't bite. \n\nFinally, message me your Kik through Pm if you're interested.",

            "selftext": "Okay so for this roleplay I'm really *seriously* looking for a partner that will stick with it. I'm putting this first because a good partner is the most important part of a roleplay (duh). I plan on this being long term played through Discord text chat. Reponse/reply time should be whenever you're able, I know you have lives outside the one you put in words but. However, I expect quite a bit of roleplay throughout the day. If you ever need to go on break for an extended period of time, please let me know ahead of time. Alright now that that is out of the way let's get to the fun part!\n\nThis is a Modern Fantasy high school-ish roleplay set in a small town. High school-ish meaning we're of high school age (I'm thinking seniors but doesn't matter much) and some roleplay will take place in a high school.\n\nThe basic premise is my character has always been of a mythic clan of giants (she may or may not know this depending on how we want the story to progress). Recently she has had a few problems maintaining her 'human' size. This disturbance in magical energies can mean only one thing, that something or someone equally magical is nearby. So it's up to us to discover just what exactly is going on.\n\nIt's a roleplay filled with magic and spells, mysteries and secrets, heroes and villains! A journey to uncover what lurks beneath the fragile disguise all magic users in the world wear, to find the monsters within.\n\nIf no discussion or suggestions are sent my way, this will be a (mostly) lighthearted, action, adventure filled with mystery and drama. I'm also thinking a little romance as it naturally occurs but nothing extreme.\n\nFor you character, my two suggestions are you are either a human and completely oblivious about the world you are about to be thrust into. Or as another member of the mystical world who's secrets (and potentially life) is at stake.\n\nMessage me with any ideas or suggestions you might have and we can strike up a discussion about how this will all play out.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I will be playing Jotaro, and I need a few people to play characters like Avdol and Polnareff. I also need a few stand users and a Dio. The stand users will probably end up playing multiple characters, like one person may play J Giel, Hol Horse, and Oingo or something of that nature. \n\n\n I mostly want to focus on getting the other main characters to join in. The rp will start when I acquire those 4 people. I hope this small server has interested you! So, come and join on our fun! The server is here: https://discord.gg/2VfethA",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm looking for someone to create a really good and gripping story with. My main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. I do have a list of different scenarios to go over with you, but feel free to bring your own. Yours will probably be more interesting than mine as mine need developing abit more. I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, or tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. And if you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs be and I\u2019m more than happy to provide you with a character description or picture, whatever your preference is fine. \n\nMy favourite idea would probably have to be the cliche \u2018roommates\u2019 or \u2018childhood friends\u2019 which is slice of life. But I\u2019m down for more exciting plots too, if you see my last post, I have a list of scenarios. They are basic and will need developing so if you want, we can take one and expand on it. Or we can just do one of yours as I\u2019m flexible and I try to play as many roles as I can when it\u2019s needed.\n\nSmut will have an very tiny element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest (80% story, 20% smut.) Roughly - we\u2019ll decide when we\u2019ve figured out our story. So smut will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build up. Also please be literate (more than a paragraph at least) as I tend of base my replies off my partners and if I get one that\u2019s small, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do back. I hope to hear from you soon and I should be able to reply to you within an hour or so - also I\u2019m okay with just chatting too, maintaining a friendly relationship with a partner is always good so please don\u2019t hesitate, I certainly won\u2019t bite. I find that keeping a good friendship means that we can base some ideas on our collective thoughts and change it whenever we need to. I\u2019m also happy with giving you time off, as long as you let me know in advance so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve been left hanging. Thanks for reading! Also if you\u2019re wondering, yes I do MxM romances too. \n\nPM me if you\u2019re interested, I can roleplay over reddit but Kik is my main platform. Yet I\u2019d be happy to download other apps which allow me to connect to you. (If my phone allows it!)",

            "selftext": "Hello people of Reddit!  Recently my roleplay partner has been sort of ignoring me and/or not responding to my messages, so I'm sort of looking for someone new. A nice roleplay partner who's willing for long term and won't just air me. \n\nI have 5+ years of roleplaying experience, and I'm a literate role player as well. I'm not too happy with one liners, so that won't be tolerated, thank you. Also, Smut is allowed, but I don't want it to be all we do. \n\nAnyways, I have had a roleplay idea I've wanted to try out for a while now, and maybe I'll find someone willing to try it with me! \n\nThe idea is that my character, Jocelyn Rosella, is currently dating who she thought was 'Prince Charming'.  She has found a man who she believes can do absolutely no wrong, and can make her truly happy. What she doesn't know though is that her lover has a very dark secret. The truth is her lover is a psychopathic murderer, with a monster inside of him with a hunger for blood. He shows some signs of it here and there, but Jocelyn doesn't take notice.  Your character being her lover, you can decide how he acts towards her, if he's good at keeping his secret or if he let's out the monster within. Does he truly love her or does he only use her to disguise himself as normal?  Once again... your choice. \n\nPm me if you're interested! ",

            "selftext": "Hey folks!\n\nSo I am running what I think is a cool variation of the Kingmaker Adventure Path. I call it 'Fallen Frontier'. In my campaign, there is a traditional tabletop party (possibly soon to be more than one). But in addition we have a group of online players whom we call the 'Citizenry'.\n\nThe Citizens actively roleplay with each other and the player characters in our discord, and soon in our 3d role-play environment that I am constructing. On top of this, they have full character sheets and participate primarily through clever use of a modified downtime system which allows them to create everything from a small business, to a family farm, to an organized crime guild, to a monastery to train monks. As citizens of prominence and power, you can work with the players...or to your own ends.\n\nOn top of all this, once or twice a year I will run a large dungeon/mini-adventure (or series of them) for those citizens who are interested. This gives the chance for the citizens to earn gold and cool treasure.\n\nCitizens also play a crucial role in the plot. There is definitely room for spy-masters and detectives to help unravel the various mysteries of the world. I've worked really hard to modify the adventure path and fill in the holes that existed, and would love for you guys to figure them out. Prove valuable to the party, and who knows, maybe they will give you a place in government...or better yet...MAKE YOU A NOBLE.\n\nLastly, I will use this community to promote future gaming projects! So even if you just want to lurk, that is fine too!\n\nSo what kind of characters can you be? Any standard race and typical class will be accepted without much concern, and most of the advanced classes will be accepted.\n\nThe players have allied themselves with a nearby tribe of Kobolds and have even exposed these lizards to new religions. Feel free to message me if you'd like to play one of these tiny little dragons. (Note: The Kobolds have largely been swayed to the worship of Erastil. Bring on the Kobold Paladins...the Kobadins.)\n\nWant to be something more exotic and unique? Toss me a PM.\n\nThanks for reading! Looking forward to hearing from you!\n\nCharacter Creation\n\nSo you want to join? Do the following:\n\n1) Think of your character concept, background, and all that jazz.\n\n2) Roll six sets of 3d6 (adding together).\n\nSend both of these together in a PM to me. I will review your character ideal, and give you a link to the discord!\n\nAlso, if you want to run your own small fief let me know. I currently need three players who would be interested in running/ruling their own realms. I will be making my decision for these players based upon the cool ideas they come up with. Players seeking to play as their own minor fiefdoms should be familiar with Pathfinder!\n\nPM TODAY!",

While I do have some story prompts, I would generally prefer to work that out with my RP partner.\n\nPlease be able and willing to either NPC or play more than one character. I am. It is very difficult to have a good story with only two total characters.\n\nGenre preference: Fantasy or dark fantasy strongly preferred. Sci-fi if it is more Star Wars and less Star Trek. Modern only with a fantasy twist and if the world is particularly interesting. I've been playing for like 15 years now, and have done my share of tabletop gaming also. I tend to go to rolling dice whenever the random element is appropriate, and to help encourage drama in the play.\n\nI play through discord primarily.

            "selftext": "You had given up on finding a mate over a century ago.  Love was too fickle. Watching humans flip through partners like they did clothes did nothing to help stop your vendetta against the concept of love. If humans with their short, fleeting lives couldn\u2019t find true love, then how were you meant to? \n\nOf course you\u2019ve heard talk of and from others about finding their mate. The intense, unmistakable draw they felt towards them. \u2018You won\u2019t be able to fight it.\u2019 They warned. \u2018It is a hunger like nothing else- an insatiable need.\u2019 They explain. But in the decades that have passed you\u2019ve began to accept that you are destined to go throughout eternity alone. No living creature has ever sparked a fire within your cold, dead soul. \n\nUntil you saw her. The moment you laid eyes on her you became obsessed. As if time itself had stopped, she became your only desire. Though as stubborn and determined as you were that love wasn\u2019t real, you\u2019ve fought to keep yourself at a distance. It\u2019s better that way- isn\u2019t it? No pain of losing her. No fear of rejection. No explanation or hiding of your secrets. You would watch her from afar, where you both are safe from one another. \n\nYou\u2019ve never truly spoken to her. Hell, you\u2019ve barely even been close enough that she might notice you. By when the time comes, will you intervene? Should you even? You\u2019ve seen that man across the bar staring. Getting to close. She\u2019s said no, and he is still insisting and that is troubling you more then you would like. How will you feel when he follows her out of the bar without her notice?\n\n\nHi there! So that is a little brief snipet of the setup I\u2019m looking to expand upon today!  Incase it\u2019s not clear, you are a centuries old vampire who is very perturbed by the fact he has found his mate and is in a constant struggle to ignore that fact. Reasons he denies it are up to you, but I imagine it has a lot to do with the fact that he doesn\u2019t believe in the concepts of soulmates in the first place. \n\nHe ends up saving her one night from a less the friendly character, and breaks the barrier of speaking to her, looking into her eyes, etc etc. And of course she too feels an immediate connection though she can\u2019t understand it due to her lack of vampire/soulmate concept. \n\nFrom there if he tries to avoid her or can\u2019t pull himself away is up to you! I\u2019m just looking for a good old fashioned angsty vampire romance story. If this interests you let me know and I\u2019d be glad to work something out with you!",

            "selftext": "\nLong ago, there was nothing. \nNothing had ever existed, nothing would ever exist, and the nothing itself was nothing.\n\n\nBut then there was something, a spark of creation referred to simply by the name of \"The One Who Does\". What was nothing quickly unfolded into the complexities of existence, realities, and worlds. It was not perfect, for nothing ever was, but the Creator was satisfied. His final two creations were two beings, one might call them brothers, but that is only true in terms of their shared father. First there was the chief Overseer of existence, serving as a second in command to the Creator. He watched over existence and made sure that the flow and time and space continued as it should, and that the balance of order and chaos held firm. Next was the Servant, a younger creation who served the Creator at a closer level. He learned of the universe, documented its complexities, and fulfilled the Creator's personal wishes upon existence. \n\n\nThere came a time however, when the Creator decided to move on, to breath the spark of life into a new nothingness. Upon deciding this, he left two portions of his power behind. The first share was smaller, and went to the Overseer, who was already quite strong. The larger share went to the Servant, who was prior far weaker than the Overseer. After giving these gifts, the Creator declared the Servant to be the new ruler of existence, and charged the Overseer to serve the Servant as the Overseer had served the Creator. \n\n\nThis did not please the Overseer however, and once the Creator had left he rose in rebellion against the newly crowned Servant, believing that what he had been robbed of what rightfully belonged to him.\n\n\nThe newly crowned Servant was inexperienced with his powers, inexperienced in leadership, and was caught utterly unaware by the rebellion. Thus began a game of cat and mouse, with the Overseer pursing the Servant and his creations across the entirety of existence. The horizon was grim for the Servant, and he nearly fell many times. Eventually the Servant came to decided they would never win the way things were, and that a sacrifice would have to be made. It would be a risky sacrifice, and one he could not be certain of the outcome of. But it was the only thing he believed could have any effect, and so it was done.\n\n\nWelcome to the Chronicles of Light and Dark, a story of gods and mortals hopefully unlike anything you've ever experienced before! The Chronicles of Light and Dark is a minimum semi literate RP detailing the story of 12 individuals who have been plucked from their worlds and sent into a strange series of events. Throughout this tale both your characters and your worlds will develop and change, though for better or for worse will have to be seen. \n\n\nThe question is, are you interested?It is necessary for you to have (or create) both a character and a world behind said character, whether it be original or a pre-existing one (ie from a fandom). Daily participation of some form is generally desired, and this RP is *Very* long term. There is no determined genre to this RP, as it spans across many. The RP floor is set at semi literate and above. Also, the RP base timezone is EST, so it\u2019s advised that you only attempt to join if you can plan around that. Finally, it's required that you be at least 16. This is a hard limit, and if you are found to be lying about your age you *will* be booted immediately. \n\nIf you think you're up for this, shoot me a PM and I'll shoot you a discord invite so we can give you a look. Just be aware the standards are a bit high, but if you think you can meet them we\u2019d be glad to have you!",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm a woman on my mid-twenties and have been roleplaying for about a decade. I would say that I am quite experienced. I put a lot of effort in both the story and the characters and I hope that you would be willing to do the same. I enjoy angst and darker themes but also fluff and humor. I've had wonderful roleplays where I've both cried my eyes out and laughed until my stomach hurts and I need that in my life again\n\nMy length varies from 300-500 words and sometimes more depending on what's going on in the story. You can also expect multiple replies a day although obviously not every day. I enjoy rapid-fire every once in a while but things may slow down for a moment when life comes in the way.\n\nWhat I really crave for right now is LuffyxZoro and I'd be writing the swordsman. I can write other characters of the crew too and do multiple pairings if that's your thing! In fact, I do think that having only one character each gets a bit boring in the long run.\n\nI could be interested in original characters as well if we loosely followed the canon plot!\n\nPm me, can't wait to hear from you!",

Fought. THREE. HORDES. Of. Orcs.\u201d she hissed, her teeth clenched.\n\n\u201cAnd, and I appreciate it, but-\u201d\n\nShe exploded. \u201cAnd you just made me climb this entire mountain and fight a goddamn dragon too! I didn\u2019t even manage to kill it, it\u2019s going to come back at any moment-\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, you mean Ilirhu?\u201d\n\n\u201cIl- you know him? By name?\u201d She could feel her anger rising with every word the prince uttered. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me-\u201d\n\nShe was interrupted by the beating of wings as a great golden dragon returned to the cave. She reached for her sword, but the prince grabbed her hand. \u201cWait, no! He\u2019s not going to hurt us.\u201d\n\nA man dressed in furs stepped off his back, swinging a heavy club, his muscles rippling with each movement. He was heavyset, and at first look, one could have mistaken him for a barbarian, but his beard was impeccably trimmed and his hair was glossy and neatly braided, though a little windswept. \n\n\u201cAnd who is this?\u201d Ivina demanded, pushing Detheil off and drawing her sword, pointing it at the newcomer. \n\nThe dragonrider chuckled and dropped his club, putting his hands up. \u201cCalm down, lady, I\u2019m just his be-\u201d He paused and laughed as the prince shot him a look. \u201cUh, bodyguard. Friend. You know, keeping him safe from the orcs. Actually, someone just killed, like, three hordes these past few weeks. Really screwed over the Hill clans, they\u2019re all sort of screwed up now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was me,\u201d Ivina snarled, her hand still gripping her sword tightly, though now out of frustration rather than aggression. Well, maybe there was still a little aggression, but her stance indicated that she wasn\u2019t going to attack. \n\n\u201cOh, was it? Good job. Who\u2019s this, hun?\u201d The muscular man strode past Ivina, pulling off his fur cloak and hanging it up on a hook in the cave wall, then putting up his club. The knight raised an eyebrow at the term of endearment, giving the prince a look that told him he\u2019d better have a *damn* good explanation. \n\nDetheil gulped and wrung his hands nervously, sweat beading on his tanned face. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want you to find out this way, but um\u2026 I- I\u2019m gay.\u201d \n\nIvina rolled her eyes and sighed in exasperation. \u201cYeah, I already knew that much, but that doesn\u2019t answer my question. Who\u2019s he?\u201d She jabbed her finger in the direction of the shampoo-ad-barbarian. \n\n\u201cFortrentsis. He\u2019s my-\u201d he blushed harder, but barbarian with the good hair finished the statement by putting an arm around the prince and kissing him on the forehead.\n\n\u201cBetrothed,\u201d Fortrentsis finished, beaming and showing off sparkling pearly-white teeth. \u201cCall me Fort, by the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetrothed?\u201d Ivina\u2019s eyes seemed to bug out of her head, and she slowly sucked in air through her teeth as she sat down on the cave floor. \u201cOh boy, you\u2019ve got a *lot* of explaining to do.\u201d  \n\n\\-----\n\nHello all! Hopefully my prompt has given you some idea of at least the tone that I'm looking for. Something fairly light-hearted and sort of comedic but with lots of fantasy action as well. Think Harmonquest. I'm looking for a semi-literate roleplay; I think sometimes it's better to be concise and say what needs to be said instead of repeating details over and over again, though I do also appreciate and respond appropriately to the need for paragraphs. We don't necessarily need to do this prompt, I'm open to brainstorming as well. I'm on US pacific time and can respond anywhere between 1-10 times a day, depending on how much work I have (engineering student). Since the semester hasn't started yet, I'm pretty free to respond often.",

But, here's the pitch:\n\nI want to be the Herald of Andraste/Inquisitor for a Dragon Age: Inquisition RP with ONLY OC'S. Cassandra, Solas, Sera, Iron Bull, all of them gone and replaced with characters made and played by you. Extremely minor canon characters are fine to still be present, because they're unimportant and I doubt I'll remember them anyway. But I DO NOT, WILL NOT, EVER, do anything with major, established canon characters. It's not my jam. I don't judge those who do it, but I can't.\n\nI'll be writing a female character, probably either a human or an Elven Mage, as Mages are my favorite role in a Fantasy setting. Because magic is awesome. I've got ten years of writing and RP-ing experience, I consider myself to be literate and detailed, several paragraphs per normal response unless it's a really dialogue-heavy scene, but even then I'll still be at least a paragraph.\n\nSoooo yeah, I doubt I'll get any responses to this, but I want to be a player to a DM, and I wanted to see if this is an actual thing I can get rolling with someone. I'm cool to follow the in-game story-line, or we can deviate, it's all up to you as the DM. But just to reiterate, NO CANON CHARACTERS. At least not major ones.\n\nIf this strikes your fancy, or you have your own world you want me to be the player for, hit me up! I prefer romance to be a sub-plot present in the RP, though organically-grown relationships are a must, and some spicy smut here and there would be nice. If you have any questions, drop me a comment. If you PM me, please tell me what your favorite food is so I know you read the entire post to the end. Have a good one!",

            "selftext": "Looking for literate rp partners interesting in starting a new story! I\u2019m a 26 year old female living in EST and I have pretty regular schedule. I always let my partners know what\u2019s going on if I\u2019m unavailable to make a reply, and I hope for the same from my partners! I use discord and google docs for RPing and OC sheets, respectively. I prefer partners closer to my own age and in a somewhat compatible time zone! I prefer using drawing/anime face claims, but can do with a well worded description in its place! I generally don\u2019t do smut, but I\u2019m a big fan of slow burn romance. I don\u2019t like to over-plot every detail, preferring to leave room for surprises! I\u2019m into character development and juicy plot over all else. I write in 3rd person! Pretty sure that\u2019s everything I wanted to specify! \n\n\nI do have some ideas already, but I\u2019m willing to hear yours or create a new story we can both be excited about together! \n\nI enjoy any of the following genres: horror, supernatural, comedy, fantasy, mystery and romance! Mix and matches are always encouraged! I have a few ideas for some small town mysteries with Room for supernatural themes already on hand. \n\nI also RP in some fandoms: RWBY, Soul Eater, Noragami, Daganrompa, Harlots, Buffy, or Magicians! Always done in an AU format, using OCs and not canon characters. \n\nI can provide a writing sample, and I require that one be provided as well! I\u2019ve been rping for 5+ years and can write multiple paragraphs, I move plot along and can play as many different characters to help build our world. I keep my details relevant and try to make my posts interesting for my partners. Pm me if this all sounds good and you want to discuss things! ",

Then quickly left again. \n\nIn a tent was a male, he was dressed in a heavy Survival outfit with a duster. A rucksack and satchel next to him. As well as a battle rifle, a submachine gun, and a sawed off shotgun. \n\u201cGet away from me! It\u2019s just the leg quit trying to stick me!\u201d Shouted the man as he pushed off a nurse. It was clear he was bleeding. He had a gun belt on with two big revolvers, then a strange pistol on his chest (That Gun/LAPD 2019).\nHe probably had other hidden weapons, these NCR Ranger types always did. \n\n\u201cSir, your bleeding would you please stop!\u201d Said the nurse as the man scooter away.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine! Just.. just treat the damn leg.\u201d He Said, his face was going pale. \n\nHe had a handsome face, he was very big. Like a mountain, really. He had white ivory hair and bright orange eyes. Probably all from mutations.. but it made him so.. alluring. \n\nBut time for staring would be later, he needed help, fast. Before he bled out. God why were the rangers always so stubborn? \n\n\n// So, Fallout New Vegas RP. I was hoping Y/C would be a Follower of the Apocalypse, and M/C is a NCR Ranger. \nY/C helps treat M/C and over the time of his stay they get.. close. But he has to leave, so what will Y/C do? He probably needs a doc with him. \nY/C could be an OC but it would be great if you played Arcade Gannon, since this is a BxB plot. \n\nPlease join!",

I\u2019m looking for someone who\u2019s as open as I am and willing to listen to the few ideas I might have, and probably add on his own! I\u2019m still unsure as to where this might be going. \n\nThe themes might be somewhat dark but if necessary, we can probably approach this without any 18+ subjects, although I would prefer if my partners were over 18, fairly literate (I might not be the best exemple of that so I\u2019ll let small errors pass, but proper punctuation and capitalisation would be nice of you unless the errors are intentional and used to give depth to the writing or whatnot) and have a good amount of free time, as I personally only have a part time job and lot of time on my hands.\n\nSo if you\u2019re interested in trying this out simply send me a PM with your discord handle and maybe a word or two about yourself. Hopefully we can craft a very nice story together!",

I plan for the characters to start out not liking each other, however some circumstance forces us to become companions. Later on in the roleplay there is a high probability of romance being involved. I\u2019m fine with smut but it\u2019s optional so if that isn\u2019t your kind of thing I won\u2019t force you to do anything.\n\nThe roleplay will take place in an alternate universe of the original show, with the only difference being that all the students and teachers in Beacon academy (where it\u2019ll take place) are to be replaced with new characters. This\u2019ll allow us to have creative freedom and not be constrained. Of course, we\u2019ll use our own OCs. You don\u2019t need an already made OC, as I have some already made character sheets to fill out.\n\nI expect my partner to be literate, willing to contribute in making new characters, and suggesting things for the roleplay.\n\nThat\u2019s it really, if you\u2019re interested hit me a PM and we can start chatting!",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m looking for a literate rper who wants to play inside of the RWBY-verse! Plot and things can be figured out after (or during) the initiation! The RP will take place through discord, and I\u2019d like to set aside time 1-3 times a week where we spend a few hours RPing (as opposed to once a day posts. It personally helps me stay interested if I just make small blocks of time through the week just for an rp!) Here are a few guild lines for what I\u2019m looking for: \n\n1. Literate and descriptive, with the ability to move plot along! I also want to note that one of my biggest pet peeves is when people continuously reiterate how \u2018beautiful\u2019 their own OC is during RP, so please for the love of god don\u2019t do that. \n\n2. I prefer people my own age, so I\u2019m setting the bar at 21+ when it comes to RPers. OCs should be at least 18 as well. \n\n3. Romance will happen! I\u2019m not huge into smut, but I\u2019m willing to discuss it if that\u2019s something we want to do further down the line. Also, slow burns only! No instant infatuation! \n\n4. Be able to play multiple OCs! We are going to have at least 2 to start out with, since we\u2019ll be building a team together! There will also be NPCs and villains to flush out as well, and we can take turns rping the Grimm. \n\n5. No Mary Sue type characters! All OCs must have flaws and downfalls, and semblance\u2019s and weapons should be balanced and make sense. That being said, we can have some leeway when it comes to semblance\u2019s since it\u2019s just us two playing anyway (as in, I\u2019ll allow some slightly OP powers, as long as you can roleplay it fairly and well). Also, not every OC you make should be a Faunus. I\u2019d like to keep the minority status of their race as canon, since it gives us lots of opportunities to create good plot/conflict around it. \n\n6. I need a writing example! I\u2019ve been burned in the past. I\u2019m of course willing to provide one as well, so we can see that our writing styles mesh together! Samples can be copy/pasted from an old RP or written on the spot, I just need something that helps me get a feel for what you\u2019re working with. \n\nAs far as the RP and plot go, I figured once we get our starting OCs dropped in, we can get through the first day of arrival, sleepover and launch into the forest before we need to flesh out our ideas. I like keeping things flexible, so you may not enjoy this rp if you\u2019re an over-planner. I figure that this way, we can get a feel for each others characters and let the interactions guide us to our first arc idea. That being said, I do have some ideas already and I\u2019d love to hear yours, but let\u2019s keep them less-than concrete as we go through the first few days of life in Beacon. Canon characters are not in our universe, which is the only thing making this an AU. Technically, the universe is the same, though we can build our own lore and cast as we go along! \n\nI write in 3rd person, and I require that my partners do the same! I also heavily prefer FxF ships, but I don\u2019t mind FxM if that\u2019s more your speed. Romance should be a side plot as well. The actual plot should help guide and mold the romance. If you\u2019ve read through all of this, thanks! I hope to see some writing examples in my inbox soon &lt;3 ",

It had to be revenge, don't owe anyone money that I remember.\n\nIt was over before it really began, seems they weren't much for a fair fight. Once it was apparent I was ready for a fight, they took off. Even managed to get rid of them without causing too much damage to the coffee shop. Except the one window and a table, which I will gladly repair for you.\n\nThe RP would be set in the modern world, one where magic is all too real. Mages, witches, vampires, fairies: they all exist and so do their unsavory brethren. The average person on the street has their suspicions, but we tend to do a pretty fair job of keeping the non-magi in the dark.\n\nYou could be a baseline human or perhaps something more.

The one thing that I won't do, and I WILL hammer this in if I see needed, is roleplays only based around smut.

The timeline roughly follows the real world's timeline up to the 1970's, at which point certain strange events started happening on Vyrme and people started being born with powers.\n\nOnly people born on Vyrme have the potential for powers (~40% chance), but people have been born there and raised elsewhere.\n\nThe roleplay lifts several elements from the Worm web serial, including the power rating and classification system, the concept of a Triumvirate, and the Protectorate - a UN-funded organisation consisting primarily of Heroes, working to stop the various Villain players.\n\nAdditionally, there are several ongoing events run by the administrators: a mysterious organisation known as Briefcase has been selling powers, an revolutionary group known as the Ouroboros Insurgency has declared open war on the Protectorate, and immensely powerful, high-rated humanoids have walked out of the sea.\n\nUltimately, the roleplay is about *having fun*, so I hope you'll join us in New Vyrme, which can be found here: https://discord.gg/xQ2YGPe",

            "selftext": "When the dead started rising from their graves it was a worldwide panic. Dead mothers and fathers eating their children. Old business men coming back to find their dead wife. The soldiers killing those they were supposed to protect. It was madness in the world for a good bit. Eventually everything went dark though. No radios, no electricity, hell even the dead vanished eventually. Those that survived emerged from thier hiding places. And those that were our with the dead and survived, came back a lot more scarred than any can imagine. Everyone had lost everything. But them the most.\n\nBut, once the dead have fallen quiet once again, and the sorrow had passed. It was time to rebuild. In this new world people tried to make what they knew before this all happened. But it seems the dead rising again was more of a trigger than anything. As many anomalies appeared before the heavily reduced population.\n\nBut in all this we're going to be focusing on small band of people from a little town in the midwest of America and their strife's of trying to cope in this new strange world.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo, hi, how's it goin? Thanks for clicking on if you read this far down. In this I was thinking about the after math of an undead apocalypse. But in this edition theres gonna be some other elements to it. Some more mythical races have arisen seemingly from the soil. Or possibly some alien races decending. Who knows. All I know is that one of this band of misfits will have an enchanted baseball bat.\n\nAnyhoo, enough rambling. Who might you be in this universe?",

I am 21 years old and have blonde hair that falls to the midpoint of my back in loose waves, dark blue eyes that resemble the same deep colour of the sea, a small nose and freckles during the summer months. I stand at 5\u20195\u201d (170 cm) and I have played sports my entire life, so I am in good fitness xx.) \n\nThings have been restless as of late. War has ravaged the lands between the North and South, two powerful kingdoms at the helm of a ruthless war. The North is situated inland, with fantastic mountain ranges, streams, and takes up the most land. The South, on the other hand, is right on the seacoast. With what they lack in land mass, the South makes up for with water, including access to the bustling trade routes via sea. I am the princess of the Southern region, the oldest of three daughters of the King and Queen. Known for my philanthropic work and my sweetness, I was favoured among the Southern people and often kept the peace in times of civil dispute. Because of this, my father hatches what he considers a perfect solution to solving the war crisis between the two kingdoms: offer my hand in marriage to the prince of the North (you). Upon catching wind of this, I argued with my father for weeks on end, even offering up my younger sisters when I became fit with rage at the situation. Not only was the prospect of a forced marriage troublesome for me, but to spend the rest of my life among people I hated and, in turn, hated me, sounded like hell on earth. However, the wishes of one were not best for the wishes of many and soon I found myself on my way North, curling up against the walls of my transport as I tried to find sleep to distract me from my rushing thoughts.\n\n(If interested, please kik or end a message via discord with your name, a description, and continue the role-play.

            "selftext": "I'm looking for a literate partner to do a 1x1 Elder Scrolls RP.  I may be open to an original medieval low-fantasy (or thereabouts) setting with the right person, and if your setting is truly unique and not a rehash of the same old stuff.\n\nA bit about me and what I'm looking for: I am 29, and looking for partners 18+.  I write in close third person, past tense, usually 3-5 paragraphs at a time, depending on what the story calls for.  Discord, Google Docs, or email would be easiest for me to use, but I'm open to other options.\n\nI am usually available from noon-4pm and 10pm-2am EST.  I like to post multiple times a day.  It usually takes me around 40 minutes to write my post.  I am open to RPing with partners who'd like to post less frequently.\n\nI like RPs with a plot involving drama, action, and character growth.  I like dark themes and realistic, bloody battles. I am comfortable with violence and gore, and I enjoy flawed characters with physical or mental weaknesses. \n\nI enjoy romance if it develops organically, preferably with a realistically slow build up, but I am not looking to set up an RP with romance as the primary goal. Likewise, I am only interested in sex if it actually makes sense for those characters to have it. Whether I'll describe sex in detail or \"fade to black\" depends on the situation and my RP partner. I like m/m and m/f pairings.  I play male and female characters equally, and have no preference for what you play as.  I almost always play non-human characters.\n\nThese are some samples from past RPs: \n\nhttp://pastebin.com/17siNznQ\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/qdkQZDZC\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/WNkmsRtJ \n\nIf you are interested, please send me a writing sample and a bit about what you're looking for.  :)",
