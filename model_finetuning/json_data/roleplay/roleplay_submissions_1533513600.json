            "selftext": "I have a pretty big writer's block and I was hoping that maybe doing a writing exercise with someone would help me build a daily fingers-to-the-keyboard discipline. Trouble is... I've never actually roleplayed before.\n\nAnyone here willing to set aside maybe half-an-hour or so every other day to teach a fidgety, 30yo cat-lady how to roleplay? I'm willing to play in your sandbox and follow your lead. \n\nI do have preferences, though. I prefer fantasy and long-form posts in the third person. Fandoms are great, but I can't do them since I get really obsessive about researching, and I'd rather spend the time writing. Also, please be around my age, or at least 21yo.\n\nIdeally, I'd want to test out this character of mine, a surly, damaged teen (18) shut-in who pretends online that she is a sweet, air-headed, pansexual man who incidentally has dark, sorcerous powers. The problem is that she's a teen shut-in so she doesn't know much about actual men and actual relationships, but she has severe issues and tries to low-key seduce everyone she meets. The other problem is that she really does have dark, sorcerous powers and they're slowly consuming her. \n\nShe lives in this jerry-rigged science fantasy world I have (so there's demons, shapeshifters, magical swords, and fully virtual online gaming), but we can do a different setting. Or I can just try to be somebody else. I skew towards casually twisted stuff, though. I really enjoyed Fallen London way back when, and \"a dark and hilarious Gothic underworld\" would be one way I'd described my main sensibilities.\n\nI apologize in advance if I'm actually hilariously bad at this. My overall goal is to just have fun with someone and write for about 30 minutes every day.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone. I\u2019ve been lurking for a little while and decided to deep my toe into the creative waters. I\u2019m in my late 20\u2019s and within the Eastern Time Zone. I enjoy a variety of settings and types of roles however what I\u2019m looking for as of recently has a thread of romance regardless of genre. In romantic roles I tend to play primarily female and usually do M+F pairings although I have experience and do enjoy playing same sex scenes as well. I don\u2019t like to censor myself so I prefer to only play with those 21 and over. Graphic sexual scenes aren\u2019t my primary focus and I prefer for them to be within the context of the wider story.\n\nIn terms of style I write in multi-paragraph posts via Discord. If I\u2019m inspired it\u2019s not unheard of for me to write multiple page posts. I put a lot of detail and effort into my characters in the form of character sheets, outfits and even family trees when occasion calls for it. In terms of availability I\u2019m around most afternoons and early evenings for chat. Depending on the length of the post my response times can vary from several hours to a couple of days.Writing takes a backseat to real life and I\u2019d be best matched with someone who felt similarly.\n\nHere are some of the particular ideas that have been standing out for me recently.\n\n**Historical-** I have a ton of experience with scenes set everywhere from Ancient Rome to the early 20th century. Time periods provide a variety of opportunities to build storylines around historical events, social norms and anything else we come up with.\n\n**Slice of Life-** I\u2019m always down for a touch of realistic romance and SOL has become a specialty of mine. My preferred way of playing this role is to have some kind of underlying conflict to keep it interesting.\n\n**Odd or Mismatched pairings**\\- this could and has taken many interesting forms from our characters being vastly different classes, being sworn enemies or even to one of our characters have supernatural abilities. I also have a story involving demi-gods that could be a fun basis for a potential rp.\n\n**Mob or Criminal Enterprises-** I\u2019m perfectly comfortable being the criminal within this roleplay if you prefer but I am happy either way. You can either be a rival, a forced ally, law enforcement or even an innocent guy\n\n***I am also extremely interested in GOT/ASOIAF themed roleplays.*** I am a big fan of both the books as well as the show. I would jump at the chance at creating a scene within that particular universe.\n\nHowever just because it isn\u2019t listed doesn\u2019t mean I am not interested. I have several pre-written scenes that don\u2019t fall into the particular categories I listed that I would be more than willing to share as well. I welcome all new ideas that you may have and want to share. I also have a handful of scenarios already written that I didn't post for length sake if you're interested. If anything I said strikes an interest feel free to message me with your discord name or your ideas. I wholeheartedly look forward to hearing from all you wonderful people.\n\nGood luck on your search.",

I prefer discord, but I can also use kik, email, and docs.

            "selftext": "Not the anime! Trust me when I say that I've become just as confused when ever I searched up Overlord on Google, as it links me to the anime of the same name. I should probably check it out who knows, might be good.\n\nAnyway for those that are still here and not thrown off by a misunderstanding, welcome! \n\nRecently I've been binging a video gamed titled Overlord and I absolutely love it! It's a game where you take control of a resurrected being of dark energy and commands minions to do your bidding. It's like an RTS mixed with third person adventure game, with poking fun at the fantasy tropes sprinkled on top for extra flavor. All in all it creates a fun experience and I think you should check it out, but if you aren't currently scurrying to buy it, I'd love to get a roleplay started.\n\nNow I'm not saying we should follow the world of Overlord to the letter, as it is about as generic as it gets in terms of fantasy--which is done purposefully mind you. I'm going to be taking heavy liberties, applying a whole bunch of make up, doing its hair, dressing it up nice and teaching it how to smile just for a roleplay. The core story will be there but I will just be...making it pretty.\n\nWhat's your role in this? \n\nYou are the Second Overlord, a being plucked from the Void of souls that transcends all universes and time,  for the original Overlord has been killed by a group of seven heroes. They really smashed up the tower and even stole the Tower Heart, adding the side affect of scattering most of the First Overlords magical items. Am unintended side effect, however, has occurred, for the Tower Heart required the energy of evil in order to be powered...its theft has totally thrown the energy consumption on its head! Somehow the new Overlord can be *evil* or *good.* \n\nFor now all you have are your Brown Minions, strong, brutish, crude but otherwise plain Minions who can only be summoned through Lifeforce. How do you obtain Lifeforce? Why, you kill living things of course!\n\nNo matter the behavior you exhibit will be leading this land, how you do it is up to you!\n\nHow will you approach this situation? A benevolent leader? A cruel but fair tyrant? A bloodthirsty warmonger? An utter sadist hell bent on killing everything in sight?\n\nYou have all of the choices you could possibly want, no matter how good, bad or downright ugly those choices are. I don't have any limits and the NSFW tag is right at the top, so go absolutely crazy! Feel free to get creative too!\n\nI will be the Game Master of course, but really, don't be afraid to take my story and my exposition by the throat and shove it off a cliff. You are your own man/woman! But be warned, sometimes a bit of exposition and questioning could help your Overlord overcome their troubles.\n\nI will be writing in third person and for simplicity I think you should play in first person, with a bit of meddling with the Minions since we will both have control over them. I know that I'll will be the Game Master and that you will be the player which means that you will have a lot less in terms of writing. I get it, so don't get dissuaded if I send a wall of text and you can only reply with a paragraph or two. \n\nI'm glad you've decided to read this far as we have one final thing to go over before we are done! Generally I prefer PM's and Email over Discord, more of a personal thing, but if you're really unwilling to respect I guess I could ignore my distaste. \n\nI hope to hear from you.",

However, these were quite small servers, and I want to jump to the next whole level by creating a new big roleplay server based on Space exploration. The project is big and I have a lot of plans. Therefore I am looking for people quite experienced with discord and roleplaying to help me work on the project. PM me if you're interested and want more informations on the project. I'll give you a link to the server.\n\nBest Regards,\nMichael ",

            "selftext": "I surprised you. \n\nYou'd settled in this sleepy shore town a few years ago. Teaching at the local community college and generally living the easy life. You were one of the few locals on this pristine part of town. Most of the year, the street remained empty and maintained by rental companies the owners had hired to watch their properties. Of course, it did pick up a bit during the summer as tourists flocked to the beaches. You didn't mind, it kept things fresh, you told yourself, and they were gone before they got too annoying. \n\nOr at least you thought you didn't mind until two years ago. The couple across the street, 1212 Pelican Way, moved back to the city and the folks who bought the place decided to rent it out. We're AirBnBing, they said. Soon, what was supposed to be a place to live out your early retirement soon became neighbors to a nightclub. When the first share group moved in you decided to spend way more time at a favorite coffee shop.\n\nThat July saw way too many sleepless nights as the parties raged. It wasn't that they were loud - just louder than you were used to in this quiet community. You didn't spend all this money for a beachfront home to sleep to thudding EDM across the street. You didn't say anything for fear of being that boring old guy in the neighborhood. And once summer ended the people who came through were, for the most part, quiet.\n\nBut as the summer came to a close and the summer traffic returned back to the city, you were surprised to see a car roll into the driveway. When you saw me, young and energetic, driving up in my black coupe with a NYU and sorority bumper sticker, moving in a week ago you were fearing the worst. But as you sat by the window, watching concernedly, you realized that it was just me. One girl in her early 20's, maybe not even renting out all of 1212 Pelican Way and the tail end of the summer. Both school and work had already started, what was I doing living by the beach on my own this time of year? But at least, I was quiet. I seemed content to just pass the days relaxing in the sun, reading books, and generally enjoying the beach not one hundred steps from my front door. I'd walk past your house on the way to the beach every morning.\n\nLike I said, I surprised you. \n\nYou kept waiting for something to change - something to disturb the peace and nothing ever did. Until this morning when for some reason I decided to knock on your door.  \n\n\n\\------------  \nHi! So, this is my prompt and I'd love to find some literate, dedicated partners who can help me play this out. Of course, there will be 18+/NSFW content and a decent amount of story-building, so please be mindful of that before messaging me. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to just chat about it! Look forward to finding some great people to play this out with and looking forward to your envelopes. ",

            "selftext": "Hello, and good tidings to all of you lovely role players from \u2018round the world! I\u2019m back to look for a friendly someone who is willing to plot manically with me. Some deets to know about myself is that I\u2019ve been in the role play game 10+ years now and consider myself a bit of a veteran. But of course; this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m perfect. I\u2019m always looking to up my game and learn! Currently I have a pretty open and weird schedule. I usually work mornings and occasionally nights, but I like to rapid fire post as often as possible. To be completely honest; I\u2019ve had a hectic life the past year and am looking to get out all my built up ideas out ASAP! Outlet, of sorts, you know. I am looking to play a female to a male character, only. I don\u2019t mind if you have sub characters that are female, but if we end up pairing our characters I only do MxF.\n\nWhat genres I\u2019m good with:\n\n* Supernatural\n* Sci-fi\n* Fandom\n* Horror/Thriller\n* Mature\n* NSFW\n* Modern\n* Victorian\n* Slice of life (Long as it\u2019s not too dramatic/boring)\n\nWhat I\u2019m currently itching to do:\n\n* Overwatch (PLS FOR THE LUV OF GAWD.)\n* Predator (NEW MOVIE AHHHHH.)\n* World of Warcraft (NEW EXPANSION AHHHH.)\n* Marvel (I do anything from Avengers to X-Men and more.)\n* Supernatural (Plotting will commence, and no, not the show.)\n* SUGGESTIONS!\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\n* When I do fandoms, I tend to play OCs first, and do canon characters on the side. With Overwatch, I\u2019m looking for someone who can play mainly as Reaper/Gabriel Reyes.\n* World of Warcraft has been my bae for a loooong time and I have many characters I\u2019ve developed. I\u2019m willing to work with yours but if I don\u2019t like them, I will voice it!\n* With that being said; I need you to know that for any reason, if I begin to feel that I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to work, I will voice it as well. Sometimes people are awesome as friends but with Role Playing, it just doesn\u2019t work!\n* Please, please, please! Basic High School - College level grammar and spelling, and lots of juicy details! I get bored easily!\n* I will match your post as much as possible. If we are in a lull, you\u2019ll know it by the amount I post. I try to keep my paragraphs thick! (Giggity.)\n\nAnything else, we can talk about over discussion! Send me a PM! I\u2019ll be waiting! Thanks for reading over this c: And I\u2019m open to more than just what I\u2019ve listed! Throw ideas at me, do it! DO IT!  -Cue Shia LaBeouf-",

It seems like it is almost impossible to get away from it all. \n\nWhat if that all changed though, what if you found humanity gone tomorrow. What would life be like....what would relationships be life for the few left behind?  I have a few ideas in keeping with that. \n\n1. The Lakehouse: Everyone was gone, whether it was zombies, nuclear war, or perhaps you just woke up one day with everyone vanished.  Survival was your only concern...civilization crumbling around you. Until you found it, a beautiful lakehouse surrounded by large old trees. Solar panels, a quaint and fecund garden....but was the owner planning on sharing? How did he survive. \n\n2. The island: Perhaps civilization didn't collapse, maybe it is just so far away that it may as well have. Washed ashore on a distant island somewhere in the pacific you need to survive together.\n\n3. A mysterious realm: You woke up here, you can't remember how. The fields are too vibrant, the sky too blue...everything is just too perfect. There is not a soul in sight....what brought you here and why? It would be so easy just to stay here the rest of your days.....\n\n\nI would ideally be looking to play across from someone interested in doing world building as a team exercise though I do have lots of ideas for the three scenarios. \n\nI have also learned to love the idea of my partner playing someone famous (A celebrity, singer etc) whose wealth fame and power no longer mean a thing. \n\nHope to hear from you soon",

            "selftext": "### Realm of Angarak\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What is Angarak?\n---\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What makes it unique?\n---\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n### What are the 'requirements'?\n---\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n&amp;nbsp;\n### Tl;Dr\n----\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj",

The old timers that were around to see them arrive usually just call them aliens, or varmints. Not sure why, though. They look like all of the smaller bugs I've seen. Long before I was born, the bugs came to earth. Not on a ship like in the old books, but from a rock. This big rock crashed into the eastern ocean, and it was only a matter of months before the swarmed the land. In only a few days, most of the people living on land were gone; eaten. Sometimes you can find bits of clothes or maybe some shattered bones in old buildings, but not nearly enough to account for 9 billion people.\n\nThe ground isn't safe anymore. The bugs only really come out at night, but to see a few or even a full colony traveling in the daylight is definitely not unheard of. Some people live in the old big buildings, sky-scratchers or something, but the only real safe place is up in the air. Dirigibles, zeppelins, airships, balloons, and other things like that keep you far from the ground, which is where I like to stay. That doesn't mean that I haven't had many dealings with the ground, though.\n\nFor the better part of my life, I traveled alone; salvaging the wreckages that dot the ground, finding usable metals, electronics, the occasional food store. My favorite finds contain alcohol, though. I rarely ever sell those. I don't think humanity will come back from this. Numbers are dwindling and no one wants to bring kids into this world, but at least we have the spoils of an entire planet all to ourselves; even if they have some risks attached to them.\n\nMy name isn't important, it's not something that people need to know now. What they do need to know is that, at this point, everything is too far gone.\n\n(This was not initially intended to draw inspiration from anything, but as I was going along some things made better sense than others so now this is very inspired by \"Falling Sky\" by Rajan Khanna. I don't think this is my best work and is certainly quite derivative, but I think some good stories could come out of it. Thank you for your time.)\n",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit! \n\nMy name's Mystique, i'm 21 and i'm from England. Recently, all/most of my rp partners have stopped responding or have become inactive and i'm looking for new partners.\n\nI like much darker settings filled with Action, Gore and Smut, but I can work with just about any setting or genre. So I've got a few ideas which would be quite nsfw and filled with romance, smut and gore. I'm really into romance right now and would like quite a few smut scenes. I play guys and would like you to play ladies in character. I write 1-2 paragraphs but don't care how much or how little you right, it's all about the content. Looking for an 18+ partner seeing as our plot will be quite mature.\n\nIdea 1.\n\nIt's the 22nd century, just after riots sent the government into martial law and what was left of freedom was completely destroyed. The families of two infamous hitmen of the 21st century are the last of the rebels, fighting long and hard\n\nto get their freedom back. Swat teams sent to kill the families capture one of their children of each of the families before killing the rest of them. The infamous children of the hitmen were trained killers, each to their own methods and poisons.\n\nBut the group recruiting the children aren't of the martial law, they are trying to re-claim the government. The two teens captured, a girl and a boy, lethal and wild, are given weapons and gear, and of course, a hit-list. The duo, the shadow and the light. Action with possible romance.\n\nIdea 2.\n\nTwo skilled antihero, culturally and skillfully different, a master thief and a wanted assassin, meet in an underground bar and in an odd mix of attraction and flourishing their skills, end up beginning an ongoing relationship. Set in a fantasy setting. Fairly open ended romance.\n\nI've got a couple platforms we can role play with. But I prefer discord! Message me and we can trade info for whatever platform you want!",

            "selftext": "The light flashed on, the crowd boomed with excitement, cheers, chants, screams and whistles echoed across the large stadium. It was that all too familiar time. It was the Pokemon League challenge, in the region of Sinnoh. Only it was the last battle. Cynthia stood tall and proud on her end of the stadium as the announcer introduced her, a mile long list of accolades only creating more suspense for the lively crowd. \n\nIt was already extremely loud within the stadium. It only became louder the moment the announcer began to reveal the identity of the challenger. His voice blared over the speakers. \u201cIntroducing her challenger!!! Former Hoenn League Reigning Champion!!!\u201d There was a slight pause. \u201cSTEVEN STONE!\u201d With the two words spoken, the crowd erupted into a living embodiment of hyper-massive energy. \n\nFrom the dark corner of the challenger\u2019s respective side, a normal poke ball was gently tossed out into the middle of his playing field. A flash of bright red light emitted and from the confines of the ball, came about a terrifying monster, one that towered over most. One consisting of rock and solid framed steel. It was vintage Steven as his Aggron was first revealed to the champion of Sinnoh. It released a roar that could be heard over the crowd itself, perhaps from an extended radius around the stadium. \n\nSteven came to light there shortly after, his hands dig deep into his dress pant pockets. Light steel blue optics somewhat coldly viewed the blonde haired woman before him as similar colored hair went with a slight, gentle breeze. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Cynthia..\u201d He began, offering a small grin. \u201cSorry I had to see you like this, but I had no other real option.. I need to talk to you.\u201d \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHello everyone! Hope that post might\u2019ve grabbed your attention. Anyway if it isn\u2019t obvious, I\u2019m looking for a Pokemon roleplay partner to take on Cynthia\u2019s role in what would be an adventure to save the world! I was thinking something along the lines of a new threat forming and capturing Mewtwo and harvesting it\u2019s energy to create some sort of super weapon. Either way we can discuss plot!\n\nWhy Steven and Cynthia? Well they\u2019re both uber powerful and perhaps my favorite characters of the series for each respective gender. Both were/are champions so I can only assume they have known about one another. Whether they have a rocky past, a love filled past, it\u2019s up to us to decide. I\u2019m looking to follow more along the lines of the games with elements from the show added in. I want this to be a lot more serious and dark than the show. For the love of god. \n\nSmut is acceptable but I don\u2019t want it to be a focal point. Romance is a better route for this specific plot. \n\nI\u2019m a male, of age, so don\u2019t worry about that. Tell me what platform you prefer to write with and we can decide from there. Hope to hear from you!\n\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTt0-uYBhrapkBArN128k-3LS1j98a_p_BO2JPQF_YTvS1vJ48j",

            "selftext": " Hey there! My name is Allen, and for whatever reason I've been really into Star Wars roleplays lately. That being said, I am a pretty big geek when it comes to the Star Wars universe and I would appreciate anyone who might message me to be one as well. It's a lot more enjoyable to me when we can both geek out on Star Wars lore and really set up an interesting story. I am partial to the Clone Wars era, mostly because I'm a prequel baby, but I also find the Clone Wars a very interesting time period. I'm fine with any of the eras including, what is now not considered canon anymore, the Old Republic era. I admit I never really got into the old Expanded Universe (Events after ROTJ) before it got kicked from the cannon so my knowledge on those stories is very limited. Anything before then or within the new cannon I know like the back of my hand. So if you're a fellow Star Wars geek and either have a story you've really been wanting to play out, or if you want to create something new, then send me a PM to discuss further details. I can do Discord, Reddit or Kik, it just depends on whether you prefer a keyboard or just a phone (I personally prefer keyboard). I would very much prefer it if you are literate and capable of writing more than just a few sentences as replies, it just makes everything flow better.",

Not a hint anyone had been there; save for the horror that remained. \n\n*The work of a madman,* the media projected in their positively eager tones. *Where will he strike next? Today local agencies brought in help from the FBI\u2026*\n\n~~~~\n\nLillian Hurst heard none of the news. In fact, the girl had barely moved in the two days that followed the slayings. Surrounded by mountains of blankets and pillows, she slept in a plush valley. The fever that had flashed on the thermometer had been a lie. Frequent stumbling trips to the restroom resulted in nothing more than pruned fingertips. \n\nThe high was long gone as she laid there. It had been only hours after her blade had broken flesh that she craved it once more. She was helpless, however. Worthless. Most did not understand the physical affliction that accompanied murder. Each inch of her petite form was too fatigued to move.\n\nOn the third day she ventured from her dim room to eat a bowl of cereal she wasn't even hungry for. She began her research as she laid in the dark. \n\nOn the fourth she took a shower that lasted more than two hours and ended icy cold. Somehow she found her way across town to the street she needed. \n\nThe fifth day coaxed her outside for a run that she nearly blacked out from. It allowed her a clear view of what she needed, however. \n\nDay six was spent preparing. The craving was becoming too strong. No amount of her own blood would satiate it. Nothing would. Not for long anyway. \n\n______________\n\nLillian. Rare female serial killer. But why? \n\nEnter the male lead. Your character. What brings him into her life? Therapist. Agent. Fellow psycho.

I'm looking for a literate partner, who's comfortable writing in third person, and is okay with some darker themes. \n\nI also roleplay on Discord, only. \n\nStory: \n\nFor the past five hundred years, ever since the humans landed on the shores of Feyendal, the elves, the kingdom's original inhabitants, have been slaves to them. \n\nOut of all the five cities of Feyendal, only one has freed it's elves from slavery: Highkeep. There, the elves, along with the city's government, are planning a rebellion against the rest of the kingdom - a rebellion to free the rest of the elves. \n\nSo, if any of that caught your eye, feel free to PM me!",

I\u2019m willing to play either Honey Lemon or GoGo, and I\u2019m looking for someone to play either Wasabi, Fred, Hiro (if we go this route id prefer he be bumped up to 18+), or the girl I dont go with. I\u2019m open to any ideas, especially to go into the lives of these college age superheroes. I\u2019d like to keep this SFW, but if we want to get into slight NSFW we can discuss it, I just want this to be a story, not smut. I want to do this in third person paragraph style, literacy is an absolute must. DM me if you\u2019re interested!",

Until today. \n\nYou were out gathering Oran Berries for your mother who was a Pok\u00e9mon nurse. While you were out gathering them, you heard pained cries of a Pok\u00e9mon. You listened to them, trying to find the source. \n\nAfter walking around for just a few moments, you found a Gardevoir who was injured laying on the ground, its pained cries filling your ears. \n\nKnowing you couldn't leave them here, you picked them up and began to walk back home where they could be treated and nursed to health. \nOnce you were home, your mother took the injured Pok\u00e9mon from you and began to work on them as you sat and watched, helping anyway you could. \n\nAfter awhile, your mother said that the Gardevoir would be fine with a little time for recovery. You nodded and looked at the Pok\u00e9mon who was now fast asleep with bandages wrapped around its body and left leg. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nHello and I hope you enjoyed my post~ I am searching for an awesome roleplay partner to do this prompt with~\nPlease be aware of a few things before you message me;\n1.

I have some roleplay ideas that are emotional and/or just random (not random for me but may look random for the other person), and their core would be having a dad/son big/little brother interaction.\n\nI'm 25 and would be playing the younger character. Regarding scenario, I can do anything... Anime, apocalyptic, old ages, etc, the important is having the kind of interaction I mentioned above.\n\nI'd need some help regarding how all of it works as I've never done a \"structured\" roleplay before, but I'm great at writing, coming up with ideas and being elaborate. If anyone is interested at all PM me, I can research your theme to mix with mine if necessary.",

            "selftext": "##Hello there traveler!\n\nIf you are reading this, then that means that you have found [A Roleplay of Ice and Fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/arpoiaf) - a collaborative writing community with a story set in the fictional world of A Song of Ice and Fire - either entirely by accident, or because you were looking for something different.\n\nYou've come to the right place!\n\nAs any roleplayer on reddit will tell you, there are more Game of Thrones-based RPs on reddit than can be counted on one hand. And if you include those that are no longer active, you might have to pull off your shoes and use your toes for those calculations!\n\nIt's easy to see why it's so popular - a vast world to explore with a myriad of cultures, yet with just enough left untold so that you, too, can pick up the pen and fill in those holes. The game of thrones tends to lend itself to be seen as just that - something to win at all costs, followed by the need for everything to be controlled by dice in an effort to level the playing field.\n\nBut you have to wonder - what happens to the story amidst spy and sabotage attempts or posts written simply to ensure that a character gains better odds on their next moon's skills-roll?\n\nPerhaps you've read all the books and are on tenterhooks waiting and wondering if and when the next one will come. You may instead be a fan of the HBO series, and have been anxiously awaiting the final season. Either way, it was the story that has drawn you in, time and again, and it's that story that has you here, now.\n\n**ARPOIAF has decided to get back to the basics.**\n\nYou will find no mechanics here; no claims lists full of troop numbers, levies, or economy spreadsheets. You will find a community of like-minded writers eager to post their chapters as a part of a never-ending tale where characters are limited only by your imagination, rather than your ability to min-max a skills sheet.\n\nA Roleplay of Ice and Fire is precisely that - a roleplay rather than a role playing game, where the world is built by the words woven upon the page and the plot is guided by the authors: the true masters of their characters' fates.\n\n##Prologue\n\n\nIt is the 370th year since Aegon\u2019s conquest. \n\nThe Long Night and the War for the Dawn interrupted the scramble for the throne of Westeros that began with the death of Robert Baratheon. The victory of the living over the dead came at a great cost and forced an armistice that satisfied no one.\n\n[Westeros remains divided](https://imgur.com/a/T1QtA3v) between two men who claim the title of King of the Andals, the Rhonyar, and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. In the east, the descendents of Aegon VI Targaryen and Shireen Baratheon sit upon the Iron Throne. In the west, the descendents of Tommen I Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell rule from the Golden Throne in Casterly Rock. With winter once again giving way to spring, the growing sentiment in both Royal Courts is that this state of affairs cannot endure indefinitely. \n\n*Two kings is too many.*\n\n##Roleplaying at ARPOIAF: Getting Started\n\n\n###What We Are\n[***A Roleplay of Ice and Fire***](https://www.reddit.com/r/arpoiaf/) is a roleplaying forum based here on Reddit, where users come together to write and collaborate in a shared world and their actions and decisions affect the people around them. It takes place after the events in the books have concluded, though in an alternate universe where the kingdom is split between kings Tommen I Baratheon and Aegon VI Targaryen following the War of Five Kings.\n\n###How the Roleplay Works\nThis is a reddit based RP - so all of the actual roleplay is done on /r/ARPOIAF. Basically, once you have your character approved and ready to go, you begin by posting to the sub - you write and describe what your character is doing, or going through, or thinking. Some people have storylines outlined before hand, and work toward some end goal. Others take in events around them, and develop their characters more organically. There is no right nor wrong way to go about it.\n\nThe key to any roleplay is interaction. Your character will be affected by the decisions and choices of other characters, especially those nearby. You can interact with these people by commenting on their posts (often called threads) and beginning a conversation. They will then reply, and so on, and so on. Its usually best to arrange such interactions OOC - use our [Discord chatroom](https://discord.gg/6UmrpB2) to get to know your fellow roleplayers.\n\nA big issue many new players have is grasping how the timeline works. Because this is a forum-style roleplay, and not everyone can be on all the time, our timeline works in a very fluid fashion. You're allowed to have more than one thread open, where your character is interacting with more than one person at a time. At this time there is no direct IC time - OOC time conversion. (More on how time works can be found below, in the TIme, Travel, and Distance section.)\n\nGetting the hang of reddit RP can take some time, but with the help of the ARPOIAF community, it won't be as hard as you think. All of Westeros and Essos is open to you - you, as your character, can interact with it however you see fit. Craft your character's story in a way that is meaningful to you - and watch as it meshes and builds upon the tales of those around you.\n\n###Creating a Character\nCreating characters on ARPOIAF is a simple two-step process, but before you begin you must first have a character in mind. Westeros, Essos, and the lands beyond are home to a wide cast of races, cultures, and civilizations, the vast majority of which are open for your choosing. You should, however, choose a character that you\u2019re interested in writing, and won\u2019t abandon. \n\nIf the house your character is from has not been established by another player in the RP, you\u2019re free to flesh out its family members. If a house you wish to play in has already been claimed, feel free to contact the player who established it, and talk to them about picking up a member. Most players are more than happy to share a house \u2013 but if they refuse, you must pick a different one. Though we do our best to make sure there are plenty of family members for new players to pick up, there are, of course, a limited number of members in each family. Late additions to Great Houses will not be accepted.\n\n[**Currently, we are accepting Major Character applications!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/arpoiaf/comments/92ndrx/major_character_applications_part_deux/)\n\n###Character Skills, Abilities, or Traits\nARPOIAF is a \u2018roleplay\u2019 (RP) rather than a 'roleplaying game' (RPG); that means your character\u2019s traits ought to come out through your writing, not a list of skills. It's advised that you don\u2019t create a character based around a skillset, but rather choose skills that fit the character you wish to create. There is no skills-sheet here, but writers must make note of any advanced skills or exceptional characteristics their character may possess on their application for approval. \n\nAbilities involving magic are approved at moderator discretion for players who have already proven themselves mature and responsible writers - this includes the possession of special creatures.\n\n###Applications\nOnce you have your character in mind, you\u2019re ready to move on to the character creation process. Completing the application is a fairly simple procedure, meant to be thorough and detailed without being overwhelming. It asks for the most basic aspects of the character you have in mind (their name, house, titles. age, appearance, etc.), but also requires an outline of your character\u2019s history, family, and household, and which gets you to make decisions on just who your character is. A successful application needs two moderators' approvals. \n\nTwo characters may be applied for when a writer initally joins the roleplay. All others must wait until these characters are adequately established.\n\n###Alts\nAlternate characters, or Alts, are characters that are played by a person who already has one or more previously established characters. In ARPOIAF you are allowed to make as many as you wish dependent on your activity level, whether or not you have dropped any characters, and at the discretion of the mods.  No two alts may be of the same house, and we encourage you to branch out, trying your hand at different regions, personalities, and walks of life.\n\n###Jumping In\nOnce your application has been approved by two moderators, you\u2019re ready to begin! How you do that is entirely up to you. It's often a good idea to get a general grasp of what has been going on in your region \u2013 this can be achieved by visiting our State of the Realm page, or by hopping on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6UmrpB2) to talk with our incredibly helpful community. Once you have your bearings, the world is yours to explore. Go on an adventure, try your hand at court intrigue, or attempt to expand on the glory of your house. How you roleplay is up to you.\n\n###Time, Travel, and Distance\nBecause ARPOIAF is a roleplay, not an RPG, the focus is on the story, not \u201cwinning\u201d. Things like travel and distance and time \u2013 while important \u2013 are also fairly malleable. There is no direct correlation between IC time and OOC time, nor is there a hard and fast rule on how long you should wait between posts when traveling. Most often such decisions are left to the discretion of the player, though of course the mods will step in if they feel action needs to be taken. A good way to keep things aligned is to remember that you cannot \u2018win\u2019 a roleplay. Attempting to move too quickly in an effort to defeat your opponents, or skipping over long stretches of time or distance to gain an advantage, are both examples of metagaming, and are frowned upon. Do your best to keep your timeline in line with other players. Communication with the rest of the community and the mod team is a fantastic way of doing this.\n\nThe moderators will keep a watchful eye out for time-bubbles and will help to facilitate moving past them, making decisions for absent writers if the need arises. The moderators will also keep players abreast of when a new moon is due to arrive, so that everyone can attempt to stay on the same page/timeline.\n\n###Wealth and Conquests\nTo continue on with the theme of \u2018there is no winning an RP\u2019, wealth and conquests are two features that are often too strongly focused upon by new players. No one is saying you cannot be rich, or conquer plenty of lands \u2013 but the story is the focus here, not artificial gains. While the overarching fortunes of your family can absolutely affect how you RP, the gritty details are usually unimportant.\n\nConquests are similar. If you mean to take up a title in Essos, or Westeros, and immediately begin to conquer the world, you\u2019ll find your process slow going. Wars are not fought nor won in a day. They take time to build up, prepare for, and execute. While major shifts in borders are possible, expected, and even hoped for, try to avoid creating a character just to wage war on others. We cannot stress enough that the focus should be on your story \u2013 not victory.\n\n###Battles\nThere are two ways for battles to be decided. The first way is for the participants to settle upon an outcome between them. If both parties agree on how the events occur, they can write out the battle as they see fit, and post it on the subreddit.\n\nIf the combatants cannot agree, however, a Narrator-run battle will take place. This is facilitated by the Narrator, and will be an interactive battle post in which success and damage rolls are made that will produce a binding and final decision.  Players may lose their characters in such a battle, or suffer wounds or capture.\n\n\n###Where You Fit In\nEach story and character is unique. Every player that joins ARPOIAF brings something to the table that wasn\u2019t there before, and is a valued and appreciated member of a story we all work together to create. Whether you wish to play as a king or beggar, merchant or mercenary, your tale will contribute to the lore of ARPOIAF, giving it depth, purpose, and hopefully giving your fellow RPers an even more fleshed out world to expand upon. What you choose to do with your time here is up to you \u2013 but every story, no matter its size or scope, is welcome.",

And we know now that there is not one divine power\u2014but there are many gods who watch over us, holding the fate of mankind in their very hands. The Ancient Pantheons have been fighting each other for supreme rule over mankind for millennia. So much so that it started an eternal war, that if not stopped would bring ruin to The Universe. In attempt to humble the gods, The Universe destroyed each of their kingdoms, sending every remaining god plummeting down to the Earth's surface where they would be mortal, living and fighting for survival in human civilization until peace was made between the three groups.\u2800\u2800\u2800** \n\n**Now** **the gods have been on earth for millennia; some thriving, some fading away into existence. Even with their mortal bodies they are still connected to their domains. As humans moved and warped the world they've forced old domains of gods to shrink into nothingness; their gods with them. But that isn't the only thing killing the gods. The Universe conveniently forgot that the Gods were not the only immortals, yet they were the only ones cursed. Titans, Giants, Monsters, and Demons still live, but now the gods are not there to keep them in place. The, titanspawn, as they now are known aren't stupid. They've kept a low profile over the years as the humans started to believe they did not exist. But they've always shared one goal; kill the fallen gods that used to imprison them.   From the moment the Gods were cursed they were hunted. But in the past century things have quieted down. Have the monsters of old given up or are they just beginning?**  \n\nThis will be a modern mythology rp. We are only accepting Gods from the Norse, Egyptian, and Greek/Roman pantheons but that includes the monsters from that myths, in fact we desperately welcome people willing to play our Titanspawn (villains) Literate 3rd person only.

            "selftext": "Galaan is a high-fantasy dungeonpunk server filled with various races, creatures, and cultures. The following are the primary nations in Galaan.\n\n**Ruddahara** is a barren, desert continent located in the Southern parts of the known world. Ruddahara is known for its luxurious spices, its abundant supply of mithril, and its unique matriarchy. in Ruddahara, the women are the primary social presence and are both taller and physically more powerful than the Ruddaharan men. They are known as some of the best warriors to walk the planet due to their natural agility and endurance.\n\n**Kroslavia** is a nation located North of Invictus. It's a frigid, wild land with giant animals, plants, and terrible snowstorms. The Kroslavians are equally giant, in order to survive. Most stand at around 3.5m on average and possess skin tones on a monochrome spectrum. Kroslavian culture is based on the concepts of survival of the fittest and \"might makes right\". It has various Slavic and Alaskan native influences, in terms of it folklore, architecture, and language. In most lands, they are seen as being 'barely' human and are often feared and shunned.\n\n**The Ren'Do** is a massive jungle east of Invictus. Not much is known about the Ren'Do other than the fact that no machine was able to fly over it, and it is impossible to map, as the locations and landmarks in the jungle shift at a seemingly random process. The Ren'Do is home to various beastfolk tribes that live inside it. It is rumored that, while in the jungle, they have free reign over what form they may take, as long as it pertains to their tribal 'animal'.\n\n**Invictus** is *the* largest military power in all of Galaan. Known for their war-centered culture and rich architecture, music, and appreciation for the fine arts, Invictus has became the cultural center of the world. They are known mainly for their history of repetitive victories and superiority in any organized event. In fact, the word 'Victory' in other lands derives from this nation. Invictans are a brutal people, however, as gladiator battles are still considered to be prime entertainment in the capital.\n\nThe Twin Islands, **Yarelle** and **Ganderfell**, are the technological and magical superpowers of the world. Existing as a pair of floating islands as of the past hundred years. Yarelle and Ganderfell are the only nations in the world to have developed, and perfected, air travel. The people of these two islands, collectively known as Yarions, are renown for their innate ability to metabolize and generate magic, as well as their near-indefinite lifespan.\n\n**Teikoku** is known as the Spirit Land. It's an exotic and mysterious land that's often seen as the Eastern counterpart to Invictus. Teikoku is filled with its own groups of clans, ranging from the demon-associated Yakuma clan that dwell in the lowest valleys, to the mysterious and aloof Tatsu clan that live in the highest mountains. The most populated clan is the Otora clan, which is coined as the Invictus of the East.\n\nThe history of Galaan was shaped largely by the roleplayers in the server, with only a few nudges from the staff. Every roleplayer is given their own chance to make a mark in the history of Galaan!\n\nInterested? Stop by and one of our friendly staff can fill you in!\n\nNo, really. Join in! We need more people to keep the server alive!\n\n[https://discord.gg/hueynpU](https://discord.gg/hueynpU)",

I also love fantasy with sci-fi elements mixed in.\n\n**About me:** I am 29, and looking for partners 18+. I write in close third person, past tense, usually 3-5 paragraphs at a time depending on what the story calls for. Discord, Google Docs, or email would be easiest for me to use, but I'm open to other options.\n\n**Availability:** Noon-4pm and 10pm-2am EST. I like to post multiple times a day, but I am open to RPing with partners who'd like to post less frequently. \n\n**Things I love:**\n\nDrama\n\nCharacter growth\n\nDark themes (racism, slavery, etc)\n\nGrey morality\n\nViolence and realistic, bloody battles \n\nCharacters with flaws, both physical and mental\n\n**Relationships:**\nI enjoy romance if it develops organically, preferably with a realistically slow build up, but I am not looking to set up an RP with romance as the primary goal. Likewise, I am only interested in sex if it actually makes sense for those characters to have it. Whether I'll describe sex in detail or \"fade to black\" depends on the situation and my RP partner. I like m/m and m/f pairings. I play male and female characters equally, and have no preference for what you play as. \n\n**Characters:**\nI strongly prefer nonhuman characters - monsters, daedra, beastfolk, talking animals, androids, etc.  I do not have a stable of characters to pick from.  I create a new character for every RP so I can tailor them to the plot and to my partner's character for the sake of having good chemistry.  I am really flexible on the types of characters I play, so if you have a preference let me know and I may accommodate you.\n\n[Click here to view some writing samples taken directly from previous RPs.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-7ss87TsTNI38S-1wjyGRflvhud2jHGVuyAFugaUOV8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIf you are interested, please send me a writing sample and a bit about what you're looking for. :)",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone who clicked on my post!\n\nAs you can tell, I am looking for a roleplay based around the awesome world of Pok\u00e9mon. To give you a basic premise of what I have in mind, a new mayor has been elected in the Kanto region. In order to bring new people to the region which has begun to dwindle, he has implemented a series of trials for the trainers that sign up to compete for positions as the new gym leaders. There will be familiar faces among the competitors, including some of the gym leaders themselves attempting to get their former positions back. To add another layer to the competition, each gym has been made into duo gyms in order to differentiate from other regions. People can come with a partner to sign up, or can be assigned a partner upon entering. That is likely how our characters would come to know each other. This year is the inaugural trials and has a massive turn out of people all across Kanto and other people coming from the other regions to try out.\n\nI prefer long term roleplays. I like to see EFFORT in replies. No one liners. It doesn\u2019t always have to be a novel, but come on, you know how to give details people. I am also looking for a PARTNER for this roleplay, not somebody to passively make posts alongside me while I tell a story. Your input is just as important as mine is. I expect you to push the story along beside me. There can be a romance angel, but I don\u2019t want it to focus on that.\n\nAs for who our characters will be, I already have mine created and can send you the opening prompt that introduces her once we get things started. Yours is entirely up to you! If you are interested, send me a pm to discuss things!\n\nThank you!",

I don\u2019t mind NSFW aspects, so I want to make sure nobody is getting into any trouble, even if there is no NSFW scenes in our story.\n\n2, be somewhat literate and enthusiastic. RP is supposed to be fun for everyone involved. It\u2019s hard to be motivated with someone who gives one word responses or doesn\u2019t seem very excited about the world we are creating together.\n\n3, be active. I don\u2019t expect instant replies, but a couple posts a day would be nice. Also, if you decide you don\u2019t want to continue, some fair warning would be nice instead of total abandonment. If you get busy, no big deal, just let me know so I\u2019m not constantly checking.\n\nThat\u2019s about it.

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am a 21 year old US\nmale looking for a Roleplay partner. I am not very strict on the requirements for that partner... the only thing I ask is a passion for writing.. the response length can vary depending on where we are within our writing: \n\n1.)\u201dNow you're king of the mountain, aren't ya, but it's all garbage!\u201d- This role-play is my newest role-play idea. Loosely based off of the contents of the popular retro-anime \u201cAkira\u201d, it would follow the story of our OC\u2019s and how they meet within this Neocity. Some of the teens in the city have been deemed as danger and classified with a mental disorder but in reality they\u2019re battling with the ongoing growth of their new psychic abilities which they often use to cause trouble with the city\u2019s martial law as well as with each other. They keep their powers hidden for the most part to maintain a normal appearance ( I.E. going to highschool , parties, etc). Plot is still in development so we can make this our own!\n\n2.) \u201cTitans GO!\u201d- This role-play feeds more into my own love for the teen titans and I wanted to create a plot around the day in and day out lives of the titans... we could play our own OC(s) who have been added to the team or we could plays as some of the titans ourselves evolving their characters in whatever plot we see fit.\n\n3.)\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the Winchester\u2019s\u201d- This role-play takes place within the realm of the hit-tv show \u201cSupernatural\u201d. I am a huge fan of the show and of almost every single character brought to life on the show either as hunter or hunted... why not write our own story based off of their rules. \n\n4.) \u201cWe ain\u2019t in Kansas anymore\u201d- This idea is actually the brainchild of my recent rewatching of two staple retro anime\u2019s \u201cCowboy Bebop\u201d as well as \u201cSpace Dandy\u201d. I thought the idea of my OC exploring all of time and space with another\u2019s OC for the exploit of currency would be fun . This plot is extremely volatile and we could discuss more details of this is a tune you\u2019re tapping your feet to.\n\n5.)  \"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed \u2014 or worse, expelled.\u201d- this Roleplay idea sets place in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, we don\u2019t have to necessarily write off the canon storyline but in fact create our own plot(s) within their \u201crules\u201d with our own oc(s). \n\n6.) \u201cThe world is full of monsters with friendly faces\u201d.- I wanted to dust off the old vampire cliche and create something new with a roleplaying partner who is interested in creating something different. \n\nI am extremely open to other ideas... these are just some I had kicking around my noggin. \n\nPM if interested!\n",

In our world, arcade characters live their own little lives when their games aren't being played. Our setting is heavily Wreck It Ralph based- but we encourage OCs.  You don't have to limit yourself to game characters or regular people. You can bring your creation as is! Some 'real' people have already discovered the arcade world.\n\nWe're looking for quality, para style players who enjoy story driven writing. You don't need to have seen the movie. We'll help you figure out how the setting works at your pace. c: We're just happy to see new faces. \n\nWe're also pretty chill and won't mind if you peek in and don't decide to stay. (The server does not announce your arrival.) Some folks have already been playing if you'd like to browse the Rp section and see what our style/flavor is like.   \n\n\n[https://wreckitrp.weebly.com/](https://wreckitrp.weebly.com/)",

Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

As the title of this thread suggests, I am looking for Roleplay partners who are interested in the fandom of The Orville!\n\nThis is the first sci-fi show that I\u2019ve really gotten into, with the exception of later seasons of Agents of SHIELD, and I really really love it. The characters are great, and the humor isn\u2019t forced or too shticky.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get on to the main part...the characters! I\u2019m looking to play as Commander Kelly Grayson, and I\u2019m looking for someone to play as her sarcastic ex-husband Captain Ed Mercer. I love this pairing because they\u2019re both so snarky and kind of ridiculous human beings, especially when they\u2019re together.\n\nI don\u2019t have any plots figured out just yet, but that\u2019s something we can talk about. Since it is set in the future and in space, there\u2019s plenty we can work with.\n\nSome info about me:\n* I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+.\n* I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply.\n* I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out.\n* I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does.\n* I would prefer literate partners.\n\nInterested? Excellent! Feel free to comment here or shoot me a message! I look forward to plotting with you! ",

Some of them are more fleshed out than others, I guess just ask about them. Some of their back stories aren't the best, for the most part I'm not gonna change them. I'm mainly looking to play against female characters, cuz I don't have good experiences against male characters. Put some effort into your first message, tell me about the character or your idea for whatever you're messaging me for, leave your Discord and we'll go from there. Also, it's fine if you change your mind,you but do not just block me out of nowhere and act like I didn't exist. I think that about covers everything, so I've got characters for:\n\n*Steven Universe*\n\nStar Wars\n\nDC\n\nMarvel\n\nMegaMan\n\nNaruto\n\nDragonball\n\n*Avatar*\n\nDevil May Cry\n\nHalo \n\nRWBY\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\nDead Rising\n\n*Archer*\n\nAssassin's Creed\n\nWitcher\n\n*Zelda*\n\nMario\n\nI might be forgetting a few others, but there's the most part.

            "selftext": "# Fallout: Dust\n\n\" After the fall, little remained of the old Mojave Wasteland.  Once-powerful factions such as Caesar's Legion, Great Khans, and Powder  Gangers were either wiped out or dissolved into roaming gangs of tribals  and survivors. Cannibalism became rampant, as people did whatever they  could to survive. The NCR remained in control of various locations such  as Camp Golf, Hoover Dam, and Nellis AFB. Those fortunate enough to  evacuate the Mojave mostly wound up at Camp Adytum, an NCR/Followers  refugee centre in the Boneyard. The NCR would eventually launch  expeditions into the ruins of New Vegas, presumably to acquire materials  left over from the Lucky 38 laboratories. However, none of these  expeditions were successful, and the NCR soon abandoned all attempts to return to New Vegas.\"\n\n# What this includes:\n\n\\-  A RP based off the Fallout New Vegas Mod, Dust. It uses it's lore, and  will contain a harsh RP for those looking for a realistic 'edge' to  Fallout RP.\n\n\\- Open positions for staff or lore helpers/writers.\n\n\\- Fresh and new, allowing people to shape the RP to their standards (with permission, of course.)\n\n\\- Inter to advanced RP which will be mandatory.\n\n\\- Perk system which resets after characters death!\n\n\\- A character sheet which allows you to change and develop your character.\n\nLink: [https://discord.gg/sCgXGhr](https://discord.gg/sCgXGhr)",

            "selftext": "In this rp, we would both take part in constructing the rp together, and would center around one of us playing Darkrai on a quest to awaken/revive an ancient entity that was locked away by Arceus that may be their precursor. The other person would play characters from the anime, and this would take place in a custom large island region called Pyaki that has a capital named Jiro City. I will also post the bio of the precursor in this rp below. Must be able to play both male and female roles. Please, also remind me of type matchups and Pok\u00e9mon I forget.\n\nName: Zaryn\nAppearance: 8 foot tall, pitch black bipedal creature with a head like Darkrai but with no white part, 2 red eyes, and a jagged stop, and a jaw it can open full of sharp teeth. It has spikes all over it\u2019s back and blade like protrusions on it\u2019s fists with claws as well.  It has 5 fingers like a human.\nType: Dark, Poison?\nMain Abilities: \nSoul Plague: A plague that corrupts the very soul of a human, making them a violent entity with black, oily blood and completely pitch black eyes, and changing hair to black and skin to pale. Other symptoms are extreme violence, and mania.\nThe Corruption: Corrupts an area and changes all Pok\u00e9mon in it to dark versions of themselves. It\u2019s realm is completely corrupted.\nRest of it\u2019s abilities are strikingly similar to Darkrai\u2019s abilities, and some more things as well that will he explained in RP.\nDiet: Carnivorous.\nStrengths and Weaknesses: In the dark, it can heal itself easily and can evade attackers quite well if needed. In the light, it is almost impossible for it to heal and has the vision of a normal human, unable to see things of supernatural nature. Something like a flashbang would blind it of course for a bit, but also hurt it. Not only will Zaryn be the main enemy, but he will also have his own Cult of sorts, Team Dark Sky. They are a menace to society, more than most \u2018teams\u2019 in the Pok\u00e9mon series as they focus in a more cult-like manner. They\u2019ll kill themselves if they feel they\u2019ve failed Zaryn. They\u2019ll sacrifice both humans and Pok\u00e9mon. And like other teams, they\u2019ll have a base as well in a strangely high tech manner, attempting to continue the work Zaryn once worked on himself...and they\u2019re succeeding. They also have an opponent, a team of ex-military, mafia, any combat role, you name it. It\u2019s called Clear Sky [Yes, a Stalker Reference] dedicated to stopping them at any cost.\n\nEdit: Presets: Presets will help if you want to play a set role instead of an OC. You can choose more than one\n\nPreset 1: Ash \n\nPlay as Ash and his Pok\u00e9mon. You\u2019ve recently moved into Jiro City, and have met some nice people. At night though, You occasionally see a purple glow from the nearby forest...\n\nPreset 2: Team Rocket\n\nPlay as Jesse, James, and Meowth, etc.. \n\nYou\u2019ve been sent to a cave in Pyaki near Jiro City to check in on a lab in a cave investigating a temple older than most known history. You were never fully briefed why, and have a bad feeling about it...\n\nPreset 3: Darkrai\n\nPlay as Darkrai on it\u2019s quest to awaken it\u2019s precursor. You\u2019re almost there, just a little further....\n\nPreset 4: Arceus\nPlay as Arceus on a quest to stop Dark Sky from making an abomination. It turns out you\u2019re too late, and they\u2019ve made something called Neorai with a mix of DNA from something called Zaryn, and Darkrai...it is the perfect life form, to them. It is going to corrupt the entire world to be like Zaryn\u2019s Dark World/The Void.\n\nPreset 5: Neorai\n\nPlay as the abomination known as Neorai. You look like Darkrai, just...imagine what a mega evolution would look like, I have a pic, but give it stronger legs, a green eye, and the power of a god that died before Arceus, unknown to anyone but the \u2018cursed\u2019 and the \u2018blessed\u2019, which is Neorai.\n\nPreset 6: Myrrah\nPlay as a Ancient Lucario. Bio is below.\n\n\nName: Myrrah\n\nRace: Void Lucario\n\nType: Dark-Fighting\n\nAge: ???\n\nBio: There was once a war between Humans and Lucarios. Myrrah was a normal soldier, until his left arm was ripped off and was visited by a Void Monster, and given the power to regenerate by hatred. His hate fuels his power. When they surrendered, he ran away and became a killer of anything living until he died and went to the Void. He now has escaped into Pyaki, and is ready to kill again...\n\nPM me for contact info",

            "selftext": "**I've stated this before but I still get flooded with a lot of low effort responses: Please only contact me if you can write a similar length as me and are capable of a similar frequency. I generally just ignore low effort and poorly written messages because I want to write with people that care about their work and put time into it. Furthermore, I'm not capable of messaging everyone back due to the ton of messages that I get, so please, as I said, only respond if you're serious!**\n\nHi, I'm a twenty-one-year-old from California. I did the whole college thing for a while but a lack of money and opportunity led me to look at other career options, however, I still have a passion for writing and I would like to work towards that for the future. I'm taking a break from writing more serious, personal projects and I want to dive back into writing just as a hobby with someone else. Considering the fact that the majority of the writing I do is solo, you might not be surprised that I prefer to roleplay exclusively as a DM (please have some experience with that sort of thing). However, I like to think that my system of doing so is unique and offers an unforgettable experience!\n\nAs a DM, I like to create a story. However, I know that because of the nature of roleplay, a story isn't always immersive and alluring. So, I have always DM'd with a promise of difficulty. What does that mean, you might wonder. Well, it means I like there to be a real sense of difficulty and consequence to your character's actions. I regularly kill many of my own characters and add in obstacles for your character, if only to prevent them from reaching their goals when they make a decision that will negatively impact them. Furthermore, I prefer it if you give me permission to cause injury and fatality to your character (I rarely actually do it) just to ensure that we both are in the mindset of 'we should probably be careful otherwise we'll die'. Honestly, roleplay got boring to me after a while because it felt like living the same story over and over. Basic plot, two characters meet, there's some action, forced romance, and eventually one of the partners gets bored and is no longer interested. Maybe that's just my unfortunate experience, but I like to add real flavor and emotion to my stories.\n\nWith that out of the way, I typically respond 5-10 times per day and with 300-600 words on average (often more). I don't ask that you write as much as I do, but I would greatly appreciate a partner that can respond at the same frequency! I have no problem writing twice as much as you but the amount of responses is important to help move the story along. Of course, I totally understand if you work, study, have kids, or whatever else. A heads up is all I need!\n\nAs for the plot: Mass Effect. I don't have anything beyond that figured out, however. All that's **important** to me is that your character isn't a predeveloped space jesus. I like your character to start from nothing and work their way up.\n\nOne last thing: I'm looking for more than just a partner. I'm looking for someone to be more than a stranger and at least something resembling a friend. It sucks writing with someone and never really knowing anything beyond that about them.\n\nI'm sure this is starting to get long, so I'll cut it off here. If you're interested or have any questions, please message me! Thanks for reading!",
