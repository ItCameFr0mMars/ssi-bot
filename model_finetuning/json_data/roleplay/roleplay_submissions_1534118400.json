I want to get back into role playing but I feel like I\u2019m terrible at messaging casually. Allot of my conversations with people seem to go no where \u201chey how ya doing\u201d \u201cgood and you?\u201d And then the conversation burns out within 20 minutes or so. I figure if I can\u2019t even text people regularly then I sure as hell won\u2019t be able to roleplay a full blow character with good dialogue and actions, etc. etc. Have any of you experienced something like this after not role playing for awhile? Should I try to again? Any advice? Thanks guys :) first time posting here ",

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nI am looking for an advanced, long-term roleplay partner to do a romantic, slice of life roleplay with over PM, that includes lots of drama and twists and turns. I am looking for someone who is literate and can write multiple paragraphs per response. This is meant to be a story that we create together, so input and ideas from both parties are necessary to make this enjoyable for both of us.\n\nA little forewarning, I only play original characters and would like your character to be an original character too. Straight off the bat, I'll let you know now that I don't do roleplays that are based on the generes of fandom, supernatural, fantasy, medieval... etc. so if that's what you're looking for, then this is the wrong post for you.\n\nAnyway, a bit about my roleplay history... I've been doing text based roleplay for about 4 years now, with a main preference for romance and slice of life roleplays. I have been told that I am a literate and detailed roleplayer, and I put a great emphasis on using correct spelling and grammar in my responses. In terms of response length, I usually write a few paragraphs, dependant on the situation. As a general rule of thumb, the more I get, the more I give back, but it's never less than a paragraph. \n\nI am looking to create a roleplay where our characters already begin in an established relationship together, and can explore that relationship throughout the course of the roleplay, as different events and situations arise in their lives. I know this may sounds strange and a little boring, but I have a few ideas in mind that you can read over if you choose to PM me.\n\nAs for NSFW, I am comfortable with NSFW elements in a roleplay, but am happy to exclude them too. If NSFW elements are incorporated, I personally prefer my roleplay's to revolve around the plot and storyline, rather than the NSFW elements themselves.\n\nI'm hoping that I have expressed enough detail for you to be interested, without writing an entire essay. If you would like to roleplay with me or hear more about my ideas, feel free to send me a PM. If you have any ideas then I'm more than happy to hear those too, if you feel that they align with what I'm looking for.",

I dislike one-liners and people without grammatical skills during roleplay.\n\n\nHopefully this isn't too much to ask. If there are any active roleplay groups, I'm happy for them to send me a message here on reddit. If anybody wants to do a 1x1 roleplay with me, preferably someone who can play multiple roles, I'm up for that also. I roleplay primarily on Discord, sometimes on Skype and Kik too.\n\nCheers!",

While our site offers a one-of-a-kind searchable database with hundreds of members to browse with their likes and dislikes posted for all to see, our Discord has become a storytelling portal and a community effort. Our mission may be to connect people around the world and let their creativity shine, but for the last year, our Discord has grown into something more.\n\nOur server offers both one-on-one and group advertisements to help you find your perfect partner, as well as a whole section of writing help channels to encourage you to become the writer you've always wanted to be. We boast useful sources, writer's block busters, and a section to ask your burning writing questions where someone is always around to answer! In addition, we post a daily question to make you think about your characters, your writing style, and how you tackle a story. As a perpetually active server, there's almost always someone around to chat with, bounce ideas off of, or relax from a stressful day.\n\nDon't believe us? We asked our members what their favorite parts of RPC were:\n\n\"The friendly community, post-a-plot, and the way the list is set up is my favorite!\" \n\"The community is the best part. Everyone is really nice.\" \n\"I enjoy how welcoming everyone is, and helpful as well.\"\n\"Post-a-plot is a great way to get a new idea, and there's plenty of writers to indirectly learn from.\"\n\"The community itself is my favorite part, even though I do like thinking over the questions of the day.\" \n\"It's crystal clear that RPC is a very loving commuity where there's a place at the table for everyone!\"\n\nhttps://discord.gg/A476RXk &lt;\u2014 \u2728",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m looking for a literate partner who is okay with a dark, sexual, semi-romantic and a humorous roleplay. Said partner should be able to make an OC character bio, be able to make drama inside the plot at the snap of a finger. I don\u2019t care if you decide not to tell me about the sudden change. I like surprises. I like to be shocked. It\u2019s all the fun of roleplay. \n\nAnyways, the plot I\u2019m interested in right now is this pre-apocalypse world where The Horsemen (I hope you do consider making your character apart of The Four Horsemen, but again, your choice), come down to Earth to initiate the apocalypse. The Horsemen separate to four different, non-specific countries to break open the gates of Hell. My character finds out about this from an ancient scroll and attempts to find one of The Horsemen to try and get them to stop their siblings from ending the world. \n\nThis is just a baseline plot. If you want to add anything, I\u2019d be interested in hearing what you have planned. \n",

I wont share my name publicly, but that isn't the point. I have a couple roleplays in mind and other than that the rest is up to you!!\n\nI am perfectly fine with unfamiliar T.V. shows, Books, Movies, ect. Just give me the gist of it and be patient with me. I love anime, criminal justice shows, slice of life (as long as you  can keep it interesting), and fantasy is one of my top favorites! I can do smut, but I would like to focus it mainly on story. BUT if you are so, so desperate I can make an exception for you. ^^\n\nAs for my \"scenarios\" I like to keep them very, very open. Some I will be more detailed when introducing them and will expect a certain amount of \"love\" for them.\n\nShows: Naruto \u2661, MyHeroAcademia, Criminal Minds \u2661(or something along those lines), Disney, Pok\u00e9mon, Star Wars, Marvel, DC, Harry Potter \u2661, etc. I do want all OCs (Original Characters) for these roleplays. If you cannot come up with one, or habe a certain idea in mind for the scenerio that uses the canon characters; I can make an exception.\n\nGames: Beyond Two Souls \u2661, Heavy Rain \u2661, Detroit Become Human, Horizon Zero Dawn \u2661, Watch_Dogs I &amp; II, Fallout. Skyrim, etc.\n\nSlice of Life (Sort of?): FBI or some sort of Criminal Action stuff(?), New Roomates, Brother&amp;Sister/Father&amp;Daughter, Prison, etc. Slice of life is really hard to get me interested in, as I adore adventure and action. If you can somehow fit action/adventure into a slice of life scenerio, let me know.\n\nFantasy: This is self explanatory. Original Characters, Action, Adventure, Romance, Betrayal, and more. Difference Races, Species, Magic, Technology, and so kuch more. To your minds extent! I love this because it is very flexable within the story, anything could happen. We could even do like super heros or fantasy set in the \"real world\"!\n\nThose are my \"scenerios\" that I have in mind. I do like for the person I am roleplaying with to be somewhat literate as well as have somewhat long posts, not three paragraphs everytime, but at LEAST one everytime. If you have anything else in mind for me, hit me up on reddit and I will give you my kik. Sadly, I do not have Discord, but I am avaliable on Reddit if that is more convenient to you. Anyway, thanks. Message me with the code: You're a Dummy. If you do not, I probably wont reply. Cheers!",

            "selftext": "I read the manga Les Bijoux years ago and really liked the idea of a character that changes sex. For those who have not read this manga, the MC in this manga was born a male, named Lapis. However, at times (he can not control these times) he changes into a woman, and goes by Lazuli. Lazuli is loved by the main antagonist in this manga, while Lapis is hated (because he stood up to/attacked the villain) It's not until near the end of the story that the villain learns that Lapis and Lazuli are the same person.\n\nI'm looking for someone to rp with who would play the love interest for my character, who was born female, but sometimes changes to male (depending on the setting, this could be because of a curse, or the character is a metahuman or whatever)\n\nThe setting can be historical, modern, fantasy, or science fiction, and I am not too picky about your male character - I don't care much about ethnicity, occupation or age as long as you have fun.\n\nBasically, your character would already be romantically involved with my character (while she is female) and he is not aware of her curse/ability, but has come across her male aspect in another sphere (they can be rivals or friends) This can lead to comedy or drama, however you want the mood of the rp to be. He does eventually find out, which can lead to more comedy or drama. I'm pretty flexible, PM me if this sounds like it could be fun.\n\nThis RP can have NSFW scenes or no, depending on your tastes. Your character could even be bi or pan, which means that he would appreciate both aspects of my character. Again, I'm pretty flexible.",

Honestly I don\u2019t have much of a plot in mind as I\u2019m putting this up without any planning, but I\u2019m sure we can figure something out. Whether your character is a gunslinger, a sheriff or a scheming criminal is entirely up to you. Pretty much I just like the charm of the theme. \nAs a forewarning, I don\u2019t really do the actual roleplay on reddit, so other platforms would be preferable.

Angst. Drama. Darkness. Light. Engaging plot. Multiple main characters. Side characters. All of the elements that make it feel more like a fully fleshed out story, instead of something forced. If any of this sounds like what you\u2019ve been looking for, then keep going!\n\nThe nuts and bolts\u2026I write in third person, past-tense para form. Response times can vary, depending on what is going on. Most of the time, I\u2019m able to respond multiple times per day. If there\u2019s any lapse in days I can put something out, then I\u2019ll let you know. I\u2019m laid back when it comes to response times, but generally I find it harder to get into the start of an rp if responses are sparse early on.\n\nPosts range from 150-600+ words, depending on what is happening. Also not too picky about this\u2026All I require is that I\u2019m not receiving one or two-liners, and that we both feel we\u2019re putting in similar levels of effort. All of my main pairings are MxF, but I am willing to write MxM or FxF for your main(s), or any side characters. For anyone looking to write anything other than M for their main, I expect to be *doubling* here. Love doubling and getting invested in multiple stories! Also, very OOC chatter friendly. Exchanging gifs, musical inspirations, pinterest boards, and what not is completely welcome. \n \n*ORIGINAL* What I\u2019m currently looking for:\nHistorical/eras (18th-20th century, Gallic Wars/Ancient Rome, willing to try other eras)\nGang related/Crime drama \nComplicated relationships \nModern (Without feeling too slice of lifey) \nSirens/Mermaids/Mythological \nRunaways/Spies/Kidnapping/War-time drama, so on. \n \n*FANDOMS*  i\u2019m currently feelin\u2019. Disclaimer: I don\u2019t usually write canonxcanon, only canonxOC or OCxOC. AU-friendly.\n\nFallout (Faction-centric, or something off the grid.)\nElder Scrolls (Dragon War era, Dragon crisis, Oblivion crisis, Morrowind, ESO, something Miraak-centric would be amazing!) \nSalem (Something dealing with witches, covens, &amp; the supernatural loosely based off the premise) GoT/ASOIAF\nNearly any period show you can think of :\u2019)  \n \nThanks for hangin' in there! Feel free to pitch a plot idea or character, and we can build from there. Or, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, just drop a starter&amp;your preferred place to write and let\u2019s see where it takes us.\n \nPreferred places to write\u2026Email, Skype, Kik, gdocs.\n",

The US government employed scientists to investigate it, first by building a machine around it, to both contain and stabilize it followed by a facility to house it. Months went by as they sent drones into the rift only to find a black abyss with objects seemingly from other times and other realities floating aimlessly inside. It had seemed baron and lifeless until the incident. Not much is known about what transpired moments before it happened, practically nothing was left in the wake of the event. The machine had collapsed into the rift as it detonated spreading a kind of radiation that created widespread madness across North America. The UN quickly scrambled to assist in evacuation creating refugee towns across the world. North America lies fairly abandoned save for the unlucky souls who had failed to evacuate, it's borders quaranited by the newly formed United Nations Army.\n2019: During the three years refugee towns began either collapsing or growing, violence spreading as the radiation greatly affected the minds of some. The UNA stepped up their strength with the development of new technology and even hybridization. Even then the effects of the radiation began manifesting in other ways as kids across the world began developing powers. Some were taken by the UNA never to be seen again while others managed to hide in amongst the people.\n2028 (Present): With the strength and influence of the UN and UNA things have begun to stabilize. But unbeknownst to many there would be a new threat arising.\n\nLooking for individuals willing to play a UNA agent tasked with hunting down the powered individuals or to play a powered individual trying to survive in the world.\n\nAnthro friendly, hardcore themes will be present, and I want it to be largely nonsexual.",

            "selftext": "Hi there, you can call me Rae. I'm a 23 year old woman living in CST. I've been writing creatively on and off for many years, starting in elementary school. Right now, I'm coming off a months long hiatus from roleplaying so might be a bit rusty! My writing is 3rd person multi-para format, my average response is at least 2 paragraphs (outside of action scenes/conversation) while my intros are usually at least 5 paragraphs. I ask my partner write a similar amount to me! I love little details. In the past I have most often roleplayed over email with some sort of Instant Messenger like Discord, Skype, etc. for OOC chat. I would be willing to do all communication over Discord though! I am comfortable with violence, gore, horror, etc. and those things being written in detail. I love little details after all. Regarding sex, at this time, I'm undecided if I would prefer fade-to-black or would be open to writing things out should it come up. Please keep that in mind!\n\n\\*Note\\*: Since our writing may include sexual themes, I will not roleplay with anyone under 18. Sorry!\n\nAll that being said, what I'm interested in:\n\nMy main interest is something original that we could create together. For this, I would require some element of fantasy (specifically, magic/powers). This can be set in medieval times, present day, near future, far future, post apoc, whatever you like. Personally, I find magic and the high-tech aspect of far future to be really fun and interesting to mix together! Aside from that requirement, I'm very open to hearing any ideas you might have and would love to work on something amazing! I do also have ideas of my own that I'd be happy to explore with you too!\n\nFor fandom related things, I really enjoy Star Wars, Pokemon, and My Hero Academia/BNHA, though I'm not caught up on the anime at all so it would be a pretty basic concept type of thing. I would play an OC regardless of canon chosen. I once did a Rogue One Star Wars roleplay opposite a Cassian and it was one of my favorite roleplays I've ever done! Pokemon roleplays would be more 'mature' and abide more by how real life is. If you have another fandom you're interested in, let me know in case I've seen it and would be interested in doing it!",

            "selftext": "ello! I am a 21 year old US\nmale looking for a Roleplay partner. I am not very strict on the requirements for that partner... the only thing I ask is a passion for writing.. the response length can vary depending on where we are within our writing: \n\n1.)\u201dNow you're king of the mountain, aren't ya, but it's all garbage!\u201d- This role-play is my newest role-play idea. Loosely based off of the contents of the popular retro-anime \u201cAkira\u201d, it would follow the story of our OC\u2019s and how they meet within this Neocity. Some of the teens in the city have been deemed as danger and classified with a mental disorder but in reality they\u2019re battling with the ongoing growth of their new psychic abilities which they often use to cause trouble with the city\u2019s martial law as well as with each other. They keep their powers hidden for the most part to maintain a normal appearance ( I.E. going to highschool , parties, etc). Plot is still in development so we can make this our own!\n\n2.) \u201cTitans GO!\u201d- This role-play feeds more into my own love for the teen titans and I wanted to create a plot around the day in and day out lives of the titans... we could play our own OC(s) who have been added to the team or we could plays as some of the titans ourselves evolving their characters in whatever plot we see fit.\n\n3.)\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the Winchester\u2019s\u201d- This role-play takes place within the realm of the hit-tv show \u201cSupernatural\u201d. I am a huge fan of the show and of almost every single character brought to life on the show either as hunter or hunted... why not write our own story based off of their rules. \n\n4.) \u201cWe ain\u2019t in Kansas anymore\u201d- This idea is actually the brainchild of my recent rewatching of two staple retro anime\u2019s \u201cCowboy Bebop\u201d as well as \u201cSpace Dandy\u201d. I thought the idea of my OC exploring all of time and space with another\u2019s OC for the exploit of currency would be fun . This plot is extremely volatile and we could discuss more details of this is a tune you\u2019re tapping your feet to.\n\n5.)  \"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed \u2014 or worse, expelled.\u201d- this Roleplay idea sets place in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, we don\u2019t have to necessarily write off the canon storyline but in fact create our own plot(s) within their \u201crules\u201d with our own oc(s). \n\n6.) \u201cThe world is full of monsters with friendly faces\u201d.- I wanted to dust off the old vampire cliche and create something new with a roleplaying partner who is interested in creating something different. \n\nI am extremely open to other ideas... these are just some I had kicking around my noggin. \n\nPM if interested!\n",

Yet, it was a world known for its\u2019 luxury spires - wide, open spaces, large courtyards and the oddest of all, it natural ocean areas. It was this world that a young woman by the name of Renee called home. She was not one of the nobles, but she had been lucky enough to not be born in deep slums of the world. No, her skills had earned her a bit of easy life. Not the best, but not the worse. She did not have to spend her days working in the manufactorums, instead her time was spent in the grand courtyards. Painting.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nShe had other skills as well, a known writer though her words had never made it into anything of note. She could play music, which earned her a few extra credits here and there. But what paid her bills was her art. Often painting the massive spires, or vast oceans of the world. Painting that hung in office buildings and the homes of the wealthy.Renee had never had to work in the same place twice after her work was done, traveling from place to place as she wished. Skills that she had learned because of her love books, and the story of the Remembercers of old. Even if people questioned her line of work. Not that she gave it a second thought, she was free. Or as free as one could be in the twisting maze that was this world.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nLife was good, or at least it was until the skys went dark with the shadows of the massive chapter ships of the legendary Astartes. Something that left the people in both awe and shock, what heresy had laid upon their world that would draw the eyes of the Emperor\u2019s angels. A mix of fear and honor rushed though the masses. Renee among them. Being able to see one. Maybe capture one in her work. Little did she know, her dream would turn into her worst nightmare.\n\nThis is one of my Primarch x Remembrancer ideas. Enjoy.\n\n&gt;**Warhammer 30k Prompt: Let me paint you. (Legion and Names are just placeholders. Feel free to approach me with any legion or character you want to play!)**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nHer name was Jolene, the youngest child of one of the minor noble houses of Terra and thus making her no one of real note as far as anyone was really concerned. That was until she was found to be of steady hand and artistic mind, able to give life to the world around in her both paints and charcoal. It was why her family funded her, helping her along until she was finally given the honor that was bestowed on all those that called themselves a member of the Imperial Rememberancer Order...to accompany the Fleets of the Great Crusade.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nIt took her almost a year of her twenty seven years alive to finally reached the 28th Expeditionary Fleet, the fleet who was called home by the Astartes Legion, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Children.\u201d Her muse screamed, her fingers inched to get to work. She had sketch what felt like hundreds of simple charcoal works capturing her journey, the people that worked aboard the ship, the ship itself. Now she would be able to prove her skill. She couldn\u2019t wait. Yet, her first few months among those that called the fleet home, she had gotten little to no real work done. Though she had made a friend with a young Imagist, who\u2019s work as of late had proved very lackluster. He had gotten good photos, just of poor quality.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Jolene, however, had taken interest in the still images. Often taking them and drawing them out. Breathing life into the images with paints and other mediums. Giving the once blurry images depth and meaning while in turn the young Imagist gave her images to work with that Jolene would not have been able to draw on her own. The Marines moved to fast in their day to day life that it would have been almost impossible to sit there and just draw them unless they wanted to be immortalized on canvas.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was those drawings, small paints that started to make circulationand in time caught the eye of one of her targets. A Captain of the Emperor\u2019s Children named Tharsis, then again she would have take time with any of the Astartes if they were willing to give it to her. Like many of the Marine\u2019s who had stories to tell, word had gotten around about the Captain. Said to be a lovey man, proud and arrogant. Then that could have been said about many of the Marine in the Third Legion. Men who seemed to strive for such perfection, noble men. Firm in purpose, loyal to the core. For a moment it made her work pale, how was she going to capture such a being?",

            "selftext": "**Do you ever have those cravings where you just want to roleplay without setting up a huge world or without having to come up with deep intricate lore before you start? Me too.**\n\nI've been craving a certain type of setting/plot for a while now and it's nothing too fancy: a high fantasy/medieval setting where two lost adventurers without coin become contractual bounty hunters for monsters that have been disturbing cities and villages. They need coin to buy a place to rest at night, after all. \n\nNow, I'd prefer a long-term RP that goes through several contracts and dips into character development after a while, but if you'd like a shorter story/one-shot, then that's okay with me too. For the sake of a starting location, let's say we bump into each other on a snowy mountain path and the nearest village is a few miles away.\n\nIn terms of rules, all I ask is that you use a past tense 3rd person POV, have enough substance in replies so we can go back and forth with each other easily, have a character that's at least 18+, and *please* don't use a Mary Sue/Gary Stu - I love character flaws. Aside from that, feel free to go hog-wild with your ideas. \n\nI'm a 26 y/o writer and would prefer someone that's at least in their 20's as well, but if you think you can bring the creativity, then age doesn't matter. I only ask for a certain age based on one concern of mine: I do *not* write explicit content - anything that suggests moving forward into mature sexual themes is an automatic fade-to-black for me.\n\n if you'd like to chat and start up this crazy idea of mine, feel free to PM/IM me. I prefer email but have since warmed up to the idea of posting through discord as well; I'll provide more of my info when we get to talking.\n\nThanks for reading this far into my post, and I hope to hear from you soon!",

The coordinates pointed to the middle of nowhere, far from any of the major cities or villages. It wasn't on Vale, or any of the other Kindom's continents either. \nHe stared at his map, looking at the blip in the middle of the landmass to the west of Vale and north of Vacou, watching it slowly fade before coming back to life once again. \nThe only thing that tore his eyes away was the sound of a tiny ding, and doors sliding open. He turned to the group that now stood before him, hunters and huntresses in training. \n\"Good to see you all.\" He said, straightening himself and putting his cane in front of him. \n\"Now you must be wondering why I called you head today. Well it's on account of a strange transmission that was sent to us. It gives a set of coordinates that frankly shouldn't mean a thing, but I don't want to take the risk.\" He stated, starting to pace back and forth in front of the group. \"Therefor, I won't. Your team will be heading there to investigate. I can't send any large amount of students there otherwise the other kingdoms might grow suspicious. You will be taken to the edge of the island and work your ways in. When you reach the point you will survey the area and then return. If there aren't any questions, I'd like you to get set as soon as possible.\" He said before turning to look at the map once again. \n\n*End Prompt*\n\nHope you were interested enough to read through and consider sending me a message!

I'm always interested in starting new roleplays with exciting partners! I've been looking over the summer but I'm still hoping to get some more long term partners.\n\nA bit about myself, I'm a big fan of reading, gaming, movies and writing and find roleplay to fit nicely in as a hobby alongside a most of them. I'm interested in a wide range of genres from science fiction, to more generic fantasy and espionage style roleplay just to name a few. My favourite genre overall is cyberpunk but it is quite niche and very rare to find a partner interested in it, so bonus points if you are! Other genre's / settings I'm interested in are Lovecraftian, Apocalyptic and honestly anything fictional I'm most likely to be interested in it! Just give me your suggestions or idea's and i'll be happy to discuss and see what works for both of us. \n\nI also have numerous prompts on my profile, but they all lean more to an adult setting. I don't mind with our roleplay being more adult orientated or not. I'm fine with either, although I would like the roleplay to be somewhat mature in tone. Any sexual aspect would be depending on your presence.\n\nI'm open to any ideas or discussions, just fire me a PM and we can see if we work out. Hope to hear from you soon!",

That, however, did help his current line of work.\n\nHe's been around the block a few times in the past. Got through school, served a term in the military, even served actively on a humanitarian mission, returned and held a few different jobs, but things didn't quite work out. The volatile state of the economy didn't help much either. Eventually, he became a courier, delivering various packages with dubious content for shady customers. \n\nThe job pays decently and while it has its risks, he's good at avoiding them, remaining unseen. Due to the risks involved, he distanced himself from those last few members of his family he had been in contact in, the one or two friends he had, and refuses to get close to anyone. It's a lonely life, but at least it's a life, right?\n\nThen, one day, he receives a special reward from a client of his. It comes with a cryptic message. Something about empty souls weighing down healthy bodies. It looks like one of those new generation virtual assistants... at first. It soon turns out that the she's a lot more than that as she begins to display signs of genuine sentience, feelings included.

            "selftext": "Hello all! I am looking for someone to join me in what will hopefully be a long term roleplay set in the word of Pok\u00e9mon. I have a few different scenarios in mind to play with and am also open to idea that you may have.  To be clear though I am looking for someone to play another Pok\u00e9mon trainer with me and not a Pok\u00e9mon. Now with that said here are the idea I have come up with. \n\n1. Our characters grew up in the same town and started out traveling together. However, several years have passed since then and we have grown apart. Now you are a member of Team (Your Choice) while I continued my journey and entered Pok\u00e9mon League tournaments in various regions. Not long after I arrived in the region your team operates in I am ambushed by several members of your team and a baby Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve been taking care of is stolen for forced evolution experiments. Now I\u2019ve broken into one of their hideouts in search of my Pok\u00e9mon and find myself facing off against an old friend turned enemy. Will we be forced to fight as your loyalty to your team is unwavering or will the bond we once shared as friends be reborn and will you help me look for my lost Pok\u00e9mon?\n\n2. You are a Pok\u00e9mon researcher recently come to town investigating possible sightings of the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Heatran. As the local Gym Leader it is only natural that you would want to speak to me about what I know of these rumors. With the regional League Tournament having just ended I decide to temporarily close my gym to join you on your search for Heatran. \n\n3. Classic story of two trainers who become friends during their journey. We always seem to find ourselves running into each other. One of us prefers entering Contests and the other prefers to challenge Gyms, yet whenever we find ourselves in the same town we always find time to support one another. Eventually we decided it\u2019d be fun to travel together for awhile. Training together, battling other trainers and occasionally Team Rocket, catching new Pok\u00e9mon, and all the while winning ribbons and badges. Let\u2019s find out how long our adventure can last. \n\nSo those are the ideas for scenarios I\u2019ve had and like I said before I am always willing to hear your ideas as well. My preferred method of writing is Google Docs lately, but am willing to use Kik and Discord as well. Feel free to send me a message if you are interested in getting something started or have any questions. So long as this post is up I will be looking for potential partners. Hope to hear from you soon. ",

            "selftext": "Earth, during the 37th Century. A world that was on the verge of complete and utter war. The nations of the world, fighting for what little natural resources remained. The countries had been ravaged when the war came to its inevitable conclusion. A conclusion that the smartest individuals of the world had prepared for. Nuclear attacks. No one could remember who fired the first nuclear strike. No one even remembered when the bombs dropped. Those that have are probably long dead. Or changed. It doesn\u2019t matter at the end though. The earth itself seemed to shatter upon the impact of each bomb that struck the earth. The cities that were hit were utterly destroyed. 75 percent of the world\u2019s population was obliterated from the blasts. For a moment, a single dark moment, whatever dark Gods that reigned above and saw the World...thought it was over. But...as has been seen before. Humanity can still survive. \n\nWhich brings us to current day...in the 47th century. Humanity has rebuilt itself, though not to the same majesty that it once was. As all the world\u2019s older fuels have been destroyed, a new fuel has arisen. Bio. And not in the sense of reusable fuels. Bio. Unfortunate souls who wouldn\u2019t be able to survive in the world are used as living batteries, their bodies powering cities and their souls utilized as a fuel source. What natural fuels do remain are rare, and are often fought over by mega corporations which dot the desolate landscapes of the nation. But the most prized possession of all is power, and power can be gained in a multitude of ways. Not least of which is Mutation.\n\nFor every normal human that exists, though normal is an abject term when it comes to this place, there are ten or more Mutants. Their type ranges of course, but typically they fit into two styled categories. They are the Ravagers, mutants that have been turned into monstrous amalgamations of what they once were. They are still human like in appearance. But, only as far as their mutations will allow them. Some, like the roaming and nightstalking vampires, are blood crazed fiends addicted to their own vice. Their bisected mouths, lined with needle like teeth, drool for the prospect of draining the bioelectricity out of their prey. Still others, like the animal like Lupus, have adapted their bodies to that of a crazed beast, hunched over and ragged with long spindly arms and razor sharp claws. Whatever you desire to create yourself as, you shall become. And that is the rule for these monstrous mutations. However, the Ravagers are not the top beasts of the world. \n\nThere are still others. A dangerous third type of mutation. Genetically crafted monsters. Those that are akin to gods of this world. These Genetically Modified Organisms are often deemed World Killers. They are monsters of every kind. From tumorous masses with cancerous tissue dripping from their bodies, to dragon like titans who spew acid from their maws. They are the source of nightmares, designed by scientists who sought an end to the war. And they are considered Gods to many of the ravagers. There are few of these GMO\u2019s that exist. But those that do...bring terror wherever they walk. \n\nAnd here, in the ruined necropolis that was once London, lays the foundations of our new world. And it is here that the story begins. Perhaps you are a ravager, existing on the outskirts of the city, in the wasteland. Perhaps you are a regular human, surviving off the city of Golcanda. Or perhaps, you are one of those GMO\u2019s. A world killer who has awakened from lab 2A. Perhaps. What will you decide?  \n\n\nBiotic Revolution is a Biopunk themed roleplay set in a post-post apocalyptic earth. We are newly formed, with but a few members, but we are very inclusive and would leave to see people join in this fun new venture. Rules and lore can be further discussed when joined in, but please hop on in and discover the magic of this dark and twisted future, where your life can be altered with just a bit of genetic manipulation.  \n\n\n[`https://discord.gg/UQxc4zd`](https://discord.gg/UQxc4zd)",

I would prefer if you had the same writing style, but I\u2019ll work with whatever! I write on Discord mainly but could write on Skype as well.\n\nI'm currently looking for a Game of Thrones or historical roleplay at the moment. So please have seen GoT, or have read the books and played the game!!\n\nI tend to include a lot of drama, angst and not so nice characters in my roleplay, just to add some spice to it and make it a lot more interesting! I do include smut, but there has to be plot as well.\nThough saying that I do think smut does add some extra elements to a roleplay, but I don't want it in absolutely every scene.\n\nI tend to get quite inspired when roleplay, so if we end up roleplaying together, expect a lot of drawings, playlists and Pinterest boards :) \n\nI'm sorry for rambling on so long, hopefully you've gotten a good enough idea about me and how I like to write! I would love to hear from you so please send me a PM if you're interested!\n\nValar Morghulis &lt;3\n",

I do enjoy romance being thrown into my roleplays, so... I don't mind any romantic pairing, and mostly prefer homosexual ones, to be honest.\n\nHave anything YOU want to do?

It may be possible to make is NSFW if you would like with smut or gore, I'm not opposed. But we can keep it toned down as well and to time skips and the like. I'm looking for a gentleman who knows at least the basics of English (I understand the occasional misspelling and if your learning and such), and can do 3-5 paragraph replies, though it can go down to 1-2 when there is more of a personal interaction. Now onto the idea!\n\nYou're a vampire hunter, born and trained to kill vampires, though you can handle other creatures also. On one raid of a clan in an old castle, you find me, a weak, near starving vampire, to weak to do nearly anything. Seeing the perfect opportunity for a hostage, you quickly take me away and lock me in a cage in your basement. Where I'm thankful to be taken away from that God Forsaken place, I'm far to weak to even talk. You slowly bring me small game to drink from and I eventually get the strength to thank you. Upset by this, you ignore me for months again before you come back with more game. Furious, you question me to the point where I nearly die, prodding for information and why I thanked you. It ruined your entire impression of the blood suckers...\n\nFrom there it can go several ways. I love stories that grow organically, so I try to not make the basics to detailed. If you're interested, feel free to message me! Thanks guys!",

Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n- I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\n- Real Life Romance\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- Sci-Fi\n\n- Mecha\n\n- Halo\n\n- Elder Scrolls\n\n- Destiny\n\n- Superhero\n\n- Apocalypse\n\n\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon!

That being said NSFW or not, I'd prefer literate writers who aren't minors. \n\nAs for fandoms, I'm into a multitude of tv shows, anime, and video games.

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking for someone who might be interested in creating a setting similar to that of the SCP foundation, although with slight alterations where we might deem them necessary, OC characters and \"SCPs\" and possibly an entire new name for the sake of keeping a tiny bit of creative liberty. If you're not familiar with the SCP foundation, and still decided to click on this post, the SCP foundation is a fictional wiki/database of various different entities referred to as \"SCPs\" along with a number ranging from 0001 to 4999 as of now, with more being created every day. If you'd like to take a look at the setting and whatnot, I'd recommend reading some of the most famous ones such as SCP-173, 096, 106, 682, 087 etc.\n\nThere's also a subreddit if you want even more info, but that should be the gist of it. SCPs are not restricted to strange creatures, and might take the form of objects or places, and so we might see similar concepts in our own original setting. If you want any more info I'll be glad to answer all of your questions on Discord! ",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! Looking to make new and exciting stories with you! I am someone who has been roleplaying since I was 14 (now 28). It is something I have recently got back into with full force as a productive means to cope with anxiety and depression. So without much ado I will list the things I look for or like to do and I hope to hear from you soon. At the bottom I will also include a sample so you can get a sense of my writing style. Don\u2019t fret over the length. I do both shorter and longer paragraph style roleplays\n\n\nGenres/Plots: Modern, Slice of Life, Supernatural (think angels/demons with human invasion), Science Fiction, Post Apocalyptic, Cyberpunk, Fantasy (think LOTR but not fandom). I have several plots in mind that I would be more than happy to share.\n\n\nPairings: MxF is my main jam with me playing the male.\n\n\nRoleplay style: Prefer long length (400-600 words) but either longer or short is okay as well. The quality is more my sticking point than quantity. \n\n\nRoleplay length: Long term strongly preferred \n\n\nContacts/Mediums: Discord (will make a private server just for our rp) or email/google docs\n\n\nSample\n\n\nThe Captain was exhausted after his cross Atlantic voyage. He and the crew had just returned from another convoy mission delivering supplies to Europe to help against the Germans during WWII. Out of the 10 ships that left port, only their ship had made it past the German U-Boats without a burial at sea. The Beautiful Liberty had outmaneuvered several torpedo assaults due to his firm command of the Bridge when chaos was erupting all around them. A few men had died when cargo fell on their heads as they dodged the submarines but otherwise the crew was alive, minus bumps, bruises and a few ruptured ear drums.\n\n\nAs they neared the Eastern shores of the United States, a deep fog enveloped the lone vessel, reducing visibility to less than 1/3rd of a nautical mile. Leaning on his Naval Academy experience, the Captain slowed down the ship down to 2 knots, or less than 10 miles an hour. He then commanded the navigational crew to place on the spotlights to try and make out where land was. Minute after minute passed with only the fog covered bridge visible to him. Where is the damn lighthouse, he thought to himself. Typically the ship\u2019s crew would have already seen the guiding light in the darkness, directing them to safe harbor. Without its guidance, the crew were praying fervently that the course they had set on prior to entering the bay would lead them true.\n\n\nIt was not to be.\n\n\nThe lookout had barely been able to shout \u201cRocks ahead!\u201d before the ship crashed into their razor\u2019s edge points. Pandemonium quickly ensued as the crew went flying all around the ships, a few falling into the frigid waters of the Atlantic. The Captain quickly rose to his feet, immediately ordering a head count to see who was missing. Before the count could finished, a large explosion tore a gaping hole on the bow, the aftermath of the fuel being ignited by sparks caused by the collision with the shore. \u201cAbandon ship!\u201d cries echoed through the chaotic scene, flames rapidly consuming the Beautiful Liberty.\n\nStaying true to his training, the Captain refused to leave the ship until every man had gone overboard. There was no time to lower the lifeboats. They would have to take their chances in the freezing water and violent tides. Once he was certain everyone who had remained alive after the explosion was off the ship, the Captain navigated around burned corpses of his crew to make his way into the deep. As he began to leap, another explosion threw him overboard, plunging him into the water with unintended haste. Disoriented, the Captain steadied himself under the water before rising up, taking care to follow the bubbles so he did not swim down to his death. Once he broke the water\u2019s surface, the waves began to thrash him amount, placing him perilously close to the fine edged rocks along the shore. Debris continued to fly off the ship, landing with crashes into the water until a particular piece marked for him landed square on his head, rendering him unconscious.\n\n\nAfter several minutes, the waves carried him to a safe point of the shore, away from the sharp rocks. The Captain was hauled out of the water by an unknown woman and laid to rest on the soaked sand. As he laid upon the sand, the woman began to try and rouse him, hoping to bring him back from the brink before the tide rose again. Slowly, the man\u2019s consciousness was restored and he peered up at the warm face crouched over him. His head felt warm as the blood continued to pour down his face. He needed assistance quickly lest he bleed out and perish with the rest of his crew.\n\n\n",

Today, I'll be giving my full list so I won't have to limit myself! \n\nBefore I give my fandoms, I'd like to cover a few things!\n\nGender: I can play any gender and have no preference which you prefer to play!\n\nRomance: I'm 100% okay with romantic pairings within a roleplay and can do any sexuality of pairing from straight to gay!\n\nSmut: I'm also cool with smut, but I ask that there's a plot to go along with it! I get pretty bored when it's just constant sex, haha!\n\nStyle: I RP in third person, para-multi para style, but no worries if you don't match this! \n\nCharacters: I play canons most of the time and usually have a list of characters I enjoy for each fandom, so feel free to request that! I don't mind if you play an OC or canon, so do whatever you most enjoy!\n\nOkay! On to my list!

            "selftext": "Hey all, thanks for stopping by to check out my new ad, I really appreciate it. I hope you enjoy the ad and to hear from some of you soon.\n\nA little about me, I\u2019m in my late 20\u2019s, have a career, and participate in a handful of other extracurricular activities. My work schedule is a bit sporadic, but I can usually find blocks of times available to chat or write with a partner if you\u2019re not looking to play by post. I tend to post rather long, detailed posts anywhere between two to four paragraphs in the third person perspective. It would be ideal if I could find a partner that can match this, but if you feel you can progress or develop the story or situation with less I\u2019d be up for giving it a go. For this ad I\u2019ll only be using Discord to roleplay as I find it to be quite convenient and easy to use. Finally, I live in the Pacific Time Zone and am mostly available in the late evening, generally after 8 PM is a safe bet.\n\nAt one point or another, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all wished we could be whisked away to some magical land that only exists in books, shows, games, or our imaginations. I\u2019m proposing that our characters start the scenario off here, on Earth, living out their lives as either close friends or co-workers. Then, by means of some unknown, yet powerful anomaly, they're transported to an unfamiliar time or place having only each other to trust and rely on as they traverse these unknown lands. I realize that while this premise is not necessarily the most original or creative one out there, I still think that it provides us a prompt that is full of interesting and intriguing possibilities!\n\nI\u2019d prefer there to be some elements of fantasy involved in this, paired with major themes of romance, adventure, and action. For the romance, I\u2019d really like this to be something that develops over time and not rushed into. I\u2019d even prefer that just before they're both swept away to another land, both of our characters are actually in committed relationships, though there can be some chemistry or light/comical flirting so that there is a base to build off of. Action and adventure, I feel will happen rather naturally as they try and find their place in this new world, but I am up for discussing these themes in greater detail in DMs. I\u2019d also like to mention that I\u2019d eventually like there to be the possibility of some NSFW play once a romantic relationship between our characters has been established. It does not need to be a driving theme, but I would like to play it out every now and then when they get to that point. As I\u2019d like to keep this ad SFW, I will not be going into any further detail about this, any questions regarding it can be asked through DMs.\n\nIn regard to the new world the characters will be travelling to, I\u2019m up for anything from your favorite medieval fantasy setting to something futuristic or sci-fi based. I\u2019m even up for a bit of world building if that\u2019s your thing, however this is a great undertaking and takes a lot of time, patience, and collaboration. Below you\u2019ll find a list of a few themed settings that came to mind while writing up this ad. Please don\u2019t panic if you don\u2019t see something you like, you\u2019re more than welcome to tell me your own desires and suggestions. I might add that I really like the idea of our characters eventually developing fantasy-based powers or skills that pair with the setting we select as a byproduct of the anomaly that transported them there. If you\u2019d like, we can even have aspects of their appearance be changed, yet I\u2019d like their personalities and memories to be intact.\n\nWorld of Warcraft\n\nStar Wars / Star Trek\n\nMarvel/DC Universe\n\nFinal Fantasy Based Worlds\n\nKingdom Hearts\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender / The Legend of Korra\n\nHarry Potter\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nWell that wraps up my ad, thanks again for stopping by. If you have any questions, comments, or are just interested in playing, feel free to shoot me a DM with a little information about yourself and the world you\u2019d like to see us travel to.\n\nHave a good one!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm Cas and I'm looking for partners that are at least 21+ as that's old I am. Mature themes will be in my plots though limits will be discussed. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn't have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having long, thoughtful replies back where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance, using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship.\n\nLast but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along.\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n- 21+ partners\n\n- For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\n- For you to write as a male in thier 30s-40s and older. I'm a sucker for the gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. The broken ones who are rough around the edges and aren't afraid to throw a punch. But are tender enough provide a hug if needed.\n\n- The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life.\n\n- The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n- Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post or before it. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me.\n\nI love all types of genres, but especially urban fantasy and science fiction. Lately I\u2019ve been wanting something based off Castle Rock. All my characters will be adults and I require my partners do the same.\n\nFor plot ideas, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and possibly writing. Look forward to hearing from you!",

I'm mainly looking for World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 settings but generic fantasy or modern miiiiiight be okay depending on what we come up with.\n\nI'd like someone who comes to the table with ideas in mind, too - I get a lot of 'I'm okay with whatever!' and it never leads anywhere since we can never come up with an actual scene to get started.

            "selftext": "Galaan is a high fantasy roleplay server featuring multiple fantasy races, cultures, and monsters of all kinds. \n\nA pretty small server, most of the lore in Galaan is player-driven, inspired, or created. We're looking for new roleplayers with imaginative minds to join the server and add some spunk!\n\nHere's a summary of Galaan:  \n\n**Ruddahara** is a barren, desert continent located in the Southern parts of the known world. Ruddahara is known for its luxurious spices, its abundant supply of mithril, and its unique matriarchy. in Ruddahara, the women are the primary social presence and are both taller and physically more powerful than the Ruddaharan men. They are known as some of the best warriors to walk the planet due to their natural agility and endurance.\n\n**Kroslavia** is a nation located North of Invictus. It's a frigid, wild land with giant animals, plants, and terrible snowstorms. The Kroslavians are equally giant, in order to survive. Most stand at around 3.5m on average and possess skin tones on a monochrome spectrum. Kroslavian culture is based on the concepts of survival of the fittest and \"might makes right\". It has various Slavic and Alaskan native influences, in terms of it folklore, architecture, and language. In most lands, they are seen as being 'barely' human and are often feared and shunned.\n\n**The Ren'Do** is a massive jungle east of Invictus. Not much is known about the Ren'Do other than the fact that no machine was able to fly over it, and it is impossible to map, as the locations and landmarks in the jungle shift at a seemingly random process. The Ren'Do is home to various beastfolk tribes that live inside it. It is rumored that, while in the jungle, they have free reign over what form they may take, as long as it pertains to their tribal 'animal'.\n\n**Invictus** is *the* largest military power in all of Galaan. Known for their war-centered culture and rich architecture, music, and appreciation for the fine arts, Invictus has became the cultural center of the world. They are known mainly for their history of repetitive victories and superiority in any organized event. In fact, the word 'Victory' in other lands derives from this nation. Invictans are a brutal people, however, as gladiator battles are still considered to be prime entertainment in the capital.\n\nThe Twin Islands, **Yarelle** and **Ganderfell**, are the technological and magical superpowers of the world. Existing as a pair of floating islands as of the past hundred years. Yarelle and Ganderfell are the only nations in the world to have developed, and perfected, air travel. The people of these two islands, collectively known as Yarions, are renown for their innate ability to metabolize and generate magic, as well as their near-indefinite lifespan.\n\n**Teikoku** is known as the Spirit Land. It's an exotic and mysterious land that's often seen as the Eastern counterpart to Invictus. Teikoku is filled with its own groups of clans, ranging from the demon-associated Yakuma clan that dwell in the lowest valleys, to the mysterious and aloof Tatsu clan that live in the highest mountains. The most populated clan is the Otora clan, which is coined as the Invictus of the East.\n\nInterested? Stop by and one of our friendly staff can fill you in!\n\n[https://discord.gg/hueynpU](https://discord.gg/hueynpU)\n\nStop by, ask around. See if you find anything you like!",

I can stay on reddit or move to discord.\n\n- I give about three to four paragraphs typically and want the same in return.\n\n- I want us to use canon characters. I don't really like insert-me characters/OCs. I've seen too many poorly made ones lately.\n\n- I stick to third person, past tense. Me and my characters are different.\n\n- It's important we keep in touch to plot and stay on the same page. My partner should be happy and eager to post and that means voicing what we both want to happen. I love chatting with my partners. I also like knowing if any delay is gonna happen, if you need to wait a couple weeks, that's cool. I'm a patient person. I try to be chill but try not to keep me on the hook for too long. Generally speaking if we need a break, I'm fine as long as I'm not kept in the dark about it.\n\n- Lastly the general tone of my RPs tend to be light and focused on slice of life stuff. I don't need tons of action or dramatics happening all the time because it's just going to drain my motivation to post. To me writing is about escape and life is too dramatic to have it being written about as well. I want this to be fun, not bogged down by things like cheating or tons of lies and deception and drama. Conflict is fine but I'm not looking for a lot of depressing plots.

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm Courage. So, I've got the RP bug right now, and I'm looking for another partner to work something out with. I write in 3rd person paragraph style, since that's what I've found most comfortable, so I generally expect the same from my partner. At the very least, you ought to know how to put a decent sentence together. I'm not super picky on length, although I would prefer replies be at least a couple sentences long. One liners are ok sometimes, but if you're constantly doing them, I'm honestly going to lose interest quickly.\n\nI like a bit of romance between characters, and from that, I do naturally expect a bit of smut to crop up from time to time, which is fine so long as it doesnt interfere with the overall story. Because of this, I do require responders to be at the very least 18 years old, no exceptions.\n\nProvided you're ok with the above, lets talk the meat of what I'm looking for.\n\n[Fandoms] I am ok with doing a roleplay in an already existing world, however I do have to insist on OC's. I am most comfortable with anime and game worlds, but as long as I have a decent enough grasp on the world in question, there shouldn't be an issue. I am knowledgable enough to definitely be able to RP: -Naruto -Pokemon(Game) -My Hero Academia -DBZ -JoJo's Bizzare Adventure This is hardly all I'm willing to play with, but if one of these strikes your fancy, Im well ok with running it.\n\n[World Building] I'm well versed in building an entirely original world as well. If you're more interested in something like that, I'd be more than happy coming up with something with you. I enjoy the following genres and settings the most, but am open to ideas. -High Fantasy (Magic, strange creatures and races, etc.) -Distopian Future(Think Shadowrun and the like.) -Science Fiction &amp; Science Fantasy (Space play, SWN style, etc.)\n\nAs mentioned in the title, I roleplay on Discord. If you're interested after all that, please PM me with your Discord tag, and I'll try and get back to you as soon as I can. Please, please, remember to leave your discord tag amongst anything else you send in your reply. Forgetting it only slows things down which is no fun.\n\nWith all that settled, hope to see you soon!",

If this interests you, send me a PM with your Discord and we can get started!  \n\n\nMust:  \n\\- Have an OC (preferably one whose abilities/backstory don't greatly deviate from the already-established canon). I won't use canon characters in the story at all.   \n\\- Have Discord.  \n\\- Type in detailed, grammatically-correct sentences.  \n\\- Type in 3rd person.  \n\\- Have adequate knowledge on Black Clover, at least.  \n\\- Read all the rules I send before we start, and communicate any you may have with me.   \n\\- Be able to communicate on a consistent basis.

            "selftext": "Reposting.. Looking for Discord people.\n\nHey, \n\nI have been roleplaying for a very long time and started on IRC. (Dates me as a Dinosaur). I dig the complex, multi-faceted angles a character's personality can take. The more tortured your character in depth and backstory, the better. I like a level of realism in everything I do. The aim is a slow burning love story filled with twists &amp; turns, angst, love and betrayal. I want to get lost with someone in a story that we both can enjoy with equal composition. \n\n**Genres:** I love anything Ancient. Historical Drama in any sense of the word to be honest. Any Era from Egyptians on. History fascinates me. I like Middle Ages/Medieval. I love Victorian Era stuff. Dark themed stuff. Modern/Slice of Life as well as Supernatural/Horror. I honestly am into a lot of things so just IM me so we can have a parlay.\n\nNot into animae/video games characters as face claims.\n\n*Weaknesses:* I am not so great at space rps. I'm also inexperienced at some types of sci-fi. I have only recently gotten into Marvel/DC types and it's been hit or miss with partners who are actually good at those characters.\n\n*Strengths:* Emotionally stable writer not looking for ooc connections beyond writing. Descriptive. Imaginative. Non-Judgmental. Capable of many types of complex characters. Easy going player. Drama-Free.\n\n*\\*\\*Request (Not requirement)\\*\\** : I would like my partner to play longer haired pic-bases: Ex: Kit Harrington (Snow), Charlie Hunnan (Teller), Travis Fimmel (Ragnar), Brock OHurn, Jake Weary (Animal Kingdom), etc.\n\n**Pairings:**\n\nDangerous Biker/Old Lady or GF **|||** Warrior/Chieftain/King x Female Healer/Warrior/Assassin **|||** Gladiator x Senate Daughter **|||** Coastguard x Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter (old or Modern) **|||** Bootlegger x Hostage-Victim \\[20's-30's Era\\] **|||** Romeo x Juliet Typ**e |**|| Constable x Suspected Witch/\\[During the Salem Witch Trials**\\] |**|| God x Godde**ss **||| Demonologist x Female Medium \\[Victorian Er**a\\] **||| Anything Medieval Ty**pe ** ||| Elves, GoT, LoTR, etc. (Negotiab**le)** ||| Lawman/Texas Ranger x Prostitute (Wild West E**ra)** ||| Celebrity Play (Negotiab**le)** ||| MMA Fighter x Partygirl-Strip**per** ||| Knight-Drifter x Gypsy-Th**ief** ||| Kurt/Courtney or Sid/Nancy type lovest**ory** ||| Addict x Dea**ler** ||| Criminal or Inmate x Cop or Law**yer** ||| Mad Max Dystopian (Tom Hardy Face Claim Plea**se)** ||| Professor x Student (College or H**.S)** ||| WWII Soldier (American or British) x Childhood Sweethe**art** ||| Vampire plots (Negotiab**le)** ||| Werewolves/Supernatu**ral** ||| Slice of Life (Negotiab**le)** ||| 60's Woodstock Hippie/California P**lot** ||| Lovecraft-Style Hor**ror** ||| Pirate RP\n\n**Fandoms:** GoT, Boardwalk Empire, SOA, Damnation, Peaky Blinders, Taboo, AHS, and countless others. *\\*No Anime/video games in my arsenal\\**\n\n**Posting Style:**  I am looking for a matching Paragraph - Multi-Paragraph poster. *(No one liners)*. Please be literate, descriptive, and verbose. I typically post 3-7 paragraphs depending on what I have to work with and I mirror what I get in effort and imagination/description.",

            "selftext": "I've been interested in a Danganronpa roleplay. We could try to work out a plot, although Hope's Peak Academy setting is fine by me.   \nI roleplay as a few canons, perhaps not 100% accurate but I can try. The ones I can roleplay as are: Fuyuhiko; Hajime, Kazuichi; Kaito; Makoto; Togami; Nekomaru; Rantaro; Shuichi; Sonia and Keebo. I also have an OC. I kinda want to roleplay with other canons but OCs are fine as well. Any canon is fine, since I love them all, but below you can see my preferences:  \nKokichi Ouma  \nNagito Komaeda  \nJunko Enoshima   \nKyoko Kirigiri   \nChiaki Nanami   \nMikan Tsumiki   \nMiu Iruma  \nIzuru Kamukura  \nAoi Asahina   \nAngie Yonaga  \nMonokuma (shush, I love this guy too much. uwu)  \nKorekiyo Shinguji  \nMaki Harukawa   \nToko Fukawa   \nIbuki Mioda  \nKirumi Tojo   \nKiyotaka Ishimaru  \nAkane Owari  \nPeko Pekoyama  \nYasuhiro Hagakure  \nSeiko Kimura   \nGundham Tanaka\nSonia Nevermind \nI guess we could do ships but romance isn't my top priority. Character development and such things are highly encouraged. Also, to be fair, both of us can be canon and OC. And please be at least semi-lit.  \nIf you're interested, message me or comment this post. I'm more active on Discord. It's Naegi#4305. Thank you and have a good day.",

            "selftext": "Greetings and shit ain't my thing so I'll just say I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original.  I say \"consistently available partners\" because if I don't I get ghosted more often than if I don't include that in my post and I don't have the patience for that in the slightest.  I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a female character. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within 3-4 tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** From most to least interested I would sayyyy...My Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Pokemon, Splatoon, and Legend of Zelda.  I can try other fandoms but that's a case by case thing and anything that holds ZERO similarity to what I am looking for is likely a hard no.  Some outlying ideas people have come to me with that I've been okay with being things like Dragon Ball Z, Kingdom Hearts, Skullgirls and Shantae for example.  With Pokemon and Splatoon I have characters specifically for those, as for the rest I'd likely be repurposing some of my original characters. If you wanna play as a canon in one of these settings or just an OC, that's your choice and fine either way. But I'll most definitely be playing an OC myself.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~",

            "selftext": "Adelia Lavender stands silently among the heavy velvet curtains that skirt the stage. The heat from the spotlights makes her skin prickle with tiny beads of sweat that seem like minor inconveniences compared to the droplets that cling to the magician\u2019s forehead. Her striking blue eyes are not on him, however; rather she studies the audience and the way they study him. \n\nIt is a perfectly executed performance and it shows in the way they stare. Their awe is only amplified when, with a tip of his top hat, he vanishes. The crowd erupts in applause, leaping to their feet, a sea of excitement that echoes through the halls of the theatre. \n\nAs the lights on the stage dim seemingly on their own, as the patrons disperse, Adelia wanders away from the shadows of the red curtains. Backstage is quiet and still, as if she is alone. Many productions such as this have a great number of assistants scurrying about to insure that each trick goes according to plan. There is only a single assistant to the magician, save for the girl. He prefers to keep his entourage small. Secrets are safer this way. \n\nA single door is framed in pale light, shadows of figures walking within the room distorting it now and then. Upon the door is a small sign with elegant gold script that reads *The Illusionist.* It opens as she approaches, no hand ever brushing the old brass knob and closes behind her as she steps inside. The room is bright and warm, a contrast to the way the magician sulks in his chair in just a robe. \n\n\u201cI think I am losing my touch,\u201d the illusionist sighs as a glass of wine pours itself and nestles into his hand. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain you are not, Father,\u201d Adelia says with a hint of laughter in her voice. \u201cThe crowd was as pleased as ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d he trailed off as the door opened, creaking slightly in annoyance at its handled being used. \u201cTell her! Tell her I\u2019ve lost it.\u201d\n\nIn the doorway stands a young man carefully carrying a brilliant white cage filled with brilliant white doves. As he places it gently next to another cage, he gives Adelia a knowing look. She stifles a giggle, shaking her head. It has become a nearly nightly routine. The magician insists he has lost his ability to hold the crowd captive and his daughter reassures him gently. It is almost a game but Adelia has no desire to play this evening. \n\n\u201cI am going out this evening,\u201d She announces as she stretches her arms out, a coat materializing down her arms and buttoning itself over her chest. \u201cIt is the first evening of the Spring Carnival.\u201d \n\nNeither man attempts to stop her, knowing it is a fruitless effort. One settles in further with his wine and despite his many sips the glass never seems to empty. The other stares at where Adelia was only just standing, where all that remains is the faint scent of her perfume. He decides it is best to set his lessons aside for the evening, to let the illusionist drown his doubts in merlot, and to make his own way to the carnival at the edge of town. \n\n___________________\n\nMeet Adelia, the magician\u2019s daughter. \u00a0Her father is a performer, world known for his illusions and mystifying feats. What the audience doesn\u2019t know, however, is that his magic is real. It is a talent that Adelia too possesses. Only she and his assistant, whom is taking lessons from the magician, know the truth. \n\nI imagine your character as someone Adelia encounters at the carnival, perhaps an illusionist himself, the curator of the circus, or simply another visiting the celebration. You could be the assistant as well, studying alongside the magician and his daughter. Or, if you have your own idea, I am more than happy to hear it!\n\nMy hope is for something long term. I love stories with great detail full of romance and drama, of twists and turns and the unexpected. There are ideas brewing inside my brain of where a story such as this could go and there are so many possible pathways. It could be a tale of great love or of great tragedy. It will be magical and adventurous. It will be fun. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you.",

I would rather it not be solely smut happening, but I'm fine with those themes. Face into black or not I don't mind. I'm looking for a Roommate Appeal this time, they don't need to be Canon Relationships such as Clint for example, with his wife. I'm fine with throwing together anyone or even if you have an OC you would like to add. As long as they are of age and it somewhat makes sense. But don't get me wrong I am fine with things like Starlord and Gamora, and whatnot but I had to clarify.\n\nLong Term would be best, or even a short term is fine with me! I am totally fine with MxM and whatever the case may be, honestly. I'm just looking for a nice Roleplay to dwell into. You can bring anything into the table!\n\nI use Discord, I now hold a preference to that when Roleplaying. Due to italics and bold, and the longer frame. All I ask is for a literate person, with no four liners. At least 6 or 7 :)\n\nFor Marvel, I Roleplay T'Challa, Peter Parker, Peter Quill, Deadpool, Hawkeye, but these are ones I've done! I can definitely try more with you, but these are the ones I am most comfortable with. We can also do certain Au, if you don't understand what that means you can ask me about it and I'll tell you!\n\nWith DC, I Roleplay Dick Grayson, Shazam, Beast Boy, Green Lantern, and Booster Gold. \n\nI can do female characters, but I can only be totally fine with it with FxF. This is mainly someone looking to play as Male, in this regard I am fine with it. MxF, MxM and others. It's just what I'm comfortable with, if that all sounds good or remotely interesting try to Dm me!",

Reply length varies, but I'd say generally it's 3-5 paragraphs. I only roleplay over email! Since I'm gay, I would prefer to write MxM pairings, but I'm willing to try MxF. I'm on summer holidays right now, but I'm working quite a bit before I go back to uni. Usually, I'll have time to reply once a day.\n\nPlot-wise, I'm interested in a lot of themes. Here's a quick list off the top of my head: Drama, mafia/mob scene, mythology, medieval fantasy, romance, adventure - yes I do realise this all sounds blatantly generic, but this is my first post here and I have no idea what I'm doing :') I would love to come up with an original story we can expand on together. It could be fantasy or real life, with dark themes or fluffy romance. If any of this interests you, I have some potential plots I'd love to discuss!\n\nI'll just shoot this message out into the void and see where that gets me. Looking forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "First of all, thank you for reading. Second, I am super laid back and ready to write! If romance is included I\u2019m already interested! Let\u2019s talk and set some stuff up!\n\nWho are you?: My name is Maddie and I am twenty-one years old and I am located in the lovely mountains of Kentucky. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for years and years as a hobby. I am found in the EST timezone. I am obsessed with Shinsou Hitoshi, cats, anime, learning about cultures, true crime, food, and drawing.\n\nWhere you RP: Kik, Skype, Discord, Email, maybe somewhere else if you ask!\n\nWhat you RP: Boku no/My Hero Academia, Naruto, Monster Munsume, One Piece, Pokemon, Supernatural (genre) and more so just ask me! It will mostly be movies, anime, cartoons, books.\nWhat you are looking for: I am looking for a mainly romantic story for my OC. I WILL DOUBLE FOR YOU NO MATTER WHAT, M/M, F/F, whatever else you are looking for. I can try to play any character from the anime listed below, but having a list to choose from is nice. Angst, fluff, hurt/comfort, slice of life, horror, supernatural (genre) is fine with me!\n\nCharacters you RP: I will usually always play as an original female character, but I will be happy to double as whoever you choose.\nCharacters you\u2019re looking to interact with: These are listed from \n\nMOST to LEAST wanted. MHA: Shinsou Hitoshi, Ojirou Mashirao , Sero Hanta , Bakugou Katsuki.\n\nNaruto: Gaara , Kankuro, Kiba Inuzuka, Shinki\n\nOne Piece: Sanji, Zoro, Law, Bellemy, Bartolomeo, Luffy???, Chopper??\n\nSnow White With The Red Hair: Obi, Zen, Ryu, Mitsuhide\n\nAngels of Death: Zack/Isaac Foster \n\nSuper Natural: Demons , Lamiia/Naga , Were creatures , Faeries, Witches/Warlocks/Wizards , Vampires ???\n\nParagraph or dialog form?: I prefer paragraph form, please!\n\nGrammar/Length requirements: Please have some decent grammar! No text talk unless it is in an actual text or note between characters. As for length I prefer two upwards to ten paragraphs, or around 650 words per side depending on how into the roleplay we both are. Two to three should work fine but sometimes I end up rambling.\n\nShort-term or long term?: Both! I vastly prefer long term.\n\nGenres I roleplay: Romance, horror, fantasy, tragedy, supernatural, hurt/comfort, fluff, angst.\n\nAs my partner, a person would have to: Become my friend! I love meeting new people and hearing stories. Talk with me OOC frequently if you can! Respect my boundaries and I\u2019ll do the same with you.\n\nOther ideas?: I have a few!\n\nA commoner girl catching the sights of a prince and allowed to move within the castle walls.\n\nForced marriage between two warring countries.\nMedieval assassin who falls in love with his target and decides to create a life with her.\n\nAn herbalist/traveler moving through a creature\u2019s (vampire, werebeast, etc) territory is taken as a hostage/wife.\n\nA daughter from a very wealthy family of hunters is gifted a rare beast for her birthday, and the two end up falling in love.\n\nI am completely open to ideas. Please send me a message if you\u2019re interested! If I sparked your interest, please message me with a little about yourself and what you\u2019d be interested in roleplaying! I look forward to talking with you!",

While slice of life has grown on me, I like having some sort of fantastical element, even if it\u2019s relatively minor. \n\nI am still in flying saucer mode. Give me something with the Men In Black, harassing abductees who then go on the run, or maybe something to do with Area 51. Bonus points if there\u2019s some sort of language barrier or the aliens are really, really alien. \n\nIn the last six months, I started playing Pathfinder and Starfinder, as well as writing my own campaigns for the future. If you\u2019re looking for someone to DM, I\u2019m your girl! \n\nI\u2019m not super in the mood for fandoms, but I could be convinced for a good story.\n\nI'm also open to other suggestions, please tell me if you've got something else on your mind!\n\nWhile I prefer to have romance in my stories, it\u2019s not a requirement. Let me know up front what you\u2019re interested in!\n\nWe can talk about our personal limits once we start talking, I hate to bog down a post with too much.\n\n",

More specifically, I want to explore Ethan falling in love with the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). His love could be consensual or it could be that Ethan finally loses it and kidnaps the White Widow to have his way with her. We could start from the scene where Ethan and the White Widow first meet. We could start it as a romantic roleplay following the movie a little but having our original twist. I feel like there are many paths that this roleplay can take. I feel like it could be a wild ride!\n\nWe could work out the details more if you are interested. Of course, I\u2019ll be playing as Ethan and you as White Widow (Vanessa Kirby).

Here I am looking for a roleplay partner again! \n\nI'll give you all a little quick note about me:\n\nFemale, 35, ESL (first language is Portuguese), work full time, roleplay through e-mail, reply at least once a day, prefer to write female characters, roleplay in 3rd person, prefer to fade to black and keep it safe for work, don't double. I guess that's all.\n\nAs for the partner I'm looking for: Either gender is cool, age, over 21, please, I'd like you to be able to reply at least a few times per week. For this plot, please be okay with roleplaying a male character. \n\nThe plot I'm looking to write is: A (my character) has always been sheltered and treated like a princess by her loving parents. When her mother passes away right before her eyes, she feels guilty and helpless, and goes into a severe depressed/suicidal state. Her wealthy and famous father quietly ships her off to a psychiatric facility and tells her she's to stay there until she's herself again. Isolated and lonely, she ends up falling for her therapist- and he ends up falling for her as well. Themes I want to explore: power dynamic, age gap (she's between 19 and 23, I'd like for him to be a bit older), forbidden love, forbidden relationship, maybe an unwanted/surprise pregnancy because I'm trash.\n\nInterested? Drop me a line and I'll get back to you! Thank you for reading!",

The scale of rp can range from playing a few spaceship crewmembers to roleplaying entitre ship-crews, fleets and colonies. And it can change over the corse of the story a little bit about the setting:\n\nHard sci_fi setting:This game setting is about the (relatively) vast interstellar expansion yet there is no \"magical\" hyperdrive technology or \"gates\" (at least none that humans know of.\u00a0\nSo starships are all Slower then light and use combination of solar sails, and antimatter catalysed fusion for propulsion. This means trips to even nearby stars take years and decades\u00a0 but advances in cryogenics allow the crews to endure even millenia long voyages (tho that would be really extreme)\u00a0\nTo save precious fuel and propulsion mass colossal lazer arrays are built in orbits around the stars using stars energy to power massive laser arrays and direct it at the solar sails of interstellar ships for boost of propulsion. Same solar sails are used to decelerate at the destination. Wichmakes traveling between colonised worlds alot easier.\u00a0\nThe expansion fleet would usually send a \"first wave\" (comparetively small ship) to scout out potentially interesting system. Upon arrival the first wave ship would deploy automated factories and buold an outpost. That will start generating fuel,\u00a0 precious milligramms of antimatter and eventually group of solar laser array sattelites allowing bigger ships to arrive, relive crews and begin building more ships.\nTechnologies we can run away with. Big on obviously is space travel but there quite a few addutuonal cool stuff to halp build the adventure: Cloning and gene mods - obvious and not soo obvious ramifications, Automation that allows automated factories, ships and entire industries to be build with minimal manning. Cybernetic implants both electro mechanical and biological. Atrificial intelligence and semi intelligence, overall sky is the limit.\u00a0",

I prefer Google Docs as a roleplay medium, but I can do both Skype and Discord as well. When it comes to fandoms, I of course have more than those listed above. I can do canon characters, but I have oc's for all the series. (Be warned that my \nmain OCs for both BNHA and DnD are female, although I have character ideas for male ones)\n\nI do not have any ideas when it comes to a story, but creating one together is part of the fun! If you're interested in roleplaying with me, or want to advertise a group, you're more than welcome to send me a PM on here so we can exchange contact information.\n\nHave a nice day regardless!",

Size matters, VR RP is not a thing yet\\] \n\n\u2022 Balancing **story** with **smut** \\[ This is for all the people that want something more than just pure smut, not saying that smut is forbidden, but if I wanted pure smut, there are countless of interactive lemons online, I assure you that a fruit tastes better if you eat it at the right moment\\] .\n\n\u2022 Honesty \\[I will not waste your time, if the things are not fine by the moment we start I will not drag you along only to poof after\\]\n\n\u2022 A roleplay has to be nice and fun for both sides, I believe that there are some amazing people out there and I'm here to meet people like them, if you want to give a taste to some fun roleplay, don't hesitate to contact me on reddit, we can discuss an actual plot there.\n\nWhy not detailing a Roleplay plot here? It would be quite pointless, I treat each person as unique and so has to be the roleplay plot, playing the same scenario over and over again is not fun.

BNHA: WC is a roleplaying server featuring original characters made by you and your fellow roleplayers! The server's plot and setting are completely separate from the canon BNHA universe, so please keep that in mind when considering to join! A plot description will be given below! This server is brand new and is looking for members to participate in the unique narrative that will be carried out. Students, staff, villains, and pro-heroes are all welcome to be created!\n\n\n**Boku No Hero Academia: Wild Cards is a literate roleplaying server. This means that all posts must be written in a third person narrative POV and must have a minimum of at least three sentences. Descriptiveness is key and always appreciated. Failure to comply with any of the server's rules will get you removed, as we wish to ensure the best possible roleplaying experience for everyone involved.**\n\n\n*One day long ago in Quig Quig, China, a luminescent baby was born with a unique power. Then, as time passed, the similar phenomena happened all over the world, and soon the majority of the population had obtained superhuman powers\u2014known as \u201cQuirks\u201d. Due to that, people were able to pursue heroism as a profession. However, with the changing pace of the world, it was no surprise when tensions began to rise. People with quirks became the norm and the quirkless were left to watch them rise to the occasion whenever trouble was afoot. While most quirkless individuals tended not to mind the heroes and even appreciated their valiance, a growing number of quirkless people felt that they had been completely forgotten by society.*\n\n*These quirkless individuals decided to take matters into their own hands, a select few even going so far as to bring about the production of \u201cartificial\u201d quirks. Artificial quirks are quirks that are given to a quirkless individual through a procedure specific to its type. Slight mutation quirks were distributed through surgical procedures, emitter quirks were given through implantation of various devices in the body, and transformation quirks had yet to be mastered. The scientific field unveiled artificial quirks to the public and the world began to change yet again. With the influx of artificial quirks, competition to get into hero schools skyrocketed to an all time high while several pro-heroes experienced a shift in their ranking. On account of all of this, there is typically a great deal of tensity between those with artificial and natal quirks\u2026 Society had begun to change and as fate would have it, artificial quirks eventually fell into the wrong hands.*\n\n*Today, there is a large ring of villains attempting to bring about change to the world once more. By forcing their hand, they believe that they can usher in a new breed of heroes and villains\u2014Heroes and villains that are practically hand crafted. Your story begins in Las Vegas, Nevada, a cesspool for crime and a hot spot for heroes to be. With Lady Luck Academy nearby and a plethora of budding heroes, paths are bound to cross and adventures are sure to be had. The only question is; Who will you be?*\n\n\n**If you've made it this far and you're interested, congratulations!

            "selftext": "Hey all, currently looking for new writers for an RP with a political bent in which each nation is a closed system. This allows for them to interact with each other in a much more stylised manner through a GM whilst having to contend with truly complex affairs both internally and externally, related both to their own character and the nation which they serve as a whole. The benefit of this from a writer's perspective is that it gives real reason to characterise extensively as to justify actions, rather than encouraging political machinations without depth.\n\nThree nations are currently fully staffed, and the last one I intend to have running is of a rather different nature than the previous three monarchies. As a republic, it'll have multiple writers each with significant influence and with one Merchant-Prince as the nominal head; either leading as a truly charismatic leader, or being manipulated by others as the face of the nation and nothing else. Each decision won't be a matter of right and wrong, but will rather relate to complex factors built over time, such as a the varying benefits of pragmatism over ideology and vice versa, which may well encourage factionalism over time if your character is going to ensure the nation progresses in the direction they intend it to.\n\nIf this at all interests you, or if you'd simply like to hear more about the world, feel free to PM me.\n\nCheers!",

Now, I'm a straight guy if you would want a sort of romance or smut-based RP, another warning, I'm pretty sub. Now, if that isn't enough to drive you away then congratulations, you may have found a good RP partner.\n\nWhat I'm looking to do is mostly a RP where two OC's interact in some way, be it where it's a hero and villain fighting, or just a pair of people interacting in average day-to-day life. Another fair warning regarding my earlier comment about vanishing, sometimes I may not be on at all some days, I have a life at times, and a job, and college for the next two miserable years of my life.\n\nNow, I'm not particularly seeking out something story-based, it's actually pretty hard to make one and takes a lot of time and commitment, along with some thinking ahead, so if you came here hoping to get a story based RP then I haven't much to offer, if you yourself are a writer of sorts and have your own little story in mind then I'd love to play along, a good story is appreciated.\n\nFor what I'll most likely play for an OC, if we go for magic and such, I'll be one of my main OC's, he's a spin-off of me. (narcisism inbound) He acts like me and does what I would in most situations, it feels more natural and easier to do for me. The details is that this OC used to live on a version of Earth, unfortunately his own creations came to life, good and bad, until the climax, where he managed to get primordial energies wrapped up in a creation, making something so powerful that it wiped out all life on this Earth. He wandered the wasteland that was once his home for exactly ten years until the Horsemen of the Apocalypse show up, they demand he be damned for all eternity for not keeping his powers in check, and just before War kills him, Death stops him and makes an offer. She (Yes, this Death is a she, as is Famine, and Pestilence) tells him he can keep his life at a cost, the removal of his powers to bend local space-time, and his abilities to create life. He accepts and the power is removed entirely, but Death looks at him with pity, so the Horsemen adopt him like a son, at this point he SHOULD be 29, yet due to magical complications, among other things, he always has, and will always look 19, over the course of the years he learns many magics and powers from the Horsemen, and he puts them to use in his daily life sometimes. After these few years end, they teach him how to \"World-Jump\", where one can use magic to create a portal to another world, be it in the same dimension or timeline doesn't matter. He bids them all farewell and begins a long, hard journey. He becomes an adventurer and legend on many worlds, making plenty of friends and allies, while collecting millions of magical relics. He collects the relics in hopes that if he were to combine them all together he would be able to bring life back to his world, and live out the rest of what he missed. Leading up until he enters the setting via portal, where it goes from there is completely up to you, as I tend to allow my partners more control so they feel more comfortable while RPing with me.\n\nIf you managed to survive this long and have even the slightest spark of interest, feel free to comment or PM me, I'm eager to meet the person who decides to make a new friend. Also, as a side note, if you ask me for smut RP's, don't expect them to be often, I can do about two-three times a day before it gets boring, if you read this far and decide not to contacgt me then thank you for taking the time to read this post and consider helping a guy our with his boredom. :3",

            "selftext": "Hi there! Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\nAs a change of pace, I am actually looking for two Specific Fandoms that I feel that I really want to RP. I usually post a generic post saying about how I am open to doing a hell of a lot of genres, which is still true, don't worry! Just this time, I'm looking for one or the other fandoms at the moment.\n\n- HALO : Halo has always been a number one fandom that I have loved to Rp in the past but have never really found someone perfect for the role. So for this RP, I can do alot of different themes/pairings so long as, said later, that the characters are indeed OC.\n\n- Destiny : Exactly the same as Halo, I absolutely love this game. To the point where I am a Lore Nerd as well as a Sherpa. I would love to find someone who would want to delve into the stories behind the game and the hundreds of years of lore prior to the first game beginning.\n\nAs always, here are my preferences:\n\n- I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nWith this being a specific post, I also ask of the following\n\n- Know what you're RPing! This seems like a common factor but please, just know what you're RPing. I dont mind explaining complex things but I dont want to have to turn around and explain what an ODST is or what a Warlock is. Please know what these fandoms are and have *some* knowledge about them, even if it's just the games.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey! I feel like doing a roleplay me and an old friend did around two years ago, involving an Arch-Angel, and a young rising Arch-Demon, known as a Demonic Prince.\n\nSo, here's how it'd play out. This RP takes place in the medieval times, around the 1400's, give or take a few decades. Your character, a female Arch-Angel would have been assaulting one of the seven strongholds within Hell along with various other angel's after the demon-kind has overstepped their boundaries. The strongholds, Imagine the seven deadly sins, though each one had their own castle within the underworld, which they operated from and used during their leisure time. While assaulting the castle, your character would come across a demon child. At the time, your character would not know this, but it is the son of Wraith. The demon had taken the form of a human baby, pinkish red skin, with small horns sprouting from its forehead. You're character decided to do the one thing she thought was right, and smuggle the child out of hell so he could live a normal life behind the other angel's backs, as this practice was uncommon, and often looked down upon by the other angels. You're character would of placed the demon within a royal family, a duke that held quite a bit of land. \n\nThat's where the RP starts really, at first it'll be your character observing the situations he finds himself in, the actions he takes. Though, as he get's into his teenage years, and early adulthood everything starts to fall apart for him, and that's when your character starts to step in place!\n\nI usually type at least a paragraph response, though it really depends on what I am given, as I try to match the other's length as best as I can. \n\nIf you are interested, feel free to PM me at any time!",
