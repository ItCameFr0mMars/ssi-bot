The ones I do keep often don't even RP with me we just end up being talking buddies.\n\nI never know how to act anymore either because I get two kinds of partners.\n\nSometimes I get partners who want everything to be done their way and expect me to be compliant and submissive. naturally this means that if I speak up at all they usually throw a fit about it.\n\nOther times I have partners who expect me to do all of the leading. These partners expect me to basically have entire plot idea written down, along with exactly how I want everything to go and they usually get annoyed at me if I show any semblance of trying to make them take a little responsibility.\n\nWhat I have noticed regardless for both sides however is that I no longer allowed to act out of character. I have to stay in character with basically everyone I meet now because anytime I am not their idea of perfect they ditch me.\n\nI can and in fact have shared thousands of messages with people where we get along great and then I have a little slip-up where maybe I'm just having a really bad day and need to vent a little bit, the point is I'm not at my best and that little slip-up ruins everything.\n\nAs opposed to when I first started role-playing a simple \"I'm sorry I was having a bad day\" was more than enough.\n\nI really just wish I could be myself again. \n\nMaybe it's just me. if I am right though, has anyone else noticed this? Has anyone else who has role played for a long time noticed that the community in general seems to have changed? \n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi! This is my first time posting here. I\u2019m not new to Reddit and not new to roleplaying, but I am newish to participating in an RP community. I tried forum style back in my teenage years and it worked for a time, but it was very short-lived. My roleplaying experience spans 12, nearly 13 years (I\u2019m 26 now) and has been majority 1x1. I\u2019ve had 3 partners. The first lasted a couple years until she moved and we grew apart, and the second was the partner I had the longest for the entire duration of those 12 years. We used the old dinosaur AIM until it died last year, and this partner is no longer around. The last and newest is a current partner, however the experience I get with them is very hit or miss for what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019m not super familiar with apps people use these days for roleplaying, so forgive me in advance for my ignorance\u2026 I guess this is the part where I tell you what I do/am looking for.\n\n* **Please be 18+.** The stories and worlds I\u2019ve created with my partners contain mature content. We can discuss in PM\u2019s\n* I don\u2019t do fandom RP\u2019s, just original stories with original characters\n* I write in 3rd person\n* I\u2019m not in character all the time. I like to chat OOC \n* I like stories with at least a couple of arcs, intersecting or not, but I\u2019m also open to simpler RP\u2019s\n* I like a good balance of plot and romance. Excessive focus on romance or one particular couple tends to put me off (if the story has multiple couples to focus on that is). Sometimes the story can shift to certain characters for longer than others, and that\u2019s cool\n* I can adapt to almost any setting. I\u2019ve done (and really enjoy) realistic and historically influenced, fantasy (modern or otherwise), cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, and sci-fi\u2026 and pretty much any amalgamation of 2 or more of these things. Sci-fi is not a strong point, but I\u2019m not bad at it\n* I like to have characters with varied backgrounds. This means they\u2019re different genders, different races and ethnicities, that are straight, bi, gay and anything in between, monogamous or polyamorous (though I slant more towards monogamy). I aim to stay away from stereotypes, but sometimes they kind of happen. I won\u2019t rip your head off about it\n* I\u2019m not strict on post length. Good with anything 1 to 2 paragraphs in length for more personal interactions to 4-5 paragraphs for more in-depth situations. I\u2019m not *super* fixated on grammar and spelling, but mostly proper use of those are preferred. I LOVE when accents are shown through writing, so if characters have a certain manner of speaking, then perfect grammar and spelling is not a must. Also, I understand if English isn\u2019t your first language, so no worries there. **Please though\u2026 no txt tlk.** \n\nAs for what I\u2019m looking for in a partner, I want someone I can brainstorm with and that is willing to roleplay long-term. Someone that is intermediate or advanced. I totally understand brainfarts happen. Writer\u2019s block and bad days happen. But constant \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses get tiring\u2026 I would like someone that gives a mostly equal contribution to story/scene and character development. Oh! If you\u2019re having a busy or less than stellar day/week and are unable to/not in the mood to RP? Feel free to talk to me. I want to be your friend too. Communication is highly valued. If you want to deviate from one roleplay and would like to create another one, we can do that. We can always revisit RP\u2019s. Sometimes I\u2019m in the mood for different things. As a final note, I want to mention that I am on Eastern Standard Time. If you\u2019re in a different time zone, I\u2019m sure we could try to figure something out. I work the whole week, so I will be busy throughout the day. I work an occasional weekend or evenings too. ",

I am robotkinks.\n\nI've been roleplaying for ten years now but took a looooooooooong break and now I want to get back into it! \nI'm looking for new partner/s that I can roleplay with! I have experience in group RP but I think I prefer 1x1 better? I'm +18 so unfortunately I prefer my partner/s to be so as well, just encase. I'm someone who likes to gush OOC about their characters or their partner/s characters and all their interactions, so I apologize before hand for that.\n\nI'm fine with roleplaying over a majority of avenues, though some I haven't even used before so please be gentle.\n\nI'm open to most genres with more of a liking towards slice of life, fantasy, mythological, drama, romance, adventure. I love world building so ultimately I would prefer an original universe/original characters to be used but that doesn't mean I will say no to a canon roleplay either. \n\nI think at the moment my perfect roleplay (or what I'm PRAYING for) is a slice of life filled with fantasy/mythological themes, who says the slice of life can't be filled with elves, orcs, demons/oni, other fantasy or mythological creatures? Make it exciting ya'll.\n\nI would prefer someone/s who is/are comfortable with +18 content and who would be a partner, not just someone who gets told what to do or tells me what to do, I want it to be a partnership, equal effort on all parts.\n\nI live in Australia so my timezone is GMT+8 so I understand if that's a bit hard for some people, I like to do long replies (+paragraph) but I'm fine with people who do short replies as well, as long as the effort is evident in it.\n\nPlease feel free to PM me or comment! &lt;3",

It's an older idea of mine but I haven't done it for a bit and I'm looking to bring it back.\n\nYou are the heir and only son of a northern, winter kingdom. You're known for being heartless and cold, just like the harsh landscape. A warrior at heart, you were the leader of most of the guards in the city. I'm a princess from a southern, and much smaller kingdom. I'm known for being sweet and gentle. I'm an excellent noblewoman, being skilled in diplomacy, politics, and others customs. Our fathers have engaged us in promise of my father's land, since they're old friends. However, they haven't seen each other since we were born. The other thing, you don't know, but I've known that we were to be engaged for several years.\n\nThere is the possibility to add some smut if wanted, or gory description, hence the 18+.\n\nI want it to be drawn out and dramatic between the two, as when I've done this several years back it was only after several days. I want the odd details of their days between meetings and such. I'm looking for a gentleman who knows at least the basics of english (I understand fully if your still learning, but no text talk or the like), and can do 2-5 paragraph replies, depending on if it's a description, though it can go down to 1-2 when there is more of a personal interaction. Please message me if you're interested! I hope to hear from some of you!",

I am looking for a long term roleplay partner who is interested in medieval roles, roles involving magic, witchcraft, mystical creatures. Etc. If you have any roles of this sort, please shoot me a message. I will be free almost every day until the 30th. Then I will be free after school. And always free on weekends unless I say otherwise.\nI\u2019m open for any partner with atleast a semi literate writing level. You will be rejected if you use asterisks (*) for actions and use normal text as talking. I don\u2019t expect paragraphs but maybe almost a 8th grade paragraph size each response. It gets boring when you send one liners. Thank you for reading all of this. Feel free to shoot me a message. ",

Yet, it was a world known for its\u2019 luxury spires - wide, open spaces, large courtyards and the oddest of all, it natural ocean areas. It was this world that a young woman by the name of Renee called home. She was not one of the nobles, but she had been lucky enough to not be born in deep slums of the world. No, her skills had earned her a bit of easy life. Not the best, but not the worse. She did not have to spend her days working in the manufactorums, instead her time was spent in the grand courtyards. Painting.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She had other skills as well, a known writer though her words had never made it into anything of note. She could play music, which earned her a few extra credits here and there. But what paid her bills was her art. Often painting the massive spires, or vast oceans of the world. Painting that hung in office buildings and the homes of the wealthy.Renee had never had to work in the same place twice after her work was done, traveling from place to place as she wished. Skills that she had learned because of her love books, and the story of the Remembercers of old. Even if people questioned her line of work. Not that she gave it a second thought, she was free. Or as free as one could be in the twisting maze that was this world.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Life was good, or at least it was until the skys went dark with the shadows of the massive chapter ships of the legendary Astartes. Something that left the people in both awe and shock, what heresy had laid upon their world that would draw the eyes of the Emperor\u2019s angels. A mix of fear and honor rushed though the masses. Renee among them. Being able to see one. Maybe capture one in her work. Little did she know, her dream would turn into her worst nightmare.\n\nThis is one of my Remembrancer ideas. Enjoy.\n\n&gt;**Warhammer 30k Prompt: Let me paint you. (Legion and Names are just placeholders. Feel free to approach me with any legion or character you want to play!)**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Her name was Jolene, the youngest child of one of the minor noble houses of Terra and thus making her no one of real note as far as anyone was really concerned. That was until she was found to be of steady hand and artistic mind, able to give life to the world around in her both paints and charcoal. It was why her family funded her, helping her along until she was finally given the honor that was bestowed on all those that called themselves a member of the Imperial Rememberancer Order...to accompany the Fleets of the Great Crusade.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It took her almost a year of her twenty seven years alive to finally reached the 28th Expeditionary Fleet, the fleet who was called home by the Astartes Legion, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Children.\u201d Her muse screamed, her fingers inched to get to work. She had sketch what felt like hundreds of simple charcoal works capturing her journey, the people that worked aboard the ship, the ship itself. Now she would be able to prove her skill. She couldn\u2019t wait. Yet, her first few months among those that called the fleet home, she had gotten little to no real work done. Though she had made a friend with a young Imagist, who\u2019s work as of late had proved very lackluster. He had gotten good photos, just of poor quality.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Jolene, however, had taken interest in the still images. Often taking them and drawing them out. Breathing life into the images with paints and other mediums. Giving the once blurry images depth and meaning while in turn the young Imagist gave her images to work with that Jolene would not have been able to draw on her own. The Marines moved to fast in their day to day life that it would have been almost impossible to sit there and just draw them unless they wanted to be immortalized on canvas.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was those drawings, small paints that started to make circulationand in time caught the eye of one of her targets. A Captain of the Emperor\u2019s Children named Tharsis, then again she would have take time with any of the Astartes if they were willing to give it to her. Like many of the Marine\u2019s who had stories to tell, word had gotten around about the Captain. Said to be a lovey man, proud and arrogant. Then that could have been said about many of the Marine in the Third Legion. Men who seemed to strive for such perfection, noble men. Firm in purpose, loyal to the core. For a moment it made her work pale, how was she going to capture such a being?",

            "selftext": "I'd like to be able to tell you I'm kneeling here blindfolded, hands cuffed behind my back, awaiting my execution because I've been caught in some act of ingenuity so dastardly the mere mention of my name sends waves of fear throughout the Central Government. It's nothing so grand. I am but one of thousands scheduled to die today, unknown, unnamed, unimportant to everyone but you. You. Beside me. Quiet. Prepared. Braver than I've ever been. \n\nWhen our final moment does come and we're here one second and in the next simply bodies on the ground, nothing more than an assortment of atoms clinging together until decomposition sets in, I hope you know I'll never regret the *how* of how we die. Not because I want to die this way, or because I'm anxious for death. No, it's because I get to have my last moment with you, and that's the best possible way to end things. We've had our adventures. Not nearly a lifetime of them, but enough that this blindfold, and these handcuffs, and the ache in my knees from the hard ground beneath, they're inconsequential compared to the eight months and six days we've spent together. We're just here waiting to be off on our next escapade. \n\nI'm stuck in my thoughts, a stupid grin etched on my frozen face, when the sound of you gulping then inhaling the way you do when you're trying not to cry draws my attention. \"I don't want it to happen like this.\" Your voice is soft, or at least that's how it sounds. The clamor of a thousand men and women awaiting their death is about as loud as one might expect, and your words were likely spoken equally as loud. But they're a sweet whisper in my ear. And when you speak them the world around us dims to a hum and your voice is singular and clear, as though we were in a quite room together. When I feel you press against me to rest your chin on my shoulder, I\u2019m filled with a warmth from deep within. That one gesture pulls memories from a place deeper than ever before, a kaleidoscope of imagery cascading across my field of vision, and the sadness I kept at bay with a grin starts to form at the corners of my eyes. I blink to push it away. To make room for words of comfort. But my mouth is dry and my jaw aches from the grin and the words are momentarily lost to reverie. \n\nWe've been kneeling in this cold for so long my neck aches when I turn to look at you. \"Hey.\" It's the first thing I've said since they brought us here. \"Remember. This is just Phase Two.\" I attempt a chuckle as I speak, but all that emerges from my lips is a puff of air. \"The Non-Existencing,\" you whisper back. In some drunken moment we'd named our death \"Phase Two: The Non-Existencing,\" and we laughed harder at our corny joke than we likely had any right to. It's not as funny now. Your lips brush against mine, and your hot breath becomes a startling reminder of just how alive we are. It snaps me from within myself, and the cold and noise and the weight of *now* blindsides me with unexpected force. \"Are you ok?\" Hearing you quells the fear, and I nod before remembering you're blindfolded to. \"Yeah.\" *Not really.* I don't want to think about *now* any longer. *Now* threatens to upend whatever calm I've gathered, so I search for a memory to take us away from now.\n\n\"Do you remember the first time we met?\" I ask this anticipating that you'll say yes, when I know you really don't. \"It's when I fell in love with you.\" I can visualise the look on your face right now as you replay the memory of eight months and six days past. But we met earlier than that, not by much, but earlier still. Before you can reply I start to recount the moment I knew I loved you. \n\n****\nHello! \n\nI actually started writing more than what I have above, but I went back and realised that it was better to stop where I did. My original thought was two women facing their deaths just weeks before the entirety of humanity sees its death at the hands of an asteroid or a fleet of angry aliens. Something that's unescapable. A weird premise, maybe, but I like it. It's the idea of some vengeful government run by scared people exerting their last bit of control over the population because it's the last bit of control they have: the universe hates us, and it's about to wipe us out, so let's persecute then wipe out everyone we don't like. This is all a bit heavy, but that doesn't mean our roleplay has to be (all the time. Some of the time, yes.)\n\nSo here's where we are. Our two heroines come together a mere eight months and six days prior, though they met even earlier, briefly, but your character doesn't remember the incident because it's inconsequential to her. What we're going to write are the eight months and six days. It can be fun: they go out and mark a bunch of shit off their bucket lists. Or it they can work in service of some greater good. Or it can be a mix. The point is for them to go from acquaintances pushed together for whatever reason to two women in love. The end of our roleplay will circle back around to the scene I wrote about above.\n\n\nSome other info: despite how I wrote the above I prefer third person, past tense. I also prefer either PMs or Discord or email, and I\u2019m hoping for one to three longer multiple paragraph length replies. \n\n18+ because this will become a romance with adult situations. \n\n\nI hope one of you finds merit in my idea and sends me a message!\n\n",

Whether they want to or not.\n\nThey aren't a big fan of eachother, many a times they would find themselves watching the same mortal who is just on the cusp of death and life. When one notices, the other tends to as well, and a multitude of things may occur. Disdain due to their drastically different areas of expertise will send them storming off, or worse, a verbal sparring match. Some days it's enough to just give a frown before they continue to watch the same mortal. On rare occasions they may fling \"friendly\" banter, though it most always ends in one storming off.\n\nToday is different. An extravagant festival is going to occur, to celebrate the process of Life and Death, two of the most recognizable deities. This is due to a long term cultural revolution sparked by many wars over which deity should reign supreme, now it seems that it doesn't matter. \n\nMany of the mortals look torwards the skies in hopes that Life and Death are watching, watching as they throw one of the biggest festivals in history themed around the cycle that involves Life and Death. Little do they know that their deities are right there next to them, taking a rare step into the Realm of Mortals to partake in festivities centered around *them.* \n\nYou wouldn't know it as they are impossible to discern from a regular mortal in appearance, personality and behavior is a different story. And unknown to *everyone* (except probably Love herself) Life and Death will meet. Sparks will fly, and for once, harmony in the cycle can be achieved...Or maybe they'll kill eachother upon finding out who they really are. Who knows?\n\nWhy don't we find out?",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, \n\nFirstly thank you for taking the time to check out my post . I have been role playing for roughly fifteen years so I like to think I have some \" skill ' when it comes to descriptive play :P. I para as a minimal and mainly multi-para , I like descriptive and imaginative posts. So please don't message me if you intend on one lining and not adding any kind of plot to this role play... I find it very tedious when only one person contributes to the story, it's so much more enjoyable when both parties bring in some plot , Role play is all about imagination after all right?. \n\nI would also like to add that  spelling and grammar isn't something I worry myself over, grammar isn't a strong point of mine so I can let that slide :). \n\nI have indulged as many of you would probably guess in every aspect of eras and styles from fantasy/ action to adventure/sci-fi to slice of life. Nothing is of limits with me as long as it's enjoyable/fun and interesting :). I do tend to stick to mainly modern eras as i feel more comfortable with it. Character development and long term is preferred I like to build a good story :). Romance is something that tends to be included in all my role plays and honestly? I Like it that way. Romance I find adds a real good element to any role play.\n\nRight now I'm kind of hankering for a slice of life role play, with plenty of drama to keep things interesting :). \n\nPlease message me if your interested in starting something up with me, we can discuss and brain storm an idea together :). Look forward to hearing from you soon ",

I'm looking for simple fun, with romance, and drama here and there. **OCs ONLY**.  \n Looking for someone in a US time zone. It can be difficult to RP with people in other countries, given my own schedule for school/sleep.  \n\n\nI only do 3rd person, and while I'm all about quality over quantity, I'd prefer things not be one liners. I like things to be a few lines, to a few paragraphs, depending on the situation. I would like someone with at least a decent amount of experience, and to have a good gasp on english and grammar.  \n\n\n18+ is an absolute must, and 21+ would be even better, but not a must. I'm nearly 24 myself, so there will be adult themes, and I'd much prefer, overall, to rp with someone in my age group.\n\nI am female, but have always been more drawn to male characters, and have never enjoyed playing female characters. I'm looking for someone to play a female character, who is, preferably, female themselves, but that isn't a must. I'm easy going, and open to a lot of ideas and themes.  \n\n\nI'm flexible with settings and world building. We can discuss characters and ideas in message and/or discord.    \n\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to private message me here, where we can talk further, and if we feel it's a good match, we can exchange discord IDs",

I don\u2019t require for my partner to compete with me in length of posts, but I do need enough to go on story wise.

            "selftext": " The year is 3021 of the common era, long are gone the days of men riding horses with steel in hand, and the once mighty stone castles have now fallen and are remembered as nothing but ruins. The today is different from those ancient times, it brings no frontiers; civilizations thrive across the universe with nothing to stop them but their own ambitions, but despite all that the world might not be as different as you would expect it to be, dukes and lords still hold power, but this time over entire planets, and kings exert their control over solar systems, with orders of knights ready to defend sectors of the galaxy from their space fortresses, and weapon technology has evolved so much that sometimes soldiers need to get close and personal to breach the armor of their enemies. The world has definitely changed since those times, and the universe with it, but the nature of its inhabitants hasn\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoooo I hope the idea here is clear, basically it\u2019s just medieval fantasy with a setting in space, like crushing it together with science fiction to see what ungodly creation comes out. Hopefully this will bring your interest. If you want we can even unweave this world a bit more before jumping in, or not. \n\nAs far as what we could be I had a couple of half developed ideas in mind. Maybe we could be mercenaries hired as scouts for one of the never ending wars against the confederations of orcs (obviously avoiding a good versus bad story.)  or maybe we are hired as an escort (not the sexy kind) for a private interest, we could also be merchants protecting our own, or simply pirates taking advantage of said merchants and their trade companies. Honestly I\u2019m fine with any idea as long as it allows us to be on a spaceship so we can bring the story to different planets and what not, just remember the golden rule of medieval fantasy in space. \n\nRegarding to characters races I usually just pick a boring human, but you can get as crazy as you want. You can stay traditional and become an elf, orc, fairy or whatever, or invent your own. Everything is cool on my book, and I mean everything so don\u2019t be afraid of straying.  \nAnyhow, if I haven\u2019t lost you yet and you are still interested let me know by sending me a message, if not\u2026 well it\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t blame you, we cool. \n\nPS. I honestly had no idea where to shove this idea in on the post, but just picture this\u2026 space dragons. ",

            "selftext": "\\*The name of the Black Company is one that is rightly feared. They are a mercenary company without equal, commanding a high price for their skills as cavaliers with black powder and cold steel, but when hired, one can be assured that they have yet to be beaten or driven from the field, and any village, town, or castle they lay to siege will never rise again. In their wake, they leave only depredation and slaughter, salted lands and ruins. The reports of their deeds are as vile as they are effective in inspiring fear in their enemies and they seem to revel in that and in the revulsion nobles have for them.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Roddrick is a young man who appeared in the court of a noble (or royal) family, offering his services as a hunter and falconer. He is quite good with pistol and long rifle, with bow and sword. Roddrick is hiding much though, and hopes it does not catch up to him. He left behind a life as dark as the current one is bright. He was a favored Lieutenant in the Black Company, a Black Rider known as Fear as the riders are known for taking dramatic names. However, he is trying to leave the past behind, afraid that his quick reflexes or his martial ability will draw suspicious curiosity, or that his nightmares will come true and that Black Company spies will find him. His like is good now, these people are kind, but the Black Company is on the move, war looms on the horizon, and if they knew how much blood stained his hands...\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like for someone to play a GM role and help in shaping a late medieval fantasy world where my character is a young man longing to escape from his dark past. He is serving a noble or royal family as a skilled hunter, but there may be hints linking to his darker past, something he wants to keep a secret for fear of persecution. Anything beyond past events are up for discussion or debate. I'm up for anything you want to discuss, the more detailed the better. A love interest is more than welcome and the more emotionally jarring you want to get, the better. I roleplay over Reddit PMs.",

The Alpha and Heir are taken but anyone can be anything they want. We post between 1-4 paragraphs. We are friendly and love sending gifs. Come join us! Below is an overview.\n\nHunters have never invaded the valley before. The surrounding mountains had always been too much of an impediment. The two packs had lived in grudgingly close quarters for the best of both. The trade was too necessary. While miles upon miles separated them, it was not enough to keep tempers from rising and trespass to be taken seriously. Things had changed with the new technology that had abounded. Guns with accuracy that could kill a fly on a branch at 100 ft. It was an inevitability there would be an attack.\n\n\nThe hunters never realized the valley held not one but two packs. They had always assumed it was simply large. They targeted the Blood Moon for their splendor. The wolves had always appreciated a certain sense of entitlement and grandeur. It was a night that should have been a celebration like no other. The alphas daughter, his heir, was to be mated. This man was to be chosen this night, but before the announcement was made the firefight began. No one seen them coming. Hunters in black with weapons none had seen before. It was a slaughter. Hunter and wolf blood mingled on the dance floor. The grand gowns were striped with red. The hunters were defeated, but not without great loss. The alpha had been slaughtered. That had been their main objective. Everyone knew a pack with no head was destined for failure.\n\n\nIn the following weeks what aid could be rendered was offered, but tensions ran high. Finally a bargain was struck. The only way the two packs could hope to fight off this new breed of hunters was to join. There was an Alpha who had yet to pick a mate and an heir who was yet to be promised. While the business of it was obvious, feelings were not. Kik me @ WifiAndUnwind\n\n",

I've always had a penchant and love for writing and I find that writing with a partner is quite cathartic. I love the back and forth volley of ideas that we can come up with, challenging each other and bringing out the best in each other. I find that roleplaying works best, in this sense, when it's built more on a friendship of sorts than just two partners sending messages each day about the roleplay. \n\nRegardless of how you may feel in that regard, I am looking for a good partner: someone who has good grammar, spelling, and is willing to put in the time and effort to creating a fleshed-out and vibrant world. I am impartial when it comes to Established Universes or Original ones. The same goes for Canon or oc characters, though OCs provide us as writer's with much more freedom. \n\nThe genres of stories I like:\nSuperhero\nForbidden Romances\nMedieval/Fantasy\nSciFi\nSlice of Life with Fantasy or Supernatural Elements\n\nI do have ideas for certain pairings for EUs like The Legend of Zelda and such, but it's ultimately up to what the both of us decide we want to do! I am always okay with NSFW content, but it will not be the primary storytelling mechanism for this story. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\n",

Shinobi Sagas takes place during the time of the Pain arc within the Naruto series, instead of following canon however we have our own story that will be told through events, custom baiju known as Spirit Beasts, and villages lead by custom NPC Kage. After awhile these Kage can eventually be replaced by dedicated and talented players! That being said, RP plot is player based and driven by the individuals, this is the beginning of your life as a shinobi... Make it count.\n\nShinobi Sagas is a RolePlay server with friendly staff, welcoming players, and the ability to make custom clans and Justus. We are strong believers in detailed Roleplay, as we want people to enjoy reading our stories. That said, Shinobi Saga offers an \u201cAcademy\u201d that is for Roleplayers who aren't quite up to par, but want to grow; we welcome all decent people who want to Roleplay and associate. If you enjoy Naruto, you will love our server!\n\nWelcome to a new world of Naruto!",

I don't like to have too many rules, but detail (at least one paragraph per post) and a reasonable amount of planning are both important. I have plenty basic outlines of ideas we could develop more together, so here are some of them:\n\n 1. Character A is being haunted by character B, who's either a ghost or demon of some kind.\n\n 2. Character A is in a terrible accident and is knocked unconscious. They then awake to find themself in a mysterious place, soon discovering they're in a different plain of existence entirely.\n\n 3. A medieval-fantasy setting where things are more open-ended, think along the lines of DA or even a D&amp;D campaign if you're into that type of thing.\n\n 4. Character A is mentally ill, afflicted with either depression, anxiety, maybe even schizophrenia. The only way they can calm themself down is by talking to an imaginary friend, who one day actually appears. The imaginary friend would be character B.\n\nYour own ideas are welcome too.\n\nI usually like to play the supernatural force in these types of ideas (the ghost/demon/whatever), but you're more than welcome to give that position whirl too.

            "selftext": "I am an avid fan and player of Final Fantasy XIV; I adore the rich storyline, the characters, the dungeons and the boss fights (Tsukuyomi EX, anyone? More like this, SE, please). It's a brilliant, immersive game and hands-down my favourite of all the MMOs I've ever played.\n\nSadly, the number of FFXIV roleplayers seems to be extremely low, as do the fans of this particular pairing (though I don't know how, the canon hints are pretty blatant and we've got word of god that it might just end up happening). I know this is a long shot and I'm probably doomed to be stuck alone in rarepair hell, but I got lucky and struck gold once in a similar situation, so it can't hurt to make an attempt\n\nI've fallen in love with two characters in particular from the Stormblood expansion, and as I said above, there are some pretty heavy hints at the possiblity of them actually getting together in canon...eventually. Until then, I can only get my fix through art and fic, and...well, there's not a lot of that to go around. Like I said, rarepair hell.\n\nIf you're familiar with the game, you've probably figured out by now from the thread title alone that I'm talking about Magnai and Sadu, the hopeless romantic (and tremendously awful at the pursuit of the love he seeks) khagan and the proud and cocky khatun of the undying ones. The you-know-what-kind-of-tension between these two is unreal, you just know there's something going on between them behind the scenes. I refuse to be convinced otherwise.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is, at its most basic, a long-term story woven by myself and one other that follows these two, their lives on the Azim Steppe, and the relationship they develop, slowly moving from outright hating each other's guts to realizing that the Nhaama Magnai has so long sought has been right in front of him all along, and anything in between and after.\n\nI don't ask that you be completely caught up on storyline, since we haven't seen much of either Magnai or Sadu in the last couple of patches, but please at least have finished the Azim Steppe part of the Stormblood MSQ and have a good feel for the characters and the area and culture so you can play your part to the best of your ability. The gender of my partner isn't important to me, I'll write with men, ladies, and those who identify as anything else. However, I do ask that you be at least twenty-one, as I'm twenty-seven and writing 18+ material with anyone younger than twenty-one kind of skeeves me out. And yes, there will be 18+ content, I do not fade to black, so if you're not comfortable with that, we will not be a good match.\n\nLiterate to advanced only, please. I'm not going to get on your case about a typo here and there, it happens to absolutely everyone and anybody who says they never slip and hit a key they don't mean to is a filthy liar. But butchering of the English language is my kryptonite and if you're constantly using contractions where they should be possessives and misspelling every other word, you just might end up giving me a stroke. One-liners are another one of my bigtime hates, but if you're Lit/Adv you won't be doing that anyway, so that part should probably go without saying I suppose. I'd also like someone who will post multiple times a week, though this isn't a requirement, it would just be nice.\n\nI'll roleplay through Google Docs, but if you happen to have an account over at Blue Moon Roleplaying (warning, it's not a SFW forum. At all.) or are willing to register there, I'd prefer roleplaying through DMs over there. I'm not really used to Google Docs and have only used it for this purpose once, and while it's manageable and I can do it, I can't say I'm very fond of it.\n\nI like, whenever possible, to actually become friends with my partners, so while a form of offsite contact - I primarily use Discord - is not mandatory, it is preferable, not just for OOC talk regarding plot and event planning but for just talking as the people behind the characters. I'd like us to get to know each other a bit; when I roleplay, half the fun for me is swapping headcanons and ideas, tossing music at each other that we feel suits the characters or situations (or just music that we like and think the other would appreciate!) and just general chat/screwing around. Like I said, let's be friends!\n\nAs we all know, not much sucks more than finding someone you think you click with, and then they just up and disappear on you. Please, [i]please[/i] don't do this! If you feel like we're not a good matchup after we've talked a bit, that's completely okay. If it's not something we can work through by talking it out, then them's the breaks and we'll go our separate ways with no hard feelings. I'm a reasonable person and will not bite your head off just for telling me you don't think we mesh well, so please don't just ghost me if it's not working out.\n\nThat being said, I [i]do[/i] only want someone who's in this for the long haul, so if you don't feel that's something you can commit to if we do hit it off - again, if we don't, even if the reason doesn't make sense to me, that's cool, I'm not going to be mad and I'll send you off wishing you well - please move on. I'm looking for long-term, not a couple of days and then you vanish into the aether. ^Haha ^XIV ^joke.\n\nStill with me after all of that? Even if you're not interested, player commendation for you!\n\nAs the most radiant one searches for his moon, so too, do I seek my sun. Come find me, my Azim; with bated breath, your Nhaama awaits you.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm looking for a partner to do a nice casual fantasy RP with, unfortunately for me most of my kik groups have died, and the sheer number of people and things in discord groups gives me terrible anxiety, which is why I'm narrowing it all down to 1X1. I would be willing to do a small group RP if there are people interested\n\nI'm a 19 y/o male, straight, who loves doing stuff to make others laugh. I don't normally go for anything too big and complex for a RP, but I do have one idea in mind ATM. I enjoy RPing with people of most any type of style, I don't discriminate between styles because it's somewhat like reading a book for me. For a plot, I am currently writing a book series based on my own little universe, yes, it's original, but no, it's not as fully fleshed out as I wish it could be, I even have the main characters in sheegt form. The plot of the book I'm talking about is as follows: After the Tamer woke up from his dream of fighting Chaos he didn't speak of it to his family, it was only s dream, and magic wasn't real, right? until later that day, when the Tamer goes to take out the trash he hears something in the distance, bells as it seems. A massive portal then rips itself open in the sky, with millions of succubi pouring out, these succubi are different however, at first they went about feasting on the people of earth, but soon a strange corruption became apparent with them, and their bodies became malformed and distorted, causeing them to only desire the death of whatever wasn't one of them. The Tamer, along with his other creations go about fighting them back with a large group of survivors, trying to find the source of the corruption. There is the option of being a normal Human, or one of the Tamer's creations in this plot line.\n\nIf your down here and still have interest, go on ahead and contact me how you please, I have no limit as to how many people can try to fill inthis position, and eagerly await to see the potential new friends! \n\n:3",

            "selftext": "I am looking for a long-term slice-of-life romantic penpal. While I have several different ideas on my reddit profile I had an idea (see below) that I hope someone could get on board with. I tend to write several paragraphs in 3rd person, and I also enjoy chatting with who ever I am roleplaying with while we write. Typically that means writing via email and chatting via Google Hangout. I could be convinced otherwise (read: maybe Discord if you twisted my arm enough), but thats at least the way I've always done it. If the beginning of my writing/prompt sounds like something up your ally I hope you'd consider messaging me!\n\n\\--- --- ---\n\nPressing the red button on his phone Eric hang up the call. What was he to do now? His brother had bailed on him for their cross country train trip. It wasn't even a good excuse. He had started talking to a new girl and they were supposed to have their first date in 2 days. She couldn't meet any earlier, and his brother was afraid that if he waited the week until he got back that the girl would be long gone. Eric had rolled his eyes at that. He was now left paying for an empty train seat from San Antonio to Chicago. While on the plus side that meant that maybe no one sat next to him, he didn't really want to go the trip alone. On the bright side his brother was having to eat his $300 plane ticket to get from Washington to Texas. Pondering what to do in the 24 hours before the train left Eric's gears turned. Remembering a movie he once saw he opened his laptop and began typing feverishly into reddit:\n\n\u200b\n\n*Subject: Female Travel Companion Wanted - Leaves in 24 hours!*\n\n*Text: This may sound crazy, but the internet is the place to be crazy right? I love trains and had recently planned about a week long trip on Amtrak with my brother. Well he bailed on me so I am left with an empty seat next to me. The train leaves in 24 hours from San Antonio and I would love someone to go with me. I know what you are thinking - a week on a train with a stranger. I know that is a crazy idea, but I'm just throwing it out there. Consider it an adventure.*\n\n*I'm up for just about anyone to come along for the ride at the moment. I do prefer females though, sorry dudes (but I'm sure you understand!). As for where you live. Well, obviously since we are leaving from San Antonio somewhere in Texas might be best, BUT if you are crazy like me and want to fly in for this adventure as long as we can be at the train station at 7am tomorrow I'll gladly pick you up at SAT (the airport). I'll cover your train ticket, I'd just ask that you cover the rest - your food, souvenirs etc.*\n\n*For those who have never been on a train we get to share a pair of really big nice reclining seats in a coach car. They have foot rests, plenty of storage, and plenty of room. This is no airline seat. You can spread out. Yes there are power outlets, yes to a bathroom, and there are a pair of dining options on the train. So I guess this isn't just an adventure with a stranger, but maybe cuddling up with one too. The trip to Chicago will take about 2 days, and then I don't really have a plan from there. I've never been to Chicago, so I want to explore some. Whether you fly home, train home, or hang out is up to you. I honestly dont' have a return ticket purchased at the moment, but plan to train back after a few days in Chicago.*\n\n*So there is my pitch. If that intrigues you at all, if you want a new adventure, or if you have any questions just message me. Believe me I love trains enough to go it alone, but watching the country go by from a train window is magical. It isn't like a plane trying to get somewhere fast, and doesn't have the pressure of a car ride. You sit back, relax, and just left life go for a bit. Hope to hear from someone. I hate to admit it, but I'll be watching the little envelope here on reddit like a hawk. Hopefully your message will turn it red and we can chat about logistics!*\n\n\u200b\n\nAfter posting on several subreddits Eric leaned back in his chair, put his hands on the top of his head and sighed. Well he had certainly given it the old college try. He really doubted that anyone would reply to such a crazy, no insane, idea as to go on a trip with a stranger. Especially an open ended one like that. He just knew he needed to get away from life, from stress, and from the reason that he phone was currently on silent. He just needed Eric time, and if Eric time involved a cute nerdy girl who either had a sense of adventure or passion for trains, at this moment he didn't care about the rest. He would love the experience.",

Usually in these posts I will lay out the kind of plot I want but I decided nope, let\u2019s try something new. \n\nSo, throw me your ideas! Whether it be fantasy, slice of life, fandom, etc. it doesn\u2019t matter! Message me what you\u2019re thinking about and maybe we can build on it. \n\nA few things I ask: please do have some sort of plot idea. Doesn\u2019t have to be laid out in perfect detail but just a direction you want the roleplay to head. If you want a romance aspect (not a requirement) I do prefer it be MxF (no offense to any one, just what I\u2019m into.)\n\nI primarily use Discord. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for years and I believe I\u2019m pretty literate. I prefer quality over quantity, so it doesn\u2019t have to be 15 paragraphs every post. \n\nMessage me if interested! ",

            "selftext": "Welcome to Ararat, a fantasy setting where the discovery of an ancient civilization's technology spurred on a golden age, though not one without consequence. Warriors, mages and mercenaries of all races, backgrounds and skills set out from city of Lumance to fight everything from bandits, to vampires, to ancient war-machines created for some unknown purpose, to take part in wars, and to deal with threats to the world's precarious peace or even the continued existence of the races of Ararat.\n\nHowever, just because some fight for those reasons, does not mean everybody does. Systematic corruption is rampant within the nations of the world, and peace is only a mask to hide what goes on behind the scenes between the powers of the world, between their spies and diplomats and assassins. Those in the know always have to wonder whether the next threat to their lives is going to come from within or from without. \n\n\n---\n\n\nThe Silver Road is a Discord-based roleplay server set in Ararat, a predominantly fantasy world, with some minor elements of other genres. Some parts of the setting will be familiar to those who have experience with other fantasy settings, but others are entirely unique! We have a custom, d20-based combat system, with plenty of options to allow you to build the character you want. Whether you want to be a classic Elven Mage, a Magnesse Paladin, a Saracen swordmaster, a walking magical disaster as an Asheor, an undisputed master of the magical or martial arts as a Pale One, or something completely different.  \nOf course, you don't have to be a combat-focused character! A merchant lord, a blacksmith, a playwright and more are all options, and those options are only limited by what you want to play. You can even have multiple characters without an issue. \n\nFor the most part, we're set in Lumance, the capital of the Magnesse empire, though every so often we have quests and storylines that take us to other areas, such as the snow-covered Munso Valley. There's plenty of lore to get into on the site, covering cultures, races, and even the origins of some of the less mundane creatures of Ararat.\n\nRight now, the group is small, but we have plenty of creativity and are looking to build a group who really enjoy roleplaying in the world we've created. We just finished a fairly major update to the combat system and moved to a new site, so this is the perfect time to join in. \n\nOur site is [here](https://thesilverroad.jcink.net/index.php), for you to get stuck into and read over. When you've read over stuff, decided you need help, or want to meet the userbase and join in, our Discord is [here](https://discord.gg/CqfH4dy). Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you in The Silver Road.",

            "selftext": "\nHello there, and welcome to my post. I'm glad that the title alone was able to catch your attention. Well, as you could see from the title, I am looking for something detailed, long term, and written in the third person point of view. It's happened more often then I would like where someone has still tried roleplaying in first person, but please understand, I will correct you. If you still continue, we can not continue. I have requested third person from the beginning, I won't be changing my mind on the matter. Please know what you are getting yourself into. Haha. This includes being detailed! Some people still think I mean just a handful of sentences, but I don't. I mean a few paragraphs worth. Or, if you prefer, one giant paragraph/wall of text. I can do either you prefer, but it has to be detailed. No exceptions unless it's just dialogue. Even then, I'm not going to accept three sentences or the like. There is always more you can write about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, now that we have that out of the way, I really want something that involves romance. I don't have any ideas in mind, but we can always come up with something together. At the moment, I'm really looking for a gay roleplay, but if you come with an idea I like, I would be willing to do a straight one. I'm just running out of inspiration for it because most people want to do straight roleplays when I say that I do both. Anyway, I just about always stick to a realistic setting, normally modern but I can also do medieval. I don't like anything historic based, sci-fi, steam punk, apocalyptic... None of it. If you really want something with fantasy, please don't make it excessive, or I can tell you now, it's not going to be something I'm interested in. I like doing things I can at least relate do. Can't exactly do that with giants, mermaids, and wizards. I personally don't know any, not sure about you. Haha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure that's all I have to say on the matter. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to message me! If you're interested in roleplaying, then I beg you to message me with your Discord tag so I can send you a friend request there, and we can get started right away! Don't worry about writing everything out on Reddit, I would much rather we discuss everything through Discord when I can actually respond to you at a reasonable pace. I hate trying to have a conversation through reddit, because I don't get notifications from it unless I constantly refresh the page, and that's just tedious. So, I beg of you, LEAVE YOUR DISCORD TAG IN YOUR MESSAGE. If you don't, you will not be the first person I respond to. I will prioritize those who actually leave their Discord Tag. I can't promise I'll be able to respond right off the bat to anyone, but you should expect a friend request coming your way within a few hours. I literally have nothing better to do. Haha Have a good day, even if we aren't a good match!",

The main thing for me is to just escape and have a blast while doing it.\n\nLove fantasy settings however real life and current settings are fine as well. If interested please drop a PM. We can just go from there. Thanks.",

If you haven't read it, its a 16th century Chinese story about a traveling monk saving an immortal deity trapped from underneath a mountain named Sun Wukong. He was the inspiration for the Likes of Goku and many other characters with the same name as him. I had a rough idea of what I wanted to start with, but Id love to talk with someone about what the story should be and the characters that get dragged along with the two heros! If you have any good ideas or just wanna ask a few questions, dont be afraid to message me!",

            "selftext": "Hello, thank you for taking the time to read, I hope to present you with enough information that you will be able to make an informative choice to if we would make good partners or not.\n\n\u200b\n\nAt this time, I'm only really looking for modern, clich\u00e9, simple, boring type of pairings. I've done so many roleplays from intense fantasy ones too supernatural ones I love them, I enjoyed them but right now I'm just looking to escape life with simple fast-paced, quick responding romance plots. This wouldn't be the ideal place I'd normally search for these types of roles but I find myself at a little impasse. The normal place I'd go to search for these types of roleplays (As I feel this sub is high-qualitied partners but also seem to love fantasy/fanfictions) the normal place is jammed with drones/zombies/clowns that can barely manage a paragraph. As much as I just want simple plots, I need more detail than a small paragraph.\n\n\u200bI love romance, build up, I feel like I excel at dialogue, I love adding all kinds of different themes and twists to my roleplays. I expect someone to put as much effort into the roleplay as I do, I can't stand laziness.\n\n\u200b\n\nI prefer my roleplays to be of the past-paced, quick firing responses. I'm not too demanding, I simply only hope we can be on at the same time, for a little amount of time to hammer out some amazing replies. The bare minimum an hour a few nights a week but I'm hoping for more. I know this method is more demanding of your time and I understand you won't always be here, nor will I.\n\n\u200b\n\nMy partners need to understand that these roleplays can fade quickly. We might find one situation, pairing that we love and keep at it for a month, or we might go through different ideas/relationships/pairings each time we roleplay. I won't keep roleplaying the same theme or play if its stale. So I need someone mature that can handle the \"We need a new rp!\" Without being ghosted, good communication is so important. The above being said, I am truly easily to please and most likely won't ask to switch!\n\n\u200b\n\nI love diving into different characters, I roleplay to be different characters to live different lives, to experience different themes, relationships, etc that I would never get to experience without roleplaying. I'm not looking for a co-author to a story, I'm looking to mostly experience everything the characters can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the rated R stuff, I love it, but I'm fine with clean!",

            "selftext": "Hello there!! I\u2019m looking for long-term partner for a Vikings themed RP. I\u2019ve recently watched The Last Kingdom, and the Vikings again..and I feel inspire to do a role play prompt based around that genre.   I have done many viking themed prompts before, and I have spent years gathering an understanding of Viking culture and normalities, and I would prefer if my partner could have some basic knowledge on the Viking life as well.\n\nAs for the prompt, I\u2019d like it if we can discuss this together so that we both get a plot that we can enjoy, instead of having someone become bored because it\u2019s not their style. I would like this role play to have a romantic prompt, but obviously not without the angst and hardships.  \n\nI consider myself a rather literate role player with years of experience, which is why I expect my partner to be the same. I write in third person, past tense only. I can\u2019t stand people who write in first person, although that\u2019s my personal taste. \n\nI\u2019m a female looking for a male partner, that has an original character to give to the prompt. I\u2019ve always preferred my partners character to take the \u201cAlpha male\u201d personality, and in this role play we will need it. I feel like everyone enjoys the role play more when the characters are historically accurate, from clothing to personalities, and roles. For example, a Viking male may be more rough, dominate, and distant towards others.\n\nIf you want a Viking themed RP, please message me and we can exchange contact information, and then discuss the plot we want to take and other small details. I\u2019d like to apologise for the lack of information, but I\u2019m not ready to write paragraphs and paragraphs of information like I use to when people don\u2019t even read the information I\u2019m giving them, or they give up role playing.

Over the past year we have grown from a small gathering of writers many who knew each other from AOL into a large and established gathering of minds with a variety of ongoing private plotlines and threads weaving in and out of our combined world.    With an active Storytelling group who run frequent world wide events, there is always something to check out from mass spars to sagas of intrigue and mystery.  \n\n\nWe are always looking for new and exciting writers to come and tell the story of their character with us.  \n\n\nPersonally I'm excited about finding like minded, relaxed muns who might be eager to pick up the quill and write as part of a private family storyline within the world as a DeCross Vampire.    We're the largest vampire family on the server and looking for three to five additional friends to flush out the family tree.    We have story plans over the next 6 to eight months with direction and goals but the individual life of your character would always be your own.   The Infernalists of the DeCross Clan are waiting.  \n\n\nThere are of course other clans, and races.  Shifter Packs, Demon Legions, Angelic Choirs, Dragon Clutches and many nomads of all races who are just going it alone and making their way through an ever changing world beset upon by trials and tribulations.  \n\n\nCheck us out, and send up a flare if you do.  \n\n\n**Contact &amp; Server Details**  \nDiscord Contact:  Mikhal DeCross#7190   \nDiscord Server Link: [https://discord.gg/SCWSQFg](https://discord.gg/SCWSQFg)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I\u2019m 25 and specialize in modern day crime dramas but am trying to branch out into historical/the American West type settings as well as medieval style fantasy role plays but anything I do has darker and more adult themes I don\u2019t like fandom role plays but am open to them in the right circumstance. I\u2019ve been role playing for the better part of 6 years and much prefer 3rd person and literacy. If you would like to chat or bat around ideas you\u2019re more than welcome to send me a dm.

I usually post a few sentences to a couple of paragraphs and I'd like at least the same in return; grammar and spelling are important to me so if you took care in your posts, that would be great too!\n\nI'm mainly online from around 8 AM Eastern onward earlier in the week but later in the week I'm only on for a few hours each day around that time, for reference!\n\nAlso, I'm super friendly OOC as well so it would be awesome if whoever was interested was also chill OOC / chatty / at least okay with someone who is.\n\nAny questions, likes / dislikes, comments, etc. - please send a message my way - thank you! &lt;3",

You do not have to match my post length. Right now I am primarily interested in finding a partner who likes Undertale. I am also open to other fandoms and exploration.  I roleplay as canon characters along with my original characters.  What is highly significant is communication, I want us both to feel comfortable talking out of character.  Also, real life is important I understand that we both have obligations.  I never want you to feel pressured take your time there is no rush.  Whats important is that we both have fun! \n\nPlatforms I Use Tumblr, Discord, Skype, and Kik.\n\nR-18 Content: I am fine with NSFW roleplay as long as my partner is over the age of 18, and so is their character. I also prefer story based roleplays with a mix of that content. \n\nFandoms I like:\n\nUndertale\n\nFairytail \n\nDetroit \n\nJak and Daxter\n\nOnce Upon A Time\n\nLife Is Strange\n\nDragon Age \n\nand much more!",

            "selftext": "Hi there, This is a group dedicated to creating a fun and welcoming environment for all roleplayers. I want this roleplay to offer plenty of opportunities to its players to help create and shape the world around them for the sake of creating a fun and interesting story. Below, you'll find a bit of lore to help situate you so you can get a general feel of how things go down on this server:  \n*\" In a small and quaint town basically forgotten (or at least overshadowed by all the other ones) deep in the heart of Utah, everyone seems to know each other's name and its so safe that some people can even sleep without having to so much as lock their door. However, this town is known for something else amongst its residents, as is the rest of the world at this point that sets it apart from our own: mythological creatures. You see, in this world, creatures big and small truly do exist and finally decided to make themselves known to the humans. However, there is one small catch: they aren't exactly liked by humans. Humans have always been top of the food-chain, they've always been able to adapt and overcome any challenges that they've faced as a species. Now that these \"mythos\" as they often refer to them as have come into their lives, they see them as simply another issue that is meant to be adapted to and overcome.*\n\n*The mythos tried to be nice to the humans, they wanted to basically be like neighbors with them. However, humans were fearful of them. Things soon escalated and now it's a bit cultural split between mythos and humans. The mythos are now essentially treated like second-class citizens if they so much as step foot into a human town or city. Some, are even captured as slaves and forced to serve under the oppressive rule of humanity. Things have even gotten to the point where anti-mythos departments have been establish for the sake of \"protecting the people from the threat of the unknown\" as they so claim.*\n\n*Of course, there are a few unspoken rules that applies to humans. For example, the dense forest that surrounds the forest is to be left alone. Any human that so enters it could potentially face certain death.*\n\n*Now, here we are. Be you mytho or human, you still have a life to live. Whether you try and create peace between the two opposing groups or instead prefer to keep old values intact and destroy all who oppose you is a choice all your own.\"*\n\nIf this is appealing to you in the slightest, please feel free to drop by and say hello! Hope to see you soon! Remember, this RP changes along with whatever decisions the characters of this RP make. I only jump in if things begin to get out of hand. Otherwise, everything is up to you guys.  \nThe link to the server: [https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw](https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw)",

            "selftext": "Hi all! So I\u2019ve had this rp in the back of my mind for a while and decided to see if I could get any bites. First though, here\u2019s some about me:\n\n * 22 Female\n\n * CST\n\n * work part time, school full time\n\n * not easily offended by anything so anything goes in the rp really.\n\nNow! Here\u2019s some about what I\u2019m looking for:\n\n * First is just a completely selfish Shuri x OC pairing. This is the one I want to do most in the whole world. You would play Shuri and it would take place after everything happened with Thanos. My character would come to Wakanda and they would meet and fall in love. Like I said, completely selfish. This one is mostly to hit my fuzzy feelings craving, though drama is more than welcome.\n\n * The other option is my OC with whoever the hell you want to play whether it be OC or one of the characters. My only thing is that it\u2019s after Thanos.\n\nSo yeah! I don\u2019t require much from my partners. Mostly that they be 18+ and realize that if we\u2019re in different time zones it will affect how often I can respond. Hope to hear from you soon!",

We have a 24 page lore guide(recently reorganized into one convenient document), and are planning to add to it. Humans, vampires, werewolves, elves, tech-junkies, and more, all co-exist in a 2170\u2019s Seattle, bathed in neon lights and conspiracy.\n\nThere are multiple factions you can join, or you can join none at all, and be a citizen in the city, human or otherwise.\n\n**We are currently looking to add faction members!**\n\nWe host events to keep everyone involved, regardless of faction affiliation. Users are free to create and play out a narrative unique to their character, that can involve others\u2019 characters, or NPC like characters of your own creation. We\u2019re all about members enjoying themselves and developing their characters in this world, how they see fit, and we love nothing more than to help, and watch these characters develop.  \nWe do have somewhat of an expectation for character types, and if we'd like you to change things about a character, we will let you know. We attempt to keep the overly 'edgy' and over-powered characters out of it, and definitely like variety.\n\nOur staff is friendly, and are open to suggestions to be added to lore, and even event ideas. We run a \u2018democracy\u2019 in this group. So if you have an idea, you are encouraged to share it.\n\nWe are a new, and relatively small community, but are growing, and keep the atmosphere relaxed and welcoming to everyone.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have an age limit, this server has a lot of 18+ content, and we expect members to act in a mature manner in the majority of situations, as a way to limit OOC drama. Any NSFW stuff is so be done in private. But violence, gore, strong language, and drugs are all allowed in the server channels.\n\nJoin us for some roleplay fun. All experience levels welcome!

I'll elaborate by stating that I'm looking for a scenario that happens after the Anime (not the manga, I haven't read it and uh...well it's awfully long, isn't it!). It'll take place in a scenario I've developed involving a cult wishing to return the earth to its primordial state (which is the story in the broadest terms.) It'll have us playing as OC students from the first year onward, and an especially talented and special pair at that! I would be glad to explain a little more if you message me!\n\nI'm looking for literate partners, as previously stated. I type anywhere from 1-2 paragraphs most of the time, and try to keep scenes moving and the RP interesting. I'm simply asking for an understanding of the basics of writing and a general sense of grammar.  I also expect a partner who can post at least once per day!

A couple years later I had started college not knowing you went to the same one and saw you at a frat party.\n\nWe can start there when we see each other for the first time after three years .

So this means I\u2019m not too picky about response length, as long as we can keep things moving. \nFair warning though, I DO like playing multiple characters. If you don\u2019t like that let me know though.\nI\u2019m open to most themes but enjoy darker or fantasy stuff the most. I\u2019m ok with romance as long as it doesn\u2019t get gross.\n\nI\u2019m an anime and games lover and draw a lot of inspiration from that. \n\nJust give me a shout and I can give my discord if interested.

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've used this place before and gotten a few good bites so it's time to give it another shot I suppose.   \n\n\nHey fellow RPers, I go by the internet handle Rotti. I'm a 24 year old lady who is currently attending University full time. I work from home as a dog trainer, frequently engage in the art of keeping a horse between myself and the ground, sometimes draw things, and practice the time honored tradition of rolling dice and trying to hit imaginary monsters (that is to say, I like table top RPGs lol). I have a lot of downtime especially at school this semester, and would like to get a few good roleplays going to fill the void.   \n\n\nI have been roleplaying for a very long time, probably like 12-14 years I'm not entirely sure. I enjoy writing, but I'm definitely the sort of person to only post as much as I feel is required for the given situation. If the characters are having a conversation, I'm not the sort to beef up a post with frivolous information. I play men and women, and when it comes to pairings and romance I can play FxF, MxM, and MxF. I have little in the way of limits aside from the usual or what can be expected out of a decent human being, but we can discuss this more in depth later if you would like. I don't mind things like gore, big bad cusses, smokes and drinkies, or a bit of smut now and again though. I prefer partners that are also as flexible as me in these departments, and **I am only looking for 18+ partners, though preferably 20+.** \n\n  \nI am the sort of partner that can post multiple times per day and prefer partners capable of doing the same. If you can't though, that's fine! Just let me know. Having a roleplay that is a little more \"active\" helps to keep the juices flowing for me, however. I also like to use Discord to chat with my partners over instant messenger. I like to be friends with my partners and do a lot of goof goofs about our ocs and whatever situation they are currently in and all of that. \n\n  \nI don't use playbys and prefer to draw my characters. I don't really do much in the way of fandom RP either, and only play original characters. I can and may be persuaded to do some Fallout though, but again, only with originals. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that all of that is out of the way, here are the sorts of things I'm looking for: \n\n* **Something involving dice?** As I've said before I love to play tabletop RPs and would like to do something to kind of fill in the time between sessions. I'd love to do something in a pretty typical D&amp;D setting, perhaps involving dice or perhaps not if you're not comfortable with that. I really love the Underdark as a setting in particular, and have a couple loose character ideas for something like this.   \n\n* **Industrial revolution, steampunk, thieves, and Elder Gods.** I want to play something with the aesthetic of industrial revolution London but with more of a fantastical twist. I also want to involve criminal gangs, and definitely some Lovecraftian elments. A touch of steampunk would be a lot of fun too, but not required. We can of course chat about this. Wererats are likely to be involved.   \n\n* **Historical stuff, but with a fantasy flair.** I love these kinds of RPs, and they are pretty much my bread and butter. I love the American Civil War, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, the Viking Era (I have a plot and some characters for this in particular if you are interested), Age of Sail, Wild West, and most other things. I can probably be convinced to do other things, and like to give this stuff a bit of a fantasy twist. \n\nOf course, if you have any ideas and it sounds like we might get along, feel free to shoot your ideas my direction! Thanks for reading this far, and if you have any questions feel free to ask in your message. Oh, and please tell me a bit about yourself and what you are interested in too, I likely won't respond to \"hey, RP?\" style pms.   \n",

Finally! Hurriedly, you exclaim and motion the steeds to continue on faster.*\n\n*Upon arriving, the first thing to take your notice isn't the bashful crowd in the town center, nor is it the cold fog seeping in from the forest just outside the walls. No, what you notice first is the building standing front and center at the town gates, with its dark, wet wood and water dripping into the mud covering the roads. Above the door, you read, written in red and gold calligraphy: \"The Soviet Inn.\"*\n\n*Curious, you enter. Immediately you are met with a flurry of voices, all throwing their arguments at one another. As you look more closely at one table, you see a man with glasses and a hat exchanging pictures of shitposts, some relevant, others obscure with a tall, lanky boy. At another table, people poorly dressed as God, Persephone, and Satan fighting over something. And in the back, behind the disorganized arrangement of the room, a man with long hair reading a biology notebook. Hesitantly, you close the entrance behind you, and the moment the crack of the door is sealed, the entire room locks its attention onto you, all activity halting. A man you didn't notice before screams out: \"Leave your weapons by the door!\"*\n\n\\------\n\nSo, that's the introduction. Don't get overwhelmed, it's not usually like this in the server unless we're in a game.\n\nThis server is looking for new members, as the title states! We're pretty chill usually, and if people get heated over something, it's almost guaranteed it's over something small and stupid and irrelevant. We have some rules to keep a semblance of order in here, and it's pretty rare when they're broken.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe're a pretty diverse server, full of people from all sorts of backgrounds, and sexes, and sexualities, and nationalities, and other things. We're very accepting as long as you're a decent human being. Don't worry about not knowing the game well or being an awkward human, we are willing to help with getting to know the game and with socializing with members.\n\n\u200b\n\nOur server is being organized right now, but overall we're pretty separated so that you can personalize what content you want to be notified about.\n\n\u200b\n\nIf this sounds like a good place for you, please join through his link:\n\n[**https://discord.gg/x57CVrV**](https://discord.gg/x57CVrV)\n\n\u200b\n\nWe love new people!

            "selftext": "This is a world where almost anything could happen. Magic, dragons, elves, dwarves, and other mythical creatures exist in the land, although it has been centuries since the last living dragon has been seen. There are three kingdoms that govern different regions.\n\nThe first, and largest, is Drunemia. It is located in the northern part of the land and contains elements of all three of the intelligent races: humans, elves, and dwarves. It is a fairly normal kingdom with its usual graces and troubles. It is ruled by a king who is ruthless towards his enemies and not unkind to his subjects. He is neither loved nor feared by his people but he is highly respected. He does not concern himself with the two other kingdoms present in the land for one is too small for him to care about and the other he has beaten on countless occasions when they have tried to take land from him.\n\nThe second, and most troublesome, kingdom is the Krotus Empire. It is comprised of only humans: those that believed that humans were the superior race and the other two races should be enslaved. They are a militaristic Empire. They frequently attack Drunemia in hopes to gain more land or riches but are thwarted due to having an Emperor who thinks more about power than cunning.\n\nThe third, and smallest, kingdom is Ivairis (Iv-air-ees). It is a modest place that has been never invaded for it doesn\u2019t have much to offer to the Krotus Empire by way of strategic value since it lay in the far south and wouldn\u2019t help in a fight against Drunemia. It is ruled be a beloved King and Queen. They are both kindhearted and warm people but can be stern and coldhearted when the situation warranted it. They have only one child, a daughter, you. But for the last 15 years they have also been raising me, Carth Delwynn. Your father makes frequent trips through the capital of the kingdom, merely walking through the streets as if he were a normal citizen, never mind the contingent of Kingsguard that always accompanies him. On one such fateful walk, he happened upon a skinny boy of 9 years who had been surviving on the streets alone for two years. The boy never spoke of what happened to his parents but the King felt compelled to bring him back to the palace and so he did. That boy was me. And now I have become a renowned swordfighter and your best friend. I now stand at 5'11\" and wear my jet black hair in a short military cut. I have warm brown eyes, tanned skin the color of caramel, and an athletic body that weighs in at about 170lbs. Very few in all of the three kingdoms could match my skill at the sword. Your father believed it was important for you to learn to defend yourself should the worst happen so ever since you were old enough, you had been training right alongside me. Of course, your mother didn\u2019t quite approve of a princess learning how to fight, instead focusing on teaching you the finer points of being a queen. We are near equals in sword fighting now, although I tend to beat you when we spar. You have always been better at me with the bow, however. Neither of us are particularly good at magic but you do seem to grasp a little more of it than I do. I am now the second-in-command of the Kingsguard and commander of your personal group of bodyguards.\n\nOur story begins here...where lately there have been rumors of the Krotus Empire preparing some sort of attack on our kingdom so that they may launch a multi-front offensive upon Drunemia. Your parents and I are doing our best to shelter you from this information so as not to worry you. At this very moment, I am wearing the customary black, leather armor of the Kingsguard with matching black boots that reach my knees. I usually wear a cloak along with it which now has a silver trimming to signify my position but it is currently hanging on a post nearby while I spar on the training field with one of the new recruits.\n-------------------------------------------\nI hope you like what you see and wish to continue! If you do, send me a PM with your name, age, and description for the roleplay and continue from where I left off. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss some elements that you\u2019d like to change, feel free to do so in the PM! Thank you for your time!",

Going to do my best not to make this too long winded and keep it simple.\n\nI'm looking for someone that's 21+ that is up for some 3rd person perspective RP that will be heavily focusing around romance. I don't mind if there are hints of fantasy in it (I.E - Life is Strange) and would like there to also include NSFW and dramatic themes. I usually post anywhere from 1-2 paragraphs, but anything beyond that is a bit much for me. I do my best to be detailed, use correct grammar, and run my posts through spell checks but I'm not perfect and do make mistakes. If you're looking for some insane, super literate writer that can write you novel like posts, that isn't me. I will however do my best to keep my posts interesting and intriguing.\n\nFor a setting, I'm really open to suggestions here, but in the past I've enjoyed supernatural based or just normal based colleges/schools (Characters MUST be 18+ for this, no exceptions), roommates in a new a city, or even co-workers that have or develop a crush. I know none of these are wildly original or imaginative, but that's why I said I'm up for suggestions. I like there to be fun twists and turns in the story, like adding in other characters that can bring on some jealousy, disapproving friends or family, reappearance of ex's, or anything else we can come up with. I really like the idea of my character being straight and either seduced or persuaded into dating women! Would also love if my partner\u2019s character was a little more on the thicker side, though this isn\u2019t required! I'll just be using Discord for this so please don't try and convince me to use another platform.\n\nI think that's about it, if you have any questions or are interested feel free to send me a DM and I'll be sure to get back to you as soon as I can. Oh, and please, no messages regarding group RPs, I'm only interested in 1x1 for the time being, thanks!",

I'm looking for an RP group for a specific concept that has been   nudging at me for a while- the basis of it is that a young, semi-feral   shapeshifter of some variety, my character, is found and taken in by an   adult were, in a universe where the supernatural is known about and   werewolf packs are considered an important part of whatever area they   set up their territory in. The RP would involve a large amount of   somewhat domestic fluff, with the option for some plot if desired,   presumably with the plot focusing around supernatural aspects. I would   be very willing to have this RP involve more than just two people- given   the pack based nature of lycanthropes, I would actually almost prefer   that.\n\nMy character would probably be   anywhere between eight and fourteen, I'm flexible. Because of my   character's age, of course, there would be no romantic subplot involving   her.

Her name was revealed, her face shortly after, and now some crime organizations are setting their sights on taking her out to even the playing field out.",

            "selftext": "This is a pretty simple post: I want to do a Resident Evil roleplay.\n\nBased on games, not the films. Specifically, I'd like to tackle the Raccoon City Incident but with the intention of doing is in a way that flows better. Basically, I want to combine Resident Evil 2 and 3 (and maybe some of other spin-off games) and go from there.\n\nI'd like to blend together a mixture of canon and original characters. I have an OC myself that I'd like to use and I can also play many of the canon characters, and intend to do so as needed. You're not obligated to use an OC yourself, **I** just like to use them. However, if original characters being involved is the only thing that's keeping you from messaging me, I do have an idea for a bit of a compromise that I'd like to discuss in better detail if you message me. However, I hope that OCs don't deter any potential players. I take a lot of care in crafting my original fan characters so that they're not OP Sues.\n\nAlso, for the record, I'm not looking for anything sexual in the roleplay itself. I'm not necessarily opposed, if that's the way we might decide to go, but that's not what I'm interested in just on my own here.\n\nAnyways, as I said, I want to do a blend of games, canon and events. While I want to follow the events to some degree, I don't want to just play out the events exactly as they unfolded. The fun of taking over characters and welding different kinds of canon together means we get to have a bit of fun with how things go! So if you're as big an old school RE fan as I am, feel free to hit me up.\n\nMy stipulations:\n\n* Please be 18 or older. It just keeps a lot of problems from cropping up.\n* I'm looking for skilled roleplayers. I've been doing this a long time and I take quite a bit of pride in my roleplaying, so I'd really prefer if you did too. **What this means exactly:** I'm looking for paragraph-style players. I personally play in third-person, past tense. I'm not expecting a New York's Bestseller with every post, but I do want effort.\n* I typically prefer female partners, mostly because I get along better with females than males. That being said, I won't turn down a male partner if they're not obnoxious and if they're open to playing female characters.\n* Although I'm open to fiddling with canon and the flow of events (that's kind of the point of this whole roleplay idea), I'm not interested in anything *too* outlandish such as gender bends or having friendly, intelligent monsters. Let's try to keep it as real for Resident Evil as we can, please.",

            "selftext": "Hi there\\~! The name is Sam, and I'm looking for a literate partner to write some stuff with! I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nI just finished watching the film Hostiles, and it reignited my love for Western films/games in general. With Red Dead 2 around soon, I feel like now would be a great time for a story like such! First things first; This will not be a down to roots, extremely realistic representation of the Wild West. I want to play as a woman, and a woman in the Union Army to begin with; Those that this bothers, and other things as such, I am not the partner for you. Second, I want to experience a story near the end of her service. I want to write about despair, consequences of a life of violence, etc. I don't have a heavy preference on who you play; Though I would love anyone who is open to playing someone like a doctor, or some other woman who is a bit of a caretaker. \n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well. So, if you're going to play a male character just keep in mind I wouldn't want a romance arc.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

The ideas I have aren\u2019t directly tied to the story but they have to do with Connor becoming deviant and developing feelings.

During this Connor has to step in and save her. When they get back to her apartment she tells him she could handle herself and he shows her that she\u2019s no match for a male android. \n\n2) They are partners and are taking on cases dealing with deviant androids.

            "selftext": "Morning!\n\nI've got a craving as we head into this three day weekend, and I'm hoping to find a partner who is interested and down for the long haul! As I typically like building my world and stories with my partners, this idea is loose and relatively open, so that we may tweak it to our needs. Before I get into all of those details, I'll give you a quick summary about myself! I'm trying my best not to make this post too long and wordy, so here we go!\n\nI'm a twenty three year old female who lives on the east coast of the US. I'd prefer a partner in a similar time zone (EST/GMT -5)! I have three adorable pets who I will show off to you at any request. I work two jobs, though one is from home and its flexible hours allow me to respond when I'd like. I tend to respond at least once a day - more often when I'm at home and inspired! If I plan to be gone for any amount of time, or if things get too busy, I'll let you know. I adore chatting with my writing buddies and enjoy the roleplay so much more when we do chat. That's not to say I plan to pester you all hours of the night. I don't have preference in the gender of my writing partners, but have found lately that I do need to stress that *writing is a hobby for me, and not any type of dating effort.* I prefer to write over Discord above all else, utilizing a private server for our story and the regular chat for our own back and forth. I have very few limitations on content, but will respect whatever things my partner may want to avoid in a story. Please keep in mind the nature of the world we're writing in when considering this story, however! I write multiple paragraphs for replies, and I expect my partner to as well. It certainly doesn't have to be anything crazy, but I do like to move my stories along with *at least* 300 words per post, even in the slow moments. \n\nMoving on to the real meat of this post then - the story\n\nI've been *dying* for a good survival story. What I've felt most inspired to write in that vein is something post-apocalyptic, with a gang of strangers trying to get by in their new world. Admittedly, I'm most interested (and most comfortable) in something zombie-related. It doesn't have to be realistic. Hell, *realistically*, our poor little everyday-citizen-types don't even know how it all started. All they know is that this is their new reality, and they've got to push through!\n\nThe main character I've developed for this type of story so far is a young female lead with rough, limited medical knowledge. I imagine her acting as some sort of make-shift nurse in this world. I'm open to playing her against either gender, and any age above 21. Historically, I favor m/f pairings (with the male lead being older), but I'm open and curious to see how anything plays out! (I should add that more characters are an inevitability in this world! I play characters of all genders/ages/walks of life, but prefer to start stories up with a main pair and then build up around them.)\n\nThere are a million different starting points to a story like this, so I'd prefer that we nail that down as partners. I'm very hopeful that this will be a long term story, and hope to find a partner with equal commitment! This isn't meaning that we have to plan for weeks before we get down to business, or that I expect a novella for your every post. I would just like to see a response with as much effort to it as I've put into this search thread!\n\nSo, if this sounds like it might be up your alley, please do send me a PM! You can expedite the contact process by including your Discord handle if you'd like, so that I can just go ahead and message you over there. \n\nThank you!",

The more creative you are the more likely we will be able to click!\n\nI don't really have any major specific wants or needs so I'm open to discussing and compromising to make a plot we can all enjoy.\n\nI use kik, discord, and sometimes hangouts.

            "selftext": "Hi all! I am Lindsay. I am 25 and have been roleplaying for about ten years now. I am currently craving to do a story that mostly takes place in a woman\u2019s prison and revolves around the relationship of an inmate (my character) and a male C.O (yours). I am solely looking for a mature partner who is above the age of eighteen because the story includes smut, violence, gore, swearing.\n\nI adore length and detail; I write novella style and would like an experienced partner who does the same! Besides, I am only looking for a partner who is willing to continue the story for a longer period of time. (Or at least if you do not want to continue the RP any further, please let me know. Do not simply disappear on me.) I would also like my partner to be male IRL. (otherwise I am not comfortable writing smut, sorry.)\n\nThat is all for now. If you are interested I will give you the plot idea I have in mind. We can discuss the idea here on reddit, but I only role-play through email.\n\nIf it sounds interesting to you, do not hesitate to contact me! I am looking forward to hearing from you.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'll try to make this short and sweet so that things are simple for both of us. I'm seeking a male, or anybody who plays male characters, to write with. Typically I write 2+ paragraphs a response, in 3rd person, and in past-tense form. My experience includes one-on-one writing, group roleplay, and tabletop games like DnD. I also tend to like partners who are the DM of the storyline/NPCs, though it's not really required since that can be a lot of work for one person. \n\nRight now, I'm interested in three particular plot devices: \n\n1. **Pirates** - This is something I would want to take place in the nautical prime of the 1700s, but I wouldn't mind adding in paranormal or magical elements here and there to spice things up. After all, most good pirate stories are at least a little mystical.\n2. **Time Travel** - I'm a big fan of Outlander and was hoping somebody else would be interested in using time travel as a main element of a story, especially where the character cannot find a way back to their original era. I don't want to play the same characters, just enjoy the idea of somebody being sent back to an older period and trying to adapt. This can be anything you'd like, from ancient civilization up to the 60s, though it would probably be more fun for us if we picked a century with a good amount of social or political turmoil.\n3. **Classic Romance** - I've been watching the ABC show Once Upon a Time, and while I want our roleplay to have nothing to do with it, it has rekindled my childhood interest in Beauty and the Beast. They have a great rendition of it and now all I can think about is a Stockholm Syndrome love story. Your character would not have to be a Beast, but he would have to be an initially despicable or otherwise unlovable character. \n\nWe can do any of these, or combine all three, or whatever you'd like. Along with massive amounts of thrilling escapades, I would like to include a little slow burning romance with anything we do. Love is what keeps the world spinning round (at least for a total, complete sucker like me). Anyways, hope to hear from you soon. :)",
