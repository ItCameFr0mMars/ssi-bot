Anyone interested just message me with an idea about your character. I generally use Discord or Kik, and strongly prefer longer, narrative structured replies.\n\nSo, my current concept is that my character is a young, na\u00efve Jedi Padawan who is corrupted to the dark side by a Sith lord. I do have one in mind, but we can discuss other character ideas as well. If you're a big Star Wars fan we can discuss what time period it would be, but that's not a requirement because Star Wars lore is for only the deepest of nerds.\n\nNote that while I do prefer long replies, don't feel the need to pad it out if you only have a little bit to say, I'm not going to instantly block you for short replies when appropriate.\n\nI guess that's my spiel, hopefully you'll message me if interested! \n",

My name is Seol Lefeure, and if your reading this, them I'm likely already dead... I'm currently plummeting towards the ground of an unknown planet. I was hoping to use the gravitational pool of this planet to slingshot myself towards a (semi) nearby port. Well, apparently the planets atmosphere is \"anomalous\" so my math was a bit off and my ship was swallowed by the planet... My engines are not graded for atmospheric operations, and the hull has no wings, rudders or other control surfaces... To be frank I'm doomed... It's a beautiful planet at least... I write this, lighting the last of my Verhinian Peaceweed, and watching the horizon slowly consume everything. My scans do not read any sort of developed life on this planet... so there is really no hope of intervention... Well... Hello world! ...and... goodbye!\n\n(This is a story about a miracle. A space man who has lost all hope somehow plummeting to your world, and through no intervention (or if you wish) or someones intervention, surviving. He rises from the burning wreck with limited air and supplies, on a world very toxic to him, with lifeforms very different. He comes from the stars with technology you may consider primitive, or magic... What is known is that your worlds are very different, but this individual is vulnerable here, and he needs your help.

The carnival would appear seemingly overnight; seduce, goad and bait the townspeople, drawing them in before clamping its unholy jaws shut.\nLost souls, lonely orphans of war, those searching to escape their pasts flocked to the carnival; they saw it as easy money and a chance to move quickly. Soon they would learn that not everything was as it seemed, and madness would overtake them. The Gods would feast and gorge themselves on the delicious souls; experiencing human emotions that were strange, alien and intoxicating. In time however the Gods grew tired and moved on, leaving the humans and their souls and the carnival to face whatever fate lay before them.\n\nOver time the carnival wandered, searching and consuming. Souls weren't just for the Gods, they were the energy source of the infernal engines powering the beast. Like a dying animal the carnival scoured the land and consumed whatever it could find. Eventually rusting and dying. Until now\u2026.\n\n*\u201cThe Chaos Carnival\u201d* is a new and exciting experience for all ages, a three ring circus focusing on pushing the human body to new extremes!

            "selftext": "Hello role players my name is Hat and I\u2019m here to get as many of you people into our RP Inexplicable Reference to the End of the Story. We have been rocking and rolling for seven years now and we are looking for some fresh new blood.\nOur group is a bit small but it's full of creativity. We run what is basically a science fantasy slice of life adventure group. Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains (usually me) to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.\n\nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, lords of chaos, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence. Feel free to choose from our RPs take on the pure magic races such as elves, dwarves, etc. or go nuts and make something crazy and we will add it to our species list.\nThe world is alive with more lore than you could learn in several years and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature.\nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.\n\nStart in any corner of local reality you wish, and play however it is you want. Go for a more morally upright guardian soldier in the Ultram Alliance ready to fight for freedom and justice, or play as an imperial inquisitor scouring entire worlds in flame for their crimes against the Empire.\nBe a righteous stand up dude or a right bastard it\u2019s up to you. How far you go depends on your drive, ingenuity, adaptability, and intelligence.\nAlso to clarify as there have been some misunderstandigns. This world contains both magic and science in equal mixes. Neither is hard, so don't ask for the molecular structure of arcane. You can get very powerful with both arcane and tech, it just takes time as power comes from time spent active. That means if you spend every day working on things and do that for a month, you beat out the guy who does nothing for six months. As well, we move in real time. That may be a drag but we do it so that characters don't become locked in interactions with people who show up more rarely. One member bless her heart is a Paramedic. Valuable as that is, if you talk to her and had to wait, you would be trapped as she shows up for only a few minutes every couple days due to her work. That means when you leave if the scene goes on, your character will auto pilot to whatever it is you want them to do. Training, research, sleeping, eating, whatever. Please know that it may feel strange or bad, but we have lasted this long so something is working. It's like some games, the start sucks the most, but get past that and it becomes a lot more fun. Like Warframe. Or getting addicted to League of Legends.\n\nPlease not we are most active from 8-1 central time. We sometimes have intermittent RP through the day but it\u2019s not regular by any means. We are willing to accept people worldwide but if you are in a time zone that makes regular activity easy in our prime RP times I cannot guarantee you will get as much out of the RP as others.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note combat is a fairly large part of the RP. We have a fairly significant plot coming up involving a war for a very strategic system. While utility and slice of life characters have their place it\u2019s important prospective recruits have a main character that is combat viable.\n\nStill if you are just looking for a good RP we would still love to have you and get you into our little group. We have lots of lore, most do after several years but have the big stuff summarized in a dedicated lore tab and player. What topics get extra attention for recording are decided by the community, and even more detailed info can be found on our google drive. If you are worried about having a lot to read, no worries new players are required to only peruse a short five min read in the bare essentials tab.\n\nA note we have a hybrid post length system here, our policy is you dont need 5 paragraphs to open a door but ya sure as hell do the murder a fucker. We like to keep things conversational with 2-4 lines sometimes more for casual conversation. However we do believe in long massive paragraphs for things like combat, character descriptions, land descriptions, plot overviews, lore (ESPECIALLY THIS ONE), well descriptions of important shit in general honestly. \n\nIf that is fine by you we would love to have you. PM me to join the fun and enter our little corner of the internet!\nHope to see you all soon!",

            "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI have a few prompts, some more detailed than others, I've been itching to play; but, I'd like to play them from a more player-GM relationship.  It doesn't have to be exclusively that, and I'm absolutely willing to help with the world building, if you so desire; but, I do prefer there to be some mystery left to be discovered by my character in each.  It's a sliding scale I'd be willing to discuss.\n\nMy favourite theme in roleplay is moral greyness.  Do the means justify the end?  Who supports that, and who will vehemently oppose it?  Are the deaths of a specific thousand worth a *chance* to save ten million?  How far would that number have to change for the scales to rebalance another direction?\n\nI enjoy roleplay that makes your emotions jerk away, and putting myself in the mindset to have to write a character that copes in that environment.  I enjoy decisions that have resounding ramifications, knowing that there isn't an undo button.\n\nI often see blurbs about post length, so I suppose I should put that here:  It doesn't matter to me how long a post is so long as the frequency makes sense.  I strongly prefer more snappy few-sentence replies with a quick back and forth over writing two pages and not hearing from you for a day or two.  It's always felt more natural and engaging to me that way.  I tend to post a minimum of a few sentences up through a couple of paragraphs, depending on what makes sense.  If we're in a conversation between two characters, likely toward the shorter end.  If a scene merits a vivid description, the longer end.\n\nOnto the prompts --\n\n - A vampire who begins their unlife thousands of years ago, and lives through many of the more impactful events in history.  I love the thought of through various periods and engaging with those in the culture at the time.  Historical accuracy isn't really that important, so long as we achieve a vibe that fits well.  I'd love to explore how various religions and cultures view this creature throughout the ages.  Perhaps some venerate her.  Perhaps others hunt her.  Roleplay can decide this. :-)  There are a few more details I have for this, but we can discuss it over PMs.\n\nWhether the roleplay is free-form or via some stat/rolling system is up to you.\n\n- Broadly -- I'd *love* to participate in a Castlevania themed roleplay.  Time period or setting doesn't really matter to me.  The lore in this universe fits a broad range of settings, from original hunters in the dark ages up through soul-stealing Dracula-reincarnate of the future.  Details can be discussed on what exactly it'd entail.\n\n - Broadly -- Supernatural hunting other supernatural threats before they hit the public sphere.  Details to be discussed.\n\n - A character I wrote for a previous campaign -- A Warlock whose entire life was orchestrated to make her exactly the type of person that would say yes to a dark higher power, and the story of her growth into a Warlock and up into a planar power.  \n\nFeel free to message me if you think we'd be a good fit, and if any of these prompts interest you.  Feel free to offer any other prompt you think might be a good fit with what I've said so far, too.\n\nLooking forward to hearing back!\n\nKhisera",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars are some which quickly come to mind). (Admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am mainly looking for as a partner. And hopefully one who has no limits, like me.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me! And please, do PM. I have yet to get used to that new Reddit chat.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have to urge, please tell me why so we can work on it.",

I'm admittedly new, and I'm not really used to going on Reddit for anything really, but a friend of mine suggested that I come here if I wanna find people to Roleplay with, and honestly this seems very neat. Anyways, I just recently made an RP server for the Kingdom Hearts game series, completely brand new, and I'm looking for anyone interested in joining, be it to roleplay, be a staff member or both! In any case, I would be more than happy to have you! Here is the ad below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the end of Dream Drop Distance, the Keyblade War was believed to be approaching closer to its climax, as Master Xehanort anticipated, the 13 Seekers of Darkness and the 7 Wielders of Light, clashing on the final battlefield. However as Fate would have it, some wrenches have been thrown in as well, for better or worse as arious Nobodies were being resurrected from nothingness, their human counterparts still existing, yet both half retaining their memories, the latter half having their hearts still. In addition, there have been the appearance of other Keyblade Wielder, Nobodies, Heartless, and humans that may or may not change the tide of the upcoming battles and the 2nd Keyblade War.  \n\n \\~Canon Claims available, such as Riku, Sora, or maybe Organization Members! \n\n\\~You have a chance to create OCs here as well! Keyblade Wielders, Nobodies, or just simple humans! \n\n\\~Get a chance to meet fellow KH Fans and maybe discuss the games and the release of Kingdom Hearts 3!! \n\n\\~Accepting of anyone! (Except trolls and raiders of course) \n\n\\~Explore the worlds that you love the most! \n\n\\~And right now, honestly it's currently a WIP, in its very very last stages (been hard to finish because of college, so I am currently accepting staff applications. Your help would greatly be appreciated as well to help run the server and put a hand in finishing it!! And if you don't wanna be staff, you can still join!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Come Join Us Today!

I just finished watching the gameplay demo of *Cyberpunk 2077* from CDPR, and I just have to say -- wow! What an environment for some major storytelling! Night City is alive and huge and frightening and seductive and a million other things, and I want to place some stories in it with original or canon characters (though I get that canon would be hard to pull off due to the small amount we see, but I figured that I would extend the invitation anyway) ranging from our very own OCs to someone playing their version of V or Jackie or whoever they really want! I could even play my version of V to your Jackie or whatever! It's our story, after all!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI enjoy some romance and all that comes with it in my stories, or just the all that comes with it if that is how your character rolls, but I only play male characters and do a romance/other such things with female characters. I don't care about your RL gender, only your age, thus why this is marked NSFW! If you are above 18, then we are golden! Naturally, I don't mind to roleplay with a male character either. Who doesn't love some intense buddy action in a neon-lit city with more love for corporate logos than people? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do try and match my partners, and I try to do at least one reply a day, but huge posts will take me longer sometimes as I am an active college student in my senior year, so as you can guess, things can get hectic sometimes! I do try my very best to be accountable and keep you in the know, however, so I won't just up and poof. If it seems like I have, throw a message my way and remind me! I really don't mind getting a deluge of messages or anything else. My biggest goal with this is to make sure we have fun in a wild and interesting setting, and I know that Night City will not disappoint!   \n\n\nPlease feel free to PM, send a chat, or comment down below! I can roleplay on here or on Discord! Thank you!",

After turning Twenty and living in the same quiet, English countryside town since I was born, I booked a one way flight to the Big Apple, found a small, studio apartment in the city, and got myself a nice little reporter job at a small time paper.\n\nAnd I was alone.\n\nSo alone. \n\nAs much as I wanted to get away from my home town, it was nice having a group of friends that I could always rely on to hang out with at a moments notice. I haven't had to make a new friend for about 5 years. \n\nNow here I was with *no one*. I'm living in the most gorgeous city in the world and I have nobody to explore it with. My job isn't really the best place to make friends either, I'm easily the youngest person there - most of my collegues are nearing retirement.\nI see so many cool places to eat, or things to do, but instead I just spend my evenings playing comic books. \n\nThis is horrible.\n\nEventually, after about 3 months of total social isolation, it kinda got to me. At 3:30, I just decided to try and see if I could leave work two hours early without anybody noticing. \n\nAnd, well, nobody did. It was pretty depressing actually.\n\nI swung myself over to the nearest Starbucks and ordered a fancy coffee. It may drain my soul, but my job pays damn well. I slunk myself into a seat and people watched to kill the time.\n\nBut... Hold on, that-that girl, she... Is that... Surely not... But why would she be in New York? After all this time?\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n***\nHey! I'm a fairly experienced roleplayer of about 4 years now, and I'd like to build a Romantic roleplay with a personable and bubbly writer out there!\n\nSo for this roleplay, my character bumps into one of his old crushes from school out of pure chance, far from the city they grew up in. They were friends for a little while, but they quickly drifted and lost touch. Now, both alone and lost in the big city, they rekindle their friendship before potentially sharing a steamy night of passion, and eventually starting a relationship together.\n\nI would like this story to have some NSFW elements, but only after it's been built up enough, and it's the right story beat. \n\nThe most important aspect of their relationship should be their chemistry - they should bounce off each other like a tennis court, they flirt subtley but painfully obviously - you could cut their sexual tension with a knife.\n\nI'd love to develop this more, so please, message me and let's discuss!\n\nI look forward to hearing from you :)",

Prepare for Drift\" i say as i lean back slightly, and let everything flow...\n\n\n****PLOT END****\n\nyea i know it was a bit short, but with the next things i put down, you'll understand why i didn't have much to work with, without concreting anything.\n\nSo in this rp, we can either be the following relations\n\nBrother &amp; Sister\n\nSon &amp; Mother\n\nBoyfriend &amp; Girlfriend \n\nHusband &amp; Wife\n\nBest Friends\n\nOr any other cool combinations you can think of...\n\nLet me know what you've decided in pm",

            "selftext": "Our galaxy is in turmoil.\n\n\nAutocrats seek to subjugate us, planets lay blighted and infected with magical abominations, and the emissaries of the leviathans have become increasingly malevolent. I fear for our safety. War could break out at any moment and reduce our way of life to ruin.\n\n\nMy anxiety has led me to commune with the leviathans for the first time. I am no practitioner of magic, I have never wielded their power. An abhorrent mix of eldritch horror and divine beauty has been burned into my mind. I see them when I close my eyes now, in my dreams as well. I sought answers to our future, but I fear the very corruption I once fled has wormed its way into my being. I do not have much time left. I sent my family away aboard my starship to the far reaches of the galaxy. I pray they will be safe there. \n\n\nBe safe, my dear friend. Live your life to its fullest before the cold embrace of death snatches it away.\n\n\n[End of Prompt]\n\n\nHey there, party person, I have been working on a sci-fi and fantasy setting for some time now and I'm opening the latest version to some new players! To give a brief rundown of things, it's a bit Star Wars-esque with the technology. However, there are also magical abilities that a select few have received from great beings from another realm. Expect to encounter exotic worlds, plenty of aliens, and interstellar governments!\n\n\nAs a GM, I'd like to know what kinds of things you're hoping to do in an RP like this. Do you want to just explore? Do you want to join the military and go to war? Are you just looking to meet someone? Or do you just want to make some cash smuggling? You're not limited by these of course, but knowing what you want will help me give you more opportunities to do those things.\n\n\nIt's also important that I know what your limits are. Please tell me if you're okay with blood, gore, battle, carnage, or dark things in general. Depending on how you choose to progress, you may encounter this stuff and sometimes I like to get pretty descriptive with it. Please also tell me if you are okay with NSFW content and if you want to include it. I'm more than happy to include NSFW content, and if you really want you can just go on some sexual misadventure to get a bunch of alien girlfriends from all across the galaxy or something like that. You'll have to play right though!\n\n\nNow, the boring part: writing requirements. Don't fret, if you're an experienced roleplayer and a good writer, this won't be a problem. All I ask is that you send me a message with substance that I can reply to. It doesn't need to be a specific length, though I'd like you to be capable of writing a few paragraphs when appropriate as it's not uncommon for me to do that. Third or first-person is fine, whatever you prefer. Playing multiple characters is a bonus as well. I'm going to be doing most of the heavy lifting here so I greatly appreciate a partner who puts work into their replies. Standard roleplaying etiquette applies of course, so no godmodding, metagaming, etc.\n\n\nThat's pretty much everything. If you're interested, please send me a PM with what you'd like to include and do with me!",

            "selftext": "\\### Realm of Angarak\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### What is Angarak?\n\n\\---\n\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### What makes it unique?\n\n\\---\n\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### What are the 'requirements'?\n\n\\---\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### Tl;Dr\n\n\\----\n\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj](https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj)",

I don\u2019t want to do all the work, ya know. A fun RP consists of us both thinking of fun ideas and plots. :P I am also looking for someone okay with romance. And if we do take a romantic spin on things, I ask that your character be male. I am a female irl, and will be writing as one. (It doesn\u2019t have to start off fast, I would rather some build up.) NSFW themes are okay with me, as long you\u2019re over the age of 18 and boundaries are discussed. Also! I write in third person, I prefer you do too! And, while I know and understand mistakes happen, I would like decent grammar and spelling. I tend to write 2-5 paragraphs, I don\u2019t expect anyone to match my posts exactly. As for what type of RPs we do, genre wise, I am up for all kinds! Admittedly, am not so good  with Fandoms but will consider it. \n\nThat\u2019s all for now! If you\u2019ve read this, I thank you. My preferred place to RP is Discord but message me here to see if we\u2019re a good fit, and if we are, we can move from there! ",

            "selftext": "Hello. My name is Annie, and I've been roleplaying for 10+ years. I'd like to find a few long-term partners since my more regular partners have decided to take a bit of a break. I prefer multi-paragraph, detailed RPs that incorporate interesting characters with quite a lot of development. Romance does not need to be a central plot point, but it can be a fun addition to any good story. To that end, I am comfortable with (and enjoy) playing both male and female roles, but when playing with female partners, I generally prefer to double (one M and F each) for fairness' sake. \n\nWhen it comes to the RP itself, I like Google Docs for a lot of reasons, but I'm pretty happy to work with any medium, especially for the right partner. I have a lot of RP samples, as well, and can provide them on request. \n\nI enjoy fandom and original RPs; if you don't see anything you like in the lists below, feel free to ask for another genre if you have something particular in mind. \n\n**Fandoms** (Bit old-school here. Sorry.) \n\n* Harry Potter\n* Sherlock Holmes (various versions)\n* Pride and Prejudice \n* Robin Hood\n* Eragon\n* Walking Dead\n* Beauty and the Beast\n* Final Fantasy X\n* almost anything Stephen King, Tamora Pierce, Naomi Novik, etc.\n* *really, the list goes on...*\n\n**Originals**\n\n* Medieval/fantasy\n* Sci-fi\n* Vampires\n* Pirates\n* *no, seriously, just about anything interesting will work here...*\n\nJust drop me a message if you're interested.

            "selftext": " \n\nHello it's me again. I feel as though I wasn't more specific in what I was looking for last time I posted so I wanted to make just one more post in hopes of finding the person I am looking for.\n\n**Platform:** I will only roleplay on Discord. I plan to find just one person, make a discord server for the world in which we will be rping in with channels for each city, channels for lore and character bios with pictures.\n\n**Characters:** I am looking for someone who is comfortable have two or three main characters as well as claiming a few NPCs that may require being played semi-frequently in order for the story to be rich and entertaining.\n\n**Story:** I have a certain type of roleplay that I am craving right now. I want to play a high elven female princess that for whatever reason (we can discuss details) has grown up in the human kingdom as either a prisoner of the human king or hidden hostage of some sort. She's been there since she was a baby. Perhaps she was the love child of the king and the high elven queen and kept a secret. interbreeding species is considered heresy in this world. Elves and Humans have two different religions. I want this elf to have a special ability that is unique. Something that makes her different from literally every elf and human. I am not into power gaming at all so with every ability our characters have there will be a way to disarm it or counter it.\n\nSomething has happened to disrupt the alliance between the human king kingdom and the elven kingdom. The humans revoke right of passage to the elves and go as far as to execute them publicly should one be caught. I like to add a lot of different elements to my story; I sometimes enjoy breaking my characters and building them back up. I want an interesting romance to occur between the secluded elven princess and perhaps a man that is used to killing her kind. Perhaps he becomes friendly with her thinking that she is a human.. discovers she is an elf and slowly find himself feeling protective of her and the romance ensues.\n\nI am up for building the world and story with you but this is sort of a rough draft of the direction I want to go with one of my main characters.\n\n**Deal breakers:** I am looking for someone who can contribute at least once a day. Skipping a day here and there for real life things is fine but I am in the mood to roleplay so I am looking for someone who is looking for the same. There are a lot of **NSFW** scenarios that I enjoy (I can be quite harsh with characters I get bored of sunshine and rainbows) ***but I am not looking for a smut-centered roleplay experience.***  What excites me is the story and I am hoping to create one that can develop and evolve the characters and the world we create for them (:\n\n**I would prefer someone 20+ years old, experienced, good sense of humor** *(ability to handle rp that may tend to get graphic, cruel, romantic, all of it)* **no creeps... I love talking oocly about the roleplay but I am not exactly looking for a friendship beyond that... if it happens it happens. I've made friends with people I meshed really well with RP wise...**\n\nIf you made it this far and you're still interested them **please PM with your age, timezone, and availability for roleplay.***If you don't I am going to assume you are just someone that immediately responds without reading.*",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Bailey and I\u2019m in need of some new partners, as my previous ones failed to respond or weren\u2019t doing it for me. I use kik or reddit for my role plays, and absolutely do not like discord, and refuse to use it. I don\u2019t know why, but it never rolled with me. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI\u2019ve never been good at describing fight scenes or action, but do like to incorporate it into my scenes. Some of my favorite roleplays I have done have included vampires, rich people, some fandoms, (I\u2019m also picky on those,) crime, reality, drama, romance, high school, trauma, and the list could go on forever. I know there\u2019s so many more, but these are the only things I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but am more than fine with smut if it fits into the story. Also. as for pairings, I prefer MxF, with me as F, but I can dabble in FxF if it is necessary. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where lots of words are necessary. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey. ",

Those who had money survived in seclusion, bringing only their strongest knights and warriors with them. The entirety of the world was ash, a global fire destroying anything that was alive, leaving a barren desert behind. Four races surviving the disaster. Exodus, Earthica, Primfira, and Luthra. The handful of people that survived in each race would go on to continue their bloodlines, doing whatever they could to survive the Dark Years after the world had fallen to ash. \n\nYears would pass before real reconstruction would begin. The races did what they could to stay alive, raising warriors to keep them safe, birthing children to become farmers, medics, teachers, and anything that was deemed a necessity to thrive.\n\nThe once technologically advanced world has fallen so far back it resembles that of 297 AC. As years progress, kingdoms are built. The world stays rather barren, a few dense forests appearing here and there, water sources sparse. \n\nThe year is now 2070, the only surviving kingdoms have now established homes for their people. These kingdoms spread out on the only live section of the earth. Exodus, the wealthiest kingdom, managed to thrive the most due to good money tactics. Primfira, the second wealthiest kingdom, follows in Exodus's footsteps money wise. The last two kingdoms Earthica and Luthra are the poorest of them all. Having poor money management and aggressive behaviors that caused disruption and war within their own kingdoms. While they are calmer now, these two kingdoms are still fairly dangerous, the people blood thirsty and strong.\n\nWhether you are from one of the lesser kingdoms, Primfira or Exodus, that is up to you. You will create your story starting now. Maybe you\u2019re a prince or princess in a poorer kingdom, seeking power. Or even the same but in Exodus or Primfira, desperate to leave and become a warrior, become something new. A king, no longer loyal to his queen or a spy, slithering through the cracks, soaking in the rumors that dance along the kingdoms streets. You decide.\n\n*\n\n\nWord of a princess arising in Exodus blows across the kingdoms, now unfolds the chance for a young man or woman to marry into wealth and royalty. A festival being held in Exodus, inviting all from every kingdom to come. Warriors will battle, not for death but to entertain and attempt to impress the royals. Archers will show off their skills, poets, builders, and any other skill set will be put on display, a chance to win the spot beside the princess, or maybe find love among the other many royals attending from Primfira and Exodus. Mothers will force their daughters to attend, desperate to obtain wealth. Sons forced to train or pick up a skill to impress. But the more desperate seek out the whispers that claim the king and queen of Exodus have fallen loveless. Rumors of the queen sleeping with strange men and the king bedding ladies from all kingdoms. \n\nWhile having a princess is not uncommon or taboo, Exodus has been known for not allowing outsiders to wed their offspring. They have made an exception, in an attempt to bring peace across the kingdoms. \n\nPrimfira, the sister kingdom, is enraged by the attention Exodus is drawing. They will however be expected to attend, but their intentions may not be so sincere. \n\nIf you attend the event you are not expected to wed, the festival is merely a chance for a better life, wealth, companion(s), or maybe the perfect place to cause disaster.",

            "selftext": "Hello, r/roleplay! Hope you're all doing well in this fine day! \n\nI'm Raccoon, and I'm looking for a roleplay partner for email fun times. \n\nI'll try to keep this short and sweet: I'm 35, work full time, and I'm currently looking for a partner solely for email roleplays. English is my second language, but I'm careful with my spelling and grammar an welcome corrections when needed. I like longer posts (around 3 paragraphs, give or take), and I'm not one for one-liners or rapid fire. I post daily on week days, and weekends vary, since I'm out there living my offline life.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner: Someone older than 21, who enjoys writing longer posts and can be patient when I can't reply right away due to work being busier than I expected. Someone with good grammar and spelling too. No need to be a native English speaker, just have a good grasp of the language. For this, please be willing to roleplay a male character.\n\nAbout the plot: Very simply, I want to set a Christian prince and a pagan princess together. They may come together through an arranged marriage for a peace treaty (with the condition that she practices the new religion), or meet through other ways, such as a diplomatic visit or even war (in that case, maybe she could find a wounded and unconscious prince and not knowing who he was, take care of him until he came to). If they end up married, I'd love to explore the theme of her trying to fit in with the Christians while they look for any excuse to say she's still a witch, and the conflict involved. I don't mind mature themes, but I prefer to keep my roleplaying safe for work. I'm thinking the characters would be young, but not overly. Somewhere between 18 and 23 would be ideal.\n\nIf you're interested, drop me a PM. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "First of all; I\u2019m kinda new to Reddit, oops.\n\nAlso. Hi, hello! My name is Bria! I\u2019ve been role playing for maybe 5 years now, maybe even more? It\u2019s been a while. I like to think I know what I\u2019m doing. I like to be semi-descriptive, extremely descriptive... basically, I like details and I tend to ramble... like right now.\n\nI like my roleplay partner to also be literate. I get it. We all have typos. We all make mistakes.... but if it\u2019s constant, every single response.. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll work out.\n\nI\u2019m a full time employee with a lot of time on my hands when I\u2019m off, plus I also like to do stuff on my breaks at work. When I\u2019m bored, I get really bored.\n\nI\u2019ve done mostly fandom, but I\u2019m open to do anything really! Completely an open book, but fandom is where I\u2019m most comfortable.\n\nThe fandoms I like/feel most comfortable in are\n\n-Harry Potter (mostly marauders! I\u2019ve played a lot as Sirius and I\u2019m also game for Golden Trio era.)\n \n-Marvel! Mostly Avengers however. I\u2019ve played as Clint, T\u2019Challa, Steve, Bucky, Pietro... but I\u2019m open to play anyone and give it a try!\n\n-aaaand maybe a select few others I can\u2019t think of right now? It\u2019s too late for my brain to work  and I\u2019m killing time at work here.\n\nI usually do OC x Canon, but I am partial to canon x canon, but mostly leaning towards oc x canon. I do like to double so we each have a couple we can both play female in. It just seems fair tbh. I\u2019m all about fairness.\n\nI tend to gravitate towards MxF pairings. Nothing against LGBT+... because I myself happen to be part of the spectrum. But I just am better adept at writing MxF. I also mostly write SFW because most of the time.... I am at work. But I\u2019m also comfortable with writing NSFW. Nothing... super explicit however.\n\nI do use discord quite often, I\u2019m also a fan of using email. I don\u2019t have a preference. If you wanna go the discord route, sure. If you wanna go the email way, sure. Either way... feel free to message me and we can work something out! I don\u2019t bite, I promise.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, congratulations! Hope to hear from anyone who wants to role play soon!",

There's one idea that's been floating around in my head for awhile. Again, I'm more than happy to build ideas together, so please don't think any of this plot is set in stone. If you have things you'd like to add to it, other parts you don't like, etc., let me know! It's our story, after all.   \n\n\nAlso, please don't take this quick summary as an indicator of my writing. I'll typically give anywhere from 5-6 paragraphs, and in many cases much more. But, like I said, I get eager when it comes to fleshing out a new story. With that in mind, take a look:   \n\n\n**The basis of this story would reflect around two police partners who have been working together for a year or two. They're both relatively young (mid-twenties?) and graduated from the same academy, etc. Because of the nature of their work and the high crime rate of the city they're in (I'm thinking a lot of gang-related violence, drugs, etc.), they've grown extremely close. On the surface, some people would see it as a brother/sister sort of relationship.**   \n\n\n**But he doesn't see it that way. In fact, he's had feelings for her since the day they started working together. With everything they've been through, those feelings have only grown. But, he's never lead on to them for three reasons:**   \n\n\n**1. It's against the rules**  \n**2. He doesn't want to ruin their friendship**  \n**3. She's definitely married**  \n\n\n**That's not where the drama ends. Actually, it's only where it begins.**   \n\n\n**The kicker here is that she's in an abusive relationship with her husband, and no one knows about it. She's a tough cop, but when it comes to her marriage she keeps the violence and abuse hidden.**   \n\n\n**Obviously, this could go a lot of different ways and a lot of things could happen throughout. Some initial ideas that come to mind include things like one of them getting shot, lots of dangerous situations in the field, him discovering a bruise on her one day and becoming suspicious, him confronting her husband one day after finding out, etc.**  \n\n\nI know that's a pretty basic summary, but I'd like to build on this with someone. I guess I should lay out a few ground rules so you don't waste your time messaging me if we're not a good fit.   \n\n\nPlease be at least 18. This RP will undoubtedly contain a lot of mature themes.   \n\n\nIf you say you're an 'advanced' level writer, be able to give me more than a paragraph. Not trying to be pretentious here at all, but I envision this as a gritty and detailed story, and would love to find someone willing to put work into those details and let the characters build relationships and grow.   \n\n\nI think that's it for now. Don't be afraid to shoot me a message - I'm a pretty easygoing guy! Thanks for checking in!  \n",

            "selftext": "Hey there! \n\nI am looking for a few longer term RP partners to try out a few ideas I have had in my head. \nCurrently I don't have the most free schedule, so I am looking for people who can dedicate a longer period of time where we might have one or two responses per day. Because of this I would generally want to have longer more detailed replies. Probably not a novel length, but several paragraphs that we can really dig into and expand in our own replies. Ofcourse the fact that I want some degree of literacy is a given, but I haven\u2019t had much a problem with it in the past with people from here. I am extremely flexible with the format of the writing, although I generally prefer 3rd person because it is easier to write especially with multiple characters appearing. \n\nI will also enjoy talking and getting to know you in between replies, and spending time talking about the RP and sharing ideas for it. Getting along and knowing my partners is very important to me, and being able to have some decent conversation about the premise out of character is a must. I will want to talk a little bit about what you are looking for from the RP, what interests you in the prompt and a little bit of how you are seeing the story go before we start. Most of these prompts are going to be original content so we also have decide our characters as well. \n\nI am a guy IRL, but I greatly prefer to have FxF characters and mostly don\u2019t enjoy playing as/with male characters. Although I do have a few prompts that have male characters as the main character at least part of the time. \n\nGiven that most of these prompts will have a much larger cast of female characters, with the occasional male character when needed, and I will encourage you to use female characters when you create your characters. \n\nNow that the introduction is over here are a few of my prompts: \n\n1. **The Spy Who Shrunk Me**: Based on a trailer for a game I saw recently that recently captured my imagination. This is the story of a Cold War era spy infiltrating a Soviet Era research lab to capture there newest invention a Shrink Ray! I expect this to be a mix between spy thriller, and fantastical Ant Man like adventure using the shrink ray in creative ways. Expect some romance, betrayal, and daring in a tiny world. \nNote that a lot of details here are subject to change including the setting. I have a few other ideas this could go into if you are interested. \n2.  **Witch School**: Exploring the daily life and adventures of students at an all girls school for witches, something like **Little Witch Academia** or **Harry Potter**. This will be a mix of a magical slice of life, think attending classes, making friends, studying for tests, learning new spells; as well as adventure, trying to save the school from dragons, finding a hidden dungeon to explore with a dark secret, etc...\nThis will be strictly FxF, with almost no male characters. I am up for this being set in the **Little Witch Academia** world if there is interest as well if anyone is interested in RPing that fandom. \n3. **Gigantic Monster Romance**: A kinda strange premise, that I absolutely fell in love with after reading a manga recently. The basic plot is a girl who has a strange disease that at times makes her seem monstrous. She grows claws and dorsal fins out of her back. She scares off her friends from school, and often gets bullied for her condition. All she wants is to be normal and have friends like anyone else. That is until she meets someone who can understand her, despite their vast differences in condition and social standing. They form a close bond and get closer. Unfortunately this relationship triggers something in her condition that causes her to change, suddenly growing bigger and more monstrous. Now grown to gigantic daikaiju size, and having the body to match. It has to be the worst day of her life, and it just gets worse as first the military and later other monsters arrive in town. Can these two girl\u2019s relationship weather these changes, can the main girl survive the onslaught of the military and other monsters, what caused her strange condition, and will she other get back to normal? \nThis prompt will be a mix between romance and daikaiju action. Naturally the premise will be more sad and at times somewhat horrific given the changes the kaiju girl goes through, and the damage she might cause in her kaiju form. It is a kinda silly idea, but I kinda want to take it somewhat seriously. \nThis is based heavily on **Otome Kaijuu Caramelize** manga, but with some changes since I have no idea where it is going since only the first chapter is in english. The biggest change is making the romance to be FxF due to my preference for female characters. \n4. **UltraGirl Action**: This is similar in some ways to 3 but taken less seriously and more in a fun way. Basically the story is that there is an Alien invasion of Earth sending giant monsters to cause destruction and chaos around the world. To combat this a more friendly Alien has granted a normal girl the power to grow gigantic to, and at first somewhat reluctantly, fight these monsters. But unknown to her she isn\u2019t the only granted this power, and others may not be as willing to use their powers for good. \nBasically just a twist on the **Ultraman** Concept, but with a girl character instead. I have a few ways to take this if anyone is interested. \n5. **Merging People**:  Before I begin I know this one is kinda weird, but I had someone suggest this prompt to me in the past, when I couldn\u2019t continue it. But it really stuck with me, and I would love to do it justice if anyone is interested.\nIn the future due to an ever growing population, and dwindling jobs there just isn\u2019t enough work for people to do. Rather than have people waste away doing nothing, the government and several large corporations have engineered a way to reduce the excess population. Normal methods of culling the population, plagues and famine were seen as too distasteful for the rich in charge. Instead they settled on a new, cutting edge method; a new device the Chrimeria Genesis Engine. The purpose of this device is to take two normal humans, and merge them together into a new person taking attributes from both creating a whole new person.\nThe only catch is that the original two people aren\u2019t gone. They are now both occupying the same body, sharing memories and feelings, able to think but share thoughts, and having some control over the shared body (This will be a unique situation to RP, as we will have 2 characters (or more characters) in one body!). \nThe RP will explore what it is like for our characters, the growing of a new personality of their Chrimeria body, and what the world that has this technology commonplace and widely used in the manner described is like. This is one prompt that I will really like to discuss before hand if you are interested. \n6. **Magical Girl**:  Basically just a typical Magical Girl adventure. Some girls get a set of powers and fight evil. I don\u2019t have much of a setting, or characters in mind. I am generally looking for OC, but might be able to be convinced of a fandom if you make a good argument. Still would really like to discuss the details before hand. \nFunny enough I might be considering a male character in this one, given that he still turns into a magical girl. I think playing that genderbending twist could be fun. That said I am still fine for playing it straight. \n\n\n\nIf you are interested in any of these prompts message me here and I will give my discord username. I much prefer to chat on there. \n\nI am on US East Coast, under EST time. I am usually online only in the afternoons after 5:00pm EST so don\u2019t be too worried if I don\u2019t respond right away!",

            "selftext": "Cool air hung over the city skyline, hints of the crisp, impending fall in every breath. The lights provided a false warmth. The glow alluded at memory of sunlight, long since gone beyond the horizon. Nevertheless, there was no shortage of life on the streets. There was no lack of hustle and bustle, chatter and whispers, and the rush of cars flying passed. People wandered in and out of the endless buildings, going about their existence as they did every day.\n\nLizette Moreau rivaled most of the structures in age; a fact no one would guess by the looks of her. The youthful beauty moved gracefully down the streets she knew all too well as if she was dancing with the city itself. Perhaps she was. They were well acquainted. \n\nThere was a energy present on the breeze that most would only notice in their quietest moments; that strange sensation when your heart hiccups briefly in fear with no discernible source. And then it's gone. Lizette noticed it fully. She breathed it in. \n\nIt was the presence of her kind. The presence of the supernatural, of danger, of magic. \n\nWolves howled, disguised as men. Witches entranced, hidden in plain sight. Vampires, most a great deal younger than Lizette, lured in lovers, spawn, meals. Ghosts whispered from the darkest corners. \n\nBut life went on, flying passed, unaware of just how close they stood to death and horror each day.\n______________\n\nA classic story, sure. Vampires and witches. Werewolves and ghosts. But something is coming to change the classic tale. Something is coming that will turn Lizette's world upside down. For better or worse.\n\nPast, third-person is the only way I write, apologies if that is an inconvenience. I am hoping to find someone that can help me create a really unique, in depth story.",

The main antagonists in this are The Connections, and a shady Umbrella Remnant gaining it\u2019s money through B.O.W sales and crime. I have some presets for you to play, or you could suggest your own. I also have a custom virus as well, with the characteristic of heightened BOW and mutant intelligence and a telepathic connection to a slightly mutated girl who leads them, known as Okiku.\n\nPreset 1: Play as Leon or Claire\n\n\nPlay as RE2\u2019s star team, Leon or Claire. You could play them both or just one. Leon is working with the New Umbrella, the PMC that\u2019s dedicated to fighting Bioweapons. Claire is with the BSAA, and will be on a joint op with Umbrella.\n\nPreset 2: Play as Chris or Jill\n\n\nChris, as we know, is with the PMC Umbrella. Jill will be recruited by them if you play as her. We\u2019ll decide the operations later.\n\n\nPreset 3: Play as Ada\n\nPlay as Ada, the spy, on a mission from mysterious contractors offering big money for delivering something from an abandoned secret umbrella base. Of course, you have your own motives as well...such as information and hopefully a clue to the location of a former Umbrella USS soldier who in this rp, lived against G-Birkin and escaped Raccoon city. His code name: HUNK.\n\nPreset 4: Play as HUNK.\nIt\u2019s been so long since Raccoon City. Yet it\u2019s affects still haven\u2019t left. You\u2019re on the run from anyone and everyone: you trust no one, especially since a PMC is hunting you down with the same name as Umbrella. You\u2019ve been living in Japan with a new identity, but after Blue Umbrella Helicopters surround your apartment, it\u2019s time to don the armor once again for a possible final stand. It\u2019s about time anyway. G-Birkin still haunts you. You start with your armor and an CZ75 in a combat situation if you pick this one.\n\n\nPM me for contact info\n\nUpdate: Return Of The G-Virus\n\nThe G-Virus has been re-made by the Umbrella Remnant...and they\u2019ve released it into Tokyo as a new, infiltrator Tyrant as an experiment. It takes the form of a woman, and she is basically a sentient G-Virus sample with a body. She even has a ID, house, everything humans do that have been approved from bribing the right people. It\u2019s been around for 6 years. 18 in it\u2019s lifespan.",

            "selftext": "Looking for a Naruto RP community on reddit? Then look no farther than /r/TheNarutoWorld!\n\n---\n\nIt\u2019s a period of uncertainty and wariness among the ninja villages. For a time it appeared the villages might enter a period of relative peace, especially after they came together at a Kage Summit to discuss the formation of a coalition and the reappearance of the tailed beasts in the world. But when the village forces met in a united coalition in the Sound, two of the villages initiated a shocking double cross against a third, Kiri. While the attackers thought they had a guaranteed victory, they were shocked to discover that Kiri had been expecting this and suffered a crushing defeat. \n\nWhile the tensions between those villages simmers and results in covert missions and sabotage, Kumo continues its attempts to govern, reform, and rebuild the Land of Sound. Yet within that country elements are rising up in rebellion and threatening to destabilize the troubled country. And in all of this, the reappearance of jinchuriki appears to be overlooked, as more pressing matters plague each village. \n\nMany new leaders are trying their hand at resolving these conflicts, and the next generation of ninja will influence the constantly evolving state of the world. What will happen next, now that a state of war exists between several villages? Responses of each village are constantly evolving and plans are being hatched all the time... how will *you* choose to affect these events? Will you join others in Konoha under the Will of Fire and fight for your village? Or maybe the way of the sword in Kiri speaks to you? Or if the role of peacekeeper and rebuilder speaks to you, maybe you will join Kumo in restoring the Land of Sound. \n\n\n---\n\nCreate your own character to set out to fulfill their goals and dreams along side other players! We've got a customized and well balanced system with plenty of room for creativity and fun. RP is similarly flexible and occurs both forum-style and in real-time and at several levels, both public and within your village to maximize the cloak-and-dagger nature of being a ninja. \n\nFor more information on getting started, and the basics of our RP group, come on over and check out [our sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNarutoWorld/). With a friendly group of players, helpful mods, and an OOC Discord community there is plenty for everyone and people more than willing to welcome you and get you set up and kicking some ninja butt in no time! \n\nHead on over to /r/TheNarutoWorld and start down your ninja path!\n",

I've RPed for about roughly 10 years so I have extensive experience in telling a story and writing. \n\nAs for the RP i'm seeking, it can be anything other than a regular slice of life RP. I prefer adventure, downfall, rebellion... sadly, those are things you cannot achieve in a slice of life scenario. I have ideas (Not prompts because my mind is always changing) that we can build into a story. You even can bring your ideas to the table too! Whether it's for a Fantasy story, SCI-FI, Thriller, Horror.. I would love to hear them. \n\nAnother thing I would like to note on is when I say Romance and NSFW, I'm not talking about purely smut... Yeah, I like those types of scenes as much as the next guy but what's the point if our character's don't mash well together. There has to be build, yearning, love between them. \n\nSo enough said/rambled. PM if you have any other questions! \n\nHappy roleplaying! ",

            "selftext": "Hey there. Hope everyone had good week.  As always, I'm looking for more partners for some great writing. Right now I'm mostly feeling my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts if you find me and my writing style of interest. \n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation, and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, unfortunately, and kind of particular. Typos? Not a problem. Some mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. I edit for a living, though, and it's ruined me for polite society, so I'm looking for someone of like mind with dedication to the language that keeps me hooked. \n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* I use email. I don't use any instant messaging, because honestly, it's less convenient for me. I will do PM if necessary. \n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)[Before session 7, preferably.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. (Sorry to the people who think my list is \"short.\" Again, I'm looking for the things that currently interest me, because this is a hobby, not a diplomatic mission.) If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! \n\nPlease note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

I would like to play the female in one M/F relationship and am happy to do another male/female for you in return as long as we come up with something cool and engaging.  I actually super love playing guys, but I get burnt out only playing them.\n* I enjoy writing real life.  So I love things that are hilariously funny, and things that are infuriating and frustrating, and things that are sad.  I really, really love people.  Like, a lot.  I love writing about them.  My favorite stuff to write is poignant stuff because I think sadness and longing and heartbreak and fear and the good that can come from those things is so extraordinarily beautiful.\n* I write third person/paragraph style, though my preference is rapid fire posts where we only post as much as we need to. I am quality over quantity every time--in fact, I LOVE surprises and not knowing and doing a lot with a little.  The best writers I've ever written with have been able to devastate me with five word posts.\n* I am MORE than literate, but I write \"slow burn\" because I think good stories take time\n* My favorite settings are historical, sci-fi, fantasy (I looooove playing princesses, fight me), and slice-of-life.\n* I RP by email\n\nOkay, what I am searching for is the \"tough\" male (your character) and the girl who \"changes\" him (mine). I love the idea of characters who are incredibly idealistic--yours thinks that mine is his savior, mine thinks that she IS his savior. But of course, we all know that things are much more complicated than that. This relationship will NOT be healthy and will probably crash and burn in the most spectacular of ways (I can't wait). Ideally, I'll run this plot alongside something that complicates it--it won't just be two people who bumped into each other at the grocery store, but I'm not opposed to that idea either. I am SUPER ready to write out some complex, screwed up characters who possibly actually make each other's lives worse! I am seeking someone who wants to write this out as realistically as possible, but also with great beauty.\n\nI know that this next section will turn some of you away from me, but I want to be as open and upfront as I possibly can be. Here is what I am not looking for:\n\n* Partners who completely disregard me, my character, and my story. It's like I'm not there at all. If you'd like to write a novel, I wish you the best of luck, but I want to write together.  This is the most common reason I lose interest in roleplay.\n* People who are mean and unpleasant or creepy and trying to hit on me. We are RPING. It is FICTION. Dude you don't even know what I look like I could literally be Cthulhu think of all the tentacles you'd have to deal with\n* Unapologetic godmodders. Everyone says that they don't godmod, and then people do. Do not put words in my mouth\n* People who are unwilling to try anything without plotting it to death first. Come ON where's your sense of adventure? Let's find things out together!!  I also don't have much interest in spending long periods of time planning out dynamics. I like to strike when the iron is hot and get going.\n* I'm just gonna reiterate that point above--I really, really don't want to spend long periods of time planning.  I lose 100% of my interest immediately.  I write on the fly.  I'm not a planner.  I often don't even proofread my posts.\n* People who really aren't all that interested in romance and don't really have a passion for it\n* \"Flat\" writers.  This is kind of hard to describe.  It's writers who aren't particularly inventive or skilled.  Oftentimes, their posts read more like textbooks than novels.  I am looking for a writer who is LIVELY and VIVID and FUN.  I am looking for characters to play against who are engaging and UNAPOLOGETICALLY FLAWED and interesting.\n* Somebody who doesn't really want to talk OOC.  It's not that I'll be blowing you up every day with all my drama and woes, but I really like people who are fun to talk to online.\n* Somebody who only wants to write the hero.  I find perfect characters to be so dull it makes me want to pull my teeth out.  My favorite characters I've ever written against were actually so frustratingly flawed and broken that sometimes I actually CRIED over them.  These are the characters I try (don't always succeed) in writing.\n\nAlso I have to tell you that if I don't think we are jiving, I will probably try to be honest about it.  Prepare yourself and don't get mean if I say so. I will be nice and it's not that you're a bad writer, it's just that I don't want to use up our time with something I'm not that into. It's a rare butterfly when two writers are equally invested in something, but darn it, I'm gonna chase that monarch to the ends of the earth\n\nPlease don't be intimidated by this. I've been rping for a very long time (seventeen years) and have spent most of that time writing stuff I'm not all that interested interspersed with a few plots that made me laugh, cry, ache, and RUN to my computer every time my partner posted. I want more of that--and I'm sure you do too. So if you're interested, message me and let's see what we can figure out. The best way to get my attention is by coming with an idea, a post sample, and a little about yourself.  The BEST BEST BEST way to get my attention is to be funny af in your intro to me, either be like \"this is what I want\" or \"what do you want,\" and then we just do it while we're both amped.\n\nWow okay this is a lot lol. Well, thanks for reading, whoever you are.\n\nPlease message me if you are interested!",

Cool, right? That shiver down your spine, the electric feeling, the motivation rising...\n\nNow, I'm in a roleplay community on Discord, a sort of superhero based town, and I'm the Chief of Police. There are times during which I set up scenes and control NPCs, and especially during attacks on the city I decide to tactically utilize helicopters and other vehicles. My question is, how do I convey the sheer psychological shock that would receive someone seeing three massive helicopters flying at them? How can I convey that emotion one would feel as Police cars rush to a scene, as the SWAT team breaks into a house, the crackling voice of the Sergeant yelling \"Police Department, coming in!\" before the door blasts open? I've always found my scenes end up feeling a little bland even though I consider myself a pretty good writer. Halp pls.",

            "selftext": "Greetings, traveler!\n\nI\u2019d like to start off by saying that I hope you are having a marvelous morning, afternoon, or evening. This little tidbit will be focusing around me and some details about my life so that you can better understand me and maybe decide if I will be the right roleplay partner for you. I am a female full-time university student in the PST timezone with a passion for video games, movies (including, but not limited to sci-fi), and nerd culture. So, me being a student means that I have a life outside of roleplay, as do all functioning humans, and I ask that you kindly respect that and I will do so as well for you. I do have a name, and I do love it, but for anonymity\u2019s sake, please call me by my first initial, \u201cA\u201d. I am very shy when it comes to discussing other personal accords of mine, but I assure you that once we start chatting, I can open up more. \n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to my history with roleplaying and writing. I have been imagining and writing down short stories on my own since early middle school, and that eventually branched out into horrible, one-liner, asterisk * action * roleplay once I found out what roleplay was on the Internet. Needless to say, I had no idea where the real plot-based roleplayers were for another few years. After my time as a cringe-fest, I began to fall in love with third person / multi paragraphed responses between partners. I now have around five years of roleplay experience behind me give or take my time as an * idiot *. I\u2019d also like to stress that I use past tense, third person, multi paragraph to describe actions and dialogue of the character(s) I am playing. This is how I hope and expect our roleplay to be structured. \n\nGetting the boring details about me out of the way, I can finally discuss my expectations in a partner... which may or may not be boring as well. I am not only looking for a roleplay partner that can write alongside me and feel that wonderful immersion of alternate realities, but who also shares my passion for the lore, characters, and settings of whatever universe we are playing in. I don\u2019t expect you to know every little detail down to the nitty gritty about the universe, but to have a decent grasp of lore and such would be much appreciated! I\u2019m a slight stickler when it comes to using mostly canon characters and settings as well, which basically means little to none original characters (OCs). It would also be phenomenal if you could match my responses in length and/or detail, which usually spans around three paragraphs. Apologies if my criteria is far fetched, but it\u2019s the price I have to pay for good roleplay these days. You veterans understand the struggle. \n\nWow! You\u2019ve gotten this far! Good for you! We now move on to the main event: fandoms! Here, I will list my interests for you to peruse and choose from, but choose wisely... just kidding. Choose whatever the heck you\u2019d like, I enjoy them all. (Items with asterisks are my all time favorites). \n\n- the Marvel Cinematic Universe\n- the X-Men movie series\n- all Star Wars movie trilogies / stories *\n- Overwatch game *\n- Destiny 1/2 games\n- the Batman Arkham game series\n- the DC Cinematic Universe\n\nThank you for reading up to this point if you\u2019ve made it here. If you think you would enjoy being my roleplay partner, I\u2019d love to chat. Male or female, please don\u2019t be shy. My message box is always open, so shoot me something on there or drop a comment on this post and we can get started. As listed in the title, I am comfortable with using Kik messenger or Discord to roleplay on. Again, thanks for stopping by and giving this post a read. Hope to hear from you soon!",

Hope you're all doing well in this fine day! \n\nI'm Raccoon, and I'm looking for a roleplay partner for email fun times. \n\nI'll try to keep this short and sweet: I'm 35, work full time, and I'm currently looking for a partner solely for email roleplays. English is my second language, but I'm careful with my spelling and grammar an welcome corrections when needed. I like longer posts (around 3 paragraphs, give or take), and I'm not one for one-liners or rapid fire. I post daily on weekdays, and weekends vary, since I'm out there living my offline life.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner: Someone older than 21, who enjoys writing longer posts and can be patient when I can't reply right away due to work being busier than I expected. Someone with good grammar and spelling too. No need to be a native English speaker, just have a good grasp of the language. For this, please be willing to roleplay a male character.\n\nThe plot I'm looking to write: Very basically, I'm looking to write two characters who had known each other very early on - think childhood/school friends - and lost touch during their college years meeting up again. I'd love for it to be a chance encounter, like them being at the same event/party, or being connected through work. We can definitely flesh this out together. From there, basically the fluffy stuff. Getting to know the new people they have become, and feeling that they both want something more than just being friends again. Bonus drama points if one of them is currently taken, but we don't have to do that. I'm trash and I want romantic fluff, okay? XD Note: I do most of my posting from work, so I keep my writing safe for work, and it's often my personal preference anyway, at least until we both feel comfortable with each other.\n\nIf you're also fluff-loving trash and okay with roleplaying a male character, shoot me a PM!\n\nThank you for reading! &lt;3 ",

The ability to character create and world build is also a plus. I do some cool ideas if you\u2019d like to hit me up I can surely share them. \n\nOne more thing, I am NOT looking for an ERP partner, I\u2019m ok with a good romance but we are not going that into it.\n\nThanks for your time!",

My main character is Jaune, but I try to make him less bland and generic as lots of people worry he'll be. I have lots of headcanons and backstory I've come up with for him, as I also do for Yang; whom I also sometimes play. I enjoy a little bit of angst, but only if it ends on a happy note. I do like smut too, although I don't like it to be purely pornographic. For me, it's more about the emotional intimacy that comes with it. I'm open to AUs and pretty much any ideas or characters, although I struggle with OCs. Please message me here and we can hopefully get something going on discord. I hope I hear from some of you soon. Have a great day :) ",

I would like development, not our characters instantly in love or anything like that, a crush is different. I am open to your ideas as long as you don't control and force my Role. \n\nI do plenty of Fandoms, I have been Roleplaying for five years now and I can say I am very literate. I strive for that, makes everything better for me. I don't mind smut, as long as it's plot driven. I do love a dark Roleplay, but if anything like that doesn't suit you then tell me.\n\nI Roleplay Naruto, Pokemon, Marvel, DC, Last of Us, Avatar, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Legend of Korra and Teen Wolf. I can play canon Characters, we can also mash together ships that don't exist too. And I am fine with OC, I also love themes with Supernatural. I always wanted a Werewolf Roleplay, or even a Vampire Roleplay, Dragon and Vikings would sound good to me. I enjoy Midieval as well, and Greek Mythology. It is a great outlet for me, and don't forget to list your themes too. Or any you were interested in.\n\nI would rather have long term as well, and I mostly use Discord.

I have quite a few ideas though, about encounters and such.\n\nThe story structure would have an overarching plot, such as an adventure to recover an ancient artefact, but would have brief self-contained encounters, such as savage cannibals on an island or a monstrous kraken.\n\nAs for the actual romance it will start off slow but will gradually transform into a fully-fledged romance. Smut is a possibility later on but is not a necessity. \n\nThat\u2019s it really, so if you like the idea of adventuring with me to the hidden crevices of the old world, just PM. Bye for now!",

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n \u2022 I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n \u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n \u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n \u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\n \u2022 Real Life Romance\n\n \u2022 Fantasy\n\n \u2022 Sci-Fi\n\n \u2022 Mecha\n\n \u2022 Halo\n\n \u2022 Elder Scrolls\n\n \u2022 Destiny\n\n \u2022 Superhero\n\n \u2022 Apocalypse\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon!

            "selftext": " \n\nHi ! You can call me Aku. I\u2019m 18+ and looking for long-term or short-term RP partners, here\u2019s a bit more about my interests :\n\n**Roleplay Type** :\u00a0Mostly romance centered RP but that can be inserted in any plot with a lot of adventures/things happening in general. I just want our two characters to be together at some point. I can play any gender. Also I absolutely love drama, so if you do too, I think we\u2019ll get along well.\n\n**Style :** I only write up to **semi-para**, never more ! You can write as much as you want, but I personally prefer not describing what my character feels, I think it create more surprise and involvment in the rp. I absolutely don't mind you writing multiple paragraphs though ! But don't be dissapointed if I give you a short reply :)\n\n**Fandom/Original**:\u00a0I do both ! My fandoms are\u00a0: Dramatical Murder, No.6, Saga and Boku no hero academia (only OCs for this one)\n\n**What I want:**\u00a0I really want to play a casual and relaxed roleplay (that doesn\u2019t mean the plot will be boring !!), where we can discuss OOC for the plot (or to chat if you want to !) and just have fun. I usually play past third person and like post-apocalyptic, urban fantasy, slice of life and AU worlds which means I can go with a complex or simple plot as long as I like it :D Lately I've been very inspired for a rp with lgbt+ characters and a plot revolving around their struggles with their sexuality/gender ! We can insert this theme in any kind of setting of course.\n\n**Availability**:\u00a0I often ghost and I\u2019m sorry about that. I\u2019m sometimes too busy or simply not in the mood, but I will reply within a few days\n\n**What I want to avoid**\u00a0: I\u2019m pretty open to anything and I can try new things. When we\u2019ll discuss plots I\u2019ll tell you if I don\u2019t like something anyway :) What I totally want to avoid though is godmodding, and people who get angry when I take some time to reply. Apart from this, i\u2019m open to anything. As for smut, I have a couple things I want to avoid, but this can be discussed.",

To start this off, I am very literate 3 paragraphs or more based on the enthusiasm of my partner. I am Female, but choose to play as Male. I also can play Female if my Partner is interested in FxF but I'm most comfortable playing as Male. I hope you're capable of writing at least two chunky paragraphs, and is polite. If you can do that I love you already! I'm keeping things rather brief here, I prefer to message around on Discord and discuss ideas. \n\nCharacter sheets are preferred but if you can't manage one, at least a face claim! Actors, no anime or drawings. I have a few ideas about the Roleplay and what we can do with it. I want this to be Romance, build up to everything. Nothing quickly. I do want you to be able to write literate, and detailed answers. Show me you can be dedicated?\n\nI don't mind smut at all, but if you don't want that you can tell me and we can stray aside from that. If interested, add your name, discord, if you know you can manage literate answers and if you're okay with Nsfw or not, and your triggers because this will be a dark Roleplay.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "When a young DJ came crashing into the music scene, she was bright eyed, bushy tailed and entirely straight edge. Though her lack of drug use never led her to being the death of a party. When she was sober, she made her best music. She knew where she stood on most issues, and she knew she loved other women. While still somewhat taboo, she stood for homosexual equality, even on national and international broadcasts. Needless to say, there was backlash. The company that gave her her chance almost threw her to the wolves to save face, but instead they stood by her and ended up making more money than ever. \n\nThe few years after their little snafu with a lawsuit from a fairly well known club where the owner's wife may or may not have come onto the DJ while she worked, she only grew as an icon in the gay community. The turnouts for her events grew nearly exponentially. Her world tour went over especially well and her company put her up in a penthouse where all her \"friends\" came to party every so often.\n\nTo the viewing world, she was a pretty, straight edge, embodiment of confidence and pride. But behind closed doors, well... needless to say it wasn't quite the same. Her \"friends\" that lived with her pushed her to do worse and worse things. At first, it was just drinking more than she should have. Then it went on to smoking, so now she always has pot in the penthouse. Then sleeping around, now they're trying to get her to do hard drugs. When she tries to argue with them, they threaten to leave. Despite how she appears, she can't stand being alone. Even the idea makes her anxious. The only thing that makes it go away is the girl she chats with regularly. \n\nThe other girl doesn't know that Chrystal is who she is. To her, she's just Cecil, a girl with blue hair, piercings and tattoos that lives her friends in New York. But recently she's been seeming more and more distant. Not for lack of trying, though. \n\nAlright, so the whole idea here is that my character is famous and the people she's surrounded herself with aren't the best. I'm looking to deal with drug abuse and possibly some other dark themes. I don't really have anything set in stone though, so just message me any ideas you may have. ",

            "selftext": "Hi all, I'm Alex 23 from Zurich in Switzerland nice to meet you and thanks for reading my prompt. There'll be some context details and information about what kind of roleplay I'm looking for below, but first the story.\n---\nHer life had been what most girls dreamt of. She was on TV, radio and in the magazines. (She could be a singer or actress.) She was her own woman, made plenty of money and never found herself lonely for long. All in all, ever since she had moved to the city from the sleepy town in Ohio that had been her childhood home, everything had worked out exactly like she\u2019d always imagined as a kid. She was about to leave her stylish new apartment to give and interview when the phone rang and her life changed forever.\n\n**For an alternative role look at the bottom of the post!**\n\nHer parents and her sister had gone. Car accident. Drunk driver. As she slumped back into her chair and tried to process, she phased out for a moment. When she managed to gather her thoughts again, she realised the nurse on the phone was asking when she would be able to pick up her niece.\n\nThen it suddenly hit her. Not just the loss of her parents and sister, who, with all their differences, had been beloved to her more than anyone else, but the fate of her sister\u2019s little daughter. The father had never been in the picture and there was no immediate family to take care of her. Selfish as it was, her heart sank when she realised that she would have to be the one to raise her. And when the implications of this on her career slowly dawned on her, she felt sick.\n---\nHe had been all but set for a faulty position. It would have only been a matter of a few more years as a teaching fellow and he would have been put on the tenure track for sure. Finally, years, no decades of study and sacrifice in the name of academia would have come to fruition. Then, one day, a crying student, accompanied by her friends, had knocked on his office door.\n\nAfter hearing her out, he had, with heavy heart, brought her accusations against her professor, and his indirect superior, before the head of department. He had half known that with the evidence, or lack thereof, the department was likely to try and make it go away. Sure enough, eventually the girl had withdrawn her side of the story and chosen to leave the university, no doubt having been equally threatened and bribed to do so by the higher ups.\n\nWith him, the senior professors were less lenient. Although he knew that they could not truly believe that the girls original account of events had been anything but truthful and that his actions were therefore justified, the formerly accused academics influence was strong and far reaching, When the dust settled he had been let go, with it having been made clear to him that any attempt to continue an academic career would be impossible on account of the reference his former superior would level against him.\n\nAfter a few months of profound self loathing and violent disdain for the academic institutions he had idolised before, he had found himself with a job offer he could not afford to refuse. One of his old professors at a previous school had found him an exceptionally well paid position as a teacher. Though head of English at the prestigious Clarendon Academy for Girls in New York was more than he had hoped for, when he accepted and moved to the city he had left many years ago to come to university, he left behind the passion he had once felt for teaching.\n---\nSo, the idea here is that our two characters meet when yours brings her niece to the school mine now has been working at for a while for a tour. Whether we want to have them interact only through the school at first or whether through some coincidence they might run into each other elsewhere as well, we can discuss.\n\nUltimately they will begin to spend more time with one another, going beyond the relationship of a parent and a teacher. Both their lives have turned out very differently from what they had imagined and maybe they can help each other come to terms with it. Eventually, they may realise they see more in each other than just a fellow should similarly battered by fate and the little girl who has lost her mother might gain back not just a second mom, but also a dad...\n---\nFirst of all if you\u2019ve made it his far, congratulations and thanks for taking the time. Basically I am looking for a partner for a romantic, long-term roleplay. I highly value detail, literacy and high quality prose. My ideal partner would enjoy world and character building with me, as I find it makes for a much more engaging story. Thus, beyond a basic backdrop, I haven't filled in many details about the characters or world.\n\nIf you find the idea presented above interesting, maybe even inspiring, have questions, suggestions, comments or (constructive) criticism please get in touch!\n\nInitially I'd welcome messages on here, but once I've heard from you, I'll happily chat, develop and roleplay on either Discord (my personal favorite), Google Docs or via email.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you\nLove Alex\n\nPS: As usual, the other posts on my account are also always open. Should you find one of them particularly inspiring, we can always discuss it and maybe get something based on that one going.\n---\n**Alternative for your character:**\n\nShe had always had it all figured out. She was always the serious, no bullshit sister, with ambitions and the dedication to work hard for them. She\u2019d spent her high school years studying and busting her ass in extracurriculars while her sister partied and met boys. When she got a full-ride scholarship to go to university out of state, no one was surprised. And then finally she\u2019d left rural Ohio to go and make a name for herself.\n\nWhat followed was what she had always dreamt of. Pre-law, top of her class, law school, her whole life was playing out according to her plans. That is until one day, a few years into her first junior partnership at her dream law firm, she got a call. The moment she picked up her phone, almost out the door to attend a disposition she was hoping to cut her teeth on, her life changed forever.\n",

            "selftext": "Hello role players my name is Hat and I\u2019m here to get as many of you people into our RP Inexplicable Reference to the End of the Story. We have been rocking and rolling for seven years now and we are looking for some fresh new blood.\nOur group is a bit small but it's full of creativity. We run what is basically a science fantasy slice of life adventure group. Breaking it down, science fantasy is kind of like Star Wars, you got your laser guns and space ships, but also mystical magic and arcane stuff. The slice of life comes from everyday bumming around, and adventures come in all forms. From long plots filled with villains (usually me) to monthly primal hunts in alien territories.\n\nThe world is filled with life of all kinds, as we endorse creativity. Play as any number of character types. From gun toting mercenaries, lords of chaos, brilliant builders, wise sorcerers, novice merchants, and more. Species is also unlocked, play as any mix of biological or artificial intelligence. Feel free to choose from our RPs take on the pure magic races such as elves, dwarves, etc. or go nuts and make something crazy and we will add it to our species list.\nThe world is alive with more lore than you could learn in several years and places to explore. From the Lankhmar Empire with its sprawling military control, to the Kingdom of Aurelionus and it's endless moons all chained together with nature.\nSo if you want to join a group of downright morally grey characters just trying to make a living for themselves, then ring the doorbell. It's a big world, so why not explore with friends.\n\nStart in any corner of local reality you wish, and play however it is you want. Go for a more morally upright guardian soldier in the Ultram Alliance ready to fight for freedom and justice, or play as an imperial inquisitor scouring entire worlds in flame for their crimes against the Empire.\nBe a righteous stand up dude or a right bastard it\u2019s up to you. How far you go depends on your drive, ingenuity, adaptability, and intelligence.\nAlso to clarify as there have been some misunderstandigns. This world contains both magic and science in equal mixes. Neither is hard, so don't ask for the molecular structure of arcane. You can get very powerful with both arcane and tech, it just takes time as power comes from time spent active. That means if you spend every day working on things and do that for a month, you beat out the guy who does nothing for six months. As well, we move in real time. That may be a drag but we do it so that characters don't become locked in interactions with people who show up more rarely. One member bless her heart is a Paramedic. Valuable as that is, if you talk to her and had to wait, you would be trapped as she shows up for only a few minutes every couple days due to her work. That means when you leave if the scene goes on, your character will auto pilot to whatever it is you want them to do. Training, research, sleeping, eating, whatever. Please know that it may feel strange or bad, but we have lasted this long so something is working. It's like some games, the start sucks the most, but get past that and it becomes a lot more fun. Like Warframe. Or getting addicted to League of Legends.\n\nPlease not we are most active from 8-1 central time. We sometimes have intermittent RP through the day but it\u2019s not regular by any means. We are willing to accept people worldwide but if you are in a time zone that makes regular activity easy in our prime RP times I cannot guarantee you will get as much out of the RP as others.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note combat is a fairly large part of the RP. We have a fairly significant plot coming up involving a war for a very strategic system. While utility and slice of life characters have their place it\u2019s important prospective recruits have a main character that is combat viable.\n\nStill if you are just looking for a good RP we would still love to have you and get you into our little group. We have lots of lore, most do after several years but have the big stuff summarized in a dedicated lore tab and player. What topics get extra attention for recording are decided by the community, and even more detailed info can be found on our google drive. If you are worried about having a lot to read, no worries new players are required to only peruse a short five min read in the bare essentials tab.\n\nA note we have a hybrid post length system here, our policy is you dont need 5 paragraphs to open a door but ya sure as hell do the murder a fucker. We like to keep things conversational with 2-4 lines sometimes more for casual conversation. However we do believe in long massive paragraphs for things like combat, character descriptions, land descriptions, plot overviews, lore (ESPECIALLY THIS ONE), well descriptions of important shit in general honestly. \n\nIf that is fine by you we would love to have you. Come on in and join the fun we are eager to meet you all!",

            "selftext": "Salutations bros. Mid twenties guy here looking for an adventure!\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm currently looking for another male partner for a slightly more detailed roleplay fantasy. Someone who is equally invested in character development and stringing together a plot that is both cohesive and collaborative is necessary! Romance and NSFW moments could possibly be elements to flavor the narrative, but not necessary if you're not interested.\n\n\u200b\n\nI currently have three ideas existing in three different settings we could potentially explore.\n\n\u200b\n\nHigh Medieval Fantasy - If you're familiar with any of the worlds within the standard Medieval D&amp;D campaigns, or even Tolkienesque settings, I'd love to delve into an idea revolving a secretive cult of dark elves attempting to seize control of the surface world. Our characters would be agents destined to dismantle their efforts for example. Open to discussing your ideas!\n\n\u200b\n\nSci-Fi - Taking place in a kind of Mass Effect setting, our characters could be space explorers or pirates, traveling different star systems, establishing trade or discovering contact with new species etc... I don't exactly have too detailed a plot for this, so I'm open to brainstorming.\n\n\u200b\n\nUrban Fantasy - Heavily inspired by Hellboy or Buffy, this would take place in our modern world that coincides with the supernatural, where fantastical creatures live amongst mankind. Our characters would be paranormal investigators of sorts, actively discovering nefarious plans that threaten the balance between humans and the \"others\".\n\n\u200b\n\nAnd of course, I'm open to any ideas you might have if these don't spark your interest!\n\n\u200b\n\nI would simply ask you work with me in taking equal responsibility with moving the plot. We should both be \"DMs\" or \"GMs\" so to speak, either taking turns or equally introducing scenarios to enrich our characters. 2-3 paragraphs at the very least would be preferable, but this is not a hard rule depending on what is happening. Just don't be a passive participant and everything will be dandy.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis would either take place of PMs, Discord or Email. Just shoot me a message and we can get this show on the road. Happy hunting!",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars are some which quickly come to mind). (Admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am mainly looking for as a partner. And hopefully one who has no limits, like me.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me! And please, do PM. I have yet to get used to that new Reddit chat.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else.

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n- I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\n- Real Life Romance\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- Sci-Fi\n\n- Mecha\n\n- Halo\n\n- Elder Scrolls\n\n- Destiny\n\n- Superhero\n\n- Apocalypse\n\n\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, having graduated from university recently I've found myself with a lot of free time on my hands and would love to start on some involved and interesting roleplays. I'm always interested in starting new roleplays with exciting partners! I've been looking over the summer but I'm still hoping to get some more long term partners.\n\nA bit about myself, I'm a big fan of reading, gaming, movies and writing and find roleplay to fit nicely in as a hobby alongside a most of them. I'm interested in a wide range of genres from science fiction, to more generic fantasy and espionage style roleplay just to name a few. My favourite genre overall is cyberpunk but it is quite niche and very rare to find a partner interested in it, so bonus points if you are! Other genre's / settings I'm interested in are Lovecraftian, Apocalyptic and honestly anything fictional I'm most likely to be interested in it! Just give me your suggestions or idea's and i'll be happy to discuss and see what works for both of us. \n\nI also have numerous prompts on my profile, but they all lean more to an adult setting. I don't mind with our roleplay being more adult orientated or not. I'm fine with either, although I would like the roleplay to be somewhat mature in tone. Any sexual aspect would be depending on your presence.\n\nI'm open to any ideas or discussions, just fire me a PM and we can see if we work out. Hope to hear from you soon!",

Wipe your feet off on the rug and we\u2019ll get you up to date on everything, there\u2019s plenty to be going over, no time for dilly-dally.\u201d**\n\n*Welcome to Los Nirvana Hotel and Dormitory, a strange place known for its mythical occurrences. Originally built to be a simple hotel in the late 1700\u2019s, it would become a home (permanent or otherwise) to the mystical and magical throughout its years of operation; This all leads us to the present day, where you have arrived at it\u2019s doors for one reason or another, personal or otherwise. While widely known around the paranormal community as a congregation for all things strange, it is widely overlooked by the not-so paranormally inclined as just another strange building. With that and other such safeguards in place to shy away curious investigators, it\u2019s only natural that you yourself have some sort of paranormal or otherwise odd ability. You might have problems coming to terms with your abilities, even as a teenager or adult, but you\u2019ll soon see that there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed or scared of...these things are only natural in our world, afterall.* \n\nLos Nirvana Hotel is a Discord-based RP surrounding the historic and magical Los Nirvana Hotel and Dormitory, a place home to teenagers and young adults that are a lot more than just gifted. Characters can interact with each other on a regular basis (when you want to RP, you can!), with larger stories and plotlines to be GMed to further the progress of characters and their development. Characters relationships to their past, the world around them, and other residents of the hotel shape the world of Los Nirvana; Which is always changing and shifting.\n\nLos Nirvana tries to create an environment of balance, where there is light there is dark, but in some cases there will be serious overtones in an otherwise light-hearted game outside of character interactions. With the secrecy of the hotel and it\u2019s residents, there comes a price to pay, just like everything else in life. While the hotel may be a safe haven for the magical, paranormal, and just downright strange, this does not guarantee that everything will be sunshine and rainbows for them. There will be good times, and there will be bad times, regardless of your character or their situation.   \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/GXPaK6t](https://discord.gg/GXPaK6t)",

I'm looking for a partner who would be interested in a long term Discord rp!\n\nPlots: **I have an OC I'd like to use already!**\n\n- I pretty much stick to these main genres: Realistic/Modern, Crime, and Star Wars (any era)\n\n- I don't have a problem with NSFW/Romance if it's built up and in the story! Please don't push it on me, chances are that I'll get bored and leave.\n\n- I enjoy crime RPs as my OC is a criminal in the Realistic world, but any pairing will do, not just criminal x criminal. I really do enjoy law enforcement x criminal too!\n\n- SW wise, I'm down for anything and any era! This is my favorite genre too!\n\n- I don't do Fantasy or Sci Fi other than SW.. sorry!\n\nRules:\n\n- Please please please be literate!\n\n- I tend to write longer posts, especially in the beginning\n\n- I do have a busy schedule, but I try to reply every day as much as I can! I'm very patient, so I hope someone else is too\n\n- Please write in 3rd person! I can't really work with 1st person.\n\n\n\n- Communication is important and I'm flexible with ideas! I kind of plan ahead but not a lot to limit the story completely.\n\n- NSFW/Romance is welcome, but please build it up\n\n- I tend to play my characters realistically, which might involve some darker themes.\n\n- Common sense is the best rule!\n\n- ***I only use Discord*** and making your own servers for RP might make me reply a bit slower (I tend to have notifications off for servers since I'm in so many..), but I'll do either!\n\nI'm very open to ideas, suggestions, plots, pairings, and well, anything.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone - trying this again after another unfortunate hiatus. I'm sorry if I ended up \"ghosting\" if you contacted me before. Life got a bit crazy, but things have calmed down and I'm ready to dive back in. The following is a search request I posted before, but it all still rings true. One thing I'd like to say before you keep reading is that I don't do one-liners! If your idea of an \"advanced RPer\" is \"at least a paragraph,\" I'm sorry, but I'm not the partner for you. I'm not saying we need to crank out a novel in each post. But, a paragraph per post doesn't cut it. \n\nWith all that being said, I'm definitely looking for a couple solid writing partners to develop some great stories with. My writing style tends to lean toward 'advanced,' even though I feel pretentious saying that. High-casual works for me if that's the level you're at, but I love detail and depth.\n\nI also really love working things out with my partner OOC. I like to think I'm a nice guy, so don't be afraid to reach out with your own ideas or suggestions if we start working together. We'll make it happen.\n\nI try to keep things pretty straightforward, but I do have a few rules I should probably make known:\n\n\\- Please be at least 18 if you want to write together. Some of the RPs I do have adult themes, and even if you're cool with it and super mature (good for you), it makes me uncomfortable.\n\n\\- That being said, please be comfortable with certain adult themes if you're interested in working together. I can cater to different needs. If you're not comfortable with more sensual scenes, we can fade to black. If you don't like cursing, gore, violence, etc., let me know. As for me? I don't have any limits. You'll see that most of my pairings are based in reality. Reality isn't always pretty and certainly doesn't fade to black, so neither do I.\n\n\\- I might risk losing my man card in saying this, but I'm a sucker for a good dramatic romance. I like tension and discord, but two characters that can become passionate about each other and really click can make a great story. That being said, I'm not looking for a love at first sight story.\n\n\\- I know I said it earlier, but I consider myself to be somewhat of an advanced writer. I ask that my partners are at least high-casual. I don't care if there's the occasional misspelled word, and I could give a crap about the Oxford comma. I guess my interest is in length. I'd prefer it if you're able to write at least 4-5 paragraphs per post. I realize in times of heavy-dialogue, this can be different.\n\n\\- I would prefer to RP over Discord, email, or Google Docs, but I'm open to other avenues.\n\nI do have a few ideas in mind, instead of just listing 'pairings,' but if you've been itching to work out a plot of your own, I'd love to hear that too. Thanks - looking forward to hearing from you!",

While our site offers a one-of-a-kind searchable database with hundreds of members to browse with their likes and dislikes posted for all to see, our Discord has become a storytelling portal and a community effort. Our mission may be to connect people around the world and let their creativity shine, but for the last year, our Discord has grown into something more.\n\nOur server offers both one-on-one and group advertisements to help you find your perfect partner, as well as a whole section of writing help channels to encourage you to become the writer you've always wanted to be. We boast useful sources, writer's block busters, and a section to ask your burning writing questions where someone is always around to answer! In addition, we post a daily question to make you think about your characters, your writing style, and how you tackle a story. As a perpetually active server, there's almost always someone around to chat with, bounce ideas off of, or relax from a stressful day.\n\nDon't believe us? We asked our members what their favorite parts of RPC were:\n\n\"The friendly community, post-a-plot, and the way the list is set up is my favorite!\" \n\"The community is the best part. Everyone is really nice.\" \n\"I enjoy how welcoming everyone is, and helpful as well.\"\n\"Post-a-plot is a great way to get a new idea, and there's plenty of writers to indirectly learn from.\"\n\"The community itself is my favorite part, even though I do like thinking over the questions of the day.\" \n\"It's crystal clear that RPC is a very loving commuity where there's a place at the table for everyone!\"\n\n\u2728 https://discord.gg/A476RXk \u2728",

            "selftext": "Hi there, This is a group dedicated to creating a fun and welcoming environment for all roleplayers. I want this roleplay to offer plenty of opportunities to its players to help create and shape the world around them for the sake of creating a fun and interesting story. Below, you'll find a bit of lore to help situate you so you can get a general feel of how things go down on this server:  \n*\" In a small and quaint town basically forgotten (or at least overshadowed by all the other ones) deep in the heart of Utah, everyone seems to know each other's name and its so safe that some people can even sleep without having to so much as lock their door. However, this town is known for something else amongst its residents, as is the rest of the world at this point that sets it apart from our own: mythological creatures. You see, in this world, creatures big and small truly do exist and finally decided to make themselves known to the humans. However, there is one small catch: they aren't exactly liked by humans. Humans have always been top of the food-chain, they've always been able to adapt and overcome any challenges that they've faced as a species. Now that these \"mythos\" as they often refer to them as have come into their lives, they see them as simply another issue that is meant to be adapted to and overcome.*\n\n*The mythos tried to be nice to the humans, they wanted to basically be like neighbors with them. However, humans were fearful of them. Things soon escalated and now it's a bit cultural split between mythos and humans. The mythos are now essentially treated like second-class citizens if they so much as step foot into a human town or city. Some, are even captured as slaves and forced to serve under the oppressive rule of humanity. Things have even gotten to the point where anti-mythos departments have been establish for the sake of \"protecting the people from the threat of the unknown\" as they so claim.*\n\n*Of course, there are a few unspoken rules that applies to humans. For example, the dense forest that surrounds the forest is to be left alone. Any human that so enters it could potentially face certain death.*\n\n*Now, here we are. Be you mytho or human, you still have a life to live. Whether you try and create peace between the two opposing groups or instead prefer to keep old values intact and destroy all who oppose you is a choice all your own.\"*\n\nIf this is appealing to you in the slightest, please feel free to drop by and say hello! Hope to see you soon! Remember, this RP changes along with whatever decisions the characters of this RP make. I only jump in if things begin to get out of hand. Otherwise, everything is up to you guys.  \nThe link to the server: [https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw](https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw)",

            "selftext": "Good day! I'm looking for an RP partner and a friend to develop a sci-fi plot I've had in my head for a while now. But first of all, a little bit about me since I'm new here and what I look for in a partner. I'm 23 years old, I've been role-playing for almost eight years, and English is my second language. I can still articulate it properly, or so I hope! Some English natives would be ideal to further practice the language.\n\nI'm looking for a longterm discord partner if possible, to do this plot and hopefully many others when the inspiration arrives or when this one grows dull for any of us. I usually prefer synchronous RP, as in, both partners posting at the same time to keep the motion going back and forth (usually with as most as 15mins between answers). No need to find  an opportune time either, just when we're both online and we want to! There's nothing wrong with asking. In this type of posting, I prefer one or two paragraphs of length, nothing too complicated but descriptive enough for a quick back and forth. It can be asynchronous now and then, if we both have busy schedules.\n\nNow, the plot! (it's inspired by a mix of Alien and Mass Effect)\n\nThe Leviathan is a Spaceship that on the year 2283 finally left the Solar System to do the job it was assigned to do. It's a marvel of technology, almost a space station with movement, able to carry over 600 people (both passengers and crew included). It's a military ship with the task to explore and rescue, equipped with weapons suited for short scuffles but not for full-on fights. It carries a few shuttles to descend with a small crew on planets and/or stations.\n\nHumans have already expanded through the universe, although with little control and with  almost complete freedom once the manufacturers managed to cheapen the  costs of spacecrafts: Miners, mercenaries, pirates and entrepreneurs  started to fill the systems closest to Earth. No life has been detected outside Earth yet, except some Bacteria fossils on Mars.\n\nYour character, OC to your taste made for this plot, would be a xenobiologist  (or just part of the ship's crew, who happens to be a fan of  extraterrestial life in general) assigned to the Leviathan. The plot would start developing once the ship receives a rescue signal from a mining colony and a group goes to investigate in a shuttle, your character included... my own would be revealed later on and I'd guide the NPCs around yours until then. Then we can split responsabilities.\n\nWhat's  expected? A humanoid yet man-eating alien, interspecies romance, adventures in space, drama, maybe some subtle gore (to make some scenes stronger), and the thrill of discovery. We can discuss more on PM!\n\nPS: No. The \"Alien\" from \"Alien\" won't be here.\n\nPS2: Yes. Both males and females allowed, romance is a bit part of the plot though.",

I\u2019ve finally been able to watch season five of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and once again I\u2019ve found myself wanting to write in this world. I\u2019m craving some new Roleplays with some old characters. Mostly I\u2019m interested in playing Bobbi Morse against Lance Hunter because I am a die-hard Huntingbird shipper. With the perfect combination of angst, tension, and fluff, How can you not love them? \n\nI am open to doubling with characters if they aren\u2019t the ones you\u2019re dying to plot with at the moment, but for now they are who I\u2019m craving to play and who I actually have plots for, which are listed below. \n\n\nPlots\nPlot 1: Playing out Bobbi and Hunter\u2019s life before the events of AoS. How they met, the drama and tension between their marriage, missions they went on, etc.\n\nPlot 2: Playing out the events after season 2 episode 21 when Bobbi is kidnapped and leading up to her and Hunter\u2019s departure from the team, as well as what happens after.\n\nPlot 3: Playing out whatever happens with Bobbi and Hunter after Hunter breaks Fitz out of prison in season 5 episode 5. \n\n\nSome info about me\n- I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+\n- I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply\n- I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out\n- I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does\n- I would prefer literate partners\n\nLike I said, I am definitely open to doubling or even you playing other characters besides Hunter if you are interested. (NOTE: the one character I WILL NOT play with or against is Grant Ward. Just not something I can get behind.) Please PM me or comment if you\u2019re at all interested in playing in this world! ",

            "selftext": "So I've recently been feeling like doing a Noragami RP and I do kinda have a plot idea I wanna use for the RP. So here it goes I guess....\n\nAfter a horrible car accident Hiyori and her family got into Hiyori sadly didn't make it. Yato in grief and wanting to have Hiyori around makes her his shinki. Hiyori now being dead and not remembering her past adventures with Yato how will she adjust to being dead? And how will Yato and Yukine help her adjust to her new life?\n\n\nI just need someone to be Yato. I can be both Yukine and Hiyori if you wish but if wish to be both Yato and Yukine be my guest. We can also work out if we want the other characters in this RP. You don't need to be extremely literate or detailed I just wanna see if this story can work out. I'm 15 so I don't have an age limit. If you change your mind or don't wanna do this or don't feel like this will work out do not ghost me. Just tell me I won't make you do something you don't wanna do. I'm in EST just to let you be aware. I'm good with either Discord or email but with the school year coming up for me next week I can't promise I'll be completely active on discord but we'll see. I'm also looking to make a friend with my partner and obviously someone to talk about Noragami with.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading to the end and PM me if interested!",

            "selftext": " \n\nThe world of 2099 is one of binaries. Ones and zeros, poor and rich, light and shadow, life and death. \n\nMassive private companies called Megacorps run the world and have tricked most of the population into willing slaves, chained by poor living conditions, low wages, and oppressive law enforcement. All people are born, all people work, all people die and Megacorps would like to keep it this way.  Most cities have become battlegrounds between the Megacorps though, trying their best to squeeze every square inch of land and every person dry for everything they\u2019re worth. Of course there are those who work beneath the skin of the cities.\n\nOrganized crime groups are the second level of control and although they might not work you until you die, they\u2019ll happily shoot you between the eyes and steal from you instead. Most people try to stay away from unsavory groups like these but if you\u2019re careful and have something worth the time, crime can make you rich.\n\nBeneath organized crime are the street gangs who murder each other for every meter of blacktop they can so they can claim ownership. It\u2019s a fruitless endeavor because nobody has the money to pay for \u201cprotection\u201d and every couple of weeks another gang kills the last but maybe a short life of violence is better than the alternative. \n\nAt the bottom is everyone else. The people who refuse to play into the groups that control the streets, the money, and the city. It\u2019s hard to survive with all the world pressing down on you but people survive. It\u2019s instinct and in this world of synthetic bodies and virtual joy maybe instinct is all we have left.   \n\n\nBut yea just message me and we can discuss. I already have a good amount of the setting planned out but it's always up for change.",

            "selftext": "Hey! \n\nThis is basically a shout-out post to anyone who is willing to RP. I use Discord primarily. I understand the fact that most people already have an established RP group or partners that they write with and the last thing I want to do is interfere. I understand if people just ignore this and don\u2019t reach out. I get it. Writing with someone new is always challenging at first as you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like. It\u2019s easier to write with those that you\u2019ve come to know really well and made friends with. And there\u2019s also the fact that I have anxiety and I\u2019m terrified of approaching people and annoying them. \n\nSo this is why I\u2019m making this post instead and anyone can reply or drop me a message if they\u2019re interested! \n\nBasically looking for anyone willing to RP with my Pepper Potts. I have a good few years RP experience and have used various sites though things have slowed to a halt for me to the point where I don\u2019t RP much these days except with one person. I use various apps as well and that can be discussed to choose whichever is preferable. I\u2019m honestly very laid back when it comes to RP and I\u2019m fine with most concepts as long as both of us are comfortable. And of course, having fun! \n\nWhile I don\u2019t mind writing some NSFW I do prefer actual storytelling and working on a plot. I\u2019m also from the UK, 21+ and I\u2019m fairly quick on replies. Though replies will be slower during the week while I\u2019m at work. I do prefer para/multi para to one liners. \n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid to contact me! I\u2019m the least threatening person ever. If you are interested just let me know and we can discuss further! All I\u2019m looking for is having fun, making sure whomever I write with is comfortable and also having fun, and making new friends along the way. \n\nI hope to write with some of you soon. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

Little about me, ive been roleplaying for about 5 years plus, i prefer first person but am wiling to do other.\n\nSo the roleplay idea is that you are an attacking war lord, to keep the peace or to just be a prize. how this works is up to you, either i can be used for pleasure, used to breed and make a air, or you can fall in love with me and show me off to the world.\n\nI am open to NSFW and have very few limits. Hope to hear soon x",

My question is, how do I convey the sheer psychological shock that would receive someone seeing three massive helicopters flying at them? How can I convey that emotion one would feel as Police cars rush to a scene, as the SWAT team breaks into a house, the crackling voice of the Sergeant yelling \"Police Department, coming in!\" before the door blasts open? I've always found my scenes end up feeling a little bland even though I consider myself a pretty good writer. Halp pls.",

I'm the most used to DM style formats, but I don't really want to do that exclusively. If I'm not challenging myself to grow by playing outside of what I know, then what's the point of trying something new? That's pretty much it for limitations. I'm open to trying anything at least once!\n\nAll in all, I'm hoping to find someone to help introduce me to this style of roleplaying and help me experience some fun, new things!

I'm going back down the Mass Effect rabbit hole, and I would like to DM a story for someone! I like to keep these short, as much as I can, but I will reply several times throughout the day, in third person, and ask that if you can't respond to me several times in a day, then please move on. It's nothing personal, I just can't care much about a story if I can't make a fair amount of progression everyday. That being said...\n\nI am an adult and, as one might expect, Mass Effect includes adult themes. We can discuss this further but it's a mature universe, so expect plenty of blood, gore, and horror (and Asari). I typically respond with at least 400 words in a response and although I don't ask that you respond to me with a similar length, I just need to know you're putting in effort!\n\nAs a DM, I don't mind incorporating other RPG aspects (rolling, consequences, death, etc), so please feel free to bring that up if it interests you!\n\nThe final mandatory request I have is that your character doesn't start out as space jesus, as you do in the video games. Your character will not be Shepard, a spectre, an elite soldier, or something else. Your character is who you choose they are, but the fun of being able to explore a universe is being able to rise from the depths. If you want to become a god amongst men, 'ya gotta earn it!\n\nIf you're interested, we can discuss more in PM's or on discord :) Please tell me a bit about yourself, if you have any concerns or questions, and I'll do the same!

After all adult characters have passed.  \n\nPandora hasn't changed,  vault hunters haven't changed.  Things still seemed to run the way the always have,  and since the defeat of Handsome Jack things seemed to be peaceful.  Well..  As peaceful as they could be on a planet such as this. Peaceful until one by one the six sirens of Pandora started to disappear from the planet.  One remain, and the new guardians of Sanctuary were doing all possible to keep her protected,  and sent out search parties of mercenaries to find the others.  All to no avail.  \n\nNo one seemed to know who or why the sirens were being taken, but it was known that the safety of Sanctuary was in danger,  and remaining Siren was struggling to hold up the shields over the city alone. \n\n~~~~\n\nYou are a mercenary,  one of the many hired to go out on search parties daily to find the other Sirens. You're sent out in teams of five, and after entering a particular bandit city,  something has been plucking off your team.  A Siren.  Or rather..  5. They don't seem to be themselves, they seem to be mindless puppets set out to kill.  After being attacked to near death one of the five drops a recorded message on your dying body, and you black out.  \n\nYou wake up hours later lying in an infirmary bed.  When you open your eyes many of the leaders and head guardians of sanctuary stand around the area talking.  One would spot you and alert the others.  \n\n\n\"Why was six afraid of five?\" It sounded like the voice of one of the missing siren.  \n\n\"Because the five said goodbye\" Another one,  followed by the laughter of multiple. \n\nThe recording cut out for a few seconds before a male voice clicked on.  \n\n\"Bring number six to the bandits in the west, or the five will destroy your Sanctuary.\" \n\nThe recording ended and the people around you explain your duty.  \n\nYou had to escort the last Siren.... \n\n~~~~\n\nOh shit.  You mad it this far, so if this sounded like something you'd be interested in send me a pm and I'll get you my discord info!  \nBut before you do remember\n\n-Must be at least a para role player\n-Must be at least 18 as Borderlands has some darker and NSFW themes.  \n-Must have knowledge of the Borderlands series.  \n\n-K",
