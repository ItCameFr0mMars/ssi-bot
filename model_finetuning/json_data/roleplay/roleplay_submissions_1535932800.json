            "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nI'm 28, female, living in the southern US and I\u2019ve been roleplaying online and writing creatively for about 14 years now. I'm not a professional writer, but I believe I am well spoken and my imagination often runs wild. I have experience in both 1x1s and group RPs, but right now I'm mostly looking for one-on-one world-building. I prefer to write in third person through Discord or email, and I\u2019m more than capable of providing a lengthy response. I do enjoy quick dialogue responses when appropriate and rapid fire often works well for me as I spend much of my work day writing.\n\nI tend to enjoy romantic aspects within the writing that I do. I get plenty of satisfaction from the action and adventure, however I thrive when writing romance, whether it be dramatic, heartbreaking, cruel, etc. I\u2019m not always nice to my characters! With that in mind, I do not expect the main element of the story to focus on this. While I do prefer main characters to become involved, I always include various NPCs and side characters to get as deep into the plot as possible. Violence, language, and sex are themes I do include in most stories. NSFW is fun and I enjoy writing smut scenes too. We can discuss this further if you'd like. Again, I don't expect this to be the sole focus.\n\nSome ideas I've had lately include modern crime, medieval drama, medieval supernatural, modern supernatural, and american West. Feel free to send me a message and we can see if we might be a good match and chat about potential plotlines. \n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": " \n\nGood afternoon everyone. I\u2019m a 23-year-old from Indiana (EST) who is looking for some writing partners who are willing to dabble in fantasy, dystopia, or western. I am able to primarily respond 2-3 times throughout the workday hours (9-5 EST) but I can and will respond in the evening hours as well, albeit at a slower pace. If you can only respond once a day then that\u2019s fine as well, but if so I really hope we can get some beefy responses in so that the plot keeps moving along. Third person paragraph form is a must, there is no negotiating this.\n\nI typically make 300-500 word responses, but I can easily trim these down to 200-300 words if you\u2019re looking for something somewhat faster paced. I do not go below 2-3 paragraphs because I greatly enjoy developing the world, environment, and characters, which I feel needs extra effort. I love, love, love depicting scenes, and find atmosphere to be so important when getting a good moment set up.\n\nWorld building is a lot of fun for me, and I love to engage in it with my partner, but at the same time I\u2019m not looking to DM for someone. I want a partner who is interested in working with me, developing the story with me, and isn\u2019t afraid to throw some wrenches into the plot to keep us both scrambling and to keep it fresh. Things aren\u2019t supposed to go smoothly! Let\u2019s have some drama, bloodshed, maybe a little adultery. Oh yeah, this is going to have some adult themes. Death is going to happen. I respect my partners\u2019 wishes when it comes to depth of detail, but heads are definitely going to roll. *This post is marked NSFW because otherwise the bot scoops it up and takes it down, but NSFW isn't always required.* \n\nLastly, and importantly for many people, I\u2019m not looking for a buddy off the get go, I\u2019m looking for someone to write stories with and build worlds. If we eventually becomes friends, great!, but I\u2019ll be honest that I\u2019m a bit reserved in ooc discussion until we can get to know each other.\n\nSo, onto the show this is it. I don\u2019t do Fandoms anymore, but if you have a fandom idea you enjoy we can work out an original world with similar themes/magic/etc.\n\n    Genres: Fantasy, Western, Dystopia, maybe sci-fi.\n\n*You* have to approach me with the idea of sci-fi, traditionally it doesn\u2019t do well as a genre for me. Fantasy can be anywhere from High Fantasy to Low Fantasy to grimdark to steampunk. I have a few prompts. Western can also be Weird West if you have any ideas (along the lines of Red Dead Redemption\u2019s Undead Nightmare).\n\n    Pairings: M/F, M/M\n\nI can play both M &amp; F characters, I have no real preference either way, but I prefer to have one primary pair that the rest of the rp revolves around. Having too many characters out in the world gets confusing at times and can cause one set of characters to suffer from neglect.\n\n**Some prompts to work off of:**\n\n    A decade of assault has finally paid off, and the war is about to begin. A scout ventures too close to the other side and is taken captive\u2014will they give in and reveal what they know? Or will they tempt their captor to the other side? Is there a right side in all of this war?\n\nThis can go either way, genders left obviously unspecified so that we can work with that easily. I have ideas for nations, but I left that blank as well in case you were struck with any inspiration.\n\n    They were royalty, assigned one companion at birth to guide them through life as a friend, teacher, and guard. Despite growing up together, they are separated by class and destiny.\n\nVery, very basic. Lots of room to develop genders, characters, and the plot. \u00a0Could be a short story, could be something longer. This will take some work from the both of us to flesh out more, but that's the charm.\n\n    They\u2019ve been hidden in plain sight for a century, but a sudden and unplanned capture has exposed their people. Paranoia and hatred for the unknown suddenly runs rampant, and violence, greed, and corruption now rules. These creatures are blasphemous, and so the ruling religion has sent out allies to enforce the will of their God. The anathema cannot run wild.\n\nMuch more direct, but darker. This would likely be a chase/capture roleplay with violence of all sorts. A happy ending is possible but it would take longer to get to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are in *no way* the only prompts I'm willing to work with, but I know that a lot of people struggle with ideas and need something to start with. These are just a few. ***If you have an idea you want to try just approach me with it***. I'm a big girl and I can tell you if I'm interested in it or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks everyone for sticking through to the end! Start by PMing me and we'll move to discord if that's your preferred method of discussion! \n\n**Send**           \n ",

It's also a story about giant robots, evil corporations, mysterious aliens, ancient horrors and adventure. Does that sound ambitious? It should! I'm offering a long-term, story, world and character development focused roleplay!\n\n*Welcome to Beautiful Views, a city where war is business, a city where life and death are a game. This unique city, spanning across a third of the world it occupies, Robert's Rock, is the home of the most popular and unique entertainment in the galaxy - the Rig Wars. Various 'Rigs' - giant mecha otherwise used in everything from agriculture to, of course, armed conflict - are cast into fierce combat against each other, sometimes one on one, sometimes in teams of various sizes, for the entertainment of the masses. There are many arenas both in the city and in other locations on the planet and the most important matches are broadcast live across the galaxy. The most successful Rig jocks are celebrities and billionaires, and even the lowest tier of fighters live fairly good lives - as long as they are ready to enter the arenas again and again. But all of them have one thing in common - their next match could be their last one.*\n\n*One of the smaller arenas hosts an interesting duel tonight. A young, up and coming jock, that hasn't dropped a single match yet, is facing a mysterious, also undefeated, opponent - new to Views, but not to combat, a veteran of many wars. Little is known about the combattants' past, except that their skill has been proven time and again. Even though their names aren't high on the leaderboards yet, the match draws considerable attention and good money. Both are seen as future greats - but one of them would suffer the first defeat in the arena tonight. All is not as it seems, though, and only the two combattants know how high the stakes really are.*\n\n(The RP takes place in an OC universe. You may choose either character. We'll work out the details in PM.)",

Here is a simple prompt I would like to use but would enjoy building this world together. I am looking for long-term roleplay with a built up romance, sex, violence and drama.

The place starts to  act as any living being: it can be happy, sad, jolly and so forth.  Though it was an accident, the magicians and warlocks decide to keep it  that way, for it is nice to be able to communicate with the place. It  becomes a guide to where everything is, shortening the amount of time  they need to search something among other things.\n\nThe building is happy when people try and use her to learn things even when she cannot express this in hard words.\n\nAfter  a while though, the magic starts to permeate the books, scrolls and  other kinds of writings as well. The stories start to come to life, and  not everything on paper should be out there. The characters start to  leave the confines of the library soon enough and some are actually  wreaking havoc. Dragons burning down cities and dictators trying to  re-establish their powers, it is all happening.\n\nNow, the magical community must find a way to not only stop these creatures but also put them back where they belong.\n\nHow to defeat that which has been written though?\n\nWho could, and would, undertake such a task?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe advised, this RP will *not* be a smut RP, it'll be like PG-16 (is that a thing?).

I do try to match my partner's length but my replies usually fluctuate between 300 - 1,500 words.\n\nI do enjoy plotting and world-building (any headcanons regarding androids/life after the revolution etc. are more than welcome!) but I'm also more than able to jump into a RP with minimal planning beforehand. I'm mostly comfortable with purely Gen RPs or MxM pairings. I won't do smut and I'm comfortable playing multiple characters if wanted (although it's not necessary).\n\nThe frequency of my replies can vary a lot but if I don't reply for a long time it's perfectly okay to message me again! I'm a pretty patient person so it's perfectly all right if it takes you some time to get back to me.\n\nI mostly RP via Discord, but I've also done RPs via e-mail, GoogleDocs and tumblr before (and would again, if you prefer those). I'm willing to try any other site/app that I can access from my PC (since I'm a very slow typer on my phone :D).\n\nAlso, I'm practically always looking for new partners so even if you read this ad some time in the future and are unsure whether you should contact me or not, just go ahead!\n\nNow, here's what I'm specifically looking for when it comes to D:BH:\n\nHank &amp; Connor (platonic/non-romantic) : I'm more comfortable playing Connor but I would also be willing to play Hank. I'm more than happy to RP all sorts of scenarios (keep in mind that I don't ship them, please). I think a RP set after the revolution would be interesting, maybe with Connor struggling to adjust to deviancy and Hank helping him but I'm also open to other ideas. Maybe something canon-divergent? Or Hank and Connor meet in some other way?\n\nHank &amp; Connor &amp; Connor &amp;... : This is a very specific idea and something that would require both of us playing multiple characters. Basically, I would like to see Hank sort of 'adopt' all the Connors we see in the game, so OG Connor, RK800-60 and RK900, maybe even a fourth Connor? I'd also be open to shipping one of them with Gavin or maybe Markus as a side-plot (but it's not necessary).\n\nConnor x Gavin: I know this isn't a very popular pairing but I would love to do something with these two, they are probably my OTP for this fandom. I can play either of them. I'm open to all sorts of plots or we can make up something together.\n\nM!Android OC x M!Human OC: I have a slight preference for playing the android character but if you already have an idea for this I'm more than happy to play the human one instead.\n\nWhat I haven't tried but would be willing to:\n\nRK900 x Gavin: For that I would have a slight preference for playing Gavin since I haven't tried playing RK900 before but I would be willing to play RK900 if you want to take Gavin.\n\nConnor x Markus: I would prefer to play Connor for this one. I think something set after the revolution would be very interesting.\n\nM!Android OC x M!Android OC: This one really depends on the plot. If you have one that you want to play I will certainly consider it!\n\nRalph x ??? / Daniel x ??? / HK400 x ??? :I'd love to give these side characters some love as well, this can be a more complex plot with multiple characters or just two characters (either romantic or platonic).\n\nGeneral things I like:\n\nI do love angst and hurt &amp; comfort (as long as there's a happy ending eventually!). I'm alright with most themes apart from outright smut. I also love RPs that focus on the characters, how they evolve and interact with each other and I'm also interested in expanding on the world of D:BH, like making up more detailed explanations for how androids work or just sort of detailing what Detroit will look like after the revolution, what sort of laws will be passed and how society will slowly change. I'm really in love with writing about character's inner struggles, especially characters like Connor who I imagine struggles a lot with his own deviancy and has probably internalised a lot of the things humans say about androids. Connor is my favourite character so I'll be willing to play him against other characters even if I haven't mentioned them here.\n\nSettings: pre-/post revolution, canon-divergent plots or AUs in which there are still androids but maybe there's no revolution at all or characters meet in a different way\n\nI'm happy to hear whatever plot you have in mind or we can come up with something together, I'm pretty flexible when it comes to that!\n\nThank you for reading! &lt;3",

It would be focussing on an adventure with lots of romance, with our two characters against the world, forbidden love or even just exploring the world together! There will be action as that is what i love to write and i think that I excell at it. In the slower periods with no action, there will be romantic scenes (which i also love to write) or high tense yet non-action based scenarios.\n\nI would love for this to take place in universes from games, an examples being the Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem or other fantasy based games. If you have any other ideas of worlds/timeframes that you want to have our RP take place in, please let me know!\n\nAs per the way I RP, it may get a little NSFW so just keep that in mind. Though we wont get to that would discussing it prior.\n\nThe Characters we would play would be OCs of sorts that fit in the universe. This would be like a Ylissian Mage or a Zora Soldier.\n\nWe would be doing this via Reddit PMing or Discord so I can't wait to see some orange envalopes in my mailbox today and I hope we can write great RP together!\n\nThanks for Reading!\n\n-Chris",

I'm still not going away~\n\nToday, I'm looking for a GxG, Female to Female, or whatever you may call it, romance focused RP to polish off one of my old characters.\n\nSince I have a predetermined character, I'll give a quick explanation of who she is and everything-\n\nLilli, my character, is a young reptile-human hybrid. 15 years old, she had spent most of her life hidden away the public, in a lab, only recently having been moved to living in a small house, in the middle of the woods. Despite not being used to average people, and not being allowed near them either, she's a rather social and friendly girl, though having periods of anxiety in some situations.\n\nAs you can see, she's a bit young. I'm okay with pairing her with characters a bit older than her, I do love a good age gap, but would prefer a character closer to her age.\n\nAnyways~\n\nPlot, I want to assemble with my partners, though I have a minor, basic idea.\n\nI follow a book-style, third person, paragraph-per-reply style, and expect the same, or similar, of my partners.\n\nAnd my rules, I usually want to avoid romance to take over the roleplay, but right now I WANT that, so, yeah. My partners rules I can usually easily comply with.\n\nInterested?\n\nGood.\n\nI heavily prefer to roleplay over Discord, but am open to using any other apps.",

            "selftext": "THE NFL IS BACK! No better way to get back into the swing of things with an NFL themed roleplay. I hope you message me back letting me know you are interested. We need to talk about a few things in this role before we get going. I love using photographs for faceclaims, outfits, settings, etc.\n\nThis role takes place in Las Vegas, the Bandits (Las Vegas\u2019s successful football team) made it all the way to the league championship last year, but lost. It was an exciting run but they just were not a complete enough team. Shortly after the game, the long-time team quarterback retired. A void needed to be filled.\n\nThis role is centric on my character, Rickie Bonds, who is a young, up and coming quarterback. Rickie was drafted this year in the first round to come and play for the team. The pressure on him to deliver has been off the charts but he has conducted himself very professionally. Off season practices, mini camp, preseason games.. he has shown a tremendous amount of potential and the city in a buzz.\n\nWith Rickie here, his personal life has come into the spotlight more. Most assumed a young, 23 year old would be single and eligible but in college, Rickie got engaged to his long time highschool sweetheart. She\u2019s \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cpretty\u201d.\n\nWhere you come in is you have the option to play some females in Rickie\u2019s new NFL life. I want to leave you some options here to get you own creative mind flowing.\n\n1.\tCheerleader \u2013 clich\u00e9? Sure, but don\u2019t deny how exciting it is. The life of an NFL quarterback means long hours at the football stadium in the gym, in meeting, studying film\u2026 someone has to keep him company.\n2.\tSports Reporter \u2013 Since Rickie has done everything perfectly since getting drafted, the whole city is excited and media members are all over the young hunk. Including sports reporters who are desperate for all the exclusives.\n3.\tOwner\u2019s Daughter \u2013 The owners of NFL Teams are members of an exclusive wealthy club, the daughter of the owner of the Vegas team would certainly be used to getting whatever she wants\u2026\n4.\tCome up with your own idea!\n\nI have years and years of playing experience. I look for longer posts to get us started and then typically do paragraph responses as we get into the play. \n\nThe way I see it, details are what matter most here. Since we can't physically see or touch one another, I need to be able to feel you through your writing - and you'll certainly feel the same from me.\n\nHope to hear from you soon! Xx Daniel\n",

            "selftext": "Salutations, everyone! I hope all of ya'll are doing swell. I know we're all here looking for someone spectacular to tell great stories with, so I won't waste your time. Let's get straight to the good stuff. \n\nSome stuff about me:\n\n* GENERAL: I'm 24, female, and located in the U.S., Central Standard Time. In addition to writing, I enjoy reading, anime, video games, horror movies, working out, and the outdoors. I'm also a huge dog person. \n\n* CHARACTERS: I play a lot of very different characters. Generally I have a select number of pre-made characters that I developed while writing in previous role-plays or stories, but if the plot calls for it, I'm not opposed to creating an entirely new character. I do like to use face-claims, but if that's not your cup of tea, than I understand. \n\n* ROMANCE: I LOVE love. I love to read it, I love to watch it, I love to write it. I honestly can't remember the last time I did a role-play without romance of some degree. Of course, romance doesn't need to be the main point of our story - that would get a little boring even to me - but I definitely prefer it to be present. For couples, I prefer M/F, but I'm not opposed to M// or F//. For smut, I'm fine writing it for the former, but the latter two I prefer to fade-to-black, only because I have precious little experience writing it. I also DOUBLE.\n             ****I've had this problem in the past which is why I'm adding a note about it here: if we are doubling with two M/F couples, you will not catch me writing 4 paragraphs for my female character and 2 for my male. I LOVE writing my male characters just as much as my female ones, so you'll always get just as much detail for them as my ladies. All I ask in return is that you do the same for me. Otherwise, it feels like one half of our RP has these two awesome, well-developed characters and the other half has one developed character and one paper cut-out. \n\n* GENRES: I'm open to just about anything, although fantasy, sci-fi, crime, and horror tend to be favorites of mine. I do have a few plot-bunnies floating around as well that I'd love to share and build on.\n\n* FANDOMS: Although I'm writing this post with originals in mind, I am open to fandom role-plays! Some of my favorite series include: Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Tyranny, Final Fantasy XV, Mystic Messenger, My Hero Academia, &amp; Attack on Titan. There are others, so if you have something specific in mind, just ask!\n\n* WRITING PREFERENCES: I only role-play through email or Google docs. I do have Discord + Google chat, and I don't mind chatting there for planning and OOC conversation but I'm not a fan of writing on messengers as a whole. Style wise, I prefer third person, paragraph style, either past or present tense. I tend to be a little lengthy with my posts sometimes, but on average I usually give you about 2-4 paragraphs. Often times I try to mimic what my partner's given me. I love writing with people who really put a lot of thought and detail into their posts so that it reads like a novel, and that's how I aim to make my writing as well.\n\n* AVAILABILITY: I work full-time, however, only have to do half-days on Fridays. This means I work extra hours Monday - Thursday to make up the time difference. So needless to say I tend to be pretty tired on those four days. That isn't to say I'm totally unavailable, but don't count on a bunch of posts from me. My best days for role-playing are definitely gonna be Friday - Sunday. If our RP really has me hooked, you'll probably get multiple replies a day from me, whereas the rest of the week I would say one post a day or one post every other day is pretty typical. So if you're looking for a partner who's pretty active but not blowing your email up every other minute, I'm your gal.\n\n\nAnd what I'm looking for:\n\n* Must be 18+, preferably over the age of 21.\n* Must be friendly, &amp; although OOC chat is not required, it is preferred.\n* Must be willing to play multiple characters.\n* Must be open to doubling.\n* Remember that not about writing equally for your characters? Please do that if we're doubling! \n* Must have decent grammar + spelling.\n* I don't mind if you're a fade-to-black or smut-loving person. Either way is fine.\n* On that note, I won't do RPs that revolve around smut.\n* Not picky about post frequency. You respond a few hours after I've send my post your way? Awesome! You respond a couple times a month? Also awesome! All I ask is that, for unusually prolonged absences, you shoot me a message to let me know. \n\nI think that about wraps it up, so if I've managed to secure your interest, please shoot me a PM!\n",

            "selftext": "# Introduction and Rules\n\nHello everyone! I am a 26 year old woman living in Canada, and I have been roleplaying for the better part of 17 years. I have a few roleplay preferences. **First**, I like about 1-3 paragraphs per post, and prefer quality over quantity. In the heat of fervant replies, posts may become shorter, but should be no less descriptive. **Secondly**, I am not strict about how frequently you post, but I prefer a few times per week. I live a very busy life (full time school, part time job, and two part time volunteer positions atop a social life). I cannot post every day. My favourite way to play is to schedule certain \"online\" times with my partner which allows us to reply to each other live, but this is not necessary and not always feasible. **Third**, age is important to me. I am 26, and my partners must always be over the age of 18, with no exceptions. **Fourth**, respect is key in our engagement. I will respect your boundaries, and you will respect mine, and we will consider these boundaries as subject to change at any time. **Fifth,** while I enjoy exploring sexualized relationhips and scenarios, I employ a fade-to-black method. **Sixth**, and finally, we are both here to have fun. If we lost interest, or stop having fun, let's discuss it. Open communication is absolutely key to success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Artist's Muse\n\nA wealthy **artist** lives in the historic setting of either **(The Edo Period, Japan), (the early 1900s England), or (1920s Canada).** He is enchanted by a young woman far beneath his station. Perhaps he comes from a wealthy merchant family, or even aristocracy. Either way, this woman does not represent idealized womanhood in his society. She is either a **(maid), (a geisha), or (an actress).** He is taken by her, and insists on using her as his muse, which develops into an unhealthy romantic relationship. They are both hypervigilant as his **wife** is always around the corner, her duty as a mother and woman threatened by this new addition to his life.\n\nThe themes I'd like this roleplay to explore are as follows:\n\n* Class difference\n* Gender expectations\n* Taboo sexual relationships\n* The power dynamics associated with artist/subject\n* Abuse of power by an artist\n* Love in unexpected places\n\nAs usual, I am entirely open to suggestions! I'd happily work in a particular time period if it suits you better than those listed above, and am flesible if you have an idea you'd rather explore. Remember rule six, communication is key!\n\nPlease contact me in the comment section or through private messaging.",

It's my second year here at University, my grades are above average and I'm fast tracking myself to a brilliant career once I finish school which only fuels my thirst to get my degree and move on to bigger and better things.\n\nLast week it was all over the news, some kind of super Flue, only a few reported cases, nothing to panic about so business went on as usual. As the weeks went on more people fell victim, lecture halls that fit 80 students were dwindling down to less than half that, some professors fell I'll and canceled class for the semester all together. What makes this situation even more strange, is that as the sickness spreads there's less and less coverage on any forms of media. News stations have stuck to reporting weather and mindless bullshit or gone off the air completly, internet signal has been spotty at best as well and we are starting to have regular power outtages.\n\nAfter my fourth class was canceled for the semester I became a recluse, I only leave my dorm room to scavange and look for food or hell even some form of human contact, I feel like I'm going insane in this place. I think I'm going to leave town soon, see if the disease has spread to other towns, it's better than sitting in here waiting to die..\n\nHello!

            "selftext": "Greetings! Today I'm looking for anything related towards superheroes. It can be a little shifty and much to explain, bare with me yeah?\n\nOne of the first ideas, we create OC characters from scratch. (No Gods, or PowerPlay or anything related to Peter Parker/Spider-Man) We would give them powers, and slowly create a story. Using Canon villians, or even ones we create if you're interested in using a villian that way. We build a relationship with our characters and the community they're in, whether in Marvel or DC. I would like this to be a serious Roleplay. Also, Your character can be anyone, anti hero, villian, hero or even recently discovering who they are. \n\nThe second is more simple, we can have canon characters paired with another canon character or even an OC you may have. I am fine with MxF or MxM! I Roleplay Thor, Starlord, T'Challa, Sabertooth, Steve Rogers (wanting to learn) and a few others. I have experience with the first three mostly. We would create a relationship in time as well, and it would be after Thanos or before. With DC, I Roleplay Green Lantern, Beast Boy (especially) Green Arrow, and some of the Robins. Anything goes here!\n\nAll I ask is literacy, and delightfully dedicated responses. Something you can think about and put effort into. I would rather no smut happening 24/7, Your message, can be your discord, and the first or second idea. And something about yourself and what you look to do. If you survived this long, message me in on Discord!\n\nLooking forward to meeting with you lot~",

One, whom we know as Cyiss or the Crafter, was formed on the surface and acted as a force of creation for the new world, using her powers over the elements fire, water, earth, wind, and energy to transform Mora from it's original desolate state to the beautiful world we know it as today and to craft the seeds that would grow into the first plants and later the first creatures. Dryfiss, who was born into the Umbra, a realm that existed in the shadow of the overworld,at first worked with his sister, using his powers to carve out canyons and rivers, move plates and raise mountains from below. But as he got older Dryfiss grew jealous of Cyiss. Whilst she ruled over a realm teaming with life and beauty, he only had the bleakness of the Umbra. Eventually his jealousy turned to anger and he began using his powers to terrorize the surface by stirring up storms and shaking the very earth causing landslides and damage to the ecosystems she had made.Eventually the feud between them became so intense that their means of communication, the Link, a non physical connection between their minds was severed. Left without anyone to converse with, Cyiss decided to craft 5 beings in her image that would be intelligent enough to appreciate all she had made and to understand things the way she did. Calling them her Dolls, she gave each a portion of her powers, filled their heads with some of her knowledge, and named them individually Phyra (the elemental of water)Ignitis(fire)Proten(earth)Ismo(wind) and Zant (energy). Happy with her newest invention, she began creating seeds for smaller less powerful versions of them (with some not having powers) and spreading them throughout the overworld where they established settlements, constructing dwellings out of stone mined from the ground and growing food by domesticating Cyiss's earlier creations.For many years Cyiss, who became known as the Crafters by the dolls, lived in peace with her subjects. But, as always, Dryfiss made it his priority to destroy them. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Umbra he began crafting his own entities from the realms dark energy; monsters that would destroy everything in sight. Non physical beings that would possess the bodies of dolls and corrupt and twist their minds turning them into mindless killing machines that would act on any order given to them. Living storms that would raise hellish winds. Yet, in spite of so much against them, with the help of the original 5 (who became known as the Keepers for their efforts) and the Crafter herself they were able to adapts and survive. Proten, aggressive and stubborn would teach the strongest dolls how to fight. Phyra, using her elemental powers would teach them how to use water to heal. Ignitis would teach them all the different uses of fire. Ismo would teach them the importance of meditation, keeping peace in one's mind even in times of disaster and Zant would teach them how to use various materials containing energy to create new Dolls without the crafter and all worked under the leadership and direction of Cyiss herself. When Dryfiss's realized how resilient the Dolls could be he became even more determined to get rid of them and created a giant monster the size of a small mountain and more vicious and powerful the anything he had made before. He called it the Devourer and sent it into the overworld to end the destroy the dolls once and for all. During its rampage the Devourer killed hundred of thousands,leveled settlements, ate through entire forest and flattened entire ecosystems before the crafter, determined to save her creations confronted the beast and focusing all her powers at once destroyed it, burning herself out in the process. When she died as a result, her body froze and became stone like. As a monument to her sacrifice the Keepers and those who had been fighting alongside her carried her body to the place where she had planted the first Doll seed, the Origin as it was called, and built a vast temple around it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Afterwords the keepers were left to pick up the pieces of a Mora in ruins. The Devourer had caused a great deal of damage and even though it had been defeated Dryfiss, determined to take the overworld even more so than before continued to deploy monsters and body snatching darklings into the overworld. Refusing to give up the keepers continued to give what knowledge they could to the Dolls ,and even fought themselves whenever Dryfiss's minion attempted to overwhelm a major settlement. Without the crafter though, they began to age and deteriorate and fearing their would come a time when they would be severely needed but wouldn't be around to help the other Dolls the keepers worked to put in place a governing body they called the Authority. The Authority, with a special Doll called the Arbiter at its head would enforce a hierarchy and system of specialization they put in place in which special dolls called Weavers would take the life thread that contained the essence of living things from preexisting plants and creatures made by the crafter before and after the dolls(some of which had began to physically adapt to the world in their own ways in the crafter's absence) and combine them with the life threads of Dolls with certain desirable traits in order to create new Dolls who excelled in certain roles in society.Warriors for example would be bred for strength, certain elemental powers courage, and aggression. Aristocrats for leadership ability. Weavers for focus and multitasking ability and so on. Once everything was set and it seemed the dolls would be self sufficient the crafter's met each other at the Origin and each took a potion that put them in a sort of stasis. Before they went they gave the temples guards instructions on when and how to wake them at with that the reign of the 1st arbiter began. Now, here we are, thousands of years later.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even after so long, the war between us Dolls and the forces of the Umbra continues to rage on. Some seasons we are fortunate in that we only lose a dozen or so major settlements. Others entire regions may be lost. Either way our battlements of warriors seem to always reclaim what we lose only for it to be taken away again. It's like an endless game of tug of war in which both sides are equally matched. Over the years we have tried to gain the advantage; our warrior dolls have become more and more powerful. Our weapon smiths more and more skilled. The aristocrats commanding our troops and leading our cities smarter and wiser and our technology has evolved as we've come to better understand materials like Zantium and how we can use them to create life and energy. However it seems Dryfiss is always a step ahead of us. With every passing year more and more Dolls are trapped in their own bodies by the shadows and forced to attack their fellow dolls like wild beast desperate to survive,the umbras expendable footsoldiers. Everytime we find a way to make our battlements stronger, Dryfiss and his Generals find ways to do the same with their monsters and shadows. To further complicate things,our last Arbiter, brave as he was, manage to get himself killed in action leaving the Authority without a head for years as a replacement was cultivated. This new arbiter that the top weavers eventual came up with is meant to be an improvement over the last,yet she seems so careless. Under her rule so far we have lost more warriors than the Crafter did when she was commanding the Dolls in battle against the Devourer and greedy aristocrats in the cities considered \"safe\" from Umbral forces cheat and back stab each other (sometimes literally) in order to gain power and control. Honestly it's a bit of a mess, but I'm sure we dolls will make it as we always have. Anyway, that's enough of a history lesson for you today seedling. It's time we go about finding you an assignment.\n \nhttps://discord.gg/93dQyr9\n",

            "selftext": "Hello, Reddit! Actually posting here instead of lurking as I've dwindled down to only one roleplay partner and my creative itch is begging to be scratched. I'm going to try and make this post pretty succinct but bear with me as I can get a bit wordy at times.  \n\n\n**How I write:** I write third person always. Sorry, not flexible on this one. I can write multiple characters but my main tends to be female. Length varies based on partner, plot, and the specific scene but I've done anywhere from a couple paragraphs up to a page and a half at a time. I tend to focus on actions as well as thoughts and feelings of the characters I am playing. Don't worry though; I understand everyone has their own styles. As long as my partner moves things along in their reply and gives me something to respond to, I'm a happy camper!  \n\n\n**When I write:** My schedule can be a little hectic. I have just started my senior year of university and I have clinical rotations during the week so I may not be around Tuesday-Thursdays. Of course, I may be able to do some writing on the train back and forth but no promises. The rest of the time I tend to reply very quickly, especially when I'm super excited about a plot! Regardless, I try to keep my partners updated on when they can expect a post. Communication!   \n\n\n**What I write:** Going to be very honest here, I love drama. Not in the bad sense, just the conflicts and obstacles between characters and from the rest of the world around them. It fuels me. Aside from that, I've done fantasy (high and urban), sci-fi, cyberpunk, and am always looking to expand my comfort zones. The only thing I'm not really interested in is slice of life. I need conflict and excitement and adventure in my roleplays! Totally willing to hear anything you have to pitch. To be honest I've never been great at coming up with fully formed plots for these posts; I enjoy building something together with my partner. To me that is part of the fun. Oh, and while I'm not entirely opposed to adapting an existing world for a roleplay, I'm not comfortable playing canon characters. Sorry!   \n\n\nThat being said, I've had kind of a character concept rattling around in my head that I'd love to adapt to something. It's a super rough draft at the moment but I've been thinking a lot about the concept of identity and how a person might have to change theirs for one reason or another and how that would affect them as a person or affect the people around them. It could be someone in witness protection, it could be an operative, or it could be a criminal. Whether it's one alternate identity of many it's just something that has been on my mind and I'd love if it were possible to somehow integrate into a plot.   \n\n\nAs for NSFW, that can be discussed. I do ask that you be 21+ just to keep the option open and because I get along with people closer to my age. Sorry. In general I do not shy away from darker themes so hit me with your best shot! Also at this time I'm mostly looking for a male or someone writing a male, but not completely set in stone on that front.  \n\n\n**Where I write:** I may be able to flex on this a little bit but I really love Discord for roleplays. To me it's a great platform and super easy to have separate channels for OOC chat and story (if you love OOC chatting I will love you; I think it helps me get more into the roleplay if I am friendly with the person on the other end of the screen as opposed to it seeming like some sort of impersonal arrangement), plus I have Discord on my phone and I'm pretty much always online to some degree unless I'm at clinicals or sleeping.   \n\n\nI think that covers all the major points I wanted to go over! Sorry this got a little long but I hope to try and be as specific as I can be (without seeming too picky) to make it more likely to find a good partner. I wish you all the best of luck on your searches and hope to hear from some of you!  ",

            "selftext": " Hi there\\~! The name is Sam, and I'm looking for a literate partner to write some stuff with! I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a bit unorthodox for Warcraft stories, atleast currently. I am looking for a bit of an AU, where instead of a Khadgar, there is a woman who takes the place as the Guardian. She'd be very active during Legion and the other expansions of the WoW storyline, and I would love to make this story after BfA, or during! I would be playing the Guardian themself, and where we take the focus is entirely up to us! I have a story that would leave her rather isolated in Karahzan after hosting a meeting of both Horde and Alliance, refusing to truly act on her role as Guardian... or so it would seem. I would love to either focus on only her and another character, or create a universe of Characters all with their own stories and intertwining plots. (Akin to the Marvel Universe!)\n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well. So, if you're going to play a male character just keep in mind I wouldn't want a romance arc.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

I can double and play side characters. I can also play heterosexual and homosexual couples, though I prefer straight or lesbian. \n\n**partner** I would love someone  who is open minded and creative. I enjoy someone who writes well - quality is great, and I don\u2019t have a specific requirement for quantity so write to your heart\u2019s content. I want someone who can help drive the role play forward rather than let it get stagnant. \n\nPlease be respectful of my character. I control them unless I let you know otherwise. Please also understand that I do have other responsibilities. \n\n**avatar: the last airbender** \nWe can play them in their universe. I\u2019d prefer post-series, but I can also play within the series timeline. \n\nI would also love to place the characters in an alternate universe of some sort. Either throw them in a college setting, slice of life, modern, or medieval.

I am female as well and live in the EST. I am also over the age of 18. For roles, I do not mind doing MXF and MXM. I am sorry, but I do not enjoy FXF. I have tried it a few times and never really enjoyed it. \n\nAs for Roleplaying, there are some things that I enjoy. For starters, I roleplay in both 1st and 3rd, depending on my paretner's choice. I write about 2-4 paragraphs and more. I do not mind adding in some sexual stuff into the roleplay as long as my partner is okay with it. If you would like to roleplay with me, send me a PM and I will be sure to respond back! \n\nMy favorite Genres of roleplaying:\n-Romantic styles\n-Horror\n-Supernatural\n-War/Historical \n-Video Games \n-Fantasy \n-Superhero\n-Star Wars\n-Crime/Cop \n-",

Or will Camp Halfblood find itself falling to ruin? Your characters will shape the outcome!\n\nWhile knowing about the world is great and will help, it\u2019s not required. So if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the series, but want to play a demigod, feel free to join in the fun! One of our more experienced campers will happily guide you and explain the \u201cneed to know\u201d information. \n\n**Future Site Plans:** After the current plot, and once we\u2019ve expanded our member base, we plan to start expanding by adding Camp Jupiter as well as Norse Mythology, Mayan Mythology, and Hindu Mythology, and more! \n\nWe also have our next plot currently in planning.

            "selftext": "Hey, Male 20 UK, looking for a female roleplay partner.\nI\u2019m mostly looking for a slice of life role play. I have some prompts which will be listed but if you wish to change or message me with your own ideas that is fine too. \n\n1. We dated in high school for a few years, I was the Quarterback and you was (whatever you feel like) I went onto play college in football and we ended up breaking up before I left. We haven\u2019t seen each other in a few years until I come back to town. Where I\u2019m out for a drink with a few of my old friends, and we bump into each other, or potentially, our families are still good friends and the night I get back into town, my parents are having a party and nobody knew I\u2019d be home yet. \n2. Similar to the first one, but with a slight twist. We dated in high school and before I went to college you fell pregnant and chose not to tell me. I come back to town and you have to find the right time to tell me everything and we see what happens. \n3. I recently got drafted into the Miami Dolphins as a rookie. I\u2019ve only been living there for a few weeks when one of my team mates asks me if I want to come out for a drink with him and his wife/girlfriend. She ended up bringing you, and you can decide what you are to her, colleague, sister, friend etc. We get on really well and we will take it from there. \n4. Take it how it goes, think off a basic plot or suggest one of yours.!\n\n\nIf you would rather play younger than early adult, and maybe high school college age that\u2019s fine with me, and we can do the usual school plots, dating, friends, etc. \n\nIf anyone of these interest you and you wish to message me,. \n\nThanks for reading! \n\n",

If you\u2019re not able to play and enjoy any of these themes, then we\u2019re not compatible. Sorry. I\u2019m looking for someone LITERATE, DETAILED, and ACTIVE! \n\nSince the very beginning of human civilization, there has always been 14 fundemental beings that make up mankind\u2019s emotions and personalities. Created by god himself, they were sent down to earth to regulate those very things, forced to live among the humans. The 14 beings are split into 2 groups; Virtues and Vices. They lived in perfect balance, but after thousands of years, something has changed.\n\nThe Virtues; Chastity, Temperance, Charity, Dilligence, Patience, Gratitude, and Humility.\n\nThe virtues represent everything \u2018good\u2019 within humanity. These are the beings that god supposedly modeled after himself.\n\nThe Vices; Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy and Pride.\n\nThe Vices represent everything \u2018bad\u2019 within humanity. They were apparently modeled after angels that have been barred from heaven for various misdeeds.\n\nA war is beginning to brew between them which was originally started by some of the virtues. They wondered why they had to walk a world that was filled with misdeeds led by sins, so they set out to obliterate them so mankind could be truly pure.\n\nI\u2019d like this RP to contain action, romance, and drama mainly. It\u2019s set in the dark ages and contains mystical properties along with the more bibliographic ones. There are still a good amount of details to flesh out, so if you\u2019re interested in this prompt then message me on Reddit and we can move to another platform.",

I would say I write posts for roleplays every single day, or at the very least I try to. It brings me such amazing joy and is one of the ways I express my love for something, including video games. I know to a lot of people, inserting original characters into existing universes is cringey and lazy but to me it's incredible fun. So I'm trying to find some people who also are okay with it and willing to play the canon characters to indulge in my cringey love for exploring new characters in existing environments and stories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome information about me:\n\n\\-You can call me Steph, I'm 23 and married\n\n\\-I'm not picky about the gender of my writing partner, but I will be honest and say that writing anything NSFW with male writer partners makes me a little uncomfortable, I apologise in advance\n\n\\-I'm looking specifically for someone to write characters with me from the **Yakuza video game series**, primarily Goro Majima and/or Kazuma Kiryu. While I'm not great at writing canon characters, I will gladly try so you can have canonxcanon interactions in our roleplays so you aren't writing all by yourself.\n\n\\-I'm also open to RPing in other universes as well, Yakuza is just my current major love right now\n\n\\-Because of what i'm looking for, **I would prefer if my writing partners were 18+**, as Yakuza and many of the other video game franchises I want to RP in are mature rated. I also just feel weird writing and talking to kids, sorry.\n\n\\-**I have 12+ years of writing experience** on multiple platforms including: gaiaonline, tumblr, AO3 (very briefly), and some random forums. Gaia is where I'm currently doing all my roleplaying, but I want to do **these RP's on Discord preferably**\n\n\\-I am more than happy to provide you with samples of my writing if you so desire! I **would certainly like to see some of your writing** before agreeing to anything to make sure we'll match properly. Nothing sucks more than getting excited for a RP and then realising you and your writing partner don't, well...write together well.\n\n\\-I'm fine with AU's, plotting, angst, fluff, action, drama, pairings, etc.\n\nThat's about it really, I believe. If you're interested in giving me and my writing dreams a chance, just send me a DM so we can chat and figure things out! Thank you for your consideration. ",

My style is third person, past tense, the-more-written-the-better. That means I\u2019ll have no problem sending and recieving a few shorter replies every now and then when the plot/action calls for it, but I\u2019ll generally strive to give multi-para replies.\n\nMy preferred pairing is M/F (with me playing as the male main) but I can double on occasion, if the plot calls for it. I\u2019d strongly prefer to RP with female roleplayers.\n\nI\u2019m on the GMT +2 timezone, if you care. You can expect me to reply 1-3 times a week. I will try to let you know if something\u2019s happening in my life that will keep me from replying. English is not my first language, but no one complained yet about my writing! :) I do try hard to write well, and this is not an issue at all.\n\nI have one big craving at the moment: Batman. Basically, if you\u2019re into the fandom, send a messgage, and we\u2019ll brainstorm! I\u2019m pretty much open for suggestions. However, I have an original idea for a Bruce/Pamela RP. Yep, Pamela. The premise is that Pamela is brought to a hospital after her incident with Woodrue. Bruce, as the main donor of the hospital, in his first years as Batman, takes an interest in her, hoping to assist her recovery and turn her into a role model/symbol of hope for Gotham. However, Pamela\u2019s descent to madness and villainy is inevitable, and Bruce might have an accidental part in that, too. I\u2019d love to RP this thing as a slow burn action/tragedy/drama, exploring our own OC (R-Rated, gritty, dark) Gotham and other characters in it, depicting Pamela\u2019s journey. This is a plot I'm really, really craving to play. Really.\n\nI do have an idea for a Jason Todd/Harley RP, but it's kind of out there and off-canon. Inquire if you're imaginative and flexible! :)\n\nLimits on content can be discussed privately, but I'm not very sensitive, squeamish or conservative. \n\nYou can PM me here, and then we can chat, plot and brainstorm! I might be convinced to switch to Gdocs, but we have to talk a little over e-mail first.\n\nThat\u2019s all, folks! Have a great day!",

            "selftext": "That's right, I'm looking for a Digimon fandom RP. I probably wasted the better part of my youth roleplaying and I really haven't stopped and I'm well into my adulthood now.\n\nAnyway, the long and short of it is: if you're interested in cute, adorable little monsters and perhaps saving both Real and Digital Worlds from apocalyptic peril, then send me a PM and give me a poke.\n\nAs stated before, I'm an adult (21+) and I tend to get along with other adults of similar age, something-something generation gap. But I'm friendly and chill and I'm fine with anyone as long as you can put up with me. I enjoy romance, but it's not a necessity. I'm LGBTQ+ (don't know if that was obvious). I'm also pretty relaxed and enjoy chit chatting, so it's a bonus if you do to.\n\nAs for the RP itself, I'm not always available to post. Most of the time though, it's not more than for a day or two. But if it's longer than a day I am good on letting you know -- even if it's just to tell you I'm not feeling it. I hope others return the favor, I mean sometimes we just don't feel it, yeah? No biggie.\n\nNow I have a basic idea of a story and we can discuss it, but I'd love someone who's willing to provide input and work with me to build an enjoyable world we can both enjoy. That being said, I don't enjoy being the only one driving the story. I like it when a partner is able to take the reigns as well when they'd like. \n\nSee ya digiside! ",

It can be fairly light in tone with a strong empathises on interpersonal relationships but at the same time dark and heavy subject matter is sprinkled in there, Like herbs on a delicious pasta sauce, Though ultimately the tone of the RP is up to you!\n\nI tend to play it as somewhat of a sandbox in the roleplay itself there are a lot of different races and species but the universe will react to your character It'll change and adapt, Characters who could of been intended as minor or even background characters could be major players due to you and your characters influence.\n\n**That all being said I do have some things I have to ask of the people who apply**\n\n1: This is the most important one, If something isn't working out please let me know I'm happy to work with you to try and get this working again!\n\n2: I hate to be a stickler but I do require about one paragraph per post, Obviously if you want to go for more that'd be great but I don't want to force you to post when there is nothing to say.\n\n**In return I can promise you these things:**\n\n1: I will keep you informed of anything important IE: If I have to go away, If I'm unable to post, things of that nature.\n\n2: I will do everything in my power to get you at the very least one post a day of a good quality\n\n3: I will make my characters fun and engaging!\n\n4: I will respect any and all feedback!

I can write in third or first and love tons of description and details. I don't mind what age or gender you are. All I ask of you is that you try and reply in good detail, a paragraph will do. Please check your grammar. I don't mind small mistakes but I want to be able to read what you're writing. You don't have to reply frequently, I understand everyone has responsibilities but please don't go MIA for a week without letting me know. At any time during the roleplay you have the right to leave if you don't like it. Whether it's because you don't like my style or you don't like the plot. You can just tell me, I won't be offended. The same goes for me to. If are styles don't match or I find the plot boring I will tell you. theres no point in it if were not having fun. Alrighty my list of requirements are over, I hope that wasn't too much! Let's move on to story lines! I'm perfectly fine with FxM or FxF pairings. I've never played a male role before so I can't do MxM sorry:( Below are some of my ideas but feel free to come up with your own!)\n\n- Zombie apocalypse! Two people stranded together. Will they survive and find shelter? Will they find other people? Will they fall in love? I would prefer this RP to be longterm. \n- No eacape! We're stuck in an elevator together. How will we eacape? Will someone find us? This is a short term roleplay. \n- *Roommates? It's your first day of college and you meet your roommate. It's a girl?!? This is a MxF pairing.\n- *Mansion! Your long lost uncle had past away. You barely knew him but he left you in his will. You got a mansion? Woah. You arrive to the beautiful house, but you weren't alone. There's a maid.\n\nIf you made it this far thank you! If you're interest in roleplay with me drop a message. I prefer you have a small promt so I can see your style. In can be something you've wrote before I or completely new. It doesn't have to be long a paragraph will do:) \n\nMika~\n",

A little about me to get things started, I'm 22 (and would request that all of my writing partners be 18+, just to be on the safe side), female, work full-time with odd hours, and my timezone is EST. I'll be around as much as possible, but again, my work can be unpredictable so please bear with me on that. I'm happy to roleplay via email or Discord! \n\nGenerally, I write in multi-para format, but it can be more or less depending on what the story calls for. Some roleplays can be fun and light and require a more script-like format, others can turn into novellas! I'm flexible, so let's just write something that we can both enjoy.\n\nI enjoy playing with dark themes, so please let me know what your limits are when you contact me to make sure that I can properly respect them! More than anything, I want us both to feel comfortable and have fun.\n\nOnto my idea, I'm interested in writing our own take on the myth of Hades and Persephone. I would prefer to write the role of Hades but as a goddess rather than god this time, and perhaps with Persephone being male if you are interested! If you would prefer Persephone to remain female, that is perfectly fine as long as you are okay with writing her against a female Hades! I have researched a lot about this myth, but there are plenty of different versions and interpretations so I think it would be the most fun and beneficial to ensure we both get the most out of it if we can talk about expectations, how we perceive the characters, and overall can plot together! I'm also a big fan of becoming friends ooc so please never feel uncomfortable talking to me for any reason!\n\nThanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you!",

Pop by and check out our main premise, as it is based upon a book I am writing but will diverge. \n\nShort Premise: Short premise: Lucifer has been kicked out of Hell by the Goddess of Death and to prevent the humiliation from sticking, has created a persona of a German-born British noble, eccentric and wise, patron of the arts and decadent enough to justify his lavish lifestyle, he exchanges favours and deals to people and invite them to his ridiculous estates with his brother, toying with humanity and staging their conficts whilst truthfully searching for the Necronomicon to lift the curse that binds him out of Heaven forever and strike a deal with God to unleash the Legion of Angels, two hundred million strong, on H\u00e9la and send back to the pocket dimension she belongs to.\n\nIn the eyes of the world, the balls and parties hosted by the Morgensterns are stuff of legend, tastefully decorated manses and an island in the shores of Ireland, or hunting in Samael's country house, there is always something happening-- and several someones at once. People travel across the globe to get his favours and somehow, before his \"father\" arrived in Britain, there was no mention of their extraordinary wealth which never seems to run out, save for a few bits and pieces here and there, gathered by Lucifer during his numerous visits of the Earth.\n\nNot everybody buys his persona for what it is, a persona. Some people seem to believe he is more than that, as the Illuminati Chapter of Great Britain has itself began searching for the Al-Azif, currently holding onto one part in an undisclosed location and several items of value that fell from H\u00e9la's breach: The Ring of Baruchiel, a keepsake of Lucifer's, that allows its wearer to resist demon possession, Hell Brimstone (powerful ingredient for magic) and a Pentecostal Bible (Handwritten by the Devil himself on Hell, its creatures and their weaknesses, etc).\n\nThe roster of potential characters is vast, just check Discord, magic and supernatural stuff do exist and are very exciting and I shall be DMing the world so we all feel like the story is going places. Will he find the seven parts of the Al-Azif? Will he be uncovered?",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi there, This is a group dedicated to creating a fun and welcoming environment for all roleplayers. I want this roleplay to offer plenty of opportunities to its players to help create and shape the world around them for the sake of creating a fun and interesting story. Below, you'll find a bit of lore to help situate you so you can get a general feel of how things go down on this server:  \n*\" In a small and quaint town basically forgotten (or at least overshadowed by all the other ones) deep in the heart of Utah, everyone seems to know each other's name and its so safe that some people can even sleep without having to so much as lock their door. However, this town is known for something else amongst its residents, as is the rest of the world at this point that sets it apart from our own: mythological creatures. You see, in this world, creatures big and small truly do exist and finally decided to make themselves known to the humans. However, there is one small catch: they aren't exactly liked by humans. Humans have always been top of the food-chain, they've always been able to adapt and overcome any challenges that they've faced as a species. Now that these \"mythos\" as they often refer to them as have come into their lives, they see them as simply another issue that is meant to be adapted to and overcome.*\n\n*The mythos tried to be nice to the humans, they wanted to basically be like neighbors with them. However, humans were fearful of them. Things soon escalated and now it's a bit cultural split between mythos and humans. The mythos are now essentially treated like second-class citizens if they so much as step foot into a human town or city. Some, are even captured as slaves and forced to serve under the oppressive rule of humanity. Things have even gotten to the point where anti-mythos departments have been establish for the sake of \"protecting the people from the threat of the unknown\" as they so claim.*\n\n*Of course, there are a few unspoken rules that applies to humans. For example, the dense forest that surrounds the forest is to be left alone. Any human that so enters it could potentially face certain death.*\n\n*Now, here we are. Be you mytho or human, you still have a life to live. Whether you try and create peace between the two opposing groups or instead prefer to keep old values intact and destroy all who oppose you is a choice all your own.\"*\n\nIf this is appealing to you in the slightest, please feel free to drop by and say hello! Hope to see you soon! Remember, this RP changes along with whatever decisions the characters of this RP make. I only jump in if things begin to get out of hand.

            "selftext": "\\### Realm of Angarak\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what is Angarak? Angarak is an open world' Discord Fantasy Roleplay. We use the term Open world due to the fact that it's set in Discord an allows characters to travel freely across the lands at their own will at any time of the day. This as many other discord server allows people to roleplay across the set map at the same time without restriction on the distance they can remain alongside others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### What is Angarak?\n\n\\---\n\nSo, let's break down to what Angarak itself really is! Angarak is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is Angarak. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more!\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### What makes it unique?\n\n\\---\n\nSo, what exactly makes Angarak different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, Angarak runs off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Angarak's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Angarak is. Angarak is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### What are the 'requirements'?\n\n\\---\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to!\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\\### Tl;Dr\n\n\\----\n\nAngarak is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community that holds currently over fifty current players within the Discord. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj](https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj)",

            "selftext": "The story begins with your character signing up to take part in a school that is nearly ready to be part of the public school system, though it invites all ages of students to come and join it before its opening. However, the group of students that arrive and meet up find that there is a massive abyss within the school - a dark hole that just doesn't reasonably make sense as the outside of the school isn't damaged in any way.\nBut even worse, all the students fall into the abyss together forcefully, and only later do they wake up to find that they seem to be in an underground mine with many other kids other than the group initially thought.\nEven worse, they find out that the school was a lie and that they are in an experiment that puts their lives at risk - it is a test through killing, and jury trials must take place after each murder. If the case ends with misjustice, the murderer can go free along with another person, while the rest will have an unexplainable, horrible fate to suffer.\nThis is a bitter School Trap - one that the students must work together on to survive, or perish not doing so.\n\nSaid roleplay will function very similarly to Danganronpa's systems, though the plot and lore are all an original twist. The plot will span several chapters, and I hope to provide a intruiging experience. The investigation and court will have a unique way of operating during the RP, where each phase takes time to complete in RP, though the court cases will have a different approach. I did leave out some details in the plot and it may have seemed vague, but I didn't want to give too much away as we will be doing the prologues together, and there are seperated groups atm. I hope you can see the relation to Danganronpa, however, you won't exactly be getting an animal animatronic and talents... sort of. Characters range from all ages, including those who go to university and younger. This is a group RP on Discord, so if you would like more information or want a link to the server, please PM me. I will try to answer questions here the best I can.",

I am looking for a long term roleplay partner who is interested in medieval roles, modern roles (aslong as they are not cliche.) roles involving magic, witchcraft, mystical creatures. Etc. If you have any roles of this sort, please shoot me a message. I will be free almost every day until the 30th. Then I will be free after school. And always free on weekends unless I say otherwise.\nI\u2019m open for any partner with atleast a semi literate writing level. You will be rejected if you use asterisks (*) for actions and use normal text as talking. I don\u2019t expect paragraphs but maybe almost a 8th grade paragraph size each response. It gets boring when you send one liners. I prefer dramatic roles to keep things interesting. Thank you for reading all of this. Feel free to shoot me a message. ",

            "selftext": "Hi! My name is Danielle, I'm from the UK and i'm 18 years old. I'm looking for a roleplay based in the world of Detroit: Become Human, where Androids are living in the everyday life of humans, created by CyberLife to serve humans in different ways. I'm looking for a story in this world, whether it is with OC's or canon characters *(though i would prefer OC's)* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few ideas for plotlines, and I would like if you read them and chose which you are interested in, and if you have any other ideas then I would love to know them, as we can then brainstorm ideas together and come up with something amazing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mainly roleplay females, but I can play males. I also don't mind playing the android or the human, it's really up to what you prefer! \n\n1. **Home Cleaning Android X Human** \n\nThis story would involve an android designed to serve in the home, cooking and cleaning, and would be ordered to the human's home. The human could have a lot of different situations happening. Maybe he/she is still living with their parents and gains a bond with the android and sees them as a person instead of plastic, but the parents disagree and treat the android badly, with some signs of abuse. The human would help the android break into deviancy. Or, the human could be living alone and needs help with the house as they are very busy a lot of the time. They hate androids, but give in to buying one as they need it. They treat the android badly, but soon grow a bond with them and unwillingly help them turn deviant. They form a relationship together, even though it is shamed on by everyone, and there are some laws that go against them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.  **(NSFW) Sex Worker Android x Client** \n\n**I will only do this if you are 18+.** This story would take place in the main city of Detroit, involving an android made for pleasing humans and performing sexual actions and intercourse for a club in the city. The client could be new to the whole thing, and be trying it out since he has been a bit lonely. He is quite a talkative guy, and the android becomes a bit confused as she was programmed to serve just sexually. As the two talk, the android opens up, and becomes to start feeling self aware. The client could pressure into whether theyre okay with just working this way, and if she wanted to do anything with her 'life'. This would happen over a few visits by the client, as they have limited time together. The android would become deviant and want to escape with the client, and they go on the run from the police, hiding out in the city, just wanting a life for themselves as they fall in love with eachother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. **Android X Android** \n\nI'm not too certain on the story for this, but I would like to consider a story where two androids gain consciousness together, or atleast one of them is deviant and convinces the other to join them. I would like something like North and Markus' relationship, with the girl being damaged, maybe frequently being a sex worker, and the male helps her recover this. If you have any ideas for this then please let me know, I'm sure we can brainstorm something!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.",

            "selftext": "Good (whatever time of day it is for you)! Hope things are going well for you, or at least as well as can be expected. As the title of this thread notes, I'm looking to RP some lines within the Pokemon game/anime-verse, and I'm seeking to keep the anime's lighthearted and cheery mood. Over-the-top adventure, copious humor and comedy, witty/snarky banter, meaningful (but not bleak) conflict, quiet moments of character growth, good battles, romance (I'm cool with smut, but I wouldn't want it to be the proverbial endgame), our characters genuinely having fun and enjoy each other's company, that sort of thing. I'm asking partners to have fairly up-to-date knowledge on the games/anime (at least Gen 4 or 5) so we aren't significantly restricted. ***All partners must be 21+ years old, and all characters must be written/played as 21 years old if they aren't already older.***\n\n\u200b\n\n[This RoleplayGateway post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/9auwtv/vyces_roleplay_gateway_profile/) has all my OOC info, so I won't repost it here. (You're welcome for that. :P) Instead, let me note what I'd rather **not** have in a line:\n\n\u2620 *Making Pokemon \"darker\".* I'm fine with a *Pokemon Origins*\\-type tone sometimes. But if you're seeking a line with a darker/\"grittier\" tone or a general *Pokemon Apokelypse*\\-esque feel, I doubt we'd mesh.\n\n\u2620 *Fixating on game mechanics (mechanics of levels, stats, movesets, IVs, etc.).*\n\n\u2620 *Enforcing the \"Four Moves of Doom\" limit.* Considering the anime doesn't and the games only do so for the sake of memory, why should we? :P Let's just have it so a Pok\u00e9mon can use--and learn--any of their given moves (which could be part of a plot in itself).\n\n\u2620 *Dry or one-sentence battle descriptions.* I'm certainly not demanding every single nuance receive a paragraph, but I **am** requesting partners be willing to describe moves and battles much like the anime. Just writing/reading *\"(Name of Pokemon) used (name of attack)!\"* all the time gets boring, you know?\n\n\u200b\n\nI have a few general and open-ended ideas here to set the stage, but I'm certainly open to hearing yours...\n\n\u25d3 **The typical Pok\u00e9mon journey** is always a classic fave, our characters just traveling and having highspirited adventures fitting the series in general. (In this case, I'd prefer an *in media res* approach where both our characters are already fairly seasoned and experienced, bringing up their greenhorn days if needed.) Perhaps our characters have been traveling a long time together, or have just started doing so.\n\n\u25d3 **Perhaps one of our characters are a member of Team \\[fill-in-the-blank\\] while the other's a trainer they're tailing for whatever reason**, but they end up battling on a regular basis and ultimately falling for each other? (Think a similar version of the dynamic Ash has with the TR trio, only with some romance added to the mix.)\n\n\u25d3 **One--or both--of our characters are Gym Leaders, Frontier Brains, Elite Four members, Team Rocket members, Top Coordinators and the like.** Maybe exploring the day-to-day deal behind being one of the greats, from training their chosen creatures to dealing with some cocky greenhorns wanting to challenge \u2018em.\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters initially meet battling over a Pok\u00e9mon.** Perhaps they each have a fair case for capture, forcing a temporary team-up if the target's exceptionally clever. Or maybe they join forces to deal with a third party trying to Pok\u00e9-block them?\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters are part of an elite academy for Pok\u00e9mon trainers.** Think Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s answer to Hogwarts or something like that.\n\n\u200b\n\nCharacter-wise, I'll admit I'd love to play a male OC opposite a strong-minded, confident female who is a friend, a partner, a rival, a romantic interest or any combo platter of the above. Helpless, painfully naive/passive damsels-in-perpetual-distress aren't really my cup of tea put me off. A capable and confident woman knowing her own mind and dreams, who stands by my character's side--or boldly challenges him to match her shine--is much more personally appealing.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhile open to a female OC (I admit having a few particularly desired faceclaims), I'd particularly love to find a partner willing to play as any of the following opposite a male OC...\n\n|\u25d3 These Pokemon Anime Canons... \u25d3|\u25d3 These Non-PKMN Canon Transplants... \u25d3|\n|:-|:-|\n|Misty|Hermione, Ginny (*Harry Potter*)|\n|Jessie|Peach, Daisy (*Nintendo*)|\n|Iris|Moana (*Moana*)|\n|Officer Jenny|Mai Shiranui (*King of Fighters*)|\n|Georgia|Elsa, Anna (*Frozen*)|\n|Fantina|Tifa Lockhart (*Final Fantasy 7*)|\n|Burgundy|Yuna (*Final Fantasy X*)|\n|Prima/Lorelei|Suki, Ty Lee, Azula (*Avatar*)|\n|Bianca (anime version)|Korra, Kuvira (*Legend of Korra*)|\n|Giselle|Female!Ranma Saotome (*Ranma 1/2*)|\n\nSo if interested in this, please feel free to send me a PM. And if you aren't, then I hope you soon find something more appealing. (And make sure to stay out of the tall grass!)",

            "selftext": "have been thinking a lot about isolation and just how sprawling humanity is. It seems like it is almost impossible to get away from it all.\nWhat if that all changed though, what if you found humanity gone tomorrow. What would life be like....what would relationships be like for the few left behind? How tightly would you cling to that one other person out there. I have a few ideas in keeping with that.\nThe Lakehouse: Everyone was gone, whether it was zombies, nuclear war, or perhaps you just woke up one day with everyone vanished. Survival was your only concern...civilization crumbling around you. Until you found it, a beautiful lakehouse surrounded by large old trees. Solar panels, a quaint and fecund garden....but was the owner planning on sharing? How did he survive.\nThe island: Perhaps civilization didn't collapse, maybe it is just so far away that it may as well have. Washed ashore on a distant island somewhere in the pacific you need to survive together.\nA mysterious realm: You woke up here, you can't remember how. The fields are too vibrant, the sky too blue...everything is just too perfect. There is not a soul in sight....what brought you here and why? It would be so easy just to stay here the rest of your days.\nI would ideally be looking to play across from someone interested in doing world building as a team exercise though I do have lots of ideas for the three scenarios.\nI have also learned to love the idea of my partner playing someone famous (A celebrity, singer etc) whose wealth fame and power no longer mean a thing. Whose drastically changed life warrants deep soul searching.\nI would be open to Scarlet Johanson, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Emilia Clarke or others\nHope to hear from you soon",

            "selftext": " The  group is called Korlia Fantasy  Role-playing game It was created by me mechanically with help of a few  play testers to polish the system up  to snuff. All players will travel  to the land of Korlia about 6 months after the sun mysteriously  stopped at dawn for 5 hours, rumors coming out of the land state that 4  of the 6 greater Gods appeared in front  of   two competing armies and  reversed a bloody battle manipulated by a  man   called the  \"Inquisitor.\"The game is a  text based rp with stats  and  currency, you  start at level one and gain  stats on level up, work  for  money, RP and  fight for sweet experience.\n\nMain draws:\n\n**7 Stat combat:** Hp, Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Endurance, Stamina, and AP.\n\n**Dodge/Defend:**     Dodge is all or nothing, defend is 20% damage resistance blocking up    to  75% on a successful defend, adds strategy to fights.  Tactical reversals to make sure you can last longer, switch to defense if they   are targeting your low Dexterity, or switch to dodging if they are targeting your low Endurance!\n\n**Quick start:**     Learn skills for battle, each character starts with bonus ways to  get skills per race. Start with 4 skill slots and 4 shape slots.\n\n**Rebirth system:**     If a character dies, you carry 20% Gold, Reputation, Exp to the next character, with an additional 10% and 30% to two choices and the ability to carry more with specific upgrades.\n\n**Character Dukedoms:** Players can use missions and if they meet the staffing requirements can move into a taken castle.\n\n**War Battles:** basically like above PVP with added Npcs, Allies and Enemies.\n\n**Classes and Races:** Extra customization 13 classes 5 races. 8 classes unlocked so far.\n\n**Many Weapons:** Many types with upgrades and Legendary weapon missions. 9 legendary weapons have been sighted\n\n**Shapecrafting:** custom magic system you can use to craft spells on the fly, note this is limited to one race at the start but not by class.\n\n**Power Words:** Command your enemies and encourage your allies.\n\n**Multiple Mods:**    1 mission mod for every 5 players. Mission mods have access to Npcs to make games more interactive and deeper.\n\n**RP Rewards:**     Get rewarded for some RP actions such as If you work as a smith and a player wants to get their weapon upgraded, the player can gain a    portion  of the gold it costs to get upgraded, or work as a guard and    get paid  to fight Outlaws.\n\n**Range Based Combat:** Move into melee to have an enemy bowmen scramble to get a clear shot.\n\n**Several Battle Types:** from Friendly spar to all out battle to the death in the trenches of war.\n\n**Request a mission:**     Bored and need something to do?   Ask a Mod/Mission Mod if they can give you a quest to do, usually they will.  RP?  Battle?  Working?  There are missions that can fit every need!\n\nWill you rise to power in the lands of Korlia?

            "selftext": "# Introduction and Rules\n\nHello everyone! I am a 26 year old woman living in Canada, and I have been roleplaying for the better part of 17 years. I have a few roleplay preferences. **First**, I like about 1-3 paragraphs per post, and prefer quality over quantity. In the heat of fervant replies, posts may become shorter, but should be no less descriptive. **Secondly**, I am not strict about how frequently you post, but I prefer a few times per week. I live a very busy life (full time school, part time job, and two part time volunteer positions atop a social life). I cannot post every day. My favourite way to play is to schedule certain \"online\" times with my partner which allows us to reply to each other live, but this is not necessary and not always feasible. **Third**, age is important to me. I am 26, and my partners must always be over the age of 18, with no exceptions. **Fourth**, respect is key in our engagement. I will respect your boundaries, and you will respect mine, and we will consider these boundaries as subject to change at any time. **Fifth**, and finally, we are both here to have fun. If we lost interest, or stop having fun, let's discuss it. Open communication is absolutely key to success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Artist's Muse \n\nA wealthy **artist** lives in the historic setting of either **(The Edo Period, Japan), (the early 1900s England), or (1920s Canada).** He is enchanted by a young woman far beneath his station. Perhaps he comes from a wealthy merchant family, or even aristocracy. Either way, this woman does not represent idealized womanhood in his society. She is either a **(maid), (a geisha), or (an actress).** He is taken by her, and insists on using her as his muse, which develops into an unhealthy romantic relationship. They are both hypervigilant as his **wife** is always around the corner, her duty as a mother and woman threatened by this new addition to his life. \n\nThe themes I'd like this roleplay to explore are as follows:\n\n* Class difference\n* Gender expectations\n* Taboo sexual relationships\n* The power dynamics associated with artist/subject\n* Abuse of power by an artist\n* Love in unexpected places\n\nAs usual, I am entirely open to suggestions! I'd happily work in a particular time period if it suits you better than those listed above, and am flesible if you have an idea you'd rather explore. Remember rule five, communication is key!\n\nPlease contact me in the comment section or through private messaging.",

            "selftext": "Hello /r/roleplay. I have the bandwidth for one, maybe two more writing partners. I hope I cover everything here, but feel free to DM me with questions if you need clarification. I would like to include a brief initial disclaimer that I am looking for a rather specific set of attributes in my potential partner, and I know myself. I would be much happier and most dedicated to someone who I feel matches what I am looking for rather half-ass RP with someone I'm not that suitable with. In that sense, I am going to be rather selective and picky about who I write with, and will most likely ask for a writing sample.\n\n**A snapshot of myself.**\n\nI'm in my late twenties, and have RPed on and off for over a decade. I am most comfortable writing with people around my age or older, especially in the case that NSFW themes come up (which I expect them to at some point). I'm in PST time zone, so similar would be good, although my availability is pretty open so as long as we can get in at least one reply every 1-2 days that would be ideal. I'm not looking for a slow moving, one post per week situation. I also enjoy chatting OOC if I have time and if we get along. If you feel like we are not suitable after chatting, feel free to jump ship; just let me know at any point if you're not feeling it.\n\n**The writing.**\n\nI like to write FxM pairings, with me playing as the female lead. NPCs are fair game of course, and if present, I would like us both to take control of NPCs. 3rd person only. I usually write anywhere from 200-800 words, depending on mood and situation. Starter posts are entirely different from action or dialogue-heavy posts. I expect something similar in length and/or quality from you, although I ask that first and foremost that no matter how much you write and how descriptive you get that you help move the plot forward.\n\nIf we plan on writing a whole story from beginning to end (which is ideal), there will be lulls and exposition, some of which we can skip if you'd like, but sometimes it makes sense to write it out for the sake of character development and flavor. When it comes to plotting, I also expect my partner to pitch ideas, make mine better, and brainstorm with me. I hate hand holding, and I'm not about to waste time on half-assed ideas that only has enough meat to barely carry us over an opening or smut scene.\n\nBut above all, I want us to write something that we're both excited and passionate about.\n\n**Genres and settings.**\n\nI have a soft spot for modern settings. Even better if spliced with fantasy elements. I'm fairly open, so long as the plot is interesting. (I don't do much medieval fantasy though.) I'm a sucker for a good story and dark themes, including but not limited to betrayal, clashing characters, power struggles, the apocalypse, plot twists, crime, and the supernatural. So really, anything from modern day crime/noir with non-human races, intrepid planetary explorations, modern supernatural (vampires, werewolves, etc.), alternate worlds, post-apocalyptic scenarios. Despite the fact that I like there to be a romantic element present, it doesn't have to be completely amicable. In fact, I prefer it to be not too slice-of-life-y. It can be strained, purely physical, manipulative, what have you. No \"love at first sight\" stuff, that's just silly.\n\nHowever, I am craving a certain couple of plots, that I can share once we get chatting.\n\n**Contact me.**\n\nIf you've read that wall of text and think we could make a good pairing, feel free to send me a PM. But please know that I do not tend to respond to low-effort PMs that simply state \"I'm interested\" or \"We sound like a good fit\". That doesn't give me a lot to work with and is indicative of a rather passive partner. Tell me about yourself, what/how you like to write, what you're looking for, any ideas you might have, any specific requirements you have. Bonus points if you throw me a writing sample my way. I do have a few plots myself that I can share once we get the ball rolling. I only play on Discord as well.",

Eeks\u2019 power made it hard to conceal herself though, glowing fluorescent green in the dark had its\u2019 cons.\n\nThis study session just got saucier. \n\nOf course she couldn\u2019t let it escalate any further.

I have this OC that I\u2019ve been meaning to play around with for awhile! I gave you a small rushed sample of what one of my responses might look like! This is nowhere near an intro, or character description. I\u2019ll save that for later.\n\nI\u2019m really open to a ton of platforms although I prefer to shy away from email. I prefer 3rd person and moderately long responses. \n\nThe world is normal, except for one thing.. . Superheroes have been sprouting up! The new generation of hero\u2019s are now angst\u2019s teens, caught up in the drama of life. \n\nI was hoping to have two childhood friends fall in love? Or maybe if you prefer they meet at high school, while discovering they\u2019re powers. Or maybe in a class where they learn to use their powers for good? It\u2019s all up to you! Feel free to suggest plot at anytime! \n\nI tend to reply relatively fast, as fast as I can! And I\u2019d rather you make an OC for this prompt. Feel free to introduce me to them! And I\u2019ll give you an overview of mine! \n\nFeel free to PM me if interested! Or if you have any questions.\n\n",

Painting.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She had other skills as well, a known writer though her words had never made it into anything of note. She could play music, which earned her a few extra credits here and there. But what paid her bills was her art. Often painting the massive spires, or vast oceans of the world. Painting that hung in office buildings and the homes of the wealthy. Renee had never had to work in the same place twice after her work was done, traveling from place to place as she wished. Skills that she had learned because of her love books, and the story of the Remembercers of old. Even if people questioned her line of work. Not that she gave it a second thought, she was free. Or as free as one could be in the twisting maze that was this world.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Life was good, or at least it was until the skys went dark with the shadows of the massive chapter ships of the legendary Astartes. Something that left the people in both awe and shock, what heresy had laid upon their world that would draw the eyes of the Emperor\u2019s angels. A mix of fear and honor rushed though the masses. Renee among them. Being able to see one. Maybe capture one in her work. Little did she know, her dream would turn into her worst nightmare.\n\nLighter subjects such as being a Remembercer or Serf of a Legion or Chapter.\n\n\u200b\n\n&gt;**Warhammer 30k Prompt: Let me paint you. (Legion and Names are just placeholders. Feel free to approach me with any legion or character you want to play!)**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Her name was Jolene, the youngest child of one of the minor noble houses of Terra and thus making her no one of real note as far as anyone was really concerned. That was until she was found to be of steady hand and artistic mind, able to give life to the world around in her both paints and charcoal. It was why her family funded her, helping her along until she was finally given the honor that was bestowed on all those that called themselves a member of the Imperial Rememberancer Order...to accompany the Fleets of the Great Crusade.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It took her almost a year of her twenty seven years alive to finally reached the 28th Expeditionary Fleet, the fleet who was called home by the Astartes Legion, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Children.\u201d Her muse screamed, her fingers inched to get to work. She had sketch what felt like hundreds of simple charcoal works capturing her journey, the people that worked aboard the ship, the ship itself. Now she would be able to prove her skill. She couldn\u2019t wait. Yet, her first few months among those that called the fleet home, she had gotten little to no real work done. Though she had made a friend with a young Imagist, who\u2019s work as of late had proved very lackluster. He had gotten good photos, just of poor quality.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Jolene, however, had taken interest in the still images. Often taking them and drawing them out. Breathing life into the images with paints and other mediums. Giving the once blurry images depth and meaning while in turn the young Imagist gave her images to work with that Jolene would not have been able to draw on her own. The Marines moved to fast in their day to day life that it would have been almost impossible to sit there and just draw them unless they wanted to be immortalized on canvas.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was those drawings, small paints that started to make circulationand in time caught the eye of one of her targets. A Captain of the Emperor\u2019s Children named Tharsis, then again she would have take time with any of the Astartes if they were willing to give it to her. Like many of the Marine\u2019s who had stories to tell, word had gotten around about the Captain. Said to be a lovey man, proud and arrogant. Then that could have been said about many of the Marine in the Third Legion. Men who seemed to strive for such perfection, noble men. Firm in purpose, loyal to the core. For a moment it made her work pale, how was she going to capture such a being?\n\n\u200b\n\nOC elements are also welcomed! To your own personal chapter of Marines or regiment of Guards, to custom worlds and lore that might add to the building of our story.",

Off in the distance stood the Steeple. Someone once compared it to... what was it? \"Los Vegas\"? \"Las Vegas\"? You couldn't remember but you knew that it was the last bastion of anything resembling civilization. Sure, there were pockets of populace dotting the desert landscape but this? This was different. It was a blackthumb haven full of rivethead mechanics and bio machinists. Hell, you can fix yourself up for the right price and the abandonment of your pound of flesh.\n\nWith the sun beating down, you'd make it step-by-step until reaching the gates. It didn't matter how long it would take because you'd simple keep going. Nothing grew out here in the wastelands and water was a luxury no one could afford. With nothing but yourself as company, this journey was going to keep going and maybe, just maybe, you'd greet Death one day, like an old friend. You'd die historic in the wastes in blaze of glory after a tumultuous and insufferable life.\n\nHello! I'm looking for a single male partner to engage in this particular post apocalypse roleplay. I require literacy and a native English speaking background. You must be male and, honestly, you should probably be well into your late twenties or thirties. Please, be creative in your writing skills, have a character thought of that you can send me. I have two you can choose from bet prefer one over the other. I would like a long term roleplay that includes but isn't limited to, violence, sexual content, drama, body horror, gore and drugs, if it fits. This roleplay is heavily influenced by \"Mad Max\", \"BladeRunner\" and \"Sand\".\n\nPlease send me a 100-200 word sample of your roleplay so I can make sure we will have good chemistry. I would prefer a freelance (surprise) style of writing and only require 2 to 3 paragraphs. I'm pretty flexible. I don't want to jump into a romance, however. Maybe we meet in combat? Maybe you're tracking me down but there's a catch. Make me care for your character and I will make you care for mine.\n\nIf you're still here, drop me a line with a small sample of your roleplaying skills!",

Perhaps, they are forced to help each other, known each other for a long time, or even start off as enemies first. I\u2019m open to ideas. Why would your character befriend a dragon? Maybe they are thrill seekers, maybe they need a dragon\u2019s help, or maybe they just really love dragons. Could be simple or complex. I would love for this rp to be deep. I like the emotional and descriptive stuff!\n\nI don\u2019t have a set plot in mind. I want to spend quite a bit of time world building and plot writing with you! So come ready to share ideas! ^.^ I\u2019m also looking for a friend from all this, so I can\u2019t wait to meet you! \n\nSome things about me: I type... A LOT. I tend to type out at least a paragraph per turn...sometimes more. I expect my rp partner to be detailed and give more than just a few lines.

I would prefer to rp as OCs bit could be convinced to play a Canon character. I mostly write around 1-2 paragraphs per response and try to reply several times a day, but that can vary due to availability. I will do my best to let you know if I will be unavailable for a long period.\n\nAlright, on to the fun stuff, the fandoms, I am currently looking for Star Wars, Naruto, and DBZ for rps. If you are interested in any other fandoms, then simply ask and if I am interested then we can rp in that universe. I hope to hear from you soon and find some new and fun adventures with you wonderful people.",

I think I\u2019d love some help to build a world that I\u2019ve been working on. The world is steampunk based, with airships and copper pipes, and the such, but with a hint of magic aswell.\n\nNow I\u2019m thinking that we would each play a character from the opening, one of us would be the child with the book and the other would be the thief with the key, that can be decided when we talk on Discord/kik. Now I\u2019m thinking that there could be other creatures in this world, like other human based creatures, and maybe even more flying creatures like octopi and pterodactyls.\n\nPM me to get my discord/kik.

            "selftext": "I'm Alex 23 from Zurich in Switzerland, nice to meet you and thanks in advance reading my post.\n\nNow I know that celebrity roleplays are the very king of clich\u00e9s, but if you don't immediately feel sick to your stomach, please read on. I promise I'm not looking for your generic, *oh I wanna do my celebrity crush*, kind of plot.\n\n***\n\nHer career had been at an all-time high. Her latest album was selling better than even her very optimistic agents had predicted. Her stadium tours across the globe sold out in minutes. It was all going so well...\n\nThen, one day she got a cold. Nothing to worry about, she thought, lost my voice for a few days, drink a lot of.hot tea and get back to it next week. Only the cold went, but her voice never came back.\n\nA myriad of doctors and specialist later, she had her answer. Years of singing had damaged her vocal chords, which had, unbeknownst to her, always been genetically predisposed for frailty. Then finally the cold was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nShe would never be able to sing again, not the eay she had been, not the eay her fans loved and that sold her music. In fact, if she sang at all, she risked losing her voice permanently.\n\n***\n\nNo news could have been more devastating to her. Her entire life up to this moment had been about her music. Now she had nothing, well with with the unwelcome exception of the paparazzi's incessant hounding.\n\nShe decided to escape it all. She left the states and moved to England. She'd always had a thing for the English countryside after all. Money was never going to be an issue, so when she saw that a gorgeously renovated Victorian mansion was listed for sale in one of the quietest parts of southern England, she didn't thing long on it.\n\n***\n\nHer neighbour in fact the seller of her new home was in a similarly miserable position, though for very different reasons. Only weeks ago he had been happily studying for his PhD, not a care in the world, with the exception of the next paper maybe. Then his father passed away...\n\nHis entire world changed. He was, as his father's only living relative, heir to *the estate*. The word filled him with dread. He had always hated the world his father lived in. This was a modern world, there was no need for nobility of forgone eras to maintain huge estates across the country.\n\nAnd yet, after the funeral he found himself in exactly this position. He bitterly resigned himself to his role as the new lord of his father's estate. He even sold his mother's little villa just outside the park of the main estate, that he had been lovingly restoring since it passed to him after her death 10 years ago.\n\n***\n\nSo first of all, if you've made it all the way down here, congratulations and thanks for taking the time!\n\nI'm thinking this roleplay will explore the relationship between our two \"unfortunate\" characters.\n\nI value detail and literacy, so I'm not looking for a one line at a time kind of partner. I want this to be long-term, with elements of politics, drama, intrigue etc on top of the romantic aspects. My typical style of roleplay is multiple paragraphs in third person.\n\nOne key plot point I want to explore is how your character will struggle fitting in with the world that being with mine catapults her into. On the other hand she will be his salvation from the dreariness of that world, forcing him to leave and go on adventures with her.\n\nThe celebrity I had in mind when I wrote this is Taylor Swift, but I'm happy to discuss other options. Please keep in mind however that I want it to be someone who is both at the height of their career now, but also has been in the business for a number of years.\n\nIf I've peaked your interest, feel free to pm me with comments, questions, suggestions, (productive) criticism or to discuss your ideas. I'm looking to eventually move to discord for the actual roleplay.\n\nHope to hear from you and thanks again for taking the time to read all this.\n\nx Alex",

            "selftext": "**About me:** 30 yr old female, married, EST time zone. I work 8:30 to 5:00 but am generally on Discord all day and generally get in a few posts a day. I tend to get a bit wordy but only ask that my partner keep up momentum. I don't care if your post is one paragraph or five as long as there's momentum. Basically my philosophy is \"if I wanted to write a book, I'd write a book\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About what I'm looking for:**\n\nFor those of you who have never heard of the Anne Bishop Black Jewels books, please read my ad before clicking away!\n\nFor those of you that have, welcome!\n\nWhat I am looking for is to write in the world, with all of this lovely structure pre-created for us, but not necessarily with the canon. I am open to writing alongside the canon, if you're familiar with it, but I tend to like to do my own thing and go my own way.\n\nThis is why I ask that if you haven't read the books you give me a chance. The system is not only very simple, it's open-ended, and I am willing to introduce you to it! I am used to being a GM in my RPs and curving the story around so that it fills in knowledge gaps.\n\nIf you'd like to know a little bit about the way the world works: [http://blackjewels.wikia.com/wiki/Jewels](http://blackjewels.wikia.com/wiki/Jewels) and [http://blackjewels.wikia.com/wiki/Blood](http://blackjewels.wikia.com/wiki/Blood) tell you 90% of what you need to know.\n\nMy immediate concept is that I would play a female, likely at least a Healer, of around mid-rank in Jewels. I would want to start in the late-teens (so not yet at full strength) and write from there. Ideally I'd like the character you are playing to be male for romance possibilities, but I am also okay with same-sex couples!\n\nReally I'm just looking for someone willing to play in my sandbox with me. If you want to hear more about the story I have trying to burst its way out my chest like a xenomorph, hit me up!",

I'm very much open to suggestion on the latter but I have an awesome idea for the former, so please let me know which interests you!**\n\nHi, I'm a dude from California that spends too much of his time writing. I always like to take a storyteller approach to my writing, whether it's just me or if I'm writing with someone else. So I *exclusively* roleplay as a DM/GM. For those that aren't aware, it essentially means that I fulfill the role of a storyteller and I build the universe around your character, who fills more of a central protagonist role.\n\nI'm looking for someone to write on discord with. I would prefer that you're a female OOCly, but I have no issue with what gender you choose to write as (I'll happily explain why if you're curious!), and I'm flexible on ages, although some content will be restricted to adults for obvious reasons.\n\nI'm very adamant on either writing in a Mass Effect scenario or a crime-drama scenario, specifically something taking place with either Law Enforcement or Organized Crime (I would love to do something similar to Rainbow Six: Siege's plot!). \n\nI generally reply pretty quickly and with at least 400 words in a response. On some days you'll get a response within the hour, and on other days you may only get three responses from me. However, I don't ask that you reply in the same frequency as me but if you can't do at least three a day, I would prefer that you find another partner!\n\nI know I left out a lot of details and stuff this time around, but feel free to contact me if you're interested!

I\u2019m 25, an open lesbian, and probably a lot of fun to be around if you like loud, excitable people who generate AUs like stars generate light and heat. And I, in this the year of our lord two-thousand and eighteen, want to find partners who are interested in Naruto roleplay.\n\nYes. *Naruto roleplay*. I know.\n\nI got back into Naruto a few years back and now I\u2019m itching for something a little more immediate than *sitting down to write a whole novel length fanfic all by myself.* With that in mind, I\u2019m looking for partners who meet the following criteria.\n\n* Competent, \u201cliterate\u201d writers who **don\u2019t mind short** posts when the action calls for it. I want you to know what you\u2019re doing and be able to write a decent amount when the situation arises, but **you don\u2019t need to write a novel each time** because I certainly won\u2019t.\n* Chill folks who are into the idea of posting when we can. Ya girl has a full time job and a full time relationship, so I can be a little on the slow side, but it\u2019s always with quality in mind.\n* You like to do cool fun romance plots that involve self-indulgent angst and a hard-earned happy ending.\n* 18+, because while I\u2019m **not** actively looking for NSFW RP, I\u2019d like to be able to get excited and share something racy with you on the raaare occasions that I write it for our pairings,.\n\nI have a confession to make now that you\u2019ve read this far: I\u2019m primarily here looking for people who are interested in RPing my pairing. **ZabuHaku** is the hill I\u2019ll die on, but I always see it pulled off in a creepy and unfortunate way that I just\u2026.do not get behind. I have several starters drafted for this pairing already because I\u2019m extra, and several more AU ideas I\u2019m willing to draft if you find them more interesting. Or we could come up with something totally new.\n\nI\u2019m happy to share any drafts you\u2019re interested in via PM!\n\n(assume bolded items = already drafted)\n\n* **Konoha Captive AU** (they survive the bridge and have to deal with the Complications that entails)\n* Feudal Japan Party Bandits (basically rowdy teenagers in love)\n* **Yokai AU** (they meet much later, also there\u2019s demons. A coming of age story for monsters.) \n* **Zombie AU** (Haku survives the bridge and defects to Konoha after Zabuza\u2019s death. Zabuza gets kicked out of hell for being too rowdy a few years later. Hijinks ensue.)\n\n^(\\*Zabs is my preferred character, btw. I\u2019ve played Haku and it\u2019s a passable job so if your heart is set on the Big Boi we could talk about that.)\n\n**I\u2019m open to stuff outside this pairing** too, but clearly you can see this is where I invest all my time and energy because I\u2019m 25 gosh darn years old and cannot get over these tragic gays. Lemme know what pairings or friendships or plotlines you\u2019re into if none of this catches your attention and we can also work something else out.\n\nI have a lot of experience under my belt, so I\u2019d be **happy to play multiple characters** and double or triple or quadruple up if you wanna do something that\u2019s all you. There\u2019s only one caveat with that: **I\u2019m not super into traditional F/M romance**. Interesting forays into opposite-sex bromance and poly adventures are always a possibility, though. Otherwise I\u2019d like to stick to F/F, M/M, or some combination of the above and trans/fluid/agender/nb characters.\n\nSo yeah. Drop me a line. *Play barbies with me.* Please, please, I\u2019m desperate and I have all these starters to throw at your head\u2026..",

I am currently seeking a female longterm partner. I enjoy a Medieval/Fantasy setting, though I am more than willing to explore. I am not a professional writer but I believe I am pretty well spoken and think I can intellectually bring a lot to the table. I'm mostly looking for one-on-one world-building. I prefer to write in third person through Discord. NSFW is fun and I enjoy writing smut scenes, though I wouldn't want this to be the sole focus. I love a complex world and exciting plot with a sense of direction.\n\nI've had one longterm partner and we wrote together for a rather long time but fell off a bit. I am now looking for another. Please no one needy as I also have a career :) and I am really looking for someone who can just be fun. Reach out via message if you are interested.\n\nCheers!",

            "selftext": "Hello all! As the title of this thread suggests, I am looking for Roleplay partners who are interested in the fandom of The Orville!\n\nThis is the first sci-fi show that I\u2019ve really gotten into, with the exception of later seasons of Agents of SHIELD, and I really really love it. The characters are great, and the humor isn\u2019t forced or too shticky.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get on to the main part...the characters! I\u2019m looking to play as Commander Kelly Grayson, and I\u2019m looking for someone to play as her sarcastic ex-husband Captain Ed Mercer. I love this pairing because they\u2019re both so snarky and kind of ridiculous human beings, especially when they\u2019re together.\n\nI don\u2019t have any plots figured out just yet, but that\u2019s something we can talk about. Since it is set in the future and in space, there\u2019s plenty we can work with.\n\nSome info about me:\n* I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+.\n* I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply.\n* I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out.\n* I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does.\n* I would prefer literate partners.\n\nInterested? Excellent! Feel free to comment here or shoot me a message! I look forward to plotting with you! ",

I absolutely don't mind mistakes, everybody makes them, and out of character you can type however you'd like, but in the role-play please try to be literate.\n\nI'm craving something in the Game of Thrones universe. I'd really love to write Daenerys against Khal Drogo, perhaps Sansa against Ramsay if you're looking for something really dark.

            "selftext": "**Please do not message me if you're not genuinely interested in this.**\n\n\n**As of late, I've been getting a fair amount of messages about things that are completely irrelevant to my current interests, and while I fully understand how difficult it is to find someone for specific genres, it's really quite frustrating to go through several messages pertaining to things I'm not interested in.**\n\n\n\nI apparently live for *disappointment*. I was looking for LoZ: BotW, with a Sidon x OC pairing, alongside this, but interests shifted. I'll probably start looking for that again, as the RPs I got the last time seem to be slowing down a lot.\n\n**Keep in mind**, if we've already got a LoZ: BotW RP going, I'm *not* ditching it.\n\n* My character will be human, though that's probably a big ol' *duh*. I do have a very loose idea for a plot that can be messed around with, that involves my character in an Earth-based organization (based on the BPRD out of the Hellboy universe; it also involves her having some powers of her own, be they *magic-based* or mutant) and she more or less gets \"drafted\" to the Atlantis team for one reason or another, but nothing *solid*. While I'm open to suggestions, I *would* prefer to keep her involved with an Earth-based organization, and keep the magic/mutant powers aspect. I do have a few other characters I could use, one of them would fall in with SG:A a bit better, if the previously mentioned character sounds like too much.\n\n* As far as Wraith are concerned, I'm quite fond of *Todd*, closely followed by *Steve*, *Erik*, *Rhys*, and *Eddie*. I'm also open to *other* canon Wraith dudes (like *Shawn* and *Bob*), within reason (there are some that're just great big *no's*, like Michael), and even *OCs*, particularly ones that are *based* (at least as far as appearance is concerned) on the ones I've listed. Shocker, huh?\n\n* Yes, **long-term** too. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy one-shot wonders. But, if you\u2019re no longer feeling the RP, I can understand the desire to stop. I can also understand life getting in the way of replying. Just tell me if you\u2019d like to stop, or if you might not be able to reply. Definitely try to give me a heads up if you won't be able to reply soonish.\n\n* I only RP over **Discord**, **Telegram**, and *very hesitantly* Skype. You might be able to convince me to use something else, but I can just about guarantee I\u2019m not gonna use email, and I'm *very tentatively* open to using notes/PMs.\n\n* I do expect **NSFW/Mature/18+/21+** themes. Plot and character development over *one particular gritty subject*, obviously, but it's still expected and not something I'm willing to gut. If you're not of age, then *please* do not contact me.\n\n* I don\u2019t have many limits, and the ones I do have are rather commonplace ones that I feel most people share. Keep in mind that while I don\u2019t have very many limits, I am still rather *plain*. I\u2019m willing to incorporate certain *things*, as I have a few of my own that I enjoy, and I\u2019m willing to listen to what you might like as well, within reason. Grittier details can be discussed after contact details are given, or in PM. \n\n* I RP *third person*, past tense, and am capable of cranking out 12-14 paragraphs. Sometimes *more*, sometimes *less*, but no fewer than 2-3 paragraphs. I *don\u2019t* expect you to match me, but please don\u2019t throw one-liners at me. I need something to work with, and it's super discouraging to crank out 6+ paragraphs and get practically nothing in return.\n\n* I love details, and I love fluff, but what I really adore is stuff I can genuinely reply to. Give me things that convey emotion and I\u2019ll love you to bits!\n\n* I can double or do a split RP of your choosing, if either would 'sweeten the pot\u2019. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Keep in mind that I'm a little rusty when it comes to writing for *two* main characters, but I will most certainly try.\n\nI\u2019m online more often than not, at all hours of the day, so catching me shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue. Such is the life of an insomniac. At any rate, I hope to hear from y'all!",

            "selftext": "Hello r/Roleplay! I am posting here in search of a long term roleplay partner. Due to school, work, and other extraneous factors, I am left with only a single roleplaying partner on a plot that we are both losing interest in. So, in order to keep my creative flow going, I have decided to come here to search for roleplaying partners! It\u2019s been a long while since I\u2019ve gotten to do a fantasy prompt, and I have one that I\u2019ve been absolutely dying to use! However, a few things about me before I delve into what I want to roleplay specifically.\n\n**How I Write**\n\nI tend to write around 3-4 paragraphs with about 6-8 competent sentences each or more! This isn\u2019t representative of all my writing though, because when I\u2019m really into it or if the scene calls for it, I can write chapters worth of material. I go according to the flow of my partner. If they can start by keeping up with my pace, then I\u2019ll be happy. I only do third person writing. First person just isn\u2019t a viable option for me in roleplay anymore as it tends to be a factor that gets in the way of me writing more details. I love, Love details and I tend to fluff up my writing with them. I think that it helps immerse ourselves into the scenery in which we\u2019re roleplaying in a bit more, but if it gets annoying I will stop and write more effective and concisely. If you couldn\u2019t tell by this post, I like to ramble sometimes.\n\n**What I Write About**\n\nI tend to stick to my bread and butters: High Fantasy and Sci-Fi. However, I am looking to play out a fantasy roleplay at the moment. I tend to stay away from any roleplay rooted in the real world. I use roleplay to escape reality, not live it out all over again. This however does not mean I am completely opposed to the idea of a slice-of-life or modern fantasy roleplay. If you come to me with an incredible prompt and we\u2019re close enough, most likely I\u2019d be willing to try out something new. I love implementing action in my roleplays, and romance as well. Especially romance. I\u2019ll admit it, that\u2019s partly the main draw for me as a role player. The romance created by our two characters! However, I believe relationships in roleplay should develop over time though, from SFW cute stuff down to the nitty-gritty NSFW writing. If you are not comfortable with NSFW, I feel you would find a better partner in someone else. I couldn\u2019t live without a little bit of that NSFW to spice up the RP\u2019s I do LOL. So, if you\u2019re into fantasy romance roleplays with a pinch of NSFW, hit me up! \n\n**What I Want In A Partner**\n\nFirst and foremost: Age. You need to be at least 18 to roleplay with me. No if\u2019s, and\u2019s, or but\u2019s about it. As long as you are 18 and above I would be happy to roleplay with you! I also want someone who can write just as much as I do or more! I love being challenged and someone who can write more would motivate me beyond belief! Another really important factor for me is OOC communication. Communication of ideas and thoughts about a roleplay is crucial to its longevity and how well someone enjoys it. So, please be willing to talk with me about the roleplay, express any ideas you have when it comes to it, or just tell me if you don\u2019t like it and why. It will help both of us in the long run and make the RP last longer. While not required, I like making friends too, so if you want to just chat about life outside of the roleplay, I\u2019m down for that too. :)\n\nIf you are interested and read this all, please pm me with the word \u201cMuse\u201d in your subject line, and just sum up why you\u2019d be a good partner for me within a few lines. I look forward to all who will message me and thank you for reading through all of this. \n\n",

            "selftext": "So I've recently been feeling like doing a Noragami RP and I do kinda have a plot idea I wanna use for the RP. So here it goes I guess....\n\nAfter a horrible car accident Hiyori and her family got into Hiyori sadly didn't make it. Yato in grief and wanting to have Hiyori around makes her his shinki. Hiyori now being dead and not remembering her past adventures with Yato how will she adjust to being dead? And how will Yato and Yukine help her adjust to her new life?\n\n\nI just need someone to be Yato. I can be both Yukine and Hiyori if you wish but if wish to be both Yato and Yukine be my guest. We can also work out if we want the other characters in this RP. You don't need to be extremely literate or detailed I just wanna see if this story can work out. I'm 15 so I don't have an age limit. If you change your mind or don't wanna do this or don't feel like this will work out do not ghost me. Just tell me I won't make you do something you don't wanna do. I'm in EST just to let you be aware. I'm good with either Discord or email but with the school year coming up for me next week I can't promise I'll be completely active on discord but we'll see. I'm also looking to make a friend with my partner and obviously someone to talk about Noragami with.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading to the end and PM me if interested!",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

The game coming out kinda has me beyond hyped, so I figured roleplay could help with my excitement.\n\nYou can play any Marvel character that you'd like, but I do have a preference for a certain cat chick with white hair. I'm looking for romantic elements with some not so kid friendly themes. I ask that you be okay with that, and also be fairly literate. The more details the more betterer (Look at my perfect English skills). You also need to respect the hyphen! Spider-Man not Spiderman or manspider or pidersman.\n\nIf anyone is interested then please drop me a message. I swear that I'm not radioactive and that I don't bite.",

But I'm doing pretty good right now so here I am!\n\nI am looking for some partners for some quicker paced stories! I am really only looking for Discord partners, as I always have my phone with me and can use it even when my arms are giving me problems! \\[/FONT\\]\\[/centerblock\\]\n\n**Rules**\n\n\u2764 Partners must be 18+, I'm 21 so no minors! Sorry!\n\n\u2764 Must be able to reply at least a few times each week. I don't need you to tell me your schedule or when you're going somewhere, but just need you to be able to commit to the movement of the story.\n\n\u2764 Must be literate! I don't need every reply to have multiple paragraphs (not that I don't love it) but I do expect correct grammar and at least a few sentences.\n\n\u2764 Must be nice! We don't have to be friends, but I am chatty soo...\n\n\u2764If we are going to be doing a Fandom story, please be upfront in telling me how complete your knowledge is of the subject. I like to be sort of detail oriented.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guidelines**\n\n\u2764 Off the bat, I don't play straight guys in romantic situations. The only time I will play a straight guy is if the character is fully needed, or romance isn't involved. Every time I try to play one, they turn into a jerk.\n\n\u2764 Playing more than one character is fine. I will also double up if you want me to play a certain character, as long as I think I can play them.\n\n\u2764 I love romance. I just do, I'm sappy like that. This being said, I don't like stories where they just automatically are in love. This has a few exceptions, but most likely won't happen unless the story idea is really good.\n\n\u2764 I'm also interested in like family style stories, as far as non-romance goes.\n\n\u2764 I like to add real life themes into my stories. This is one, because I like drama, and two, because perfect stories in perfect worlds are no fun.\n\n\u2764 My only triggers are only triggers when portrayed incorrectly. These are mental health issues, invisible diseases, and suicide. I will call you out on these things and stop the story if they are misrepresented. This is because incorrect portrayal of these things is something I have to deal with on a daily basis. I call people out in real life too. Constantly.\n\n\u2764 Speaking of the above point, I do get sick quite often. This is just more of a heads up.\n\n\u2764 If you've read all of this, send me one of those cute ghost emojis the site has. I really love them.\n\n**Ships**\n\n(My characters will be italicized.)\n\n(Asterix by stories I'm craving.)\n\n\u2764 Star Wars\n\n* *OC* x OC \\*\n* *OC* x Poe \\*\n* *OC* x Hux\n* *OC* x Kylo\n* *OC* x Anakin\n* *Hux* x Kylo\n* *Rey* x Kylo\n* *Jyn* x Cassian \\*\n* *Finn* x Poe\n* *Padme* x Anakin\n\n\u2764 Star Trek\\*\n\n* *OC* x OC\n* *OC* x Jim\n* *OC* x Bones\n* *OC* x Scotty\n\n\u2764 Harry Potter\n\n* *OC* x OC\n* *OC* x Newt\n* *Remus* X Sirius\\*\n* *Queenie* X Jacob\n\n\u2764 Marvel\\*\\*\\*\n\n* *OC* x OC\n* *OC* x Hawkeye (Clint or Kate)\n* *Hawkeye* (Kate) x OC\n* *OC* x Doctor Strange\n* *OC* x Bucky Barnes\n* *OC* x Charles Xavier\n* *OC* x Hank McCoy\n* *Spider-Man* x Deadpool\n* *OC* x Daredevil (Comics)\n\n\u2764 DC\n\nMostly just looking for BatFam stories.\n\n*OC* x Jason Todd\n\n\u2764Others\n\n* *Roxas* x Axel (KH)\n\n**Story Ideas**\n\n(None of my ideas are too formed, to allow us to make it our own.)\n\n\u2764General Ideas That I'm Always Into\n\n\\-Modern Day AUs\n\n\\-Non-Modern AUs\n\n\\-Anything Cute Really\n\n\\-Canon-Divergent Stories that have basis in a Canon event\n\n\u2764 Star Wars\n\n\\-Matchmaker B.B.8 \\*\n\nA story where our good pal beebee-ate accidentally acts as a matchmaker. Beebee needs a tune up so Poe leaves him in the care of a new technician on the base while he goes off on a mission. What he didn\u2019t expect was that Beebee would grow quite fond of the new technician.\n\n(Or something like this with Milicent and Hux??)\n\n\\-Resistance Ben\n\nWhat if Ben Solo never trained under Luke and instead stayed with Han and Leia?

I am very open to suggestions, and love when we come up with everything together.\n\n\u2764 Slow Build Romance. I love to build a relationship and watch it go through things, especially when there\u2019s drama!! (I love cheesy things like k-drama and fluffy fan fiction oops)\n\n\u2764 I like both fantasy and modern settings, as well as historical things when the story is right.\n\nSome Stories I Would Love\n\n\u2764 Something set in the 30's, 60's, 80's or 90's\n\n\u2764 Something where I got to play a medically complex character. I have a lot of medical knowledge and love medical things, so I always love playing this type of character.\n\n\u2764 Something where they are meeting again.

I\u2019m a huge Harry Potter fan and I\u2019ve always loved roleplaying because it\u2019s always been fun to immerse oneself into a fictional universe. It\u2019s also a great way to write/improve my writing.\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t have many requirements other than being 18+ and being able to reply with a detailed paragraph each time. I\u2019m comfortable roleplaying with both men and women. I\u2019m really just looking to write our own story and throw in all kinds of ideas. Smut isn\u2019t an issue, and I definitely encourage romance between the characters! I\u2019m open to ALL kinds of plot ideas.\n\nI will write in whatever POV you prefer, I\u2019m used to third but I\u2019m comfortable doing any.\n\nMy preference is to have you roleplay as Draco Malfoy for my character, and here is my proposition: if you\u2019d like, you can play Draco AND also play yourself! In turn, I\u2019ll play a character to be with yours as well, and it can be whoever you want (even someone outside of the HP universe)! This way, we\u2019ll have even more length to our responses which is wonderful.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in roleplaying, please feel free to message me on here and we can figure out where to do our roleplay :) ",

My past 2 partners I\u2019ve been fiercely loyal to and I hope to branch out and make that bond with others! Anyway, down to the important details!\n\nPartner specifications:\n\u2022doesn\u2019t have to respond super fast (we all have lives)\n\u2022preferably between teens to young adults\n\u2022I prefer other students who can understand when and why I\u2019m busy\n\u2022someone who I can chat to about the RP and everyday life, not super strict!\n\nRP specifications:\n\u2022Absolutely any RP style is okay with me! I\u2019m used to very short, sharp, to the point responses but I don\u2019t mind long detailed ones either!\n\u2022please be dedicated to making the RP go somewhere! Set goals, discuss with me what you want to do! Be open \u263a\ufe0f\n\nRP topics/Fandoms: \nTopics:\n\u2022Modern supernatural beings (vampires, werewolves, etc)\n\u2022Ancient japan/Korea(romance, conflict, royalty)\n\u2022Ancient/modern Japanese supernatural (yokai, ayakashi,etc)\n\u2022School life with a twist (conflict, romance, badassery \ud83d\ude02)\n\u2022Or you can suggest a topic you think I might like \u263a\ufe0f\n\nFandoms: (prefer using OCs in fandom universes)\n\u2022Halo/red vs blue (avoid cmon characters as much as possible or use them as a platform to begin the story)\n\u2022Attack on Titan \n\u2022Mystic messenger \n\u2022Tokyo ghoul\n\nRP OCs and Canon characters:\nMaking OCs is a very important ritual to me and one of my favourite parts of any RP. I take hours and hours of time to make my characters in depth, believable, and essentially their own living breathing person. As such I will always have OCs in my roleplays, so if we do a fandom RP I would prefer a balance of OCs and canon characters! \n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of for now!

            "selftext": "Howdy r/Roleplay! I have an idea for a modern fantasy Role Play that is like to try.\n\nMy idea is in this would there are three main races, Humans, Elf\u2019s, and Were-Creatures.\n\nHumans: just basic humans, usually doing remedial tasks like custodial, factory, transport, food jobs, and other tasks like that.\n\nElfs: magic users, able to harness magic and conjure spells and familiars. They usually take the jobs of police officers, actors, teachers, and political figures.\n\nWereCreatures: these people have the ability to transform into four different creatures, WereCats (the smallest of the four, usually doing exterminator or maintenance jobs), WereFoxes (Trickers and Silver tongued Thieves), WereDogs (Also predominantly in the police force as they have the ability to track criminals), WereWolfs (Thought to be extinct).\n\nSo the idea for this Role Play is your character is an elf who works for the police force as a private investigator and one day you come home from a long shift to find that you  apartment has been broken into, with the perpetrator still inside. As the perpetrator tries to escape you manage to capture them and arrest them, but when the DNA results come back to see if he\u2019s a know criminal you find out that they are a werewolf. This starts a war as different gangs, factions, and groups of people try to kill him, and the reasons for will be discovered as the Role Play goes on.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading through all of that and I can\u2019t wait to Role Play with you! Hope to hear back soon!",

It\u2019s space western, so be thinking Firefly or Cowboy Bebop as a thematic reference. I\u2019m not going to be super active, expect a reply once or twice a day, maybe a few days without as I\u2019m an avid hiker and occasionally work ridiculous hours.\n\nAs for your character, I ask that they be able to start in a criminal setting: a prison world dedicated to mining, ran by a less than ethical corporation. It\u2019s not really a prison, more like a mad max wasteland where giant mining ships occasionally send down deadly robots to scoop up some \u201cinmates\u201d and put them to work in the nearby asteroid belt. If you\u2019re interested, go ahead and send me a PM. I\u2019ll try and get back to you when I can. There is also the possibility I will recruit you to play and the actual campaign, so if you like meeting new internet friends and rolling dice, this could be an especially go for it opportunity. We don\u2019t bite a lot. At least not hard enough to draw lethal amounts of blood... unless you\u2019re asking for it.",
