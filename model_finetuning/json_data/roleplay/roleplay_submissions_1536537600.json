            "selftext": "The Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme. Every character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\n[http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction](http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction)",

I've been into collaborative writing for about just as long and find it rewarding and fun.\n\nI'm seeking someone who enjoys chatting and plotting OOC and who likes to write anything ranging from sci-fi to horror and anything in between. I'm a fan of romance, but I don't like it being the forefront of my stories, but rather the icing on the cake, so I'd love it to be a part of what we create but it doesn't always have to happen. If it does occur, please let it be organic.\n\nI'd love to bounce ideas back and forth with you, and to note: I dig historical settings, but will do any setting. I don\u2019t do much canon work, but will easily attempt to, especially anything Game of Thrones related. I also write as Poison Ivy and Catwoman. I love drama, and anything with lots of angst and feelings. \n\nI typically play females seeing as to how I'm just better at it, though I'm not opposed to trying new things. I only write F+M romance. Also, I love screaming about our characters and creating things for us to enjoy such as playlists and graphics.\n\nI write third person, para/novella form and tend to reply quickly! I'd also like to write through email, but can do discord for communication. I'm looking for partners who enjoy writing and won't do one liners, unless we are both feeling it that day. I'm on EST time zone, as well, and want my partner to at least be over 18 seeing as to how I'm a millennial.\n\nI'd love to hear from you! PM me here if you\u2019re interested or have questions.\n\nTopics of interest: gritty neo-noir crime drama (think blade runner), modern western (think wind river), historical settings, forbidden romances, family drama, anything under the sun!",

            "selftext": "Nestled in the mountains there is a cave. A cave said by the local folklore to have not just any dragon but a greedy and fierce one that hoards piles upon piles of treasure. The tales tell of mountains of golden coins, jewels and even magical items that the dragon sleeps on. Of course, no one has ever been up to the cave or no one has come back to talk about it. Yet, people still tell the tales and some believe it. Perhaps it is just a story to keep children from wandering up the cliffs or maybe there is some merit to it. \n\nAnd who climbs to the cave now? Someone so tired of hearing these tales you head up to he cave just to disprove everyone? Drawn in by the potential riches that might be contained in the cave? Excited by the idea of there being a dragon and wanting to see it? Or even slay the beast? \n\nHeya everyone! I hope that got you interested in the story I would like to roleplay. There are two potential characters in this roleplay I can use. The first is the dragon which is actually an old female demon named Sur\u2019ath. She\u2019s greedy, materialistic and quick to annoy. However she\u2019s not a brute and might just have a use for a mortal who comes wandering into her lair. The next is Makoth the much more relaxed younger brother. He\u2019s probably the most laidback demon in the universe or at least he appears like it. His older sister lectures him about being a true demon and acquiring more power but he\u2019s much more content to lounge around somewhere in the mountains or hang around in the near by towns in some sort of disguise. \n\nEither we could roleplay with one of them, both of them or something in between. Romance is possible and optional. Good luck getting Sur\u2019ath to actually fall in love though. Both characters are available to any gendered pairings. \n\nThis is all intended for a medieval fantasy setting but if you have any ideas for adjustments I\u2019d be happy to listen!\n\nAs long as you can write a decent post there\u2019s no need to worry about length or grammar. I\u2019m not expecting perfect things from either of us. As long as we have fun and it\u2019s more than a line it\u2019s all good. If you have any issues with my posts or the plot while role playing just let me know!\n\nHope to hear for you soon!",

I don't plan on talking your head off or anything, but I just find it easier talking to people around my age.  Additionally, I like to joke around and I do enjoy the occasional NSFW scene (though it's not required) so I'd be more comfortable knowing that my writing buddy is 'legal'.\n\nAs far as writing goes, you can expect one or two replies a day from me, possibly more, depending on how much time/energy I have on a particular day and how demanding a particular reply is.  My preference is a partner who can reply daily or several times a week, but quality is more important than quantity and I'm willing to wait a few extra days for something worthwhile.  \n\nI live in the West Coast of the United States, and just transitioned to 'normal' working hours so I'm around/more responsive during my evenings.  I usually leave Discord up on my phone though in case you have a quick question/idea you want to run by me or just want to chat, but please be patient if I can't respond right away.\n\n\n---\n\n##What I'm Looking For\n\n* **Someone friendly and open-minded.**  \n\n* **3rd person and past tense are my preference.**\n\n* **For the actual writing, I prefer e-mail, Discord, Google Docs, or message boards/forums.**\n\n* **Something long term is preferred, but not a dealbreaker.**\n\n* **Detailed writing with decent grammar and punctuation.**\n\n* **Fantasy.**  High, medium, or low doesn't really matter to me.  I enjoy a good adventure or political setup and don't mind world building if that's your cup of tea.\n\n* **Science Fiction**, preferably in space or in some sort of setting where space travel is common or possible.  I admit my space/science knowledge isn't great, but I promise to do my best.  Something like magitech could be neat too.\n\n* **Modern/'Real' World**.  I can handle some slice of life, but nothing too mundane.  That said, I can do modern or real world if there's another element attached to it.  A different historical period, for example, or supernatural, or crime, or post apocalyptic, etc.\n\n* **Feudal Japan**, or something like it.\n\n* **Romance.**  I'm a sucker for that slow burn romance, what can I say?  I prefer romance to be an underlying theme in a bigger plot though, not the main focus itself.\n\n---\n\nThank you for your time.  If interested, send a PM my way and we can exchange contact info.  Otherwise, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day and wish you luck on your search.",

A world where werewolves, vampires, and the rare bit of ritual magic clash with the neon glow and cybernetic upgrades humanity had been expecting.\n\nPlayers are free to join **Division**, a government agency responsible for investigating supernatural-based crimes, the mega-corp **Argus**, an entity whispered to be funneling resources into preserving humanity\u2019s place in a world quickly outpacing it, or make their own way as an independent character or in one of Seattle\u2019s many gang factions (several of which are player-created and run!) We encourage the creation and pursuit of a personal narrative for everyone's character, and try to make it easy for them to progress and develop as they see fit, so long as what they have in mind is within the rules and lore, but we do allow some things to bend a little bit as long as it doesn't allow for an OP character.  \n***(We are currently looking for active Argus and Division members)***\n\nOur server features a detailed catalog of lore for the setting and a work-in-progress timeline from present day to 2175 to help players looking for world details they can employ to fully immerse their character creations into a setting populated by all walks of other players. We even have a map, featuring the general locations of all the places featured in RP channels.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our luck to have a relaxed, friendly community of players who are always more than happy to help a new member or write a new scene (no worries about being out of the loop!) New members are expected to treat others with the same respect, and are encouraged to contact a mod on the side if they have an issue with another player (so far we\u2019ve been very drama-free!)\n\nWhile this server does not have an age limit, we do warn new members that due to the tense nature of many story lines content may be regarded as 18+. NSFW content is to be left to private messages between the players involved, but violence, gore, strong language, and drugs are allowed in general server channels.\n\nJoin us for some roleplay fun, all experience levels are welcome!\n\n[https://discord.gg/6kwzyvg](https://discord.gg/6kwzyvg)",

            "selftext": "Hello, I'm currently looking for partners for a wide variety of plots I would like to do! Without further ado, I'll dive right into it!\u00a0\n\nA little bit about me:\u00a0I have been roleplaying for nearly four years. I'm usually available afternoons on most weekdays, and free on the weekends! I'll do my best to alert you if I am aware I'll be gone for an extended period of time.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n-\u00a0Someone who is detailed.\u00a0I'm looking for someone who puts detail and effort into the replies they send. I don't mind the occasional grammar error, I'm not too much of a stickler when it comes to it. I don't expect massive walls of text every reply, as long as you aren't constantly spitting out one line responses, I'll be happy! I tend to write two to three paragraphs per response, although I will do my best to match the length of what you send.\n\n-\u00a0Someone who doesn't mind playing multiple characters.\u00a0This one isn't too much a requirement as it is a preference. If you like playing several characters, cool! Otherwise, it's not a deal breaker for me!\n\nPlots I'm interested in.\n\nAlright, so here is the list of plots I would like to do. It's kinda long, so I've divided it into two categories.\u00a0Fandom and Non-fandom.\n\nNote: Anything marked with a '[!]' next to it means I especially want to do that one!\n\nFANDOM\n\nNote: I'm not to big on OCs, I greatly prefer if you play only cannon characters.\n\n[!] RWBY:\n\n- My character would be a thief, running around Vale. Eventually caught, but instead of being sent to a detention center, the headmaster of Beacon Academy has a better idea. He would be put under the watch of one of the teams of the academy. It could be team RWBY, JNPR, CFVY, Cinder's \"team\". Heck, I'd even be willing to give a team STQR approach. (They would be a bit younger, of course.) Maybe of unique team, composed of various different characters?\n\n- Same character as above, different scenario. What if all of the main cast of the show were put in one large house? Chaos would ensure, definitely. Chaos that my character would be thrown into. I'm pretty open to any character roster for this!\n\n- My character would be a new student to Atlas Academy. A bit of a troublemaker, until an dust incident results in him being put under the watch of Winter, much to his dismay. (Winter could be swapped out with Pyrrah, or even Glenda for this one!)\n\n[!] Overwatch:\n\n- My character would be a stowaway who ran away from home, sneaking aboard a cargo ship. For the last 6 months, he has been traveling the world this way, before accidentally coming across Watchpoint: Gibraltar\n\nAlternatively, he could be kidnapped by Talon.\n\nBorderlands:\n\n- My character would be the heir of a massive mining company. After a rebellious act of running away, he would crash land on Pandora, before being found by Lilith or Maya. This would take place after the main campaign of BL2 is done!\n\n- Or, my character could be a lowly thief on Pandora, before making the grave mistake of trying to rob Lilith/Maya/Athena.\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club:\n\n- A mysterious event brings the characters of the game into the 'real' world, leaving a destructive rift behind in their wake. Chaos ensures, especially now that Monika has access to the object she desires most\u2026\n\nOther characters I'm interested in my partner playing, but don't really have a plot for:\n\n\n- Samus (Metroid) [!]\n- Elizabeth (BioShock) [!]\n- Monika (DDLC)\n- 2B (Neir: Automata) [!]\n- A2 (Neir: Automata)\n- IQ (R6)\n- Piper (Fallout)\n- Female sole survivor (Fallout)\n- Cammy (Street Fighter) [!]\n- Power girl\n- Wonder woman\n- Lara Croft\n\nNON-FANDOM\n\nSo, I have a lot of non-fandom ideas. So I've simply listed roles I would be interested in my partner playing! If you would like to play any of these roles, just tell me which one and we can work a plot out!\n\n- Soldier [!]\n- Teacher [!]\n- Pilot [!]\n- Cop [!]\n- Security guard. [!]\n- Assassin.\n- Slime girl/other monster girl. [!]\n- Classmate(bully). \n- Android.\n- Kidnapper.\n- Serial Killer\n- Famous YouTuber. [!]\n\n\nIf you are interested in any of the plots or roles, pm me or leave a comment!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! Here I am again searching for a roleplay. I'm just gonna jump right into the things I'm looking for in a partner!\n\n- 18+ please. I'm in my 20s and I do like the occasional NSFW. \n- I write 3rd person past tense so I'd love it if you did to!\n- This is the part I cant stress enough. Please be able to write a minimum of a paragraph per reply. I tend to right 2 to 3 depending on whats going on and never under a paragraph generally. If you do one liners a lot please don't bother contacting me. \n- availability isnt a huge issue. I'd love a reply at day at the least but I understand life happens so if you cant reply every day then that's fine. Just let me know if its gonna be more then a few days!\n\nAlright...now onto the fun part. I've been roleplaying a while so I'm well versed in a lot of genres. My favorite tends to swing toward anything fantasy. Medieval, modern, urban...you name it and I'd be down for it. I've also done tons of others though, like apoclyptic, scifi, regular modern. So if you've got something you're craving then ask away!\n\nYou'd be my bestfriend if you like do M/M as well, that is my favorite pairing! I'm not opposed to other gender and sexuality pairings though so if M/M is not your cup of tea then that is fine. \n\nWith all that said, please tell me a bit about yourself when you message me. I wont response to messages that just ask me if I'm still interested/looking. I think a little thought put into your opening PM makes it look like you're more interested. Cant wait to hear from some of you!!",

I need people who are wanting to put up their roleplay ideas to give substance.\n\nI also need people to play with. I would love to hear your ideas, group plots or one x one. I like fantasy/sci-fi or historical fiction the most. I dislike playing with or as Cannon characters.\n\nMy idea for the server: an ever growing and ever changing server. RPs are broken into 4 catagories based on the suits in a deck of cards. Spades: slice of life/realistic. Diamond: original/plot ideas. Clubs: Fan based plot ideas. Hearts: NSFW plots.\n\nI have many bots in mind to support the server and not bog us down or distract too much.

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters.  I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Post-Apocalyptic, Sci-Fi** and **Cyberpunk RP** in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars, Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. I am not looking for group games or communities, nor am I looking for system games.",

No idea is a bad idea and if we can make it work out we will.  \n\n\nThis traditional, Play-by-Post setting offers brand new concepts and story arcs meant to challenge the norms of the medieval, High-Fantasy genre. An interactive game that\u2019s managed by dedicated staff, waiting to help you and your fellow writers, guide the story of a wholly unique world.  \n\n\n**Features**  \nPLOT FEATURES\n\n* A multitude of possibilities for adaptational evolutionary based powers.\n* Rich and impactful lore and individual storylines that affect the given history and unknown future.\n* Infinite character paths; players can create any sort of storyline they wish even one-shots.\n* Complex battle systems that allow players to fight freely but fairly.

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\nAs a change of pace, I am actually looking for two Specific Fandoms that I feel that I really want to RP. I usually post a generic post saying about how I am open to doing a hell of a lot of genres, which is still true, don't worry! Just this time, I'm looking for one or the other fandoms at the moment.\n\n- HALO : Halo has always been a number one fandom that I have loved to Rp in the past but have never really found someone perfect for the role. So for this RP, I can do alot of different themes/pairings so long as, said later, that the characters are indeed OC.\n\n- Destiny : Exactly the same as Halo, I absolutely love this game. To the point where I am a Lore Nerd as well as a Sherpa. I would love to find someone who would want to delve into the stories behind the game and the hundreds of years of lore prior to the first game beginning.\n\nAs always, here are my preferences:\n\n- I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nWith this being a specific post, I also ask of the following\n\n- Know what you're RPing! This seems like a common factor but please, just know what you're RPing. I dont mind explaining complex things but I dont want to have to turn around and explain what an ODST is or what a Warlock is. Please know what these fandoms are and have *some* knowledge about them, even if it's just the games.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

I also enjoy Naruto, with little to no limits with Character.\n\nI would also like Romance to be a must, preferably slow burn and built up. A few themes I also would like to do are Midieval/Fantasy, Dragon and Viking, Mythology, Supernatural, Slice of Life, Dystopian, and a few other things. \n\nSlice of Life is something that never entirely interested me, but I can willingly do so if someone is enjoyable to Roleplay with. And add dynamic and drama along with me.\n\nI don't mind Nsfw, I know it happens but I am all for fade to black. Sometimes I lean towards it if it becomes hectic. If any of my ideas interest you, feel free to message me, we can discuss ideas! With your message, add what you were looking to do, something about yourself, and if you're capable of writing a bit! Also, if you are comfortable with Nsfw or not, I could care less about it if it is plot based.\n\nCheers!",

If we end up working together and put enough effort into this, your character will end up being the bad guy for my future campaigns. (Note: no one else will read the roleplay, I will only use it as a reference for lore and narrative purposes)\n\nHow you go about amassing power is of little consequence to me. Do you want to gain political power and overthrow people in charge? Do you aim to start a war between two large kingdoms? Do you want to start a crime syndicate, rise to be the most powerful Boss in the world, then ascend to godhood by sacrificing all of your underlings\u2019 souls?\n\nOr do you want to play a grey character? Accomplish great things through terrible means? Kill the man in charge and make yourself the benevolent ruler?\n\nComplex characters appreciated! We can work on creating that character if you don\u2019t have one already.\n\nI will be keeping this entirely on Discord for ease of use.

            "selftext": " Hi all!\n\nI\u2019m Nan. Some of you might know me, but most of you probably don\u2019t. I\u2019m 25, an open and generally useless lesbian, and probably a lot of fun to be around if you like loud, excitable people who generate AUs like stars generate light and heat. And I, in this the year of our lord two-thousand and eighteen, want to find partners who are interested in Naruto roleplay.\n\nYes. *Naruto roleplay*. I know.\n\nI got back into Naruto a few years back and now I\u2019m itching for something a little more immediate than *sitting down to write a whole novel length fanfic all by myself.* With that in mind, I\u2019m looking for partners who meet the following criteria.\n\n* Competent, \u201cliterate\u201d writers who **don\u2019t mind short** posts when the action calls for it. I want you to know what you\u2019re doing and be able to write a decent amount when the situation arises, but **you don\u2019t need to write a novel each time** because I certainly won\u2019t.\n* Chill folks who are into the idea of posting when we can. Ya girl has a full time job and a full time relationship, so I can be a little on the slow side, but it\u2019s always with quality in mind.\n* You like to do cool fun romance plots that involve self-indulgent angst and a hard-earned happy ending.\n* 18+, because while I\u2019m **not** actively looking for NSFW RP, I\u2019d like to be able to get excited and share something racy with you on the raaare occasions that I write it for our pairings,.\n\nI have a confession to make now that you\u2019ve read this far: I\u2019m primarily here looking for people who are interested in RPing my pairing. **ZabuHaku** is the hill I\u2019ll die on, but I always see it pulled off in a creepy and unfortunate way that I just\u2026.do not get behind. I have several starters drafted for this pairing already because I\u2019m extra, and several more AU ideas I\u2019m willing to draft if you find them more interesting. Or we could come up with something totally new.\n\nI\u2019m happy to share any drafts you\u2019re interested in via PM!\n\n(assume bolded items = already drafted)\n\n* **Konoha Captive AU** (they survive the bridge and have to deal with the Complications that entails)\n* Feudal Japan Party Bandits (basically rowdy teenagers in love)\n* **Yokai AU** (they meet much later, also there\u2019s demons. A coming of age story for monsters.) \n* **Zombie AU** (Haku survives the bridge and defects to Konoha after Zabuza\u2019s death. Zabuza gets kicked out of hell for being too rowdy a few years later. Hijinks ensue.)\n\n^(\\*Zabs is my preferred character, btw. I\u2019ve played Haku and it\u2019s a passable job so if your heart is set on the Big Boi we could talk about that.)\n\n**I\u2019m open to stuff outside this pairing** too, but clearly you can see this is where I invest all my time and energy because I\u2019m 25 gosh darn years old and cannot get over these tragic gays. Lemme know what pairings or friendships or plotlines you\u2019re into if none of this catches your attention and we can also work something else out.\n\nI have a lot of experience under my belt, so I\u2019d be **happy to play multiple characters** and double or triple or quadruple up if you wanna do something that\u2019s all you. There\u2019s only one caveat with that: **I\u2019m not super into traditional F/M romance**. Interesting forays into opposite-sex bromance and poly adventures are always a possibility, though. Otherwise I\u2019d like to stick to F/F, M/M, or some combination of the above and trans/fluid/agender/nb characters.\n\nSo yeah. Drop me a line. *Play barbies with me.* Please, please, I\u2019m desperate and I have all these starters to throw at your head\u2026..",

Though, it takes place within the United States America, In a school located on the outskirts of New York City. This school, which is refereed to as the \"New York Academy of Hero Training.\" Thus, meaning that most event's that happen within the cannon MHA universe will most likely not apply to the roleplay, unless they are rather large, or global events. Event's such as All Might's battle versus All for One would most likely be heard on the news, though we wouldn't know much about it as we weren't there directly. \n\nIn this roleplay, everyone will be able to have a quirk, be it custom or not. Though, the class you are put in is up to the staff. You are still able to choose your year though. We also allow for people to apply for a teacher role, which they are able to train other students in classrooms, and live their own personal life outside of the school. Every student has their own dormroom chat. \n\nYou can learn more at: https://discord.gg/fHHSuN7\n\n",

Duncaster operates through the work of four factions, each faction is unique in ability and morale, but all have the same goal of making Duncaster the best it can be. \n\nAll the factions work together in relative peace and respect to one another; despite the conflicts and some differences that struggle to be overlooked.\n\nThe mechanists of Infamous Thunder are constantly busy with improving and building new machines, while the druids of The Blooming Cycle try to stop pollution from the endless combustion of the factories. The Warlords of the Seven-Fingered Fist of Dominion are conservatives, insisting that the old ways work the best. Then there are the mages of New Eras Blessing, who attempt to gain powers, which would put everyone to awe.\n\nWe are searching for roleplayers over the age of 18, with some experience and an open mind, who want to have fun in a relaxed community.\n\n**Come and join us:**\n\n[https://discord.gg/vAUgmHe](https://discord.gg/vAUgmHe)",

            "selftext": "**Hey my fellow RPers!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

            "selftext": "Hi! Here I am again with another little advertisement, in hopes that I can drum up some more rp for myself! I'm disco, and I attend college full time in Oakland, California (in the US). I still find time for roleplay, and am always so sad and bored when I don't have any going on. I'm gonna skip digging into my self-introduction further for now, since we can introduce ourselves more thoroughly once we've exchanged contact information or set up a PM thread or what have you.  \nMy preferences for roleplaying locations are as follows:  \nDiscord &gt; Google Doc &gt; PM &gt; Skype or Reddit Chat &gt; Other\n\nI prefer to roleplay with folks 18+, due to the sensitive nature of being an adult myself, and because I occasionally do like to dip into content that is unsuitable for minors. I am willing to play as any gender (usually), any sexuality (usually), and any faceclaim (usually.)  \n\n\nOn the subject of Original Settings:\n\nI'm very interested in high fantasy, steampunk, sci-fi, horror, adventure, romance, modern magick, dystopias, mysteries... essentially, you could propose just about any setting to me, and I might just accept it. Right now, I'm particularly craving stories set in high fantasy, modern magick, and post-apocalyptic settings. If you read on until the end, I'll provide some basic ideas that I've had running through my mind for a while.  \n\n\nOn the Subject of Canon Settings:  \nI love, love, love to roleplay in fandom settings- but I'm interested in too many fandoms to list them all! Instead, why don't you just propose whatever fandom you're interested, and if I'm familiar enough with it to roleplay in it, I'll probably accept! I tend to prefer doubling when I play with canons, but am fine with us each only playing one character at a time, too. I  will roleplay Canon x Canon, Canon x OC, and OC x OC! That is to say... everything's fine by me! At the moment, I'm very much craving Danganronpa, Legend of Zelda, Harvest Moon, A Series of Unfortunate Events, IT (2017), The Long Dark, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Borderlands, and Brutal Legend. (Have you yet sensed a theme?) As I said though, I'm willing to accept just about any other fandom too, so if none of this is to your liking, feel free to suggest something else! Finally, I am pretty good at picking up just about any character- so if we're doing something with Canons, don't be afraid to ask for a favorite! (I'm more likely to accept a request if you're willing to double and return the favor of course\\~ ;3)  \n\n\nAs mentioned above; Original Setting Ideas/Prompts:  \n(I'll just leave a cute little list.)  \n \n\n\\--Modern Fantasy :: Urban Spirit meets a  Nature Spirit--\n\n Somehow a nature spirit of some variety has gotten lost  in the Big City, or perhaps, vice versa. Worlds collide, etc etc!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--Modern  Fantasy :: Modern Magic-- \n\nI'd like to rp in a setting where witches and  wizards have day to day jobs and what not. I've got an idea for a  character who works in a candy store... and have a first post written for her, too!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--Modern Fantasy  :: Catching Faeries-- \n\nPerhaps a human character has been meaning to  catch a faerie to prove they exist... but what happens when they're  successful?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--High Fantasy :: Faeries (or  Fallen Stars) Being Caught Some More!-- \n\nI'm so into the idea presented  by the movie Stardust! Something along those lines- magical creatures  getting captured or rescued or this or that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--Supernatural  :: Ghost in the Cell(phone) ((hahaha im not funny))-- \n\nA ghost is  inhabiting your new phone!!!! Or computer! Or some other device!  Shenanigans ensue!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--Supernatural ::  Train Ghosts?!!!--\n\n You're a crust punk or some other train-hopping  troublemaker. They're a ghost of someone like you who had worse luck and  fell under the rails. Now you're stuck together!  \n\n\nAnyhow, I've chewed off your ear (...your eyes??) for long enough now, so! I'm gonna hit post, and hope for the best! Thanks for your time, and I hope to hear from anyone (either here or in a PM) soon!",

            "selftext": "**I wanted to repost with the VERY clear explanation that I have no interest in anything NSFW. If I was interested in that, I'd go to a NSFW roleplaying subreddit, of which there are many for you to check out if that's what you're looking for! Thanks!**\n\n**Who I Am:**\n\nHello /r/Roleplay! I just stumbled upon this community and after racking my brain this morning for some creative juices, I decided to give this a shot. \n\nI'm a college student (21, any partners need to be at least 18) and I'm involved in a lot of creative classes and writing is a big passion of mine! \n\n\n**Why I'm Here:**\n\nI have a short story assignment coming up, and spent hours desperately trying to will an idea to life. It wasn't working, like you might have imagined, and I thought I'd try something different. \n\nI need to get into the habit of daily writing, and a roleplay keeps me accountable to that goal. It's also a bit more fun than just answering writing prompts. \n\nI'm looking for a relationship where I'm able to exercise these creative muscles that don't get as much use as I might like. \n\n\n**Background and Experience:**\n\nWhen I was quite young I used to roleplay all the time. I probably wasn't any good, but I'd have a few going actively at once and I'd be a part of role-play forums. \n\nThat being said, I haven't even thought of this community in years. At least 5 or more. So I'll be rusty! \n\n\n---\n\n**Genres and Expanded Universe:**\n\n*I don't do fandoms or expanded universe roleplay.*\n\nI do, however, do - \n\n* Fantasy (high, low, dark, urban, etc.)\n* Romance (maybe. You'd have to sell me a bit on that one)\n* Mystery and/or Crime\n* Post-apocalyptic\n* Science Fiction\n* A mash up of any of these! \n* Probably more genres than listed here. \n\n\n**Quality and Quantity:**\n\nI'm looking for decent quality and decent quantity. \n\n*Quality -* \n\n\nI AM an English major, so please write grammatically correct. Otherwise, I won't be horribly bothered. Advanced writers are amazing, but newer writers are great too! I'm not calling myself advanced or perfect, and I'm not expecting you to be. \n\n*Quantity -*\n\nI'm expecting a good paragraph minimum. If we're in discord and there's a dialogue happening, a line or two is fine. If email, that paragraph is always the minimum. More is great! But preferrably don't write me an entire novel to read. \n\nIf you write more, I might not match your length, so keep that in mind. If I write more, I don't expect you to match mine. \n\n\n**Dedication and Commitment:**\n\nThis can be short or long term. I'd prefer a longer term arrangement to keep me accountable and creative all semester, but short term works for me as well. \n\nI'm a student. If something happens and you can't reply for a day, that's cool. Some days I might not be able to. I'd appreciate heads up if possible, but if not it's cool. However, I do want a daily arrangement for the most part.\n\n\n**Mediums:**\n\nDiscord is my preference, but email is cool as well. Those are MY ONLY platforms though, sorry! \n\n---\n\nI look forward to writing with you! ",

There\u2019s holographic technology robotics, and space faring ships. Vakia is ruled by a foolish king, who gains his entertainment by watching his slaves barbarically fight to the death against Vakia\u2019s best and worse beasts and demons. \n\nThe central coliseum, known as Debtar, (Named after the king himself, the old cocky son of a bitch.) is its largest and grandest structure, is the final destination for many slaves.   Debtar is able to create thousands of different environments via solid projections, one day you\u2019ll be fighting large two-headed giants in the deep jungle, then the next day (if you survived) you\u2019d be fighting an Earth Yeti in the cold mountains.   Here\u2019s where are subsequent heroes are located, the bottom most floor, underground being held in separate cages, waiting to be thrown into the fray, may Vakia have mercy on these lost souls. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n\nHello! I hope you enjoyed that beginning segment to my RP idea, \u201cTin Men, Flying Snakes and Robotic Spiders, and the Journey of Four Gladiators.\u201d (That is what the title is, yes). This is the second time I\u2019m attempting something of this caliber, so if you\u2019ll have me, I\u2019ll explain my idea.   \n\nI\u2019ve wanted to always be a dungeon or game master, controlling everything that my group encounters, and I thought to why not do it now. I will be everything you encounter in Vakia, from a street beggar to the king himself.   The way combat would work is simply based off of RP, no stats. (This is definitely subject to change, if I can figure it out.) You\u2019ll have to work together and use your brains and not just your brawn. (Obviously, you can\u2019t one hit these monsters.)  \n\nI\u2019m asking for 4 literate Roleplayers to join. I will make an edit to this post if or when it\u2019s filled.  DM me with a short example of your rp ability, and any questions you have. After that I\u2019ll give you a character sheet, and I\u2019ll get you into the discord server!  If you have any ideas to how I can improve as a DM, then please comment or DM, I\u2019m open to all ideas and criticism.  I hope to see you in Vakia!\n\n",

            "selftext": "I have been thinking a lot about isolation and just how sprawling humanity is. It seems like it is almost impossible to get away from it all.\n\nWhat if that all changed though, what if you found humanity gone tomorrow. What would life be like....what would relationships be like for the few left behind? How tightly would you cling to that one other person out there. I have a few ideas in keeping with that.\n\nThe Lakehouse: Everyone was gone, whether it was zombies, nuclear war, or perhaps you just woke up one day with everyone vanished. Survival was your only concern...civilization crumbling around you. Until you found it, a beautiful lakehouse surrounded by large old trees. Solar panels, a quaint and fecund garden and everything that was needed to live a good life...but was the owner planning on sharing? How did he survive.\n\nThe island: Perhaps civilization didn't collapse, maybe it is just so far away that it may as well have. Washed ashore on a distant island somewhere in the pacific you need to survive together.\n\nA mysterious realm: You woke up here, you can't remember how. The fields are too vibrant, the sky too blue...everything is just too perfect. There is not a soul in sight....what brought you here and why? It would be so easy just to stay here the rest of your days.\n\nI would ideally be looking to play across from someone interested in doing world building as a team exercise though I do have lots of ideas for the three scenarios.\n\nI have also learned to love the idea of my partner playing someone famous (A celebrity, singer etc) whose wealth fame and power no longer mean a thing. Whose drastically changed life warrants deep soul searching.\n\nI would be open to Scarlet Johanson, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Emilia Clarke or others\n\nHope to hear from you soon",

            "selftext": "**Hey my fellow RPers!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

            "selftext": "Allow me to start this off with saying, for the people that don't recognize this quote, I'm looking for an RP based in the universe of destiny. Despite all the flak the games have gotten over the years, I still find the universe and lore appealing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for someone that's a master at all there is to the games, not at all. I'm just looking for someone to have fun with, and to help me put together a wonderful story.\n\nAll that out of the way, I'm looking for something more surrounded around romance and adventure. An original story, between two characters. I'm completely open to dark themes, and bending the rules of the universe just a bit to fit, if need be. I'm flexible in these regards, and I'm open to doubling as well.\n\nAs for me, I prefer to keep my posts rapid fire. I find about 1-3 paragraphs per post enjoyable, and I'd prefer to stick around there so the story can move along. Other than that, I can't think of much else that needs to be said. Drop me a message if you're interested, I check Reddit often, so I should be able to get back to you rather quickly.",

It makes her an oracle of sorts with the ability to vaguely see future outcomes and events. \n\nWhen she was born she had the marking of the oracle which was in written text from centuries ago. The marking could be in her eyes (blue with a yellow ring that traces the pupils). She wouldn't be able to see events without conducting some sort of ritual.  But perhaps when she was born into the elven kingdom and word got out immediately that she had the markings.. she was was abducted by members of the a secret society belonging to the king. They put silver(anti-magic) bands on her wrist to prevent her from using the magic unless it was for their (typically military) gain. \n\nSo essentially they are using her. But to keep this from being a powergaming situation... she will be a pure and innocent person with no ill intentions towards anyone so if she ever did break free she would not use her powers for bad things and also when she does use her powers it makes her incredibly lethargic for days.  This would make it so that she can only use her powers a few times a year.\n\nLooking for someone who might be inspired to make a character for this story and roleplay it with me.\n\nDiscord only.

A lot of it is based from taking Japanese (and some from other mythologies and some original) mythical creatures and reimagining them , and mixing the culture of Japan in the Heian period of Japanese history with modern technology to world build a unique setting, but all this is just explaining it lightly. \n\nThe setting fits into the following genres: high/epic fantasy, dark fantasy, science fantasy, space opera, and in some cases dying earth \n\nInfo on the setting here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vzpYYSTGClELDZNWIwamdr2JOpP_7m1RZunY_sg87E\n\nPlease be prepared to deal with some pretty dark issues, if anything triggers you please let me know. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required(but welcome), but please be detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

            "selftext": "Howdy there. Archipelago is a roleplaying hub server that features three different worlds that have three different genres. The No-Name Archipelago is the unique setting for the server, and is a multiversal hub world, meaning that anything (so long as it isn't stupidly OP or a joke character) is plausible and negotiable, no matter the genre. Otix is the Fantasy world with it's own digital map, where the technology goes as far as WW1 in very rare cases, but the magic ceiling is infinitesimally higher. And finally, the most recent addition, the Chrysoberyl Nebula, a cosmic body that holds four distinct planets, and has plenty of room for player made planets.\n\nIf you enjoy having tons of options for variety, and plenty of room to carve out your own story, you're going to love this place. Our staff operates on a council-like democracy, and we tend to defer to player votes when it comes to large server changes. We are also offering mentoring sessions for people who want to improve their roleplaying and/or English, and that does mean we are quite open to newcomers to the roleplaying community.\n\nWe do have NSFW content but that's not the primary focus, and that kind of RP is kept far away from standard RP. We also have an OOC NSFW chat for whatever purpose. Just a fair warning.\n\nCome on by and take a peek. ~ Bojangles\n\nhttps://discord.gg/zdSn7Ye",

She had been seeing a boy she liked named Scott, and they were both quite willing to go off on their own and raise their new son together. But right after she was done resting up in the hospital, she blacked out and woke up a few states over with no memory of the trip and a massive headache. The only things she had were her precious guitar, a warm and sturdy blanket from her bed, and her newborn son. A note on the guitar case said to her \"Go and be someone else's problem, you and your son are dead to us\". \n\nShe's been homeless ever since, it's a tough life but she makes it work. She plays on the street for what little money she can, and manages to just barely feed herself and her son. But will you be the kind person who gives her a helping hand? Why don't we find out?\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\nHey there! Thanks for reading all that XD. I had this idea a long time ago, before I even discovered Reddit, and it's just now come back to me and I thought it might be interesting to try it again and see what happens. \n\nIn case you couldn't be bothered to read the above stuff, the plot starts with a homeless teenage mother who's been separated from her soulmate and dumped far from home by her family. Where we go from there is kind of up to you, I was imagining and hoping for some kindhearted person would help her out in somehow as that's what happened in my original version and I loved it, but I'm open to it going in other directions as well if you've got different ideas.\n\nWith that out of the way, I think that's everything. Of you'd like to talk some more, feel free to send me a PM and we can get down to buisness. I'm gonna be going to bed in a couple hours, but I'll be online for a while longer and I'll respond as soon as I can in any case.\n\nHope to see you soon!",

The slums of the city, lovingly called The Ashtray, are loaded with unemployed supernaturals just trying to survive in a world that wants them dead. Your character, preferably male, is in the police force, been in it for years now.

Dead set on getting revenge, he loses sleep over capturing this masked killer. Somehow, in a strange turn of events, your character and The Ram team up when your character start noticing that a recent influx of crimes seem to be connected, and The Ram thinks that these crimes might have to do with the incident that killed his parents.",

I am hoping for a woman who is over 21 and interested in some 1x1 stories.\n\nI have been role-playing in various forms for quite a long time, but never got into this kind until the last couple of years and have not had much practice. But, this is how I do things:\n\n- I write in third person and can do both book style and text style formats. \n- I can write fairly lengthy responses(two to four paragraphs), but not very quickly. I seem to be too much of a perfectionist sometimes. I am okay with smaller responses too. \n- I only have experience playing an OC(who is very confident and something else that got my post banned the last time I tried to submit this) and want to keep it that way.\n- I have only played in original or alternate universe type of settings, but I think I could be in a Fandom universe as long as I was familiar with it.\n- I'm not interested in doubling at all, but will create/use NPCs to help move the story along. \n- Any mature content do's/don'ts I will be glad to discuss with a potential partner.\n\nI am mainly interested in some sort of engaging plot with romance involved , which would include adult themes. I do not fade to black, but I feel the relationship between our two characters is just as important as the steamy interactions. I am fine with OOC talk to help with our story and to build a rapport with each other. I am willing to use discord or email for role-playing or OOC talk. I hope to find a long term partner that can respond at least once a day, but I understand if life gets in the way, just send a message saying so, that way I'm not left hanging. I will do the same. \n\nIf any of this interests you or you have any other questions, please feel free to message me. Thanks! ",

I also don't mind having a normal chat and making friends but I don't push that.\n\nAnyway, my ideas revolve around mental illness. We can come at it from two different angles basically, but it should somewhat depend on the type of illness your character (or mine) is afflicted with, be it schizophrenia, depression or something more obscure. So the two options are,\n\nRealistic - (Ex.) Character A is suffering severely from depression, but silently. Their friend/significant other/etc, character B, accidentally stumbles upon their attempt at suicide, leaving the heart of the roleplay to be character B attempting to help character A, or A dragging B down a dramatic and complicated path.\n\nFantasy - (Ex.) Character A has schizoprenia and anxiety issues, panic attacks are especially awful. One day, character A suffers just that and begins to see horrifying hallucinations, but as A is experiencing this world of nightmares, there is one apparition that's friendly and calms them down, character B. However, this apparition doesn't leave like the rest.\n\nThey're just crappy examples but hopefully they get the point across haha. If anyone's interested in this weird type of roleplay, PM me and let's figure out where to discuss it at. Oh, and I'm also interested in exploring this concept in a historical or medieval fantasy setting.",

And I'm not a sucker for word count or length- it really doesn't matter to me, and shouldn't to you either.\n\nI'm looking for someone around my age range-late 20s to even 40s.  And yes, I only roleplay on Discord.\n\nI also prefer writing in the third person and past tense- and so should you.\n\nI only play heterosexual females though, think this is a crucial tidbit. I like romantic plots the most. I like to write about things, and I really do like to challenge the boundaries of my creativity.\n\nI would like to find a buddy who shares the same sentiment. Writing romance is fun, don't you think? But I wish I can find someone to actually explore it with- to write more than just the usual. Who can write a story with me and expand the usual fluff with a little bit of twists. Someone whose characters want to be swept off their feet.\n\nI want for my words to once again have passion. I like to dive deep into every human emotion and blur those lines. Imagine, just imagine, the stories we would tell.\n\nI like the following themes:\n\n\\- Real-Life/ Slice of Life (city, university, politics, military, medical etc.)  \n\\- Marvel|DC (Comics/MCU/DCEU)  \n",

If I was interested in that, I'd go to a NSFW roleplaying subreddit, of which there are many for you to check out if that's what you're looking for! Thanks!**\n\n**Who I Am:**\n\nHello /r/Roleplay! I just stumbled upon this community and after racking my brain this morning for some creative juices, I decided to give this a shot. \n\nI'm a college student (21, any partners need to be at least 18) and I'm involved in a lot of creative classes and writing is a big passion of mine! \n\n\n**Why I'm Here:**\n\nI have a short story assignment coming up, and spent hours desperately trying to will an idea to life. It wasn't working, like you might have imagined, and I thought I'd try something different. \n\nI need to get into the habit of daily writing, and a roleplay keeps me accountable to that goal. It's also a bit more fun than just answering writing prompts. \n\nI'm looking for a relationship where I'm able to exercise these creative muscles that don't get as much use as I might like. \n\n\n**Background and Experience:**\n\nWhen I was quite young I used to roleplay all the time. I probably wasn't any good, but I'd have a few going actively at once and I'd be a part of role-play forums. \n\nThat being said, I haven't even thought of this community in years. At least 5 or more. So I'll be rusty! \n\n\n---\n\n**Genres and Expanded Universe:**\n\n*I don't do fandoms or expanded universe roleplay.*\n\nI do, however, do - \n\n* Fantasy (high, low, dark, urban, etc.)\n* Romance (maybe. You'd have to sell me a bit on that one)\n* Mystery and/or Crime\n* Post-apocalyptic\n* Science Fiction\n* A mash up of any of these! \n* Probably more genres than listed here. \n\n\n**Quality and Quantity:**\n\nI'm looking for decent quality and decent quantity. \n\n*Quality -* \n\n\nI AM an English major, so please write grammatically correct. Otherwise, I won't be horribly bothered. Advanced writers are amazing, but newer writers are great too! I'm not calling myself advanced or perfect, and I'm not expecting you to be. \n\n*Quantity -*\n\nI'm expecting a good paragraph minimum. If we're in discord and there's a dialogue happening, a line or two is fine. If email, that paragraph is always the minimum. More is great! But preferrably don't write me an entire novel to read. \n\nIf you write more, I might not match your length, so keep that in mind. If I write more, I don't expect you to match mine. \n\n\n**Dedication and Commitment:**\n\nThis can be short or long term. I'd prefer a longer term arrangement to keep me accountable and creative all semester, but short term works for me as well. \n\nI'm a student. If something happens and you can't reply for a day, that's cool. Some days I might not be able to. I'd appreciate heads up if possible, but if not it's cool. However, I do want a daily arrangement for the most part.\n\n\n**Mediums:**\n\nDiscord is my preference, but email is cool as well. Those are MY ONLY platforms though, sorry! \n\n---\n\nI look forward to writing with you! ",

We have no real requirements to join other than \"Read the sidebar/Discord and follow the sub rules\", and we don\u2019t get nitpicky on writing style or posting format (after all, we see roleplay as something that should be fun and joyful, not an English class). We also don\u2019t mind if you\u2019re a beginning roleplayer or an experienced one - we can help you learn the basics if need be and questions are always welcome if you have them!\n\nWe also have an OOC subreddit [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mRFAFBV) for those wanting a more social experience along the side (also open to any questions, if you have them). Generally, this will be an easier and quicker way to communicate with our members of the sub and us moderators\u2026who are generally on for most of the day and even at night.\n\nSome helpful little Q&amp;A for questions you may or may not have: \n \n**\u201cIs there a resource where I can look up and read canon lore for your sub?\u201d**\n\n*Why, yes! We\u2019ve created a handy [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EYvflKQBPB2VQRTQbZVygz0-XGrskfGeHG2FLCgn-wU/edit?usp=sharing) that outlines the story and setting for our sub.*\n\n\n**\u201cI\u2019m new to RPing battles and have only really done social RP\u2026 do you have any guidelines on RPing fights?\u201d**\n \n *Yes! To ensure compliance with the sub rules and fairness towards all members, combat roleplay must be actively moderated by our staff.*\n \n \n**\u201cOkay, so\u2026 I got started on creating a character! I\u2019m not sure about powers to choose, though\u2026\u201d**\n \n*If you have any questions and aren\u2019t sure about something, feel free to drop by our Discord Server or mod message us on anything (from character names, character brainstorming ideas, events on the sub, etc)! Seriously, we don\u2019t mind answering any inquiries.* :)\n\nAgain - if you\u2019d like to join, we\u2019d love to have you!\n\n~The /r/MasksRP Mod Team\n",

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow writers!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my roleplay post. Let me start off by introducing myself \u2014 I\u2019m a man in his mid-20s who (like many of you) is seeking to find a roleplay partner. I've been somewhat busy due to a combination of work and grad school, but as of late, it has been truly refreshing to connect with so many other like-minded people in this community of writers. Given that I\u2019m expecting to have a bit more time on my hands in the upcoming weeks, I figured I\u2019d reach out again, and hopefully find a few more mature, talented writers.\n\n**Preferred Genres:**\n\nMy writing tends to span a wide variety of genres\u2014including science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic modern fiction. My writing has spanned both a personal as well professional nature, and as a result, I\u2019m always up for experimenting with new genres and writing styles. Recently, I\u2019ve been dabbling a bit more in fantasy themes; however, I\u2019m still a novice when it comes to taking on high-fantasy themes.\n\n**Writing Style:**\n\nI will humbly admit that I tend to be a voracious writer, and as a result, my posts frequently range in the 3-4+ paragraph range. Granted, there are certain occasions when a shorter length is more desirable (especially in conversational, or dialogue-intensive scenes)\u2014and this is certainly something I implement when necessary. I\u2019m a strong believer in quality over quantity, and I\u2019m hoping to find a fellow writer who has an appreciation for packing a large quantity of details in a condensed post (within reason).\n\n**Collaboration:**\n\nFor me, the pre-writing, collaborative stage is as enjoyable as the writing process itself. I know that some writers prefer to jump head-first into writing the story itself\u2014with minimal discussion. Based on experience, this approach is due to the fact that some writers fear that too much discussion may \u201creveal\u201d too much of the plot prior to writing. While this is certainly a valid point, it is important for me to mention that my discussions do not pertain to plot; rather, they pertain to exploring the characters\u2019 backstories, emotional orientations, cultural groundings, and other such factors. It\u2019s more with regard to developing a creative discourse with my writing partner to truly immerse\u2014and \u201clive\u201d\u2014the experiences of our characters. To me, it is this level of exploration and collaboration that truly make roleplaying a much more engaging process as compared to solo writing.\n\n**Writing Platforms:**\n\nI prefer to write my stories via email; however, I strongly prefer to collaborate with my co-writers via a text IM platform such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or Discord. This is largely because an IM platform allows for a truly conversational, back-and-forth discourse about the story (rather than a static series of isolated messages via email). I also find that my best stories tend to emerge with individuals with whom I am able to cultivate a strong intellectual chemistry with\u2014and as a result, this has led to several long-term stories. I would be absolutely thrilled to find other writers in this subreddit who are also looking for long-term stories.\n\n**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 \\[ideally over 21\\].** This is not to suggest that my stories always involve adult themes. In fact, many of my stories do not involve NSFW themes at all. However, I feel exponentially more comfortable discussing literary ideas with fellow adults. As a result, I set this as a strict limit, and I have a zero tolerance policy for those who lie about their age. As a result, I will be firm for only this particular issue\u2014 ***do not contact me unless you are 18 years of age.***\n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.** As I mentioned above, I\u2019m seeking a writer who is truly interested in forming a long-term collaborative writing partnership. This means not only focusing on issues pertaining to our story at hand, but also to broader issues concerning our writing as a whole. Ideally, it would be nice to connect with other working professionals who are looking to use writing as a creative outlet, of sorts.\n* **Mutual respect.** As I\u2019m sure is the case with many of you, I simply cannot be in front of the computer 24/7 due to real life responsibilities and obligations. Because of this, I hope to find a writer who is committed, yet flexible\u2014someone who is willing to maintain open communication while at the same time, respecting one another\u2019s autonomy.\n\nIf this post has captured your interest or imagination, then by all means, I would love to hear from you! In your post, please tell me a bit about yourself, and your background in writing. Hopefully we can get a conversation going, and weave our way into writing a story together.\n\nThanks for your time; I hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "I am no stranger to writing in anyway, quite the opposite, actually- I'm very experienced in such a wide variety of roles that I've played everything from a child-like, blubbering, disabled big man obeying every word of his \"evil\" master to a cunning underworld crime boss. I've done every genre from medieval fantasy to apocalyptic future, and I've enjoyed myself every letter of the way. But, I'm wanting something new and different, something I've never done before.\n\nSure, there's a lot of roles left to try out, but I want a role-play that is even structured differently than others. I'm thinking of an improvised role-play, without a set ploy beyond the starting setting. A small group role-play (Maybe up to 5 other people at most in order to keep everything organized and easy) where us 3-6 all make it up as we go along. We start with a simple direction, then shape the world through our posts as we build the story. You could make up a kingdom that your character calls home and drop it in, then no one could dispute- and someone could add on to it, saying that it was once a war-craved land that thrived on the suffering of others -until this event happened that changed everything because of that ruler- so on and so forth. Yes, this sounds like it could become an absolutely horrible mess, which is why I am only searching for experienced role-players who can be trusted with creative freedom. And even if you're not very confident in your creative ideas, I plan to have a separate OOC chat where we can all get to know each other and toss around ideas that you might not be so sure about.\n\nIf you're interested in the role-play, or just want to hear the plot out, shoot me a message and I'll get back to you ASAP! Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "First off, all characters that I want to roleplay are going to be 18+. I have to make that super clear before I continue.\n\nSo I am looking for a female partner to dive into the world of college sororities and fraternities. So you should have a little bit of background on those topics to roleplay with me but if you don\u2019t just ask! We can do a little crash course.\n\nI want this to be set at a massive American university where the Greek System of Sororities and Fraternities dominates campus. The drama between groups, the process to get into the groups the days-in-days-out functions of the organizations.\n\nWe have so many options from the top sorority full of the prettiest girls on campus to the sorority know for the girls that always are down for fun, to the fraternity full of athletes, the one full of nerds, the frat known for drug-use.\n\nOne role I had in mind\u2026 you play a freshman girl coming onto campus. She\u2019s a legacy in the top sorority meaning that her mom was in that sorority when she went to college. I play the president of the top fraternity on campus. First off, pledges aren\u2019t supposed to date anyone in a greek group.. Second off, my character might he dating the president of your sorority! Imagine the drama as our characters get to know each other!\n\nThat\u2019s just one idea. We can discuss more options. This is clearly going to be long-term. I can chat on here or on Discord. Let me know!\n\nI have years and years of playing experience. I look for longer posts to get us started and then typically do paragraph responses as we get into the play.\n\nThe way I see it, details are what matter most here. Since we can't physically see or touch one another, I need to be able to feel you through your writing - and you'll certainly feel the same from me.\n\nI hope you message me back letting me know you are interested. We need to talk about a few things in this role before we get going. I love using photographs for faceclaims, outfits, settings, etc.\n\nHope to hear from you soon! Xx Daniel\n",

That means I am very busy: there will be days when my brain will be fried and served with pickles. Against previous expectations, I have found time for a bit more writing, so I thought to bring this little request back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTICE: I am going through acute grief with depressive symptoms. Writing may help some days or be impossible at others. I'll never ghost, though. My muse may also be very fickle, so I'm open to short stories too!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for two writing buddies, who understand that I am no longer able to deliver novella type posts. For me, a writer can describe feelings and actions in few words, and this is what I seek right now. Meaningful but laid back realism, having fun, being able to relax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be at least over 18, because mature themes will surely arise: not as a form of compulsion, but as an organic part of the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Adult women** is what I am looking to play at the moment, in MxF relationships. Romance and Drama are vital for me, as moving, evolving character studies of some sort. I am not interested in Anime or Furry, sorry about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis a Fandom Request, so without further ado, a small relevant list:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Worlds:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Lord of the Rings (Massive craving!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Characters I have some experience with*:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElia Martell\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBarbrey Dustin\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBethany Bolton\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLyanna Stark\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJayne Westerling\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRhaella Targaryen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJoanna Lannister\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLothiriel, Queen of Rohan\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a myriad of OCs I have for the above Fandoms, so please ask me about it. The canon list is not exhaustive either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading all this and I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "I am looking for a long-term slice-of-life romantic penpal. While I have several different ideas on my reddit profile I had an idea (see below) that I hope someone could get on board with. I tend to write several paragraphs in 3rd person, and I also enjoy chatting with who ever I am roleplaying with while we write. Typically that means writing via email and chatting via Google Hangout. I have become open to Discord as well. If the beginning of my writing/prompt sounds like something up your ally I hope you'd consider messaging me!\n\n\\--- --- ---\n\nPressing the red button on his phone Eric hang up the call. What was he to do now? His brother had bailed on him for their cross country train trip. It wasn't even a good excuse. He had started talking to a new girl and they were supposed to have their first date in 2 days. She couldn't meet any earlier, and his brother was afraid that if he waited the week until he got back that the girl would be long gone. Eric had rolled his eyes at that. He was now left paying for an empty train seat from San Antonio to Chicago. While on the plus side that meant that maybe no one sat next to him, he didn't really want to go the trip alone. On the bright side his brother was having to eat his $300 plane ticket to get from Washington to Texas. Pondering what to do in the 24 hours before the train left Eric's gears turned. Remembering a movie he once saw he opened his laptop and began typing feverishly into reddit:\n\n*Subject: Female Travel Companion Wanted - Leaves in 24 hours!*\n\n*Text: This may sound crazy, but the internet is the place to be crazy right? I love trains and had recently planned about a week long trip on Amtrak with my brother. Well he bailed on me so I am left with an empty seat next to me. The train leaves in 24 hours from San Antonio and I would love someone to go with me. I know what you are thinking - a week on a train with a stranger. I know that is a crazy idea, but I'm just throwing it out there. Consider it an adventure.*\n\n*I'm up for just about anyone to come along for the ride at the moment. I do prefer females though, sorry dudes (but I'm sure you understand!). As for where you live. Well, obviously since we are leaving from San Antonio somewhere in Texas might be best, BUT if you are crazy like me and want to fly in for this adventure as long as we can be at the train station at 7am tomorrow I'll gladly pick you up at SAT (the airport). I'll cover your train ticket, I'd just ask that you cover the rest - your food, souvenirs etc.*\n\n*For those who have never been on a train we get to share a pair of really big nice reclining seats in a coach car. They have foot rests, plenty of storage, and plenty of room. This is no airline seat. You can spread out. Yes there are power outlets, yes to a bathroom, and there are a pair of dining options on the train. So I guess this isn't just an adventure with a stranger, but maybe cuddling up with one too. The trip to Chicago will take about 2 days, and then I don't really have a plan from there. I've never been to Chicago, so I want to explore some. Whether you fly home, train home, or hang out is up to you. I honestly dont' have a return ticket purchased at the moment, but plan to train back after a few days in Chicago.*\n\n*So there is my pitch. If that intrigues you at all, if you want a new adventure, or if you have any questions just message me. Believe me I love trains enough to go it alone, but watching the country go by from a train window is magical. It isn't like a plane trying to get somewhere fast, and doesn't have the pressure of a car ride. You sit back, relax, and just left life go for a bit. Hope to hear from someone. I hate to admit it, but I'll be watching the little envelope here on reddit like a hawk. Hopefully your message will turn it red and we can chat about logistics!*\n\nAfter posting on several subreddits Eric leaned back in his chair, put his hands on the top of his head and sighed. Well he had certainly given it the old college try. He really doubted that anyone would reply to such a crazy, no insane, idea as to go on a trip with a stranger. Especially an open ended one like that. He just knew he needed to get away from life, from stress, and from the reason that he phone was currently on silent. He just needed Eric time, and if Eric time involved a cute nerdy girl who either had a sense of adventure or passion for trains, at this moment he didn't care about the rest. He would love the experience.",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind). (Admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am mainly looking for as a partner. And hopefully one who has no limits, like me.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me! And please, do PM. I have yet to get used to that new Reddit chat.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have to urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)",

This ruins the budding friendship of the two heirs to the kingdom Princess Serena of Adornia, and Prince [YC] of [your kingdom]. \n\nThe prince is raised to have a seething hatred towards the kingdom of Adornia and a bloodlust for the royalty's heads. He trains for most of his childhood to become an extremely gifted swordsman and leads the army of [your kingdom] with great pride. He is respected by his men and subjects but can never gain the approval of his father.  Meanwhile in Adornia, Princess Serena has dedicated her life to her studies and has decided the war is useless because she assumes the Prism was never stolen by her father or anyone from Adornia, but rather was either stolen by someone from [your kingdom], or has been kept by the prince's father in secret. \n\nAfter 12 years the princess and prince are destined to finally meet again when [YC] leads a raid on one of Adornia's outlying cities which Serena and several others are traveling on business. They do some damage to the group before the prince opens the carriage and pulls Serena out, as he lifts his sword to kill her they lock eyes and [YC] hesitates a moment to long, shocked to see her his childhood best friend, and is wounded and captured by Serena's remaining guards. \n\nSerena, seeing an opportunity, does everything she can to stop her father from having the prince executed and frequently visits his holding cell trying to make friends with him again but she is met with the prince's harshness for whatever reason you decide and is unsuccessful at making peace with him. Serena pleas for the prince\u2019s release, but is hindered by her Father\u2019s Hand, who presents the idea of a Life Debt. \n\nIdeally, this is a religious or spiritual concept in the prince\u2019s kingdom which states that if a life is saved by direct action of another, the rescued party must repay this action. Even if that means remaining beside their rescuer until the end of their days.  Knowing that it would be social suicide, not to mention possibly damnation of his soul, the prince agrees, vows his sword to Serena, and begrudgingly is forced into social interaction with her. \n \nFrom there, Serena begins work on trying to mend their friendship in hopes of finding a permanent solution to the war and ending it forever. The longer the two are together, the more they remember the friend they once had, and now see the person beside them; falling in Love all over again. \n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, please send me a PM. Looking forward to hearing from you. ",

            "selftext": "Long the forest stood there. Decades into centuries. It grew dense, rich and the farmlands around it always strangely bountiful. But cities grow and the farmlands began to get swallowed up by buildings. The trees began to slowly be cut away. And then a woman appeared. She was no normal woman that much was clear. For one she wore not a scrap of clothing and did not blink at the stares. Her ears tailored off to a subtle point, and the ground under her very feet appeared to bloom green and vibrant. Men nearby felt themselves drawn, tempted by her presence, the weaker willed enamoured. A nymph. A dryad to be exact. And deep in that forest her tree rested, at risk with the slow destruction of the forest.\n\nSo here is a loose idea I've had recently. Something that could go a few ways. Perhaps it's more medieval fantasy setting with other creatures. Perhaps even modern, her presence a secret until forced out to save her forest and tree. What must she do to live? Maybe someone will work with her. Or maybe be the one who controls the destruction. Holds the axe over her so to speak should they locate her tree. Hold her hostage? Take her in?\n\n18+ Please, I am late 20s myself. NSFW is fine if it fits with the story and i havr virtually no limits. Gradual romance encouraged. I love details and can write multiple paragraphs but quality over quantity. Just more than a few lines. I can play multiple characters if necessary. Email is preferred but I may consider other things. I dont require instant replies we have lives, a couple a week would be nice though and chats welcome. I'm sure I've forgotten something but drop me a message if interested and let me know which route you envision going down or any questions you have. \n\nAlso open to other fantasy and not etc so feel free to throw other plots at me and try tempt me.\n\nOh and GMT time zone so I'll check in often when I'm awake.\n\n\n\nPosted on another account I've lost the details for the other day so of you happened to message before please get in contact again.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

Despite all the flak the games have gotten over the years, I still find the universe and lore appealing.

I'm just looking for someone to have fun with, and to help me put together a wonderful story.\n\nAll that out of the way, I'm looking for something more surrounded around romance and adventure. An original story, between two characters. I'm completely open to dark themes, and bending the rules of the universe just a bit to fit, if need be. I'm flexible in these regards, and I'm open to doubling as well.\n\nAs for me, I prefer to keep my posts rapid fire. I find about 1-3 paragraphs per post enjoyable, and I'd prefer to stick around there so the story can move along. Other than that, I can't think of much else that needs to be said.

I believe my first post may have come across as too selective, so I\u2019m trying once again. \n\nI write in third person and would prefer you do too. I would like a partner who is literate. While I do understand that spelling and grammar mistakes do happen, I would like if you had a decent concept of them. (I\u2019m not expecting perfection.) \n\nI\u2019m very flexible on what genre(s) I will write. Let me go ahead and say that Sci Fi and Slice of Life are not genres I\u2019m familiar with, but I do not mind attempting! Also, I\u2019m not familiar with a lot of fandoms, but I\u2019m not against studying a certain fandom in order to write it with you. ( : Fantasy/Medieval is my bread and butter. I also like post-apocalyptic as well. \n\nI have too much time on my hands, so I can usually post to any RP pretty fast depending on the circumstance. I don\u2019t expect you to reply as fast as I do, or be as free as I am. While I do enjoy a good back and forth, I totally understand that \u201creal\u201d obligations definitely come before any Rp ones. \n\nIf any of this interests you, feel free to message me here for a little bit to discuss any finer details and then we can move over to a preferred medium. I personally like Discord, but I might use kik if it\u2019s a must. \n\nGood luck on your RP journey and I hope to hear from some of you. ",

While our site offers a one-of-a-kind searchable database with hundreds of members to browse with their likes and dislikes posted for all to see, our Discord has become a storytelling portal and a community effort. Our mission may be to connect people around the world and let their creativity shine, but for the last year, our Discord has grown into something more.\n\nOur server offers both one-on-one and group advertisements to help you find your perfect partner, as well as a whole section of writing help channels to encourage you to become the writer you've always wanted to be. We boast useful sources, writer's block busters, and a section to ask your burning writing questions where someone is always around to answer! In addition, we post a daily question to make you think about your characters, your writing style, and how you tackle a story. As a perpetually active server, there's almost always someone around to chat with, bounce ideas off of, or relax from a stressful day.\n\nDon't believe us? We asked our members what their favorite parts of RPC were:\n\n\"The friendly community, post-a-plot, and the way the list is set up is my favorite!\" \n\"The community is the best part. Everyone is really nice.\" \n\"I enjoy how welcoming everyone is, and helpful as well.\"\n\"Post-a-plot is a great way to get a new idea, and there's plenty of writers to indirectly learn from.\"\n\"The community itself is my favorite part, even though I do like thinking over the questions of the day.\" \n\"It's crystal clear that RPC is a very loving commuity where there's a place at the table for everyone!\"\n\n\u2728 https://discord.gg/A476RXk \u2728",

            "selftext": "&gt;*The night was calm, the northern breeze came down from mountains blowing down into the valley where the sea of tents stretched as far as the eye could see. The scent of campfires filled the air, as did the soft buzz of conversations and the heavy steps of these men in Armor. They were called Astarte and although to the untrained eye of this young woman they all looked the same, the color patterns of each armor told her they were all from different legions. Just as she and her brethren were all from different cabals.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Right now the massive armies had gathered on the world of Zolea, one of many planets in the Eden cluster. Worlds that this woman had long called home. Right now, the leaders of the two armies were in long and detailed peace talks. And for now, things seemed to be going along smoothly. Looking up into the twilight sky, hazel eyes watched as the stars of the great void came into view. Lighting up the darkening sky, the woman knowing each light she saw was the sun of another world. A thought that made her smile.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The heavy steps of power armor drew her eyes away from the heavens, her thoughts back to what was happening around her. Slowly, she dipped her head in a low bow as she greeted a small group of Astartes crossing her path. The sight of her making them stop, studying her as she had studied them so many times before. She must have been an odd sight, a human woman who came up to about their chest. For like them she to was a warrior, though her oaths had been given to Eden. Her home. Her people. A warrior known as a Warden; men and women enhanced in their own way to guard the worlds they called him.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Though, unlike them, she was not a mound of meat and muscle. No, she was tall but slender. Thin but strong muscles hidden under flesh made her fast and agile. While she knew one of these men could snap her in two, she would like to see one catch her. The thought brought a smile to her lips, something that seemed to draw the attention of one of the iron giants who took a step towards her. An action that caused the woman to roll her shoulders some, making them look strong and proud as she tilted her head in simple curiosity. The action causing long auburn color hair to fall into her face, shadowing her bright hazel eyes.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cDo you need something Honorable Astarte?\u201d The words flowed from her lips, almost sing-song in its tone. The words pausing the Marine in his steps.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cHow about a name?\u201d The deep baritone of his voice, cracked by the vox on his suit, made her chest tighten a bit. Like the tone itself shook her to her core.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cSpero, of the Statera Cabal.\u201d She pauses some then added. \u201cAnd you?\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething a bit different than my other request. While I can see this turning into a darker roleplay if the Peace Talks fall through and war is declared, I mostly see this as more of a light-hearted romance RP. Something to help build upon the Imperium and these worlds coming together. Details can be added and talked about in private message.\n\n**I would like for this to be a Warhammer 30k RP (we don't have to fallow the canon storyline 100% and make up our own Alt Time Line if you wish.)** *If you are willing to play canon characters that would be amazing!*\n\n**Some basic info about me \\[ooc\\]:**  \n\u2022 Feel free to call me Fox\\~  \n\u2022 Roleplayer of \\~15 years  \n\u2022 I live in Louisiana \\[CST Timezone\\]  \n\n\n**ABOUT ROLEPLAYING:**  \n\u2022 18+ only (Players and Characters), with a love of Darker and more Mature roleplay.

            "selftext": " \n\nHello, fellow writers!  \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my roleplay post.  Let me start off by introducing myself \u2014 I\u2019m a man in his mid-20s who (like many of you) is seeking to find a roleplay partner.  I've been somewhat busy due to a combination of work and grad school, but as of late, it has been truly refreshing to connect with so many other like-minded people in this community of writers.  Given that I\u2019m expecting to have a bit more time on my hands in the upcoming weeks, I figured I\u2019d reach out again, and hopefully find a few more mature, talented writers.\n\n**Preferred Genres:**\n\nMy writing tends to span a wide variety of genres\u2014including science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic modern fiction.  My writing has spanned both a personal as well professional nature, and as a result, I\u2019m always up for experimenting with new genres and writing styles.  Recently, I\u2019ve been dabbling a bit more in fantasy themes; however, I\u2019m still a novice when it comes to taking on high-fantasy themes.\n\n**Writing Style:**\n\nI will humbly admit that I tend to be a voracious writer, and as a result, my posts frequently range in the 3-4+ paragraph range.  Granted, there are certain occasions when a shorter length is more desirable (especially in conversational, or dialogue-intensive scenes)\u2014and this is certainly something I implement when necessary.  I\u2019m a strong believer in quality over quantity, and I\u2019m hoping to find a fellow writer who has an appreciation for packing a large quantity of details in a condensed post (within reason).\n\n**Collaboration:**\n\nFor me, the pre-writing, collaborative stage is as enjoyable as the writing process itself.  I know that some writers prefer to jump head-first into writing the story itself\u2014with minimal discussion.  Based on experience, this approach is due to the fact that some writers fear that too much discussion may \u201creveal\u201d too much of the plot prior to writing.  While this is certainly a valid point, it is important for me to mention that my discussions do not pertain to plot;  rather, they pertain to exploring the characters\u2019 backstories, emotional orientations, cultural groundings, and other such factors.  It\u2019s more with regard to developing a creative discourse with my writing partner to truly immerse\u2014and \u201clive\u201d\u2014the experiences of our characters.  To me, it is this level of exploration and collaboration that truly make roleplaying a much more engaging process as compared to solo writing.\n\n**Writing Platforms:**\n\nI prefer to write my stories via email; however, I strongly prefer to collaborate with my co-writers via a text IM platform such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or Discord.  This is largely because an IM platform allows for a truly conversational, back-and-forth discourse about the story (rather than a static series of isolated messages via email).  I also find that my best stories tend to emerge with individuals with whom I am able to cultivate a strong intellectual chemistry with\u2014and as a result, this has led to several long-term stories.  I would be absolutely thrilled to find other writers in this subreddit who are also looking for long-term stories.  \n\n**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 \\[ideally over 21\\].**  This is not to suggest that my stories always involve adult themes.  In fact, many of my stories do not involve NSFW themes at all.  However, I feel exponentially more comfortable discussing literary ideas with fellow adults.  As a result, I set this as a strict limit, and I have a zero tolerance policy for those who lie about their age.  As a result, I will be firm for only this particular issue\u2014 ***do not contact me unless you are 18 years of age.***\n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.**  As I mentioned above, I\u2019m seeking a writer who is truly interested in forming a long-term collaborative writing partnership.  This means not only focusing on issues pertaining to our story at hand, but also to broader issues concerning our writing as a whole.  Ideally, it would be nice to connect with other working professionals who are looking to use writing as a creative outlet, of sorts.\n* **Mutual respect.**  As I\u2019m sure is the case with many of you, I simply cannot be in front of the computer 24/7 due to real life responsibilities and obligations.  Because of this, I hope to find a writer who is committed, yet flexible\u2014someone who is willing to maintain open communication while at the same time, respecting one another\u2019s autonomy.\n\nIf this post has captured your interest or imagination, then by all means, I would love to hear from you!  In your post, please tell me a bit about yourself, and your background in writing.  Hopefully we can get a conversation going, and weave our way into writing a story together.\n\nThanks for your time; I hope to hear from you!",

My name's Spare, I'm 26, and currently looking for some new partners to write with! I'm a pretty easy guy to get along with and honestly I'm not a stickler for activity, word counts, or...well really anything. RP is supposed to be fun right? So why stress over it! \n\nNormally, I venture into a pretty long rant about what I like/don't like, what my style is, and a few little plot points to get things started. Recently, I've actually typed out a document that's got basically everything I want to say in it and more which you can find below. I'd like to go ahead and say thank you first and foremost for reading through it because it is a bit wordy! That's honestly my fault as during my time on here I've been rather...restrictive or not clear in what I'm looking for in a partner, and so to clear up any confusion, I've got it all typed out.\n\nRP AD: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pv7ph7DUYLOrJJ9mnROBOntwUAB3A91NuUKDXxJjYlg](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pv7ph7DUYLOrJJ9mnROBOntwUAB3A91NuUKDXxJjYlg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThat's got everything in it from writing styles to plot points! Take a look and if you feel like we may be able to match writing wise, just shoot me a message and we'll work something out! Thanks again!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "The galaxy is in chaos, my friend. After the republic suffered the great collapse, everything has gone downhill. What was once a powerful nation was torn apart. What once was a single nation is now dozens of different smaller nations and kingdoms, with some areas controlled by pirates or corporations. \n\nEver since the capital fell those 200 some years ago, different groups have been grasping for power. Those that want power gather soldiers and weaponry, ships and resources. \n\nSometimes, you can find freelance bounty hunters and mercenaries. You\u2019ll get plenty of tough guys and gunslingers, sneaks and technicians. Rarely though, you\u2019ll get a caster, you might know them as mages. \n\nThe galaxy is full of dangers. Dangerous wild animals, corrupt police, murderous thugs, pirates, you name it. Unfortunately for you, you\u2019ve ended up in a very dangerous part of the galaxy. The question remains; who are you? \n\n\nI hope you enjoyed my prompt. To summarize, I\u2019m looking for a roleplay in a world based heavily in sci-fi and fantasy. This roleplay will have plenty of roleplay and action, along with room for character development. \n\nThis world will have several of the \u201cstandard\u201d fantasy races like elves, orcs, and goblins. There will also be plenty of aliens species to interact with. \n\nTo repeat the question from the end of the prompt; who are you? I\u2019d prefer if you play a human, but you can play something else if you\u2019d like. I\u2019d also prefer if your character had a good reason to not know too much about the galaxy. If you wanted to do a classic \u201cI was pulled here from another world\u201d type of background, feel free to originate from earth! You can be whatever really, it\u2019s up to you. \n\nIf I\u2019ve caught your interests, or you have questions, feel free to send me a direct message. Once we\u2019ve got things ready, we can move over to discord. Hope to see you soon!",

At the moment we are looking for more roleplayers to hopefully expand our small community :D\n\n\nThe year is 2689. After the First Mutagen War which began during the latter stages of the 25th century and ran until the early 26th century, mankind had lost its title as the apex predator of the world. Its been almost 50 years since then, and humanity is ready to fight back. We've already established a safe zone in the heart of the United States and have begun to enter into Europe.\n\n\nWe are looking for experienced roleplayers capable of producing a usual amount of at least one paragraph (3+ sentences). We include a GM and dice-based system and are open to help those not accustomed to it, so please dont think you're under qualified. We are a group based roleplay and would like that those joining are mature enough to experience adult-esque subjects.\n\n\n{&gt; A detailed world\n\n{&gt; An occupation system - you decide the path your character takes\n\n{&gt; An ever-growing world set in a post-apocalyptic Europe\n\n{&gt; A huge array of weapons, armor, and items\n\n{&gt; A unique combat system\n\n\nPlease message me with your discord username and some information about yourself if you're interested in joining :)",

            "selftext": "__Other prompts on my history are always open for the taking since I don't really have a steady role-play partner at the moment. So if you don't like this one maybe there are other stuff of mine you'd be interested in. It's also an open invitation for everyone I've role-played with but never hit it off, maybe I haven't even responded to your PMs... or if you have something that'll be a great fit with my style, just send in those orange envelopes__\n\n***\n\nWith a heavy sigh, I counted to three before temporarily drowning myself with the slick wet lime. \"Okay... that's worth a nice brunch right there,\" I mumbled to myself, setting the empty thumb-sized glass near the edge of the bar. Burning almost half of my savings for this trip's already bad enough idea but consciously spending a shot that costs as much as the really cheap shirt I deprive myself on buying is a whole 'nother level of fuckery in itself. But then again, I'm dumb and I'm kinda lonely, that's why I agreed to go on this trip. *'So I could have a dumb story to tell anyone at parties,'* I thought but the *dings* of notifications from my four-year-old smartphone reminded me that, as expected, it'll be one regretful memory instead.\n\n*\"Ah\u2014screw this,\"* I cursed, dragging myself out of the club after six more nice breakfast sandwiches worth of shots and a text saying my two *bestest* friends found something else to do (or is it *someone*?) so I might as well bring myself to the place we rented if I'm not keen on joining 'em. And it's been a rage-filled blur, walking down the damp, brightly-lit streets with annoyance painted on my face, passing European cars and people with an accent different from mine. My feet and my dissolving anger brought me to a pub because... why not? Not long after that, I found myself sitting on a stool that barely contained my ass with a bowl of *fries* and a bubbling drink in front of me.\n\n\"Jesus, don't they have anything besides *sexy football*?\" I said, my tired hand cradling my head, not minding if anyone hears... and there's really not a lot who would anyway. I sat on one end of the bar, a corner where a large flatscreen TV hung imposingly overhead. It was airing the match of *Saracens* against *Bath*... or at least that's what it says. Not a lot of people were in that part of the spacious pub. A group of rowdy guys is chatting a booth behind me while several men wearing something a little more formal are situated a couple of seats to my left. \"Huh, no gear...\" I mumbled, exhausted and feeling the alcohol slowly wash away from my system. \"Looks painful.\"\n\nPulling my eyes out of the scene, I fished my phone out from my black windbreaker, gathering all the other options in my head. Or really... just the *other* option. Doing a quick google search, I scrolled through several pages, debating whether or not should I even consider doing that. And I thought about it, you know. I thought about it a million times, even before the trip started. Hiring an *escort* to show me around and... stuff. But as always, it ended up with one sentence. \"Oh... of course, they're expensive.\"\n\nI then looked up after hearing what sounded like a chuckle. My eyebrows knitting in hazy confusion. \"Uh\u2014excuse me?\" I asked the man smirking down at me. \"Did you say anything?\"\n\n***\n\nAs the title and my sample intro above suggest, this role-play will revolve around a royalty hooking up with a clueless tourist and what happens after that\u2014a whirlwind romance? A bitter-sweet ending? We'll have to see. So I'm looking for someone who could play a masculine-leaning character to play opposite mine, the unsuspecting tourist.\n\nBut I don't want to limit your character to be just a prince or a royalty. You can be a really big *soccer*\u2014I mean, *football* star, or that hot, tech billionaire, an A-list actor that will have my character thinking, *huh... this dude's oddly familiar*, that bad boy rockstar, or pretty much anyone with the same kind of notoriety.\n\nBeyond the fluff, smutty, and the chatty nature of this role-play, it doesn't have to be the only thing going on for this. I also like the play of *consequences*; effect on your character's reputation being 'seen' with me and mine figuring out what is up with this weird, weird dude and *oh my god, I'm going back to counting boxes and cleaning grocery aisles in my country in 5 days, should I tell him what I'm feeling?!*\n\nSo send in some orange envelopes so we could discuss the whole thing further, continue the prompt if you like, or if you got some nice ideas we could add to this. Please include __your name/character's name__ + __RL age__ + __title of this roleplay__ as the subject line just so I know you read the whole thing.\n\nThanks for reading.\nHope to hear from anyone soon xx",

            "selftext": "Hey there. Hope everyone had a decent Monday. As always, I'm looking for more partners for some great writing. Right now I'm mostly feeling my fandom loves, so that's what's posted here; however, you can go check out my original ideas in my previous posts if you find me and my writing style of interest. \n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation, and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, unfortunately, and kind of particular. Typos? Not a problem. Some mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. I edit for a living, though, and it's ruined me for polite society, so I'm looking for someone of like mind with dedication to the language that keeps me hooked. \n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. \n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* I use email. I don't use any instant messaging, because honestly, it's less convenient for me. I will do PM if necessary. \n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Final Fantasy X(Yuna)\n* Final Fantasy XII(Ashe)\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)[Before session 7, preferably.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. (Sorry to the people who think my list is \"short.\" Again, I'm looking for the things that currently interest me, because this is a hobby, not a diplomatic mission.) If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you! \n\nPlease note that I do not respond to comment replies under any circumstances. PM only.",

Yet we\u2019ve been peaceful. There\u2019s only around 50 of us and we keep to ourselves and live off the land and don\u2019t hurt travellers. You are the Daughter or the Grand daughter of the king. You\u2019re in the woods. Maybe with a armed escort maybe alone and you are attacked by your rival city. I\u2019m in the area and I get to you just before they hurt you, and I take you back to my camp and then your kingdom, and the king asks me to help in the war against the rival kingdom.

The human race had depleted their resources on Earth, life is unsustainable there, so they turned towards space. The Zenith relies on mechs and pilots who controls the ship, gathers materials from dangerous planets, all with the one common goal to survive.\nWe use a homebrew dice system to keep the server challenging and balanced, with a focus on player-versus-environment (PVE). For those who enjoy a more slice-of-life roleplay, we also offer the chance to play as a citizen of the Zenith, which allows you to play in the city, while the pilots fight to protect and restock the Zenith at each planet.\nWe are looking for members who are above 18, and who are open to having fun in a versatile server. We hope to see you join the ranks of the Zenith soon, and help us fight to survive.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/5zUHXyB",

            "selftext": "Hey! First off let me get right to it, my name is Sinn (pen name, it just stuck). I have been writing almost all of my life and roleplaying for around fifteen years now. I have extensive experience in the general online roleplay community which has led to me knowing exactly what I'm looking for in a partner. If you feel that we'll mesh together well please message me, tell me a bit about yourself, fandoms you're interested in writing, or ideas. I am well over eighteen and would prefer my partner to be as well.\n\nWriting style: I'm solely a third person writer, past tense. My writing style is simple but descriptive. I mostly focus on the emotion that's involved in everything, what my character is doing, how they feel. Character development over time as well as plot progress is highly encouraged and mostly expected. \n\nLength: Quality over quantity, I'm usually literate, three paragraphs minimum. But if you like smaller posts that's fine, just give me enough to work with, please. Don't do dialogue only. Unless your character is standing completely still and speaking in a mono tone, there's no reason for it. How are they speaking, how are they feeling? Are they using hand gestures, are they frowning as they speak, etc.\n\nPlatforms: Discord and google docs, occasionally I can be convinced to use only email, but rarely.\n\nFandoms: I am interested in many fandoms, but right now I'm primarily craving marvel things. Specifically netflix mcu, if you're wanting to write someone from the primary mcu films, that is fine. Just expect them to be interacting with someone from netflix based marvel shows. Ie: Matthew Murdock, Frank Castle, etc. I'd love to see the C league heroes and villains interacting with avengers or guardians, etc. Or if you're wanting to write someone from the shows too that's great. \n\nShipping: I primarily write m/m and f/f, very rarely I will dabble in m/f but that would take a lot of convincing on your end. I love ships that aren't fandom standard, that have unexpected dynamics that require thought and consideration. I like writing relationships that aren't perfect, I love a lot of angst and some fluff to even it out a bit. I'm absolutely not interested in slice of life types of things. If you don't see a ship you'd like listed below just message me suggesting it, if it's crack or unexpected I'll likely be interested. I'm even fine with dc/marvel cross overs. Oc's are accepted on a case by case basis, but usually not. In a lot of cases it seems original characters are blatant self inserts and I have absolutely no interest in any of that. If you have an original character you'd like to write with me, message me telling me a bit about them.\n\nFrank Castle / Billy Russo\n\nFrank Castle/Matthew Murdock (maybe)\n\nBilly Russo/Jessica Jones (Maybe, I told you I'm trash)\n\nFrank Castle/Jessica Jones\n\nJessica/Trish (Don't be a irl male trying to be a creep and we'll be gr8)\n\nFrank Castle / Steve Rogers\n\nSam Wilson / Steve Rogers\n\nBilly Russo/Tony Stark (Crack, but I have a plot concept for this one)\n\nBucky/T'challa \n\nCharacters I'm interested in writing: Jessica Jones, T'challa, Billy Russo, Sam Wilson, Matthew Murdock, Frank Castle (maybe).\n\nI hope to hear from any potential partners soon!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello!  I'm Cas and I'm looking for partners that are at least 21+ as that's old I am. Mature themes will be in my plots though limits will be discussed. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn't have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having long, thoughtful replies back where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and writing as I am, and please don't make come up with everything by myself. It's frustrating. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100%   dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance, using face claims. I\u2019m the type to makepinterest  boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs  that remind  me of our characters and/or ship.\n\nLast but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story  along. I\u2019m mainly looking for female authors writing male characters but  male authors are fine too.\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n* 21+ partners\n* For  you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to   advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n* For you to write as a male in their 30s-40s and older. I'm a sucker for  the  gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. The broken ones  who  are rough around the edges and aren't afraid to throw a punch. But  are  tender enough provide a hug if needed.\n* The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as  much  as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to  life.\n* The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of   ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be  delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces,  only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n* Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post or before it. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me.\n\nI love all types of genres, but especially urban fantasy and science fiction. Lately I\u2019ve been wanting something based off Castle Rock and/or True Blood. All  my characters will be adults and I require my partners  do the same.\n\nFor plot ideas, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and possibly writing. Look forward to hearing from you!",
