The clouds which struggled to withstand the burden of the weight which the rain held, soon gave in. The rain poured down over the city with a roar. The sound of emptiness was disrupted by the loud gregarious boom of thunder. \n\nA young woman ran across the hard cobbled stones a file above her head as the rain hammered down against the plastic Filofax with such ferocity it felt like her fingers were being pounded by a thousand tiny needles, her grey hues peered up to a small coffee shop just a mere stride away and she searched to seek shelter in there . Her cold stiff fingers reached forward and pushed the small door open as she slid her small frame around the bending of the door and pushed her self in the warmth of the establishment offering some comfort and relief from her Now wet cold frame . \n\nHer hair which was tied neatly in a bun against her head was slightly damp now small wet strands hung around her frame , she was rather petite .. She reached up un zipping her leather jacket and peeled it from her body thankful that the rain hadn't penetrated her blouse , the crisp white shirt was snug against her tiny frame . A pencil skirt was snug around her waist and pulled down straight enlightening the soft curves of her hips . \n\nA gentle sigh left her lips and she cursed as she brushed the tiny rain drops from her skirt her dainty fingers working against the fabric as she stepped forward not particularly watching where she was going she bumped into someone in front of her rather roughly that it caused her to step back nearly loosing her balance , a  Filofax dropped to the floor paper work billowing around the floor in a flurry , she cursed and bent down to retrieve the paperwork which had fallen from the persons folder in her haste she dropped her own Filofax paper work flowing in all directions she blushed quickly tugging some of her hair out of her face . \n\n\" gosh I'm so sorry ... I wasn't watching where I was going ... I... \" she stumbled over her words trying to sort the paper work out and sort the two different sets of different paperwork that were now in a jumble against the floor... \n\n(( thank you for reading my prompt :3.\n\nhopefully it has interested you slightly. I'm seeking someone to play the part of the male, Ideally what I would like is someone also in the buisness trade .. Someone confident and Daring. Clarrisa could do with some excitement in her life!

Bonus points if they're typically in charge and rather aggressive or cold, because if feel there will be some interesting chemistry between your character and mine. They can be crossed over from other universes as this is no universe in particular. I typically write a paragraph on average with something as dialogue ridden as this can be at times, and while I won't pressure you to do the same, I would rather not regularly see one liners.\n\nWhile, romance is going to be the idea of this story, and it will certainly encounter things of a more sexual nature, It will be for the sake of the plot. Even still, I would prefer that if you plan to take part that you are 18 at least. In addition, one should be alright with violence and gore. Its not a zombie apocalypse without them.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and getting to know your character.",

            "selftext": "So let me just slide on in here and tell you a little bit about me. My name\u2019s Nicole,I\u2019m sixteen, I go by central time and am currently looking for an rp partner that will be willing to make a world to rp in with me. I don\u2019t care what age you are as long as you\u2019re literate and up for what\u2019s written down below.\n\nI\u2019m into fantasy worlds like dnd and ones set in space.\nI also am quite into the whole \u201cschools for monsters/super powered children thing.\nI\u2019m not averse to other types of genres those are just the ones I enjoy the most so if you got some western cowboy or some nitty gritty detective horror idea or something else then by all means lay it on me! I\u2019m rather open to suggestions! As long as in the end it comes down to both of us trading back and forth ideas for this world we\u2019re gonna make then I\u2019m probs gonna be all for it!\n\nI  myself like me some romance though I\u2019d prefer it to not be the main focus and to happen naturally. I like the whole slow progression and naturalness of a relationship. No rushing and such and I do quite like some angst thrown in there.\n\nI like to also take my time with the world building. So if you\u2019re not up to taking a bit of time before we jump into the rp then I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be the right fit for one another. Also I\u2019d like to make characters with you and such so that may take a bit too! I want to start with a blank slate and color it all up with you!\n\nNow then let\u2019s talk about writing. Now I myself write in the third person POV and would prefer if you do too.\nI write about a paragraph to above. I don\u2019t expect you to write in perfect grammar. I get it typos and stuff happen. I myself ask that you excuse some of my mistakes I\u2019ll end up making. I prefer quality over quantity so if we end up just trading one liners at some point because it makes sense like in an action scene then yeah I\u2019ll be breaking my one paragraph per reply rule. Just as long as it makes sense and you\u2019re not simply being lazy then less than a paragraph is fine.\n\nBy the way,If you ever get bored of the rp or even just the world we made in  general. Kindly tell me. I don\u2019t want this to be boring for you and I\u2019ll do the same vice versa. This way we can spice it up or make a new world all together.if you need time or just can\u2019t reply for awhile I get it. Just tell me so it isn\u2019t like you suddenly just up and left forever you know? I\u2019ll do the same.\n\nAlso I\u2019d love if you\u2019re also someone that\u2019s cool with sending each other silly images of things that remind us of the rp or just simply to chat ooc at times! I wanna be buds! Pals! Amigos!!! So if you\u2019re not up for that again we\u2019re probs not the best match.\n\nFinally as I said before I\u2019m 16 so no nsfw. Not old enough for that haha. Second my main place I\u2019d prefer to rp in is right here on reddit using the pms. Though I won\u2019t shy away from other platforms like google docs,Kik,discord,email,etc. \n\nWelp I think that\u2019s it! If you wanna be my rp partner comment or pm me! Thanks for reading!",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind). (Admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am mainly looking for as a partner. And hopefully one who has no limits, like me.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me! And please, do PM. I have yet to get used to that new Reddit chat.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have to urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)",

Instead, it was dark, with a red light flashing beyond the window in the cell door. Smoke was filling the small space, making it difficult to breathe. Suddenly, the door flew open with a loud bang. A person in an EVA suit stood silhouetted in the doorway, voice distorted by the suit's speakers and barely audible over blaring alarms in the background. \"We're leaving, kid. Hurry up. Place is about to blow.\"*\n\n*Only minutes later, Prisoner 17 sat by the viewport of a small courier ship, heavily modified and FTL capable, watching the prison outpost disintegrate in a series of explosions. \"Hey, kid, get over here,\" came the voice from the cockpit. \"Records said you knew a thing or two about ships and I'm gonna need a co-pilot if I want to get us out of here.\"*\n\nWho is Prisoner 17? Why was she locked up? Who is her mysterious saviour? Join me on a fun romp through an OC universe as we find answers to these questions and create more questions so that we can find more answers until it all becomes an adventure of epic proportions.

I\u2019m not a big fan of one liners, but short paragraphs are okay when it comes to having a hard time to reply. I tend to have at least one or two paragraphs, so I don\u2019t expect a whole essay.

While our site offers a one-of-a-kind searchable database with hundreds of members to browse with their likes and dislikes posted for all to see, our Discord has become a storytelling portal and a community effort. Our mission may be to connect people around the world and let their creativity shine, but for the last year, our Discord has grown into something more.\n\nOur server offers both one-on-one and group advertisements to help you find your perfect partner, as well as a whole section of writing help channels to encourage you to become the writer you've always wanted to be. We boast useful sources, writer's block busters, and a section to ask your burning writing questions where someone is always around to answer! In addition, we post a daily question to make you think about your characters, your writing style, and how you tackle a story. As a perpetually active server, there's almost always someone around to chat with, bounce ideas off of, or relax from a stressful day.\n\nDon't believe us? We asked our members what their favorite parts of RPC were:\n\n\"The friendly community, post-a-plot, and the way the list is set up is my favorite!\" \n\"The community is the best part. Everyone is really nice.\" \n\"I enjoy how welcoming everyone is, and helpful as well.\"\n\"Post-a-plot is a great way to get a new idea, and there's plenty of writers to indirectly learn from.\"\n\"The community itself is my favorite part, even though I do like thinking over the questions of the day.\" \n\"It's crystal clear that RPC is a very loving commuity where there's a place at the table for everyone!\"\n\n\u2728 https://discord.gg/A476RXk \u2728",

            "selftext": "Hello. \n\nI\u2019m fairly new to Reddit, so please bear with me. \n\nI am looking for all types of RP, I am open to all kinds. I prefer that you are over the age of 18, because I\u2019m not comfortable writing with minors whenever the possibility for romance could arise. I hope that\u2019s understandable. \n\nAs for me, I write in third person. I ask that you do too. I like to think that I have pretty good spelling, punctuation and grammar. I prefer that you do as well. I\u2019m not too picky, despite how that might make me seem. I just need to understand what you\u2019re trying to get across. \n\nAs for genres, I prefer romance and medieval themes. I can try to do other genres, such as slice of life and sci-fi. Doesn\u2019t hurt to try. \n\nRegarding creativity. I don\u2019t usually world build. But if you want to, we can try. Just understand that I get in creative slumps at times. I never usually have an issue creating a character, as much as I do coming up with big plots and ideas. I mostly go with the flow but for the sake of finding a great writing partner, I can try to be more creative. It\u2019s something I want to be, anyways. \n\nWhile I do enjoy a good back and forth, I understand that life keeps us busy. I am free more often than not and can reply quickly on most days. I don\u2019t mean to be unreasonable, but I prefer someone who can reply more than once a day. I don\u2019t want to lose interest or anything, but it happens to us sometimes, unfortunately. \n\nJust a heads up: I may write romance in character, but out of character things need to stay platonic. I hope that\u2019s okay. \n\nAs for a good medium, I can use Discord, Kik, or Email. Let it be said that I prefer Discord over the other two.\n\nIf you\u2019re still interested in becoming my writing partner, feel free to PM me. Let\u2019s talk here a minute before moving over to our preferred platform. \n\nThanks! ",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.\n",

His dream of becoming a ranger for the army was taken from him by a single doctor visit. Now he lives alone in an apartment with nobody who really cares. H rarely goes out and when he does he is afraid he will hurt someone or himself, his hometown doesntbwabt anything to do with him because rumors spread like wildfire that he was a psychopath since highschool. All he's ever wanted was somebody to love and somebody to love him. His boss tells him that he's a sweet and caring person, she even went as far to say that she wants him to find someone, but it's rather difficult with his mindset. One day while driving through town he sees a broke down motorist who has ran out of gas and is stranded. Closest gas station was six miles away and he was the only driver for even further. (If you've read this far, say Bandit if you're interested) Offering to help her with her car he introduces himself and offers her a ride to the station for gas. That's where the roleplay will pick up and again if you are interested please message me in my pm. Serious inquires please.",

I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n* Historical (Realistic)\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

What I am looking for in a nutshell is an rp writing partner capable of original characters, novela (multi-para) play that focuses \\*on the writing\\*. I'm open to a wide variety of settings and genres - fantasy, realism, thrillers, horror, modern historic, sci-fi all kinds and combinations of any. The only genres I'm \"closed\" to are canon, slice of life (on its own, not my thing), and medieval fantasy. Almost anything else I'd consider for a partner that can knock my socks off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started waaay back in AOL days and have moved through forums and all the rest. Nowadays, I write exclusively on Discord and usually make a server with subchannels for every one-on-one story I do. I prefer \"live\" play and when available to do it, I can exchange posts every 15 minutes to an hour. My typical posts ranges from around 500-2000 words, depending on context, considers all the usual grammar, basic spelling, so on, and puts plot forward. I love characters and stories that buck trends, or take an old cliche and make it new again.Originality and collaboration focus my interest and flexing writing smarts smexy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd most love someone who is really about going above and beyond. Selecting character images, really talking through what we are going to do, possibly even making pages would be great too. Bonus points for actually coming to the table with some ideas (even really loose ones!) instead of just asking me to provide them all for us both. Triple sparkle bonus points if you're quick enough on your feet to keep hashing it out and throwing ideas around until we find the perfect thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs any of this even a thing anymore? It seems like everyone who messages me is some sort of troll or looking for a personal romantic connection, which I am not, or just into a different, more straight forward sort of canon and slice of life play that seems unbearable to me. I don't want to teach a beginner or drop all my standards to the point it stops being fun and challenging, it's just feeling a little like that might be the state of things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, someone, prove me wrong. Let's create something awesome that keeps us on the edge of our seats and coming back for more. If you aren't into one on one, I'd also \\*\\*LOVE\\*\\* some suggestions on servers that allow RP ads or have a good balance of quality players. Hit me up in DM and we can exchange info!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I\u2019ll try to keep this as short and sweet as I can; I\u2019m Alfetta, an 18+ guy from the UK. I\u2019ve been writing crappy little stories since I was a kid, and started roleplaying around six years ago. Currently I write in a NationStates community and have an awesome post-apocalyptic partner, but I\u2019m looking for someone new to try out another scene.\n\nDue to possible NSFW and graphic scenes, I\u2019m looking for someone 18+. Please respect that. I prefer quality over quantity, and would much rather have two well written paragraphs over eight paragraphs of jumbled rubbish. Preferably you\u2019d be in a somewhat similar timezone to speed up response times, but I\u2019ve had good roleplays with people across the world. I\u2019m open to writing with a guy or a girl depending on the scene, and write exclusively on Discord. I\u2019d love for us to get on OOC and talk about whatever, about our plot, real life, or anything else. Communication is key. If I\u2019m not having fun, I\u2019ll let you know. If I\u2019m busy or can\u2019t respond for a while, I\u2019ll let you know. If I disappear unexpectedly for a few days, it\u2019ll be for good reason, and I\u2019ll come back soon and let you know. I expect the same from you. I do use face claims and it\u2019d be great if you did too. IRL claims are preferred, although feel free to use fictional claims too.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone that\u2019s interested in building a world with me. I adore worldbuilding and storytelling, and would really love to get deep into the nitty gritty of whatever world we choose to explore. I\u2019m a sucker for twisted, dark scenes, with hints of soppy romance dotted throughout.\n\nNow, for some potential scenes\u2026\n\n- Medieval: I\u2019ve always been a fan of historical roleplays set in imaginary kingdoms. There\u2019s so much to explore: perhaps my prince has invaded your princess\u2019 land and has taken her as a trophy, or a knight is hired to escort a noble\u2019s daughter, or a peasant family are struggling to survive during a war. Romance and action will be rife in this setting. The course of history is ours to change, either together or as enemies.\n- Space sci-fi: Ever wanted to be a rogue space bandit, millions of miles away from home, looting some galactic overlord\u2019s cargo to pay off some debt? Me too! Let your imagination run wild amongst the stars. Space chases, sneaking around, uncharted planets and unlikely couples are welcome.\n- Grungy slice-of-life: Slice-of-life plots have always seemed boring to me, but if you add some dark elements to them, they could turn out quite fun. We could be a couple of kids struggling to survive in a crime-ridden city, or maybe we have an abusive relationship that neither want to leave. If you\u2019re interested in this kind of setting, please bring some sort of distorted twist, as I\u2019m not interested in standard slice-of-life. I live enough of that every day.  \n\nIf you happen to like Firewatch, Watch Dogs, or Community, I\u2019m happy to play scenes inspired by or set in those universes too. If anything here sounds interesting, please drop me a message, tell me a bit about yourself, and I\u2019ll try to get back to you ASAP!\n\nThanks for reading.",

I\u2019ve been on this reddit a couple of days and have even started playing with a couple of you already, but I\u2019m looking for my time to be filled a little more, so I decided to give this a try. \n\n I\u2019m 23 years old and looking for someone to roleplay with. If it\u2019s fun I\u2019d love to be long term, but if we don\u2019t seem to be working out then we\u2019ll say our goodbyes. No harm done, right? \n\nI am asking for women only because no matter how action packed or gore filled we make it, I would like for there to be the potential for romance. \n\nI generally use first person format but if you like something else it\u2019s not a deal breaker. \n\nWe\u2019ll come up with a good story together with OCs or if it\u2019s fandom based we can use prefabs. Your imagination is the only limit! \nMy main priority is just overall fun interaction, I\u2019m not even going to list my likes and dislikes because I like so many things that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure something out. \nYou also don\u2019t have to be a professional writer, but please don\u2019t be lazy. A one liner here and there is fine if it\u2019s all the scene calls for, but descriptive, interactive posts are what I\u2019d be looking for most. \n\nI can use kik or discord, so if these work for you and you have something in mind, please feel free to message me. We\u2019ll chit chat here first to make sure we\u2019ll work out together and then transition to whichever platform you prefer and go from there. ",

As long as you have the coin or the skills to obtain it, you will always find a place to call home in the vast desert of Dasht-e Zerrin.\n\nThe Golden Sands, our new roleplaying server based around a fantasy desert in which one can find a variety of locations, from the ruins of ancient civilizations, creatures corrupted by the blood of demons known as Sandlings, and cities in various stages of development, each run by specific races apart from The Gilded Perch, a melting pot of society run by mercenaries.\n\nApart from the desert humans known as Aashan, there are many lore-friendly races to play as, such as the Glass Elves, Naga, Rakshi, and Heck-lin; don't worry, however, as your wood elf, orc, gnome, etc. characters still have a place in Dasht, though some discussion with the staff is recommended so that your character's background and the lore of the setting can meld together seamlessly!\n\nWe can promise:\n\ud83d\udd25  A lore-rich environment with engaging plots and NPCs! \n\ud83d\udd25  Regular out-of-character conversation! \n\ud83d\udd25  A lite 5e DndD-esque experience (Optional, if you'd prefer to play a non-combat character)!\n\ud83d\udd25  Games and fun VIA our bot!\n\ud83d\udd25  And most importantly, a friendly community of roleplayers who are excited to create stories with you and your characters!We can't wait to see what legends we're able to form with one another!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/bVc559p",

A world where werewolves, vampires, and the rare bit of ritual magic clash with the neon glow and cybernetic upgrades humanity had been expecting.\n\nPlayers are free to join **Division**, a government agency responsible for investigating supernatural-based crimes, the mega-corp **Argus**, an entity whispered to be funneling resources into preserving humanity\u2019s place in a world quickly outpacing it, or make their own way as an independent character or in one of Seattle\u2019s many gang factions (several of which are player-created and run!) We encourage the creation and pursuit of a personal narrative for everyone's character, and try to make it easy for them to progress and develop as they see fit, so long as what they have in mind is within the rules and lore, but we do allow some things to bend a little bit as long as it doesn't allow for an OP character.  \n***(We are currently looking for active Argus and Division members)***\n\nOur server features a detailed catalog of lore for the setting and a work-in-progress timeline from present day to 2175 to help players looking for world details they can employ to fully immerse their character creations into a setting populated by all walks of other players. We even have a map, featuring the general locations of all the places featured in RP channels.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our luck to have a relaxed, friendly community of players who are always more than happy to help a new member or write a new scene (no worries about being out of the loop!) New members are expected to treat others with the same respect, and are encouraged to contact a mod on the side if they have an issue with another player (so far we\u2019ve been very drama-free!)\n\nWhile this server does not have an age limit, we do warn new members that due to the tense nature of many story lines content may be regarded as 18+. NSFW content is to be left to private messages between the players involved, but violence, gore, strong language, and drugs are allowed in general server channels.\n\nJoin us for some roleplay fun, all experience levels are welcome!\n\n[https://discord.gg/6kwzyvg](https://discord.gg/6kwzyvg)",

That being said, I'm hardly expecting to write a novel, and I understand that not everyone has lots of time to write consistently.\n\nFeel free to pm me if you are interested, and feel you meet these criteria.

I\u2019m 20 years old, work full time, and have no idea what to do with the daily allotted free time I have. So I\u2019m here to find people to write with!\n\nI\u2019ve got several things I\u2019m interested in writing, but for this particular post I\u2019m going to hone in on my love for one specific character and their world- Spider-Man!\n\nAnd, if you\u2019re curious- yes this came to me because I\u2019ve been playing Spider-Man PS4 non stop.\n\nAnyways- I want someone to fill the role of another character in Spider-Man\u2019s life- Mary Jane, Miles Morales, or someone else if we can think of em! This wouldn\u2019t necessarily be set in the version of Spider-Man put forth in the video game, but could take inspiration from it if we wished. Gender swaps and alternate universe versions of characters are cool with me, too, so, we\u2019ve got options.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who can reply at least a few times a day, though I don\u2019t have any demands for length or anything. As long as your grammar is solid and you write more than one line, we should be cool.\n\nPM me if you\u2019re interested!",

Of course it wasn\u2019t something that Dr. Frankenstein accomplished by issuing electricity. It was something that most didn\u2019t understand quite yet.\n\nThe doctor toiled around the room, bottles of things submerged in preservative liquid lines the window sill.  He talked to someone tied down to a chair. He didn\u2019t seem to see the young woman looking through the crack of the door. A maid was looking into the forbidden room, a place of blood and guts that no woman was ever supposedly see. \nShe pulled away quickly upon seeing the figure in the chair turn their head towards her. The woman took in what she had seen, though, because of the lighting it was hazy, she could have sworn to god that the figure had been sewn back together. He had scars around his arm, one around the base of his neck... \n\nClara went on with her tasks that day, scrubbing the floors, dusting, and finally making sure that the candles were out at the end of then night. She passed the forbidden room on her way to the maids quarters. She couldn\u2019t help it, she had to know who... or what was in that room, so horribly tied down. \n\nThe young woman approached the door, she set her hand on the knob and then turned. It was locked, she should have known. Clara sighed softly and walked to her quarters, tomorrow she would most definitely try again.\n\n((Hello! \n\nI\u2019m looking for dark roleplay set in London, but not at just any time. I would love for it to be during the time that Mary Shelley\u2019s book had just been published and when body snatchers were abundant. I would like for it to be a romance as well, but that comes with time, so don\u2019t force it.\n\nYour character can be the doctor, the figure in the chair... anyone, as long as it helps the story progress I\u2019m happy! And yes, this is loosely based off of the Frankenstein Chronicles. \n\nI would like it if anyone who was interested in the poly would reply to the prompt with a little writing sample, just so I can get a bit of a taste of what your going to be like, plus establishing characters and what not!\n\nThank you so much for reading this, I look forward to all the replies!))",

These storage devices are of alien design and have been reverse engineered and mass produced. Physical human or synthetic bodies are called \"sleeves\" and stacks can be transferred to new bodies after death, but a person can still be killed if their stack is destroyed. While this theoretically means anyone can live forever, only the wealthiest, known as \"Meths\" in reference to\u00a0Methuselah, have the means to do so through clones and remote storage of their consciousness in satellites.\nTakeshi Kovacs , a political operative with mercenary skills, is the sole surviving soldier of the Envoys, a rebel group defeated in an uprising against the new world order.\u00a0250 years after the Envoys are destroyed, his stack is pulled out of prison by 300-year-old Meth Laurens Bancroft , one of the wealthiest men in the settled worlds. Bancroft gives him the choice to solve a murder\u2014Bancroft's own\u2014to get a new shot at life.\n\nI'm looking for someone that is quite detailed, Literate and not a pervert, It could be smut based but I prefer lots of build up, The storyline could go according to the show or maybe we can brainstorm Something else. \n\nBelow are some points you should keep in mind if you message me.\n\n1) Be detailed, Minimum 8 lines or atleast two paragraphs per response.\n\n2) Do not ask for pictures or anything unless they are related to the Roleplay.\n\n3) If you are gonna ghost me then just don't message me. \n\n4) No personal questions please, I'll see you just as a roleplayer. \n\n5)In your first message, Don't say hi/ hello or something like that. Introduce yourself and tell me what do you think about the RP plot. \n\nWe'll exchange our Kik in dms.\n\n\n",

I\u2019m looking for someone who will be able to consistently write as much as me. I love detail. I also tend to play characters who are more uh...morally compromised. Simply, I like playing villains, or villains with a sense of heart. My one role that I have in which I am simply good, is a recovery/slice of life role, in which my character is saved from a bad situation. I also love if pregnancy roles (long term, not right away). \n\n\n\nI love world building, and am able to play multiple characters. I really like worlds were mutants are possible, or post-apocalyptic themes. \nI have roles in: Sci-fi/Fantasy, Dark (extremely dark) roles, Romance, and Crime (ALL OC). \n\n\nAs for fandoms, I do enjoy Harry Potter. I would be willing to play Hermione Granger or my own OC, with a pairing of Tom Riddle (Or Voldemort), Draco or Lucius Malfoy, and Severus Snape. \nI also have one role regarding Daenarys and Drogo, in which they both live. Showverse, Game of thrones \n\nI have Kik. We can specify NSFW themes in private, as I don\u2019t want this taken down. \n\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey, I'm a 25F looking for at least one person (hopefully up to three separate partners) to roleplay with (hopefully long-term). I am a Lit./Lit. Adv writer, so every post will at least have 2-3 paragraphs. Depending on the situation I can definitely write more (up to 8-10 paragraphs I think is the longest I've done) but I am more than willing to match your style. \n\nI am an adult so while I am not specifically looking for nsfw sex-based roleplaying, if it happens, it happens. I like a lot of gore and action though. I don't like romance to be the main point of the plot, but I would like some romance. I like to double up characters (just because I like variety when I am writing) but I can definitely stick to one character (in that case I usually end up with a female character, doubling up usually leads me to one female, one male). \n\nI have not roleplayed since I left college but I really miss the creativity and the back and forth between another person so I would like to jump in. I am hoping that my writing has gotten better since then but I may not be at my prime right now, so I hope you'll have some patience with me. Before I stopped though, I had been roleplaying for ten years and have tons of experience. I do have some examples if you're curious but they are five years old and you can definitely tell they are five years old haha. \n\nAs far as for frequency, I will be able to churn out at least one reply per day or every other day. I also live in Japan so my replies might come at a weird time depending on your time-zone, so please consider that. On weekends I will definitely be more active. \n\nAs for OOC talks, I love that and I love to chat about world building and character details and just everything. I am definitely trying to be your friend haha, so while I understand if you just want to roleplay, part of the joy for me is getting to know the other person. \n\nI don't have an idea for any specific plots, so I'm definitely open to suggestion but I love modern fantasy, historical fantasy, sci-fi, horror, action, etc. Anything that has action and a good plot, I'm up for. As far as fandoms go, I'm open to the idea but I always play OC characters so keep that in mind. I don't care who you might want to play but I don't feel comfortable stepping into someone else's character. However! That doesn't mean fandom is off the table, as I've done all OCs in specific fandoms and it works out so well (just ask for specific fandoms). \n\nI don't have specific plots at the moment but I do have some bits and pieces of ideas as well as a lot of characters I've already come up with that might fit with some of your ideas so let's talk about it and figure it out! The fun of roleplaying for me has always been coming up with something together. I am not someone who sits idly by while you plan things out so you won't have to worry about that. \n\nI will be willing to do this roleplay on any platform except kik. \n\nAnyways, this was too long. I'm sorry LOL. If you'd like to talk about it, just send me a message. Hope to hear from... someone at least. Haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'm just coming off of about three months of not writing at all, so if you need someone who can contribute on a regular, long-term basis, I might not be for you.\n\nThat being said, I love to build up worlds and characters, and have long-running plotlines. Even if things aren't romantic, I tend to prefer playing against female characters anyway, because I'm a dweeb like that.\n\nI also enjoy getting to know people and building some kind of friendship when writing, as it makes it easier to be more inventive - plus, I just like having people to talk to.\n\nI'm interested in a handful of things, so I'll just list a few but feel free to make suggestions:\n- sci-fi\n- post-apoc\n- modern fantasy\n- medieval fantasy\n- fandoms: LoL, BNHA, MtG, OW, Danganronpa - OCs welcome, depending.\n\nI tend to write best in a paragraph or two, but I can't always sustain more than one so if you're looking for that, expect slower responses, sorry :( I wish I could write more, but I've got some kinda mental block or something.\n\nThird person, past tense is my jam, but the latter is negotiable. Discord is a preferred platform, for convenience sake.\n\nThanks for reading my wall of text.

I just started to rewatch some of it recently, and I must say the character development over the course of the story is some of the best I've ever seen! What better way to celebrate it than by doing a bit of writing on it?\n\nI'm mostly looking for a romantically roleplay between any two characters. Whether that be one of the main pairings such as Aang and Katara, Zuko and Mai, or Sokka and Suki, or we could do a less 'official pairing' if you'd like! That could include, but is not limited to Zuko and Katara, Sokka and Ty Lee, or even Azula and Ty Lee if you're interested in that. Of course, if you have a ship you really like that I didn't list, please feel free to message me and tell me about it! I'm open to any ideas really, I just want to play out some sort of romance in the realm of this great show. If you must know my favorite pairing, it's probably Sokka and Suki.\n\nMy main platforms are Reddit PM's and Discord if you'd prefer that. I really hope to hear from one of you! ",

Straight relationships only. \n\n- Timezone is CST\n\n- Prefer email for roleplay but can be convinced of discord in a pinch (rather use for planning/ooc)\n\n- tend to write long form minimum 500+ words but shorter is understandable if the quality is there; will not do one liners or one paragraph\n\n- odd/unconventional pairings are my favorite; I enjoy going against stereotypes and expectations\n\n- only write OCs and don't play in any Fandom universes\n\n- don't have a specific genre I like more than others; I feel my pairings/prompts could be fitted into any genre but I lean towards near modern, modern and futuristic \n\n- reply frequency is not critical but if you go three to four days with no communication I assume you lost interest (and I probably will too)\n\n- I have a personal bio I made along with one I have on RPC list (ask for username)\n\n",

It makes her an oracle of sorts with the ability to vaguely see future outcomes and events (up to a year away).\n\nWhen she was born she had the marking of the oracle which was in written text from centuries ago. The marking being the golden ring that traces her pupils. She wouldn't be able to see events without conducting some sort of ritual. Perhaps when she was born into the elven kingdom and word got out immediately that she had the markings.. she was was abducted by members of the a secret society belonging to the king. They put silver(anti-magic) bands on her wrist to prevent her from using the magic unless it was for their (typically military) gain.\n\nSo essentially they are using her.\n\nBut to keep this from being a power-gaming situation... she will be a pure and innocent person with no ill intentions towards anyone so if she ever did break free she would not use her powers for bad things and also when she does use her powers it makes her incredibly lethargic for days so using her visions too frequently would kill her.\n\nLooking for someone who might be inspired to make a character for this story and roleplay it with me.\n\nIdeally, I am looking for:\n\n* Someone who is inspired by this prompt and would like to make a character and build this world and story with me.\n* Someone who has discord and would be down to make a server with me for this roleplay which would include channels such as: OOC, Kingdom Channels, And various other location channels.\n* A romantic element but I would love for it to be something that takes time to build up. Mushy sentimental romance bores me to tears. I like difficult relationships and I would like for them to start off not really liking each other all that much at first. I really can't stress how much I am not looking for a complete sappy love story. I would prefer someone who is interested in this type of romance as well. \\[*NSFW RP is okay but no flat out smut or NSFW centered RP*\\]\n\nThis realm should have various races. I will be playing a few NPC characters as the story progresses and I think you should also.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I love drama. \n\nI haven't put any other thought into this realm because I plan on building the lore &amp; backstory with the person I pick. You have autonomy to decide your own character. Keep in mind that this elf lives in isolation and in secret within the castle at the human kingdom.\n\n**If you're interested please PM me:**\n\n* **Whether you want to use Discord (add your contact info) or E-mail.**\n* **How active you plan to be.**\n* **Your character idea for this story.**\n* **Some ideas you have to add to the story/lore.**\n\nThank you in advance for your consideration and for reading this far!

The village offers him a wide variety of young girls for him to take back home and use as his food supply for the next ten years. This time, though, he doesn't pick any of the girls lined up before him. Instead, a young boy in the back catches his eye.\n\n\n** What I'm Looking For **\nSomeone who is literate. 3 or more sentences, no less than half my length, proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. That also includes no use of \\*,- when showing action and using \" \" when speaking. You must also type in third person.\n\nSecondly, this is a SFW rp. But what I mean by that is that this rp will not be sexual in any way unless to advance the story.\n\n** More Info **\nI have a starter for both scenarios, where I'm the vampire, or where I'm the human. If you are interested please message me for my kik and tell me which character you'd like to be.",

            "selftext": "Hello Ladies and Gents, this time today I am looking for a Marvel themed Roleplay. I figured we would get canon characters this time. I would rather it not be solely smut happening, but I'm fine with those themes. Fade into black or not I don't mind. I'm looking for a Romantic Appeal this time, they don't need to be Canon Relationships such as Clint for example, with his wife. I'm fine with throwing together anyone or even if you have an OC you would like to add. As long as they are of age and it somewhat makes sense. But don't get me wrong I am fine with things like Starlord and Gamora, and whatnot but I had to clarify.\n\nLong Term would be best, or even a short term is fine with me! I am totally fine with MxM and whatever the case may be, honestly. I'm just looking for a nice Roleplay to dwell into. You can bring anything into the table! Just be literate is all I ask.\n\nI use Discord, I now hold a preference to that when Roleplaying. Due to italics and bold, and the longer frame. All I ask is for a literate person, with no four liners. At least 6 or 7 :)\n\nFor Marvel, I Roleplay T'Challa, Peter Parker, Peter Quill, Bruce Banner, Hawkeye, Thor, Gambit, Stark but these are ones I've done! I can definitely try more with you, but these are the ones I am most comfortable with. We can also do certain Au, if you don't understand what that means you can ask me about it and I'll tell you!\n\n This is mainly someone looking to play as Male, in this regard I am fine with it. MxF, MxM and others. It's just what I'm comfortable with, if that all sounds good or remotely interesting try to Dm me! Remember, tell me about yourself in your message please and thank you!",

OCs aren't really my cup of tea but if it's for one of my top tier fandoms then I'll probably be cool with it.\n\n- Little Shop of Horrors (I can play Seymour or Orin, and even Audrey Two if you want)\n\n- Mask of Shadows (I play Sal)\n\n- Heathers (I play JD)\n\n- Danganronpa V1 (I can play Naegi or Togami)\n\n- PJO (I can play Nico, Percy, or Will, but I prefer playing Will)\n\nAll requests are welcome!\n",

I\u2019ll never call him!* \n\nToday though, you\u2019d been awake for 15 minutes already, your date was still laying down, giving you only a look at his wide shoulders. You liked him. Dinner was fun, getting to know him was fun (that\u2019s usually the hardest part.) and the sex? Incredible. \n\nFeeling a little friskier than usual, you were the one to make the move, scooting closer to him and spooning him along with some kisses on his back. Soon enough the nagging was enough to get him up. \u201cMorning.\u201d His voice was groggy and non-threatening, kind of sweet actually. Almost as sweet as the feeling on his arms wrapping around you.\n\n\u201cHow does a scientist get these arms?\u201d You asked, the big smile in your face was impossible to hide. \u201cOh you know, gym and stuff.\u201d He swatted quickly and stopped the conversation with a kiss, his weight shifted on top of you, hands softly caressing your sides. \n\nAll of the sudden, everything came to a halt. \u201cW-was that an ambulance?\u201d  At the distance, like always in NYC, the alarm of a single ambulance rung. It was the usual, background noise at this point and as background noise was to be ignored. The action only resumed for a quick second. \u201cOkay that\u2019s more than one ambulance, I need to go to work.\u201d \n\nThat was the weirdest train of thought you\u2019d encountered all day. The mood was ruined and your knight in shinning armor was struggling to get both feet inside his jeans. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re incredible and I\u2019d love to meet you again.\u201d He apologized while writing his name and number in the notepad next to the bed. You weren\u2019t listening of course, your eyes glued to the tv screen. \u201cAre you sure you need to go? It doesn\u2019t look that safe out there.\u201d The TV read \u201cCRISIS\u201d along with some shots of downtown Brooklyn in flames. \n\n\u201cUh yeah, don\u2019t worry! My work is in uptown anyways, I just need to go... secure some data.\u201d His words only matched the speed on which he picked his shirt and put on sunglasses, blowing you a kiss until he closed the door to the bedroom. Leaving you alone. \n\nAnother morning ruined. At least you got a number. \u201cPeter Parker, 445 7182\u201d\n\n(Hello! This is kind of messy and rushed but I\u2019ve wanted to play this endearing nerd for a while! It\u2019s definitely framed as a romantic prompt but we could honestly take it anywhere! \n\nLike something I think could be fun, we could make your character Scarlet Witch, or Capitan Marvel! You could have met Spiderman, in that case he would know who you are but you wouldn\u2019t connect the dots just yet. \n\nWe could do anything! And I hope that all replies come with a little input of where the story should go. That shows me you\u2019re actually interested in this.)",

            "selftext": "Thank you for taking the time to read this if you have clicked on this post! I have many ideas and many different genres that you may be interested in, so I would appreciate if you take the time to read the whole post and know all of the ideas that I am considering so that you can pick one that you hopefully will like! Just a disclaimer, **i only rp on discord.** I will not accept roleplaying on any other platform. \n\nMy name is Danielle, I'm from England (UK) and I'm 18 years old. I don't mind if you are from any other timezone just as long as we will have time to get a few replies in everyday then that's fine with me. I also don't mind what gender you are, and what gender you prefer to play. I am okay with roleplaying males or females - it doesn't matter to me. \n\nI like a lot of different genres, including **Post Apocalyptic, Fantasy, Futuristic, Historic and Slice of Life.** \n\nThose are the main themes that I usually roleplay, and I have different ideas for some of them that I will list below, please make sure you read through them so you can choose whatever you prefer and that you send these preferred ideas to me in your dm!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My rules are really simple if you are interested:**\n\n* Please do not rush the relationship between our characters, I would love to build a relationship up, but starting off as acquaintances, maybe not even trust or like each other, but I'm looking for something long-term.\n* Please be able to mainly write in paragraphs.\n* Be literate!\n* Please don't rush my replies. And i won't rush yours! We both have lives!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MY IDEAS**\n\n*Post Apocalyptic* \n\n1. **Romance -** My first idea for a post apocalyptic roleplay would be a romance between our characters, aging from 18 - 30 (with our characters having no more than a 6 year age difference.) This is very broad, as there are many directions this could go. I like the idea of having one of our characters being in a rather evil group, and forming a bond with the other character, slowly falling in love once they get past the hate. But I also love many many other ideas, including the immunity concept from The Last Of Us, quarantine zones, etc... For this I would like that you are able to roleplay more than one characters once in a while as they will probably encounter a group or be in a group at some point.\n2. **Father/Daughter -** The second idea is much alike The Last Of Us. I love this game, and I love the father/daughter bond that Ellie and Joel form. I would like a story just like this where circumstances bring the two together, whether the girl is also immune like Ellie, or if she is just the daughter of the leader of a large group and needs escorting overt there. She could find out he is dead after a long search, and after bonding with the father figure character, they start to like eachother and treat eachother like family after disliking eachother for a long time and being skeptical about eachother (especially the father character). This would have to be discussed for both of us. I am also down to rp Joel and Ellie canonly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Fantasy*\n\n1. **Castles &amp; Dragons** \\- This idea is a bit broad but I like it a lot! I would like to have this set in medieval Britain, with villages and kings &amp; queens, on a large land where dragons also live, and are hated. There are many ways we could take this. One of my main ideas is that the prince/princess has always been interested in dragons but has been taught they are evil. There was a story going around that a baby was taken by a dragon from the parents that did not care well for the baby, and when out exploring, the prince/princess finds an unexplored area near the river in the forest between some bushes when following a small creature through the woods. In this area, they are found by a person who is unable to communicate other than speaking a few words and making actions with their hands. This person is the baby that was lost years ago, and has been brought up by dragons, and knows that they are not evil creatures. The prince/princess proceeds to sneak out now and then to visit and bond with the dragons and fall in love with the 'dragon trainer', but the king/queen eventually find out. This can go many ways, and I'm very open to ideas with the fantasy concept.\n2. **Magic** \\- I am also interested in witches/wizards, something like Harry Potter and I'm very up for roleplaying in the Harry Potter world but I have no experience in it so I would need to have some guidance. I have no proper idea for this but it would be fun to explore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Historic*\n\n1. **WW2 Affair** \\- I like this idea a lot and it would be fun to explore. I'm looking for an affair story set in the dates of World War 2, with me playing a woman who is the wife of a politician, and a soldier. This would probably be a German soldier and the woman being polish, married to a Polish politician, who would meet in a hotel they are both staying in where the wife is upset and distraught because of the war and not being happy in her marriage as she is not treated right. I would like the german soldier to be a gentleman, and rather flirty, treating the wife well which would encourage her to have an affair during the time of the war, putting them on the run from everything and wanting to be together after spending a few nights talking and bonding. \n2. Any ideas you may have that differ from this \\^ I would be up for hearing so please let me know.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

I am a 22 year old male but I can play any gender and like to play new and intresting things.\n\nI normally do fantasy and sci fi but have done a lot more then those through the years. I have several plots but I am more then willing to do something new.\n\nPlots: \n\n1. The dark elves and light elves have been at war for hundreds of year the two kings got together and finally made peace meaning one member both royal families along with a servant is sent to live with the other clan. Your father has sent your cousin and her servant to my kingdom to live there. Your family heard that I was arriving today and you see two dark elves riding into the castle gates. One is dressed in very fine clothes he has dark gray hair with chains of silver weaved into it. The other one is dressed in clothes that look like simple worn out riding clothes with a shaggy black cloak draped over their shoulders and a simple black scabbard on their side. They stop in the large yard of the castle and look up at the castle and look around their surroundings.\n\n2. We go to a school split into two groups. One are The beasts who are able to change their form into some beast or gain powers and handlers who can control a beasts powers. We are response able to hunt down evil and beasts that have gone rogue.\u00a0 Me and my twin brother are both beasts but we are completely different not even looking the same. He is at the top of the beast class and I am at the bottom. It is the beginning of the second semester and the list of partners in posted and you see your name is next to mine.\n\n3. I am the captain of a small crew of interplanetary smugglers. You are the last human a former solder you where in the Lamora program just before the universal war started you where put in cryo sleep after your powers came into their full. The war wiped out the humans leaving their interplanetary kingdom in ruins. A few of my crew get the crate with your cryo unit in it instead of what they where supposed to steal.\n\nAll of these are compleatly open to change or new ideas. Also I can play any gender with them. \n\n\nI mostly roleplay in first person but can do third person as well. My normal post length is one to two paragraphs with more or less as the story goes and calls for it. I live in the us central timezone and I am typically more active during the day at work and after. Also I like to get to know my partners out of character as well so if you like to talk that is a plus. I hope to hear from someone soon.",

They were less liable than men to be suspected, and they held the ancient commodity that men would move mountains to attain, even CIA agents.\n\nThings were tense in America at the moment with The Cold War and my CIA agent husband was barely home now a days as he was busy with his current assignment of infiltrating the local governor\u2019s friend circle who he thought were hiding information about the Cuban Missile Crisis. I\u2019d try and inquire about how far he\u2019d gotten but he\u2019d brush me off, telling me not to worry my pretty little Cuban head about such matters. I\u2019d smile and nod my head.\n\nWhat my husband didn\u2019t know was that I wasn\u2019t just some docile Cuban immigrant, my marriage to him, my love for him, our romance, and my newly discovered 2 week pregnancy was all so that I could secure information for Russia and Cuba. I too was an intelligence agent but I didn\u2019t work for America.\n\nOf course once I was done extracting the information I\u2019d fly to Russia and disappear this was just a mission, a job afterall. I wonder what I\u2019d do with the baby, would he even care about it or want to know where it is? I hear the timer go off in the kitchen letting me know my roast beef is ready.

Do you find out I too am a spy? How do you react? Do you kill me? Do you care about your child growing in my womb? I want to use traditional gender roles for this RP. I will try my best to come off as the homely, doting wife. I'd like for there to be a romantic element to this, despite everything there should be an underlying aspect of love and care between the two characters, not everything needs to be said, some things are implied by actions.",

Others, like the primis crew, OCs or any other characters are there to be other subjects, the people behind the testing or the crew that liberates the labs and frees the subjects. Any ideas are welcome, no matter how crazy though!\n\nOCs and AU characters are accepted. The rest of the rules are on the server and if you have any questions, you can DM me!\n\nWe're  looking for people to play Primis characters mainly, but almost every character is available!

I prefer playing OC's but I would quite happily play a CC if the idea pulls me. \n\nIt's been a while since I've rped. I used to RP HP stuff all the time when I was younger but haven't done anything for a long time. So, it may take a while before I get back in the swing of things.\n\nI used to RP in forums, so with a wide variety of characters which makes things more interesting imo. If possible larger groups of people would be great, but I'll work with what I get. Seen people saying they RP on Discord. Not sure how that would work as such... but willing to give it a go.\n\nCheers!\n",

            "selftext": "Hey there! \n\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I posted here, I have an idea for an RP I\u2019d quite like to explore. I have the basic idea in mind, but I\u2019m hoping that whoever\u2019s interested could help worldbuild up from this basic framework. Or, simply roleplay with the framework and the world building ideas I have in store. We\u2019d be able to world build our respective character\u2019s worlds, backstories, and origins, as this is the sort of story that would allow for that.\n\nThe idea is quite simple really, a meeting of two completely distinct characters. One being a member of a tribal society still stuck in a rather primitive era, and the other (my character) being an engineer from another planet far from the one the story takes place on. \n\nIt\u2019d start simply enough, a primitive tribal attempting simply going about their day suddenly comes upon a strange construct that seems to have separated the entire land in two, as far as the eye can see. They encounter a strange figure toiling with this construct, and that\u2019s more or less where the story begins. (another idea I had for more action-oriented starters would be the tribal character having escaped or is on the run from pursuers of sorts, and comes across this construct and my character). \n\nIt would revolve around their interactions starting from the first encounter, through to subsequent encounters where they\u2019d grow to learn and understand about one another, discuss their respective lives, and chat about the going ons of their days. I was planning to structure it almost episodically? Based on each visitation, with the characters seeing each other once every half week, as my character would be visiting that specific location as is required by his job. \n\nWhilst the backdrop of the world is much larger than the two characters in question, the story will focus mainly on our two characters. But we could easily have it ramp up to something more exciting (I had an idea where the tribal character\u2019s livelihood or tribe/family would be in danger from another civilization on that continent, and so my character would be forced to help discreetly without causing a fuss with his superiors for instance). \n\nAnyways I hope this sounds interesting to you, and just a few things to say before you message me:\n\nPost Length: Usually paragraph-style, a bit longer at times to set up scenes and such. Sometimes novella but again I\u2019m adaptable to my RP partner, no one liners though. \n\nRomance/etc: I\u2019m open to the idea so long as it fits with the story. It has to occur naturally is what I\u2019m trying to say. \n\nI generally RP on both Discord and Google docs, but discord would be useful for discussing things with one another, really. \n\nAnyways, if you\u2019re interested, please feel free to message me and I\u2019m sure we can work something out! :D Hope to hear from you! :D And if it doesn't work out that's fine as well but please do tell me so it's clear! :D \n",

            "selftext": "Heya there, so I\u2019m looking for another female to do a lesbian romance roleplay with. I prefer roleplaying with fun people who can do anything from 2-4 paragraphs. I myself can do any length except from novella. I have a couple ideas of what the setting and plot hook could be, some are based off fandoms and some are not, so see which one you like.\n\n1. Skyrim Adventure\nMy character is a young mage looking for an adventurer-for-hire, your character, to do a quest with me. Throughout the quest we develop feelings for each other.\n\n2. RWBY Beacon Term\nBoth of our characters are huntresses at Beacon Academy entering our first term. We are placed in a group together, along with fighting occasional Grimm and defeating some villains we start showing romantic feelings for one another.\n\n3. School Of The Occult\nBoth of our characters are witches studying at a school of black magic. I\u2019ve not really fleshed out this idea, but it could possibly have some Lovecraftian elements, like cursed books among other things.\n\n4. Anime Monster Girls\nOur characters are both monster girls (the kind you see in anime, search up Liru or Pachira from Magipoka for example) maybe sharing a flat in a city or a house in a haunted forest. One of the characters has a crush on the other and tries their best to gain the other\u2019s affection.\n\nThat\u2019s it really, so if you like the idea then PM!",

            "selftext": "Hello there! (Again, sorry yet again!)\n\nI've been in the search for a RP partner for a while now. To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, Pokemon and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind). (Admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am mainly looking for as a partner. And hopefully one who has no limits, like me.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me! And please, do PM. I have yet to get used to that new Reddit chat.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have to urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, I\u2019m Kong! \n\nA friend of mine, Insomniac, and I have created a Discord server dedicated to play-by-post longform roleplay that takes place within our own Marvel Universe that all of us can create together. Over the years I\u2019ve been an admin for quite a few roleplay forums and servers that have seen quite a lot of success, attracting some minor celebrity attention from people like voice actors and sponsors like Roll20!\n\nThe way the server works is that you join the server and get to apply to play a **canon character** within the Marvel Universe. At that point, you build up your character through stories and roleplays via writing as if you were part of a literary \u201ccinematic universe\u201d. It\u2019s a **collaborative storytelling server**. Meaning that if you\u2019re here, you want to write a story in conjunction with your fellow users and work with them actively to create the best narrative you can. It\u2019s not just about you and your character, it\u2019s about the larger story you can create with one another. And most importantly, it\u2019s about creating memories and crafting relationships with your fellow users.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to begin this new server for all of you guys and hope you can join us. Roleplay your favorite Marvel characters, collaborate to tell compelling narratives with other members, make new friends, and hone your writing skills in an environment that helps support that! Join us in the Marvel Roleplaying Universe RP server.\n\nJoin here: https://discord.gg/Q8ZcF8q\n\nThanks - Kong",

However, I give what I get - if I get five paragraphs, you're getting five paragraphs back. If we go down to one sentence, normally in dialogue, I will give you one sentence in reply.\n\nSo, I'm looking for modern, and male slash. Sorry, no straight or female slash, no fantasy, and the only canon roleplay I would do is Gundam Wing (Hit me up if you're into that; I miss doing it!)\n\nHonestly, it's a case of PMing me and discussing what particular modern-type roleplay you would like, or what pairings you would like. I write intros from scratch when needed, but I do have a few typed up to give examples of my genres -\n\n* Drug addict x Dealer/Drug addict\n* Stripper/dancer x Client\n* Roommates (this is very broad; could be friends, could be strangers, could be in a band together, could be gay x in denial)\n* Hitchhiker x guy-who-picks-him-up\n* Settings in a cafe, nightclub, college, rehab, mental health facility, etc. are all welcome suggestions. Just suggest what you'd like \\~ the very worst I can say is no! I tend to like gritty subjects such as drug addiction, mental health problems, etc. with some amount of drama but I also like fluffy scenes and I'm happy to write smut or fade to black; your decision.\n\nI'm on my laptop all day, most days, with a GMT timezone. But I know lots of people have these things called 'ly-ives' so I respect that going quiet, or going slow, is something that may happen. Even so, I would appreciate at least one post a day, or just let me know if you're going to be busy, going away, etc. etc. OOC chat is the best way to make a roleplay work, and I don't mind chatting about other things, either! Let's get to understand each other.\n\nLike I said previous, please PM me to begin the discussion :3",

Full sentences, 3rd person.\n- 2-3 paragraphes, more if needed. Multiply replies a day/few times a week.

Like I once heard that scientist were afraid to send astronauts to the dark side of the moon because they wouldn't be able to see earth and then they would go mad! Crazy right? I mean it's not that crazy. The first \"lone\" space flights into deep space those didnt go well. The people came back mad. At first they thought it was some type of radiation messing with their brain.  That would have been easy and cheap to deal with.  No the problem was lonlieness . It was termed space fever. \n\nSo what was the first thing those brilliant scientist tried? They gave them a robot. But yea that ended as well as you would think. I heard one guy fried his dick off when he tried to fuck it. \n\nSo I guess that's why you are here with me and I am here with you. Keep eachother company. \nSome missions get more people depending on the complexity and people mental copanicity index.. blah blah blah. I really dont understand the social science. But they assign a derived number to your mission based on a bunch of stuff and that's how many people you get. This mission it got a 76 so I guess we get two people and a robot. So you and me. \n\nIt's been what like 1 month and we have been all work work work. Star charting , radiation mapping, pinging into the vast emptiness. It really is a mind numbing job at times. Maybe we should get to talking. Maybe we should get to know each other. \n\nWe all have our reasons to fly into space. What's yours? \n\n______________________________________________\n\nThat's the RP. We are both astronauts in the future just biding our time in space. We have a reason to be up here. Be it adventure or maybe something back home just wasnt working out. \n\nI dont know if this will turn romantic or not so just see where things go I guess. \n\nLet me know what's your favorite scifi novel, movie, TV show in the subject. \n\n",

While my character is married, yours is not. And it's sort of slow burn from there. I'm not looking for this to be any kind of roleplay just to get out your... wants and fantasies, but a legitimate roleplay story that can progress and has room to grow. I don't want them to just jump to each other, or anything like that. It could be something like were they're friends, and the office may talk about them  getting together, but they never have, until more recently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can discuss a lot of the nooks and crannies over PMs. Let me know if you're interested!

Some point in the future? Why not!)  \n\\-Marvel/DC (big points if you know and love the Arrowverse! It's a hard thing to find RP for compared to the MCU, which I play)  \n\\-Harry Potter (I haven't dabbled in the Marauders Era that much, but Trio era is possible, and post-Trio era is likely)  \n\\-Once Upon a Time (Guilty pleasure, I know, but I am of the mind the material and characters are there, but the writing needs to be)  \n\n\nIf something isn't listed, then feel free to ask.  \n\n\nI want semi literate to literate players. 3rd/third person, past tense. I mainly play on Discord since it's easier to bring on the go. There will be story, and there will be smut. I am of the mind that anything mature or adult can be enjoyable, but so can a good story.  \n\n\nI am usually on from sometime in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play sometime, feel free to message me here to either drop your Discord name or ask for mine. Hope to talk to all of you soon! :)",

My name\u2019s Nicole,I\u2019m sixteen and am currently looking for an rp partner that will be willing to make a world to rp in with me.\n\nI\u2019m into fantasy worlds like dnd and ones set in space.\nI also am quite into the whole \u201cschools for monsters/super powered children thing.\nI\u2019m not averse to other types of genres those are just the ones I enjoy the most so if you got some western cowboy or some nitty gritty detective horror idea or something else then by all means lay it on me! I\u2019m rather open to suggestions! As long as in the end it comes down to both of us trading back and forth ideas for this world we\u2019re gonna make then I\u2019m probs gonna be all for it!\n\nI also myself like me some romance though I\u2019d prefer it to not be the main focus and to happen naturally. I like the whole slow progression and naturalness of a relationship. No rushing and such and I do quite like some angst thrown in there.\n\nI like to also take my time with the world building. So if you\u2019re not up to taking a bit of time before we jump into the rp then I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be the right fit for one another. Also I\u2019d like to make characters with you and such so that may take a bit too! I want to start with a blank slate and color it all up with you!\n\nAlso I\u2019d love if you\u2019re also someone that\u2019s cool with sending each other silly images of things that remind us of the rp or just simply to chat ooc at times! I wanna be buds! Pals! Amigos!!! So if you\u2019re not up for that again we\u2019re probs not the best match.\n\nFinally as I said before I\u2019m 16 so no nsfw. Not old enough for that haha. Second my main place I\u2019d prefer to rp in is right here on reddit using the pms. Though I won\u2019t shy away from other platforms like google docs,Kik,discord,email,etc. \n\nWelp I think that\u2019s it! If you wanna be my rp partner comment or pm me! Thanks for reading!",

Eventually though it could no longer be ignored, the prizes inside seemed to great to avoid. It was finally challenged by its first group and they discovered that it seemed to defy time within. As soon as they entered there were beasts that had gone extinct. Once they got to the the end of the first floor they discovered odd weapons, almost like cannons but they could be weirder in the hand. These cannons needed tiny lead balls that were packed in with explosive powder that could only be found within the tower and paper. After word spread of the odd treasure inside many more parties got together and challenged it. Due to the advanced technology within the human race quickly advanced technologically by deconstructing some of the things found. Now in the year 1350 there\u2019s a massive city built around the tower that looks like a modern city. Due to our reliance on the tower for tech the items within are still worth a lot depending on how high up you get them and there were also some things we never learned to make due to us not being able to deconstruct them so we completely rely on the tower for those recourses.\n\nSend me a message here first then i\u2019ll send you an invite if your interested",

I am male and gay so I do prefer doing MxM stories but am not exclusive to it. I can also write as a female. \n\nI do prefer quality over quantity but just try to not write so little that it adds almost nothing to the overall story.

            "selftext": "Update! I'd really like to make sure people who may be interested are in fact 18+ and a mature person; if there's concerns, questions, or requests about the roleplay or the direction things are headed, talk to me about it - don't just ghost! Had one person remove me within the first hour even though they said they 'loved me already' - pretty confusing!\n\nI'm looking for another lady to keep me company over Discord during the daytime hours a few times each week, US time. This RP can range from cute and sweet to debauched and lewd, and anywhere in between! I'm mainly looking for World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 settings but generic fantasy or modern miiiiiight be okay depending on what we come up with. Story-wise I'm definitely wanting to incorporate some explicit / NSFW elements into it (written out, not fade-to-black) so keep that in mind!\n\nI'd like someone who comes to the table with ideas in mind, too - I get a lot of 'I'm okay with whatever!' and it never leads anywhere since we can never come up with an actual scene to get started. I usually post a few sentences to a couple of paragraphs and I'd like at least the same in return; grammar and spelling are important to me so if you took care in your posts, that would be great too!\n\nI'm mainly online from around 8 AM Eastern onward earlier in the week but later in the week I'm only on for a few hours each day around that time, for reference!\n\nAlso, I'm super friendly OOC as well so it would be awesome if whoever was interested was also chill OOC / chatty / at least okay with someone who is.\n\nAny questions, likes / dislikes, comments, etc. - please send a message my way - thank you! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "I typically just respond to ads others have made but I haven't quite found what I'm looking for.  Therefore, I'm giving this an attempt in the hopes my fellow lurkers are interested.  Below you'll find some details about my preferences, writing style, and where my interests lie.  If this piques your interest, send me a PM and we can possibly discuss further.\n\n**You**: You need you to be at least 18 years of age but there are no limits if you're older.  Aside from any potential legal aspects of writing adult oriented topics with someone underage, it's emotional maturity that I seek.  Please be creative and bring your own ideas to the table.  This is a collaborative effort.\n\n**How**: 3rd person via Email  \n\n**Frequency**: Generally, I\u2019m good for a post or two per day during the week\u2026 sometimes more, sometimes less. Evenings, weekends and holidays are usually not good for me.  Every story is different and my feeling is to let it find its own rhythm and leave it at that.  I reside in the United States in the Eastern Standard Time Zone, EST, or UTC -5.  I'm not incredibly picky where you are, this is just to give you an indication of the times I might be available.\n\n**Length / Grammar**:  Quality is key.  I don\u2019t count words and don\u2019t expect you to. It\u2019s about having fun. Two to five paragraphs seem to hit a post length sweet spot for me. Obviously, depending on the character or world building that\u2019s needed at the time, the length may have to increase significantly or could be shorter. Regardless, each reply has to move the story forward and give the other something to work from. Take your time to set the tone and environment. \n\nI\u2019m not overly obsessed with spelling and grammar; I care more about how well you write. Just so it doesn\u2019t go unsaid, if your writing is constantly riddled with mistakes that interrupt the flow or doesn\u2019t resemble English, this won\u2019t work out.\n\n**NSFW / Limits**: This roleplay could have NSFW elements and I would prefer that it does.  As far as limits, I really don't have any but context matters and it needs to contribute to the story.\n\n**Characters / Doubling**: A M/F or F/F pairing is what I'm looking for and I can write either gender.\n\nI won't double just for the sake of doubling but don't mind it under appropriate circumstances.  I can bring in a spectrum of support characters to enhance the story.  \n\n**Communication**:  Good communication is essential to any successful collaboration.  We need to be able to discuss and exchange plot ideas on a fairly regular basis.  I welcome the occasional unexpected plot twist from time to time but generally we need to be on the same page with where things are headed.  \n\nAdditionally, we must tell the other if real life is going to get in the way and need to put things on hold or if things are starting to dead-end.  There is also the possibility that our writing styles aren't compatible, the story isn't working, or we just don't mesh.  It usually takes, in my experience, a few exchanges to determine this.  It's nothing personal if that happens just let me know.  I'll extend the same courtesy to you.\n\n**What**:  I'd like to create an original premise with someone.  If you're interested, send me a PM and pitch a general idea based on several of the themes below.  If it grabs my attention we can toss some ideas back and forth and get something going.  Also feel free to include any details about your writing style and preferences if they differ from what I've listed above.  \n\n- Original Characters\n- Modern\n- Science Fiction\n- Post Apocalyptic\n- Dystopian\n- Odd Pairing\n- Conflict\n- Drama\n- Action\n- Romance",
