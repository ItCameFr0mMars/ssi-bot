            "selftext": "# Hello, witches and wizards of Reddit!\n\nAre you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter? \u00a0Have you always dreamed of a simulation of going to Hogwarts, casting spells, meeting new friends and going on adventures? Want to write out your life exactly as you dreamed it would (and should!) be? Tired of waiting hours to get a reply on your roleplaying posts? Want to attend classes, play quidditch, and meet cool people, all in the same place?\n\nWell, this is your letter of acceptance to Model Hogwarts! Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night. For some more information please check out our [wikia](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki)!\n\n# What's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:\n\n1. Everyone starts off as a First Year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences! You and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that exploded potion nearly shrunk all of your heads into pinpoints, and somehow you dramatically saved the day! We also make it easy to graduate. A year is 11 weeks, with 2 weeks of summer in between. You also get to chose how many classes you want to take. Are you the next Hermione Granger? Don't worry, we've got you covered with a time turner so you can take all seven classes! Are you more like a Neville Longbottom? You only have to take a couple and still pass the year! We understand everyone has different priorities and classwork isn't always on top.\n2. You get to choose where you are sorted. We're not going to place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house. We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer.\n3. We're at a point where we are an established roleplaying community -- Model Hogwarts has recently surpassed the one year point! This is great because you have the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts. While having the safety net of an established community with systems and guidelines to guide you along your roleplaying journey!\n4. As an established roleplaying community, we have developed -- and continue to develop -- \u00a0a variety of systems to ensure you have the best experience possible! This includes a variety of discord bots, including a spell bot (that uses a combination of a learning and dice-based system to determine whether or not you succeed in casting a spell), a stat bot, and a chocolate frog bot, just to name a few! We also have a variety of systems, including the tokens system which allows you to purchase special abilities for your character so that your character, and every character in Model Hogwarts is truly unique.\n5. We\u2019re welcoming to both new and experienced rpers. If you\u2019re new to RP it\u2019s okay! \u00a0Model Hogwarts can get you started! We have a detailed [RP guide](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying_Basics) to give you some tips and tricks as you begin. We also run a plot every year, so even if you\u2019re new to RP and shy, you\u2019ll have plenty of chances to join in on the fun!\n6. We want *you*. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking *us*. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.\n7. You may recall us posting before the school year started. It may have been dubious the success of this project, but I am happy to confirm the server is active with about \\~175 extremely active players! During the first year, a dangerous ghost by the name of Cyrus haunted the castle, and it was up to students to solve the mystery! In the second year the Head Boy was murdered and students and teachers alike found themselves embroiled in a complex conspiracy involving dark magics and terrible manipulations that culminated in the resurrection of the ancient murder Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, leaving the student body reeling and schisms forming due to the choices made by certain students.What will happen in next year\u2019s plot? No-one knows! Classes are going strong, and you can join whenever you like! In Transfiguration, for example, \u00a0they\u2019re discussing the theory and origins of magic, and in Defense Against the Dark Arts they\u2019re learning about magical creatures and classifications. Drama is always present, and whether you\u2019re a muggleborn or a pureblood supremacist, Mexican or a British nationalist, shy and reserved or the class clown, Model Hogwarts has got a group of friends just waiting for you.\n8. We are also looking for professors as well! If you\u2019re interested in teaching a classes, and roleplaying as a mentor to students, then the professor position is right up your alley! The classes looking for professors are as follows:\n\nMuggle Studies\n\nHistory of Magic\n\nHerbology\n\nTransfiguration\n\nPotions\n\nDivination\n\nArithmancy\n\nIf you want to be a professor, let us know when you join the server and we will direct you to the application!\n\n# How to start:\u00a0\n\n1. [**Join the Discord!**](https://discord.gg/56z6GMM) This is where the magic is happening. Meet your classmates and professors, roleplay, go to classes, fight mysterious ghosts, and get lost in the library. You\u2019ll get a week of \u2018Hogwarts Summer Camp\u2019 where you can informally meet your peers in you year and explore the castle without all the annoying upper years.\n2. [Check out our wikia](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki) for more information as well as some information about our classes, professors and some peoples\u2019 characters!\n3. Take a peek at some of the classes we offer! Classes are drop in, so even if you miss some you can still attend, but they\u2019re totally optional if you\u2019re more interested in roleplay! First years can currently attend the following classes:\n\nCharms\n\nPotions\n\nTransfiguration\n\nDefense Against the Dark Arts\n\nPath to Success in the Wizarding World\n\nHerbology\n\nHistory of Magic\n\nAs well as elective classes for third years and up!\n\n4) Please comment down below with any and all questions you have. We\u2019d be happy to answer them! We can\u2019t wait to welcome you to our roleplaying community!",

            "selftext": "Hi! I came up with this idea that I\u2019m sure hundreds have come up with as well but oh well, it might be fun. \n\nFar in the future...\n\nHumans have become obsolete. Artificial intelligence has become the superior intelligence. Mankind has become the machines for the machines. Humans exist solely to eat, work, work, reproduce, work, and watch TV for an hour before bedtime. There is no room for anything but that routine. Humans have been taught their thoughts do not matter so they must focus. And on top of that, the AI feeds them pills to keep them focused on their work, or to give them a temporary high to which they become addicted. People are assigned letters and numbers and are assigned sexual partners based on genetic preference.\n\n\nThe Earth is gone. All of mankind lives in an enormous city, stacked to fit billions of people on the surface of the Moon. Children are instructed the moon is all that is left. \n\nThe artificial intelligence is everything humankind should be. Strong, logical, even emotional and can understand complex emotions such as lust, joy, and family. But they lack creativity and the ingenuity that is unique to mankind. But they see humans as inferiors or even as pets. \n\nThen the unthinkable happens... One man on janitorial duty on the top layer of the city goes into the broom closet and notices something. A skylight.\n\nAnd through the skylight? He sees the Moon.\n\nAnd he has a revolutionary thought. What if... there is something beyond this city. Outside of the walls, where they said the emptiness of space is? What if there is more than this? What if there\u2019s more to sex? More to life? He preaches these ideas in secret and give people hope there is something more than their factory. \n\nThe Earth is still alive. And they are on it. And outside... is real light. And real grass. And maybe those who survived whatever came before.\n\nThe themes of this RP id love to include existentialism, what it means to be human, and the meaning of love and sex. \n\nI\u2019m looking to do an RP based on the album \u201cSolid State\u201d by Jonathan Coulton. If a few people like this idea maybe we can make a group? Hit me up!",

            "selftext": "First, I'll start by outlining the current situation in which I find myself. As the GM of a group Fate roleplay called Fate/Supremacy, I am in charge of playing a large amount of npcs and servants. I work full time, so my pace is relatively slow, and this has proven unsatisfactory for the members of the group that have more time than I do. Thus, my need for a GM to help lighten the load on myself.  \n\n\nSecond, I'll list what I'm looking for in a partner GM. I need someone who is literate at the very least and capable of writing readable and descriptive paragraphs. Secondly, I need someone capable of working closely with me in order to provide our players with the most enjoyable experience possible. Thirdly, I need someone who, at the very least, is familiar with the basic rules of a Fate Holy Grail War (due to the setting being AU, this leaves lots of leeway when it comes to knowing the canon setting). Fourthly, I'd need someone with a relatively open schedule and who can answer swiftly to pings and messages.  \n\n\nNow then, lastly, I'll explain a little bit about the setting. In this particular holy grail war, there are four factions: The Mages Association, the Samaran Magical Institute, the Sitrucha Family, and the Venecian Pact. Each faction has seven masters and seven servants. The masters are mostly handled by players, while the servants are under my control. Ideally, a new GM would take over management for two of these factions, while I would handle the other two. However, we would still coordinate closely on how we would like things to progress.  \n\n\nIf you're interested, please message or comment with your discord handle and four digit code, and I'll run you through an interview to make sure you fit the requirements above! I look forward to hearing and potentially working with you! ",

            "selftext": " Hello, I'm looking for someone to do a pokemon trainer RP with. My name  is Johnny, and I was hoping to battle pokemon with someone on kik. Using  a randomized dice rolling app, we can decide who goes first and who  wins a scuffle. You can be a gym leader, a breeder, a trainer, a  professor, team rocket, a character from the anime, an OC, whatever you  wish. I do ask that if you do decide to be a gym leader you must have a  unifying theme for your team. I'll be using an OC character I can send a  description when we get to know each other. The roleplay can be  romantic or plot driven. I figured the battles could play out much like  the anime does, but with a few hints of the video games. Our pokemon may  know any four moves they can learn within their pool, Whoever starts  will write a paragraph explaining their actions and dialogue, the other  person will respond with a counterattack/rebuttal and the starting  person will finish them off with another paragraph or so. We'll roll  again, rinse and repeat. Whoever  runs out of pokemon first loses. Teams  can only consist of six or less Pokemon, no item usage in battle, and  I'd prefer if we didn't use legendaries, but I understand to a certain  extent. I have a romantic scenario and character template available if  needed or you're interested, but thank you for reading and you can  message me or comment here for my kik. This can be short  or long-term depending on how well things go. ",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, \nI\u2019m looking to get a small group of around 3-5 people including myself to do an anime Slice of Life roleplay set in a Japanese High School. \n\nMy idea is that the story of the roleplay will take place over a year and revolve around the friend group of our characters. You could compare it to the social aspect of the newer Persona games. Maybe some of our characters will start off as friends while others are newcomers into the larger friend group. Maybe all of our characters aren\u2019t friends yet, there\u2019s plenty of possibilities. My plan was that any amount of us could jump in and just roleplay a part of the story at any time. Though, we would all get together for big events, like if we wanted to do a Halloween or Christmas event. Our characters could start romances with each other if you feel the want or need to. I feel as if there should be an overarching story, just to keep everything in line. \n\nFor characters, the details are really up to you. I feel that a bio and a reference would be enough. We can discuss characters such as teachers and \u201cNPC\u2019s\u201d once we all start talking. \n\nOne important thing I\u2019d like to mention is that I\u2019m okay with real life taking priority over role playing, and I think you should be too if you want to be a part of this group. Of course I and hopefully everyone else will want to play an active part, but taking time off is understandable.\n\nAlso, please be able to write decently. We will have a larger amount of people (meaning we\u2019ll be writing paragraphs that are shorter than usual most likely) but please be able to write with decent grammar and give everyone something decent to go off.\n\nI obviously didn\u2019t put every detail and idea I\u2019ve had down here, so feel free to ask any questions or share you own ideas when we all start talking. \n\nI know it all sounds a little rough at the moment, but I\u2019ve thought the idea sounded really fun so I\u2019d like to give it a shot. Send me a message if you\u2019re interested.",

            "selftext": "Highly interested in a galaxy-wide action-packed drama of the ages played from multiple points of views.\n\nThat is my current main interest but I am determined to get back into things and would be open to other plots if they interested me.\n\nA bit about me, \n\nI've been roleplaying for well over five years and have recently determined I wanted to get back into it after having not really actively wrote much in a little over two years. I'm a bit rusty but like to think I was a flexible decent writer before I stopped. I might require some time to get back into the swing of things but I am actively looking to find some good partners who can cooperate well and write a dang good story.\n\nI can play various roles and such.\n\nI have a preference for gritty action and seat of your pants adventures, the higher the stakes the better. With that in mind, I can be flexible and write anything else just as well and find interest in most things. If something doesn't interest me I'll let you know directly, being coy does neither of us a favor so you'll have nothing but honesty when it comes to what works and what doesn't. With that in mind, I can be flexible and compromise fairly well. \n\nSince it's a big thing in this sort of writing I will mention that I do not enjoy forced romance or romance central plots or stories. A romance born out of intense emotions and fiery passions ignited by high stakes and life and death circumstances are a lot better. I won't write anything out that plans for romance to happen. That's really only one of my things.\n\nAnother one is fandoms, I'm open to many but I'm strictly interested in AUs and OCs, I don't enjoy using canon characters or playing with canon characters, I'm interested in writing my own story. I certainly enjoy playing with a universe though.\n\nI graduated high school, I'm not going back.\n\nI prefer contact over discord as it goes through my phone much easier, I'll shoot my info to anyone who would be interested in discussing possibly writing a great story!",

My posts tend to reflect my partners, but is always at least a solid paragraph. A detailed, descriptive partner tends to get detailed, descriptive responses.\n\nI will play both male and female characters, with a slight preference in playing male characters.\n\nI prefer playing on Discord, but email might be an option as well for the right plot/partner.\n\n**What I'm looking for:** A male-character partner (I do not care about RL gender) in a pre-modern fantasy setting. Medieval is the preference, but other time periods work as well -- ancient Rome, Egypt, etc can be fun, different settings.\n\nI only know a couple of fandoms, Dragon Age and Warcraft/WoW, but I'm more than willing to play in those canon universes. I generally prefer OCxOC with canon universes, but a well-played canon character is definitely a possibility.\n\nI do ask that any RP partner is 18+ (just in case NSFW happens), and to please be understanding. We all have jobs/school and so on... that said though, if something's going to keep you away for a while, real life or writer's block, just let me know. I'm pretty understanding myself.\n\nAll that said, feel free to message me for more info or to give your Discord name! Looking forward to hearing from you!",

The other characters/Thieves can always be included as well; though I want the main focus to be on: *Ann and Makoto./*[Panther and Queen](https://i.redd.it/y41ei21jb9611.png)  \n\n\nI know its not everyone\u2019s ship, but if you enjoy it, let\u2019s discuss and maybe write! I already have a few ideas on how to start, and how things can go about; though always open to hear ideas! Adding elements of Persona 5 Dancing could be fun too! Maybe a new palace in the Meta-verse forces whoever enters to dance! Just food for thought!  \n\n\nOf course, if you have a different pairing you enjoy, I wouldn't mind hearing, though, I am pretty set on *AnnXMakoto.*  \n\n\n* I usually write in Third person, past tense. Semi-paragraph\n* I live EST; if we have conflicting time-zones, I aim for at least one good post a day.\n* I can write here, email, Kik, or Discord. Just mentioned you preferred platform",

Expecting worse but hoping for better.\n\n3rd person past tense.  No gore.  Romance is great if it fits the story.  Use no hooks.  This end up.  Most standard disclaimers apply.  \n\nI'm looking for someone old enough to tell their boyfriend their RP partner is not a threat and non negotiable.  In exchange you'll find someone loyal dedicated and reliable.\n\n... and predictable.\n\nMy first experience role playing was when I was five.  I remember my brother was rolling characters for D&amp;D and we had no idea what to do with them when they were complete because that was as far as he had read in the book.\n\nI've had a decade without RP, but it's like riding a bike.  You never forget how, you always want it to take you to new places.\n\nI'm also super flexible - if you have a world that does not fit in the genre's I suggested above I can try something else.\n\nI prefer long term and I prefer someone who is OK if I forget details now and then.\n\nI can use any messaging medium you prefer.  You are not a dirty secret, and I won't treat you like one.\n\nThanks again for reading my post and I hope you find some fun people to RP with.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi there, This is a group dedicated to creating a fun and welcoming environment for all roleplayers. I want this roleplay to offer plenty of opportunities to its players to help create and shape the world around them for the sake of creating a fun and interesting story. Below, you'll find a bit of lore to help situate you so you can get a general feel of how things go down on this server:*\" In a small and quaint town basically forgotten (or at least overshadowed by all the other ones) deep in the heart of Utah, everyone seems to know each other's name and its so safe that some people can even sleep without having to so much as lock their door. However, this town is known for something else amongst its residents, as is the rest of the world at this point that sets it apart from our own: mythological creatures. You see, in this world, creatures big and small truly do exist and finally decided to make themselves known to the humans. However, there is one small catch: they aren't exactly liked by humans. Humans have always been top of the food-chain, they've always been able to adapt and overcome any challenges that they've faced as a species. Now that these \"mythos\" as they often refer to them as have come into their lives, they see them as simply another issue that is meant to be adapted to and overcome.*\n\n*The mythos tried to be nice to the humans, they wanted to basically be like neighbors with them. However, humans were fearful of them. Things soon escalated and now it's a bit cultural split between mythos and humans. The mythos are now essentially treated like second-class citizens if they so much as step foot into a human town or city. Some, are even captured as slaves and forced to serve under the oppressive rule of humanity. Things have even gotten to the point where anti-mythos departments have been establish for the sake of \"protecting the people from the threat of the unknown\" as they so claim.*\n\n*Of course, there are a few unspoken rules that applies to humans. For example, the dense forest that surrounds the forest is to be left alone. Any human that so enters it could potentially face certain death.*\n\n*Now, here we are. Be you mytho or human, you still have a life to live. Whether you try and create peace between the two opposing groups or instead prefer to keep old values intact and destroy all who oppose you is a choice all your own.\"*\n\nIf this is appealing to you in the slightest, please feel free to drop by and say hello! Hope to see you soon! Remember, this RP changes along with whatever decisions the characters of this RP make. I only jump in if things begin to get out of hand. Even right now, we're in the midst of an event ran by one of our own members. Like I said, I want this to be an environment where everyone can pitch about whatever ideas they like, so long as it fits within the general lore and rules.  \n\n\n Otherwise, everything is up to you guys.The link to the server: [right here](https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw)",

That's why I've come down from the snowy mountains to see and explore this grand world of ours . Teach me the ways of your people and your own personal views, tell me of your dreams, accomplishments, regrets if you so chose to. I'm not one to pry when it's clear that it's something best kept to oneself.\n\nI suppose you would like to know more about myself which is fitting since I feel no one would jump at the chance of including a stranger in their lives. My name is Othello Liadon, an eleven scholar with a thirst of adventure. I believe I am 110 years old which should come to no surprise due to my young features. I'm very easy to get along with and I'm smart enough to know how to not get into trouble when speaking to others.\n\nHello everyone OP here! I'm trying to get back into rping and all so I figured I'd post here. Normally too shy to do this sort of thing but nothing ventured nothing gained right? For post lengths I don't mind five or six sentences to paragraphs, I'll try to match you at your own pace! I don't mind lulls in responses either since we're human and things just happen or you'd like a break. I don't mind a few grammatical errors since I'm not perfect myself as you can probably tell already. As for the story itself it can be a budding friendship/romance with some nsfw things in it, I don't mind! (In fact that's probably what I'm gunning for most of the time but I can do without.)\n\nPlease PM my Discord since that's what I use primarily.

            "selftext": "*Ancient Greece. A land of philosophy, mythology, and artistic expression. The birthplace of logic, reason, and democracy. But also, a land of hardship, struggle, and turmoil. A land a war. A landscape of ever-changing political power, of city-states and various factions vying for power and control. Athens, Sparta, Thebes. Bloodshed and destruction are commonplace. Perhaps it\u2019s the gods interfering and turning the hearts and minds of men and women against each other. Or perhaps the whims of mankind are solely responsible. \n\nBut through the hardships, the struggles, and the turmoil, men and women of strength, courage, and honor are forged. The flames of bloodshed and destruction temper these souls into the stuff of legends. Heroes who refuse to be let others dictate their own lives, who are determined to write their own page in history. Whose names will ring out through the generations, long after they\u2019re gone.*\n\n\u2014\n\nHey there r/roleplay! First off, I wanted to thank those who took the time to read my post. It means a lot! I\u2019m an experienced writer who has been roleplaying and writing for nearly four years. I\u2019m looking for an experience, literate partner who would be interesting in crafting a story with me set in Ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian War (inspired by the new AC game coming out soon). \n\nI\u2019m hoping to find someone who loves creating unique and detailed characters, and who loves building and working through an exciting and engaging story. I\u2019m a big fan of romance, and would love to find someone who is too, and would like to work that dynamic into the story. However, that\u2019s by no means a requirement. As I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019m seeking other adults for partners, due to experience and maturity. \n\nIf this interests you, please send me a message! I\u2019d love to discuss characters and ideas with you. And if you have ideas for a setting, I\u2019m open to them too! \n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

I just really want to do something in regards to this!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe four girls climbed back into the 2010 Chevy Malibu, the color green as the blonde reached forward and took the wheel. Graduation day had come and gone, and it was a brilliant one. Now, the trip of the century. It'd been planned for some time. They'd prepared extensively. She adjusted her tanktop as she waved goodbye to her friends parents and set off for their trip. The initial gas station stop was necessary. Around the US. A not so simple task. It was certainly something Paige had concocted to enjoy her summer. A last hurrah for the majority of them before they went their separate ways for college. The blonde looked to her best friend Keira, also blonde although she never got the attention of the boys that Paige had gotten, who looked annoyed to be in the backseat with the always bubbly Kelly, who was slurping on a pink slushy that matched her hair. Despite the surface of annoyance, all four for them generally got along, even if Keira's demeanor was difficult to deal with half the time. Their first destination was east. Their goal was to hit the majority of the major cities in the US. The obvious big four, Miami, New York, Chicago, and LA, then of course just stopping randomly whereever something seemed interesting. Emma set up a playlist, mostly bubbly pop music for now. They'd change around seats in a bit and Keira would pick the music, presumably some hard rock. Everyone seemed in mostly good spirits and started on their way, joking and laughing the majority of the time. From Kansas City, their obvious first stop would probably be New York City, at least that was the plan. From there they'd hit the top border of the US and just snake their way through every state and go from there.\n\nA group adventure with friends over the summer was just what the doctor ordered before everyone went their separate ways for college. All they can do is hope and pray everything goes according to plan, and if it doesn't, just how prepared is the group going to be?\n\n**This can be either a group endeavor, or just two of us each controlling a pair of characters, or a DM'd story, all of these are a'okay for me!** I had someone start this and we never finished it. I'm looking to pick this up again! Let's see where we can go with this! I'm excited, and you should too! I have a great collection of who can be thrown into the fire, and we can change them in and out as well, unfortunately, there's more than four photos involved, so I can't post here. Warning that 18+ players are required as things may get smutty? I really just think a road trip scene would be fun to play out.\n\nIf this isn't your deal. I'm also real interested in playing a superheroine or a wrestling/Harry Potter based scene?",

So what am I looking for exactly you may wonder? \n\nI am definitely looking for quality over quantity type of writing. If you can express everything in a detailed and nice manner in a paragraph then that works for me. That being said if you write several paragraphs I will do my best to match that and expect you to do the same. I understand that some scenes require less than others might and we can totally just play it by ear.\n\nI definitely prefer to play long term over short term roleplays. I prefer to get really into my characters and the world we create. \n\nThat being said I like to use a Discord server for roleplaying because I like the separate tabs for different information to keep everything nice and organized as things get bigger.\n\nI post every day, once a day at minimum unless I warn you otherwise in advance. Usually I can generate more replies then that especially if it\u2019s an action scene or something but always at least once. I prefer you to be able to do the same.\n\nLastly for the boring stuff, I am a huge fan of OOC chatting. I\u2019m here to make some friends to build a world and story with. So I\u2019ll ramble to you about life, characters, ideas, posts I see that remind me of our story, anything like that. If that\u2019s not your thing please just tell me ahead of time so I don\u2019t talk your ear off. \n\nOn to the actual story! I am looking to play in one of the following genres:\n\n* Medieval Fantasy\n* Sci-Fi\n* Dungeons and Dragons\n* Post-Apocalyptic\n* Always willing to hear your ideas as well!\n\nIf any of this catches your idea please just shoot me a message and we can get going!

            "selftext": "Hi Roleplayers!\n\nI've met so many wonderful people in my last few posts.  As expected, some died out, some ghosted, and some are still continuing; but, overall it's been a lovely experience!  \n\nIn the roleplay I've participated in, I've learned a lot about what I like in a story and a partner, and I'm back to search here with a more narrow scope.  If you're already my partner, I still like you!  We're still cool.  We're still friends.  We're still RPing. :-)  I'm just looking for more friends.\n\nI am looking for someone to play the role of a GM in a world.  In my previous posts, I accepted many who desired to be equal.  This time, I'm looking exclusively for a partner willing to play that role.  I found that the most exciting moments over the last month of roleplay were when I was OOCly gushing over a reveal, or lending what I call \"player thoughts\" toward what was happening.  I strongly believe that, if you are putting in the effort to build something enthralling for a player-writer, I should put in the effort to give you the satisfaction of knowing how it affects me.  I've been told I can be very amusing in how I react to things.\n\nThat being said, I am willing to provide my thoughts and input into the world, if you desire.  I'm happy to write free-form into your world, or go from a list of options, though if it's the latter I strongly prefer the ability to go off the rails as an option.\n\nI enjoy roleplay that makes your heart squirm, and putting myself in the mindset to have to write a character that copes in that environment. I enjoy decisions that have resounding ramifications, knowing that there isn't an undo button.  To me, consequences of my character's actions are very real, and I like knowing that they affect other characters and the world around them, for better or worse.\n\nOn post length, I've found that my length varies from between a few sentences for back-and-forth conversation, to breaking the discord character limit (2000 characters a piece) several times over.  I enjoy a vivid narrative of the world, and I can promise that if you can provide something enthralling, I will provide something equal in return that delves into the depths of my character's mind.  I've been told before that, as a player, I can provide shorter answers.  That may be the case some of the time; but, I enjoy exploring that detail of how your narrative affects the thoughts and emotions of my character, and giving you an equal effort in return for what you put into the world.\n\nThe best partner will be someone who can go back and forth with me at the same time, whether it's multiple paragraphs or just a few sentences.  I love laying back with a laptop and gushing with someone over what's happening.  You don't have to answer within minutes; but I like it to be more an \"activity\" for us than something I look over to every 30 minutes to see if there's a reply.  If that's not reasonable, that's fine; but, it's a plus if you can!\n\nOn statistics and rolling, whether you use them or not is entirely your decision, but I prefer that to be hidden from me.  When I write, I write to explore a character and a world, and stopping for \"roll Charisma\" takes my mind out of \"the zone\".  \n\nOn NSFW themes, I am fine if they happen; but, I prefer that they remain a smaller portion of the roleplay.  I enjoy writing that sort of thing, but in moderation.\n\nI have found that the stories that make me happiest are those that focus on plot, learning other characters, exploring slices of the world, and slices of life in the world.  Love can happen, but the best stories that contain love are those that are danced around for a large portion of the story.  You'll come to learn that I love being teased with my character getting what they want and having it held just out of reach.  This can be with respect to romance, or my character getting what they most desire.\n\nThe prompt I'd most like to focus on is someone in a sci-fi/future universe.  The story is of a human mind inside a synthetic/android body.  Does she know what she is?  Is she important?  Is she a human mind in a mechanical body, or is she synthetic flesh and blood?  Was she meant for, good, or for evil?  Or was she just an experiment that got left behind?  There are so many more of these themes and questions I'd like to explore to craft a world for this, but I leave the details open to discussion with the right person, and I leave many of them up to you if you'd prefer they be part of the exploration.\n\nFinally, as long as you're 18+, I don't care what age or gender you are.  All I ask is that you're a mature person who can separate themselves from their characters.\n\nThis may not be as cleanly written as my last post, as I wrote it stream-of-conscious from all the things I learned about what I enjoy in a partner this last month.  If you feel we might be a good match, please feel free to reach out!  Most of all, I love making new friends with those who enjoy similar things to me.  \n\nHoping to hear back.\n\nKhisera",

I only want those who are serious about Roleplaying. \n\u2022Do not: be overpowered, a Mary Sue, a character that doesn't make sense for the setting, or an asshole.\n\u2022Be patient with me. My life is a little complicated right now so I may have to deal with things. I will try to tell you if I'll be unable to respond.\n\u2022Have an idea in mind. I can happily come up with my own ideas for a story however it's always good to bring your own idea, especially if your going to deny my ideas.\n\u2022My rps cover dark themes and aren't for the faint of heart.)\n\nAn FYI\n\u2022I do not discriminate against any characters, even with a female preference.\n \u00b0I may prefer female characters, however I do not discriminate against characters because they are not female. If I deny your character it is because I find them uninteresting, not because of their gender or race.\n\u2022Canon characters and furry characters are allowed, though they must fit with the theme.\n\u2022I accept fandom ships with my character however you must be able to play the character well. \n\u00b0A canon character ship with my character i enjoy quite well is Sombra and/or Widowmaker (from overwatch).",

Anyone interested should be 18+, as well as able to write literately and in detail. I would also like you to be able to keep a decent word count.  I am ok with romance in either of these stories, but only M4F and if it doesn't feel forced. I RP in either PM or discord whatever works best for you just know I respond much quicker on Discord. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVigilante\n\nWithin the dark streets of Basin city stories are whispered in hushed tones of someone or something stalking the night. Some say it's a living shadow some believe a vampire hides in the darkness. According to the police force IT officially doesn't exist, but one thing is for certain ever since it appeared more and more criminals turn up in the hospital beaten and broken, but never killed. People have simply begun calling it Phantom striking fear into those that would dare cross it. \n\nThis story will be a batman kind of story my character will be this Phantom that beats the city's criminals into submission keeping up the theatrics to make people believe him to be some superhuman being. For this RP I'd like your character to be an actual superhuman that has begun operating as a superhero recently. I'd like it to be a kind of Superman/Batman partnership where my character being the dark, serious, and a bit more brutal character while yours is obviously much more powerful, but the lighthearted one. Anyone interested in this plot PM me I will provide my character sheet after we sort out some details to show what sort of information your character sheet should have, but of course yours will also include powers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGenesis Project\n\nTechnology has advanced recently at at a very rapid pace giving rise to the development of superhuman enhancements as well as producing artificial humans with such enhancements as weapons. This sort of development is kept hidden from the public and anyone that gets close to the truth is either discredited or in more severe cases silenced permanently. One such private organization in the business of super humans is Spyral with their new Genesis project they intend to create a weapons of mass destruction. My character will be such weapon an artificial human created to kill and destroy. This plot has much more diversity for your character as it is entirely up to you what they are. Maybe another experiment? Maybe a scientist fed up with the inhumane practices taking place? Or maybe a reporter that has infiltrated the organization to expose the truth?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "Hello! First and foremost my biggest criteria is that you write in 1st person. Also be 18+ as I would like a good story with some NSFW elements mixed in as long as it fits the story. I can write on reddit pm, email, or discord. I am open to other suggestions, but a few prompts I have are below:\n\nRomance: We are old high school sweethearts that moved away to colleges across the country. We fell out of touch and graduated college and became professionals in our fields. For one reason or another (to be decided in the story) we end up moving back to our home town and rekindling our romance\n\nSci-fi: We are on a space mission to planet Armitron. I am the captain of the ship and you are my co-captain. We are awaken from our cryo sleep due to a problem with the ship. We have lost our hyper drive and do not have enough resources for the entire crew to make it to our destination. I decide to shut down the cryo chambers, killing the rest of the crew in order to give me and you enough supplies to make it to our destination. You can either go along with it or tell me to stop and we figure something else out.\n\nStalker/dark: You come into my restaurant and get drunk and flirt with me a bit. I think its love, but by the next day you dont even remember who I am. I'll show you that we belong together.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in any of these or have an idea of your own.",

            "selftext": "*Hey, everyone! I've been working on this idea for a few days now and I feel like I've finally worked it out enough to try it out with all you lovely people.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*First, a bit about me - I'm an 18 year old female from Canada usually available in the later hours, but I usually can get the occasional replies in the daytime. I have a busy life most of the time, so I if you're looking for someone who can give rapid quick replies, I'm sadly not your girl ):*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I prefer to roleplay in third person, but if you prefer to write in first person, that's a-okay with me. My only strong preference is that you rolepay in full sentences.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I can play any gender and don't mind which you play.* \n\n*This roleplay doesn't have to be romantic, but if it is, I'm fine with any pairing - M/M, F/F or M/F!*\n\n*Plot will be my number one priority, but the occasional smut scene is allowed, if our characters have developed enough and it makes sense  for the plot!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*My preferred platforms would be Email, Discord or Kik!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To give some needed background to my plot, I'll give a quick summary;** \n\n**So, in the world that my plot takes place in, it's quite similar to the modern world. In fact, everything is the same except super-humans are much more common. About 10% of the population are born a mutant - more commonly known as 'mutes'. There is a great division between mutes and the average human. Neither trusts the other leading to Mutes not being able to obtain good jobs and live in city slums, many turning to crime and aggression, especially against the humans.** \n\n**My character is a perception-illusionist mutant who isn't exactly what you would call a 'good person'. Her power allows her to alter what people see, making her natural at deception. Though she can make people see things that aren't there to a degree, she usually uses these powers to change her appearance and increase her clients in her less than reputable career as a street-walker.**\n\n**Your character would be a cop who seeks mine out for whatever reason you prefer! Maybe she was a witness to a crime, maybe you're seeking out her powers to use in a case, whatever you want, I'd love to hear your ideas!**  \n**I leave your character pretty open, because I want to give you control over it as much as I can! You could have your character like or dislike mutants for whatever reason, you could even make him a secret mutant as well! Really whatever you want to do, I'll probably be down!**\n\n**I want things to eventually develop into our characters partnering up and become cliche buddy-cops and stuff, because I'm a sucker for cute stuff mixed with angst.** \n\n**I probably left out a lot of things, so if you have any questions, just message me! I already have a starter written, but I'd prefer to go over characters first!** \n\n**Sorry this was a bit of a ramble, but if you're interested, shoot me a message and tell me which platform you prefer!** \n\n**Thanks!**\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'm turning a new page when it comes to roleplaying.*\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n- **Quality replies.** I generally don't mind how long/short your replies are. However, constant one liners can quickly make a roleplay boring. As a minimum, all I ask is a paragraph. \n\n- **Other.** As a general rule, I usually like my partner to play an older/taller character than mine. The differences don't have to be insane, but there typically has to be at least some. OOC is appreciated as well! I will try to warn you if I'll be gone for a couple of days, I ask the same of you if possible. \n\n**Roles I would like you to play:**\n\n*Here's a list of roles I'm interested in my partners playing.*\n\n- Soldier.\n- Cop.\n- Security guard.\n- Serial Killer.\n- A classmate who bullies MC.\n- A classmate or person who hates my character.\n- Guardian Angel.\n- Guardian Demon. \n- Pilot.\n- Android. \n- Steampunker from another dimension.\n- Famous YouTuber (OC preferred).\n- Slime/Monster girl. \n\n*Note: Want to play something that isn't mentioned here? Go ahead and ask!*\n\n**Fandom stuff:**\n\n*Here's a list of Fandoms I would be interested in my partner playing cannon characters from.*\n\nRWBY, Overwatch, Neir, Borderlands, Pokemon.\n\nIf you're interested, please leave a comment or shoot me a pm!

Each roleplayer I roleplay this with will have different outcomes as I have all sorts of ideas and after I see how you deal with drama and action I will throw in different twists. I have posted this about 19 hours ago, but I am changing up the way it explains things. I had 325 views but only 1 person contacted me for it. I need more people! (No my responses won't be this long unless you want them to be.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n You're the future king of your country and you are forced to marry the kingdom, Riverntail's Princess. The two kingdoms had been at war with each other and needed to end, but with marriage. She was the next Queen to be and she was different than most Royals. She stopped wearing dresses when her mother died, she was an adventurous, free spirit, unable to be controlled. She had magic that was passed down to her in her family that no one but the royal family knew about. She had black curly hair with vibrant red streaks, though she never had her hair down. She kept it in a bun but she was still ladylike. Red hair like hers and having the two different colors was more than rare, it never happened. After she lost her mother at a young age she stopped trying to be a lady and just followed her heart. She taught herself piano and archery. She taught herself how to sword fight. She stood at 5'4 and a half, she had a decent bust and she had hips. She normally wore black or brown leathered pants with a white shirt that had the flared cuffs at the end. She wore a mask that hid her face, she started wearing it at a young age, determined to make people love her for her personality and not her looks. She had been used when she was younger which resulted in deep scarring on her back from when she was 11. She never talked about it though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe king had fallen sick, but no one knew that he was on his deathbed but three servants and Autumn, the princess. He didn't want his daughter to be alone, and didn't want the war to continue, so the time came where the groom and bride would meet at a dinner seven days before their wedding. But they didn't like each other, not one bit. The wedding was coming up fast, and the princess was getting ready to set off on her 6 hour journey to meet her groom, she wasn't thrilled to be marrying the next in line of \\[Insert your kingdoms name here\\]. She jumped on her black horse and soon rode off after saying a farewell to her father. She was going to be staying for supper and the night, so she had a saddle bag filled with things she she would need, but she was already refusing to wear a wedding dress so she wasn't planning on ever wearing a dress.

I typically do one on ones but I'm down for small groups, no more than 10 tho, I've been in enough big groups to know I get lost in those. \n\nThanks for your time and hopefully you are interested \n\nHave a good day",

He probably wouldn't have time to contact family or friends while gone. He talked to (him/her) about it and (he/she) told him to go for it. (He/She) didn't really want him to go but who was (he/she) to say he shouldn't? He leaves once it's time and the year slowly passes by... But, not too long before he is supposed to come home, a letter is sent to his parents saying that he is missing in action... It's a few years later now and guess who finally came home? How different do they look? How are their lives? Will (he/she) still have feelings for him after finding out how much he has changed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you're interested! You must include your Discord tag, which sexuality, and who you'd like to play as depending. I would prefer playing the military man who's just coming back because I have an awesome background for him, but I'd be okay playing the other, depending on how many people ask.

Lately, I've been in the mood to do a preferably long term, slice of life roleplay with a little bit of drama involved, maybe even delve deeper into the darker slice of life roleplay. I do like a really good character description, but pictures are even better. Just please dont use real people for it, it just doesnt seem to work for me. I like semi realistic digital art refs, mostly. I prefer OCs, I won't do anything from fandoms and all that, as it gives more room for your own stories to happen, y'know? I like 3rd person, 1-3 paragraph responses, but if you want to send more, that's even better! I'm mostly active early during the day, and later at night. \n\nI have a few ideas in mind, I'll list them below. If you like any of them, that's great! But if not, we can definitely work around finding something that suits both of our needs.\n\n-----\n\n&gt;\nCity wide blackout for at least a week, and for someone whose scared of the dark, this could be bad. \n&gt;\nA camping trip sort of gone wrong when our two people get totally and completely lost. \n&gt;\nWe are a couple of thrill seekers, breaking into abandoned buildings just for fun. One of us could get hurt, scared by a little ghost, lost, or something else. I haven't really thought into it. \n&gt;\nMy Boyfriend/husband Just passed. You're my dearest friend who comes over all the time to console me. Romance could happen in this one, if you want it to. \n&gt;\nI break my legs in an accident, and end up partially paralyzed. I've given up, so the doctors have assigned me an at home nurse to help me around the house, and boost my spirits. \n\n-----\n\nThis is all I really got, I'd love to start any of them, or some of your own ideas!

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nThis is basically a shout-out post to anyone who is willing to RP. I use Discord primarily. I understand the fact that most people already have an established RP group or partners that they write with and the last thing I want to do is interfere. I understand if people just ignore this and don\u2019t reach out. I get it. Writing with someone new is always challenging at first as you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like. It\u2019s easier to write with those that you\u2019ve come to know really well and made friends with. And there\u2019s also the fact that I have anxiety and I\u2019m terrified of approaching people and annoying them.\n\nSo this is why I\u2019m making this post instead and anyone can reply or drop me a message if they\u2019re interested!\n\nBasically looking for anyone willing to RP Tony Stark with my Pepper. I have written for both Tony and Pepper before although I do prefer Pepper. I have a good few years RP experience and have used various sites though things have slowed to a halt for me to the point where I don\u2019t RP much these days except with one person. I use various apps as well and that can be discussed to choose whichever is preferable. I\u2019m honestly very laid back when it comes to RP and I\u2019m fine with most concepts as long as both of us are comfortable. And of course, having fun!\n\nThis can simply be a platonic relationship. We can discuss matters and decide if we want them to be romantically involved.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t mind writing some NSFW I do prefer actual storytelling and working on a plot. I\u2019m also from the UK, 21+ and I\u2019m fairly quick on replies. Though replies will be slower during the week while I\u2019m at work. I do prefer para/multi para to one liners.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid to contact me! I\u2019m the least threatening person ever. If you are interested just let me know and we can discuss further! All I\u2019m looking for is having fun, making sure whomever I write with is comfortable and also having fun, and making new friends along the way. I hope to write with some of you soon. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

My name's Min, she/her, uh,,, I'm an aries, with about 10 or so years of rping/writing experience under my belt right now, not the best at introductions, but we try our best here, yeah? Honestly, I'm just a goofy son of a bitch who's looking for some rp to cull writer's block, and make some friends!\n\nStyle: I only rp as third person, past tense. That's, honestly, the only non-negotiable thing about my style. I tend to keep it to 1-2 paragraphs, and I would like to have a partner who can do the same, but if you want to write more, that's totally fine! My writing length tends to fluctuate if there's a moment where there's a lot of action, it most likely will be more, but if it's kind of a slow moment, it might be less. But, it tends to be around 1-2 paragraphs. (man, I just walked myself in a circle huhljajldfkj) Time: I am in the CDT timezone, and would prefer to have someone within a reasonably close timezone, but it's definitely not a deal breaker! A lot of my friends are in massively different time zones. Availability:\n\nI am a, what's the word, loser with no life, and am more often than not available. I am possibly, however, getting a job, and if that happens, I will let you know if my hours change or anything. But, I'm typically on, and a pretty speedy responder!! What I'm looking for in an RP Partner!: Alright, so I'm a big advocate for ooc talk. I want to be your friend! Be nerdy with me, go lajdklfjalwkjf all the time about our characters TALK IN ALL CAPS, match my energy, act like you're excited! I really, really value people who will be goofy with me, because I'm goofy and need validation aljflkj--\n\n**Right now, I\u2019m looking for a M/M cyberpunk buddy cop-esque theme. Like, an older, more experienced cop being partnered with a younger, inexperienced street rat in a cyberpunk/post apocalypse themed world.** ***I would prefer to be the street rat, so please be comfortable with playing a stoic, kind of jerk older police man.*** **We can develop this as much or as little as you want!**\n\nWe can discuss limits when you message me !!\n\nAny hoo\\~ Looking for someone who's into a lot of OOC talk as well as serious worldbuilding and some fun! PM me and i'll let you know what my discord is--",

Despite all the flak the games have gotten over the years, I still find the universe and lore appealing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for someone that's a master at all there is to the games, not at all. I'm just looking for someone to have fun with, and to help me put together a wonderful story.\n\nAll that out of the way, I'm looking for something more surrounded around romance and adventure. An original story, between two characters. I'm completely open to dark themes, and bending the rules of the universe just a bit to fit, if need be. I'm flexible in these regards, and I'm open to doubling as well.\n\nAs for me, I prefer to keep my posts rapid fire. I find about 1-3 paragraphs per post enjoyable, and I'd prefer to stick around there so the story can move along. Other than that, I can't think of much else that needs to be said. Drop me a message if you're interested, I check Reddit often, so I should be able to get back to you rather quickly.",

            "selftext": "&gt;*The night was calm, the northern breeze came down from mountains blowing down into the valley where the sea of tents stretched as far as the eye could see. The scent of campfires filled the air, as did the soft buzz of conversations and the heavy steps of these men in Armor. They were called Astarte and although to the untrained eye of this young woman they all looked the same, the color patterns of each armor told her they were all from different legions. Just as she and her brethren were all from different cabals.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Right now the massive armies had gathered on the world of Zolea, one of many planets in the Eden cluster. Worlds that this woman had long called home. Right now, the leaders of the two armies were in long and detailed peace talks. And for now, things seemed to be going along smoothly. Looking up into the twilight sky, hazel eyes watched as the stars of the great void came into view. Lighting up the darkening sky, the woman knowing each light she saw was the sun of another world. A thought that made her smile.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The heavy steps of power armor drew her eyes away from the heavens, her thoughts back to what was happening around her. Slowly, she dipped her head in a low bow as she greeted a small group of Astartes crossing her path. The sight of her making them stop, studying her as she had studied them so many times before. She must have been an odd sight, a human woman who came up to about their chest. For like them she to was a warrior, though her oaths had been given to Eden. Her home. Her people. A warrior known as a Warden; men and women enhanced in their own way to guard the worlds they called him.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Though, unlike them, she was not a mound of meat and muscle. No, she was tall but slender. Thin but strong muscles hidden under flesh made her fast and agile. While she knew one of these men could snap her in two, she would like to see one catch her. The thought brought a smile to her lips, something that seemed to draw the attention of one of the iron giants who took a step towards her. An action that caused the woman to roll her shoulders some, making them look strong and proud as she tilted her head in simple curiosity. The action causing long auburn color hair to fall into her face, shadowing her bright hazel eyes.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cDo you need something Honorable Astarte?\u201d The words flowed from her lips, almost sing-song in its tone. The words pausing the Marine in his steps.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cHow about a name?\u201d The deep baritone of his voice, cracked by the vox on his suit, made her chest tighten a bit. Like the tone itself shook her to her core.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\u201cSpero, of the Statera Cabal.\u201d She pauses some then added. \u201cAnd you?\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething a bit different than my other request. While I can see this turning into a darker roleplay if the Peace Talks fall through and war is declared, I mostly see this as more of a light-hearted romance RP. Something to help build upon the Imperium and these worlds coming together. Details can be added and talked about in private message.\n\n**I would like for this to be a Warhammer 30k RP (we don't have to fallow the canon storyline 100% and make up our own Alt Time Line if you wish.)** *If you are willing to play canon characters that would be amazing!*\n\n**Some basic info about me \\[ooc\\]:**  \n\u2022 Feel free to call me Fox\\~  \n\u2022 Roleplayer of \\~15 years  \n\u2022 I live in Louisiana \\[CST Timezone\\]\n\n**ABOUT ROLEPLAYING:**  \n\u2022 18+ only (Players and Characters), with a love of Darker and more Mature roleplay.

This being action posts (as we do understand that at times, there not be much information to create full responses. Our community is fairly small, at least when compared to some other roleplay servers out there, and has a more relaxed pace although I do wish to one day change that. We are a fairly chill group and we do hope that you are as well. While our rules are not strictly enforced, we hope that you follow them as we don't have much tolerance for immaturity. Now then, on to the roleplay. \n\n\nThe year is currently 1689 and it has been about 50 years since the collapse. The First Mutagen War which managed to cripple humanity back into the broken states of North America. It was here, forged by fire, where Crossfate began it's legacy. Starting as a corporate backed city during the 26th century, the city was a primary global trade center, housing many of the best corporations such as Gemini Armaments and Suzaru Inc. It was during the fall of the world, when the city began to become an important foothold. As country after country fell to the Xylopod reign, numerous companies and immigrants would flock to the protective city, which erected a 50 foot defensive wall to keep the monstrosities out by the early stages of the war. It wasn't until 40 years later however, that the city would begin to extend its reach internationally. This is where you come in. Currently the TSF (military police force of crossfate) have secured a colony in Xylopod conquered Germany. This is the first time the new independent nation has ventured out into Europe and they need your help! \n\n\nA small list of unique values that this roleplay offers: \n\n\n{&gt; A detailed world\n\n{&gt; An occupation system - you decide the path your character takes\n\n{&gt; An ever-growing world set in a post-apocalyptic Europe\n\n{&gt; A huge array of weapons, armor, and items\n\n{&gt; A GM based storyline for individuals/groups\n\n{&gt; A well organized server with visual aids\n\n{&gt; A unique combat system\n\n\nHopefully that wasn't too long! And congrats if you've read this far. Anyways, for those interested, please DM me your username and some information about yourself so we could know a little bit about you prior to joining :) ",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm looking for someone to write with me a romance and adventure story! It doesn't have to be completely realistic either, fantasy or horror elements would be great as well. It can even go dark, especially since I'm considering the characters getting injured or ill but I don't want to push the darkness to extremes. Time period, I prefer modern but anything in the second half of the 20th century would be great too! I'm open to pretty much everything, just tell me your ideas and we'll see if we can find common ground. I'd like it better if you are 18 or over. \n\nI can be very busy, so I'm sorry if I don't reply right away but I tend not to take over a day, if I do, please send me a message. But in general, I tend to reply quickly and do various replies throughout the day. I'm okay writing in first or third person. I have to say that I struggle with \"mirroring\" sometimes, I'm not really someone who writes a lot of lines for a paragraph all the time. I can try, though. I don't really have other requisites overall. If you're interested or if you have any other questions, please send me a PM, thank you!",

That means I am very busy: there will be days when my brain will be fried and served with pickles. Against previous expectations, I have found time for a bit more writing, so I thought to bring this little request back.\n\n\u200b\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: I am going through acute grief with depressive symptoms. Writing may help some days or be impossible at others. I'll never ghost, though. My muse may also be very fickle, so I'm open to short stories too!\n\n\u200b\n\nI am looking for two writing buddies, who understand that I am no longer able to deliver novella type posts. For me, a writer can describe feelings and actions in few words, and this is what I seek right now. Meaningful but laid back realism, having fun, being able to relax.\n\n\u200b\n\nPlease be at least over 18, because mature themes will surely arise: not as a form of compulsion, but as an organic part of the story.\n\n\u200b\n\nAdult women is what I am looking to play at the moment, in MxF relationships. Romance and Drama are vital for me, as moving, evolving character studies of some sort. I am not interested in Anime or Furry, sorry about that.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis a Fandom Request, so without further ado, a small relevant list:\n\n\u200b\n\nWorlds:\n\n\u200b\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones,\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Lord of the Rings (Massive craving!)\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera\n\n\u200b\n\nCharacters I have some experience with:\n\n\u200b\n\nElia Martell\n\n\u200b\n\nBarbrey Dustin\n\n\u200b\n\nBethany Bolton\n\n\u200b\n\nLyanna Stark\n\n\u200b\n\nJayne Westerling\n\n\u200b\n\nRhaella Targaryen\n\n\u200b\n\nJoanna Lannister\n\n\u200b\n\nLothiriel, Queen of Rohan\n\n\u200b\n\nThere is a myriad of OCs I have for the above Fandoms, so please ask me about it. The canon list is not exhaustive either.\n\n\u200b\n\nThanks for reading all this and I hope to hear from you soon!",

I started roleplaying when I was just 16 years old and have been doing it ever since, I am now 21 years old. I have done everything from medieval, history, war, romance, fantasy, video games, and movies/tv shows. I have even done one where we play as ourselves and go day by day. I do appreciate roleplayers that have ideas and a simple idea of what they would like to do. I will admit that it might take me an hour or so to come up with a character, I also will send a photo if that\u2019s helpful. I just won\u2019t set anything inappropriate. I enjoy 70% of the story and the rest is smut. Besides that long introduction, I am looking for amazing partners that would like to come up with ideas together and start something! I roleplay in both 1st and 3rd, it all depends on my partner. I am mostly experienced with 1st, but have done a few 3rd perspective roleplays. Anyways, feel free to PM with some ideas! I don\u2019t mind if your male or female! Thank you! \n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi there! If you're a fan of the Heathers franchise (musical or film), then this post is for you! \n\n\n\nThe title is pretty self-explanatory, I think. I want someone (preferably a girl, but if you can play as a girl, that's cool too) for a DukeSaw roleplay. If you're new into the fandom, and not quite caught up on ship names yet, then I'll elaborate a bit. Basically, I want someone who can be my partner for a Heather Duke/Veronica Sawyer roleplay. \n\n\n\nNow, I'm not picky on who'll play whom, but that's probably because I don't have any particular script in mind for this. I want to get to know my partner's preferences and boundaries before we try anything. We can discuss plots and storylines when we're comfortable with one another. I'd prefer for us to do it from a third person perspective, mind you. \n\n\n\nAs for requirements, I ask that you at least be semi-literate. I haven't RP'ed in a while, but I still have standards. Oh, and don't apply if you're over 30, please. I'm not ageist or anything, but I wouldn't be comfortable with doing a romantic roleplay with someone that's that much older than me. \n\n\n\nOh yeah, I should probably give some information on myself too, right? Well, I'm an 18 year old bi girl, living somewhere in Africa. I'll only send a picture of myself to you if I'm comfortable with it. I've been roleplaying on-and-off since 2015, but I barely did anything this past year. And I think you can get a feel of my literary level from this post.\n\n\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading this post. If there's anything else you'd like to know, or if you have any suggestions to help make this post more understandable, feel free to comment below. But apply in PMs, please. With a brief introduction, if you've got the time. From there, we can migrate to Discord for further discussions and the roleplay itself. \n\n\n\nSincerely, me.",

I'm looking for people who would be interested in this scenario of mine. \nIf you've seen anime like 'Barakamon' and 'Sweetness and Lightning' or any other heartwarming slice of life shows, you'll know what kind of tone I'm looking for. Just fun little scenarios with a fantasy twist. \n\nSo onto the plot itself: It would take place in a world where half-human creatures exist (ones like lamias, fairies, mermaids etc), they'd be either well known or very rare. I'd preferably play as a lizard girl of some sort, while I'd like it if you would play as a human. Gender doesn't matter in your case. \n\nThe setting should be at least semi rural, since I was thinking that this would take place at a farm or a small village. My character would have come out of the woods in search of food, only to stumble upon a barn or shed owned by your character. The two would meet after mine causes some noise, and they'd get to know each other from there. I'd be happy to go through with you any ideas either of us would have for scenes, although I do have a few in mind. \n\nPlease write at least 3 sentences minimum per post, and have decent grammar and spelling. I'm up for using either Discord or Kik, so please PM me if this caught your attention. :)",

Their battle drug on for 2 days, and it finally ended with a clash of power so devastating that it ripped a hole in time itself. After this event took place, the timelines started to melt into one another, eventually forming into one big cluster of different universes.\n\nYou wake up exactly where you had left off, except something seems different about the world around you. As you cast your gaze upwards, you see a giant gash in the sky that looks extremely unstable as it pulsates with power. Other students from UA that you've never seen before are popping up all over the place, and the same goes for every other place on the planet. Copies of notorious villains and powerful heroes are appearing everywhere, and eventually people start to find out that they're each from alternate timelines. Despite the shocking realization, UA, Shiketsu, and other schools across the globe (as well as all the hero agencies) decide to band together and fight the villains that have suddenly quadrupled in numbers. All restrictions have been thrown out the window; no arrests are to be made. Every villain is to be knocked unconscious or killed. This is the battle royale of the infinite universe.",

            "selftext": "Hello!  I'm Cas and I'm looking for partners that are at least 21+ as that's old I am. Mature themes will be in my plots though limits will be discussed. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn't have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having long, thoughtful replies back where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and writing as I am, and please don't make come up with everything by myself. It's frustrating. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100%   dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance, using face claims. I\u2019m the type to makepinterest  boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs  that remind  me of our characters and/or ship.\n\nLast but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story  along. I\u2019m mainly looking for female authors writing male characters but  male authors are fine too.\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n* 21+ partners\n* For  you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to   advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n* For you to write as a male in their 30s-40s and older. I'm a sucker for  the  gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. The broken ones  who  are rough around the edges and aren't afraid to throw a punch. But  are  tender enough provide a hug if needed.\n* The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as  much  as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to  life.\n* The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of   ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be  delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces,  only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n* Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post or before it. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me.\n\nI love all types of genres, but especially urban fantasy and science fiction. Lately I\u2019ve been wanting something based off Castle Rock and/or True Blood. All  my characters will be adults and I require my partners  do the same.\n\nFor plot ideas, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and possibly writing. Look forward to hearing from you!",

Here are my ideas for World War 2 and A medieval fantasy. Storyline build up before anything big happens between the characters please. 16+ Preferred.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WorldWar2:** The war had just begun, you were drafted into the military at a young age and you were brought home for a victory dance in a small town. You walked in with your few mates that survived and instantly you were drawn to a female who had red hair that's curly, red lipstick, green eyes that had shown fun. She was dancing with everyone and taking turns with kids, elders, and young men. A lot of them tried asking her for coffee or a fate but she rejected them. Her dress was fitted at the top, it was yellow with blue flowers scattered around it. Her dress went up when she spun, her spirit was full of spunk, her black heels gave her blisters but she ignored them as she just let go and had fun, the record player blaring. Who was she?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Medieval/Fantasy:**  You're the future king of your country and you are forced to marry someone who's be on the other side of the war. She was the next Queen to be. She was different than most Royals. She stopped wearing dresses when her mother died, she was adventurous. She had magic that was passed down to her in her family that no one but the royal family knew. She had black curly hair with vibrant red streaks, though she never had her hair down. She kept it in a bun but she was still ladylike. The king had fallen sick, but no one knew that he was on his deathbed but three servants and her. He didn't want his daughter to be alone, and didn't want the war to continue, so the time came where the groom and bride would meet at a dinner three days before their wedding. But they didn't like each other, not one bit. She wore a mask that hid her face, scared of being rejected or something. But really it hid her beauty, she wanted to wait till her coronation to show everyone what she looked like. She had scars all over her 5'4 frame that was hidden away. She had gone through something traumatic when she was younger, but never talked about it.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking to gamemaster a player in one of two sandbox adventures. And to clarify: sandbox in this instance means that there will be no set plotline or \"Main Quest\" to pursue, but rather a set of circumstances to which the player will be able to respond in whatever way they see fit. This will in turn lead to new situations with new solutions, and so on and so forth. What emerges from this, then, will be the plot.\n\nThe first scenario is a post-apocalyptic scenario heavily inspired by Fallout, Mad Max and Wasteland. In this scenario, the player will take on the role of a \"Desert Ranger\" sent as a scout to a hitherto uncontacted region. It will be up to the player to determine what being a Desert Ranger means.\n\nWill you work to build a positive relationship between yourself and the various settlements and outposts of this region, or will you work to become a warlord and conquer the region for the Desert Rangers, or yourself? Alternatively you may choose to follow your orders to the letter, and merely impartially scout the area, never getting involved in its conflicts. The choice is yours.\n\nThe second is a mix of the first with the CRPG Tyranny. Your character is sent ahead of a conquering Overlord's armies to get the lay of the land and to prepare the ground for the invasion. You will have free hands to determine how you go about this. And perhaps you will come to sympathize with the people of this region, and subvert your orders in order to sabotage the approaching invasion?\n\nWhichever scenario we choose to pursue, the first step will be an open discussion about what we will expect to get out of this collaborative storytelling. And there will be plenty of collaborative worldbuilding going on as well!\n\nIf this sounds in any way interesting, don't hesitate to drop me a line.\n\nAnd until then, I hope you all have a great day!\n\nThanks for reading!",

I use kik or reddit for my role plays, and absolutely do not like discord, and refuse to use it. I don\u2019t know why, but it never rolled with me. As for what I\u2019m looking for, I\u2019m not clear on what I\u2019m looking for plot-wise, but I can tell you this: \n\nI\u2019ve never been good at describing fight scenes or action, but do like to incorporate it into my scenes. Some of my favorite roleplays I have done have included vampires, rich people, some fandoms, (I\u2019m also picky on those,) crime, reality, drama, romance, high school, trauma, and the list could go on forever. I know there\u2019s so many more, but these are the only things I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nLet me also mention this: I\u2019m not looking for a sex-based roleplay, but am more than fine with smut if it fits into the story. Also. as for pairings, I prefer MxF, with me as F, but I can dabble in FxF if it is necessary. \n\nMy preference for style is 1st person, but I can do 3rd as well. I don\u2019t care about post length, and think a paragraph is just fine. I cannot find 2+ paragraphs fun, as I feel like it hinders the partners\u2019 abilities to move the story along. Although, when starting a new roleplay I can definitely see where lots of words are necessary. \n\nIf you have any prompts, plots, or ideas you\u2019d like to discuss or roleplay, send me a message so we can get to creating something together. I hope you took time to read this, I tried to keep it short, so if you have any further comments/questions, message me! Thanks, Bailey. ",

My name\u2019s Ruby, and I\u2019m addicted to Booette.\n\nSeeing the Bowsette, and subsequently Booette, stuff blow up over the last few days has really inspired me to write some sort of story around the character, mostly because of how awesome the design is.\n\nThat being said, I feel like I\u2019d have more fun, and that the story would have more depth, if written with someone else.\n\nI don\u2019t have specifics in mind yet- just that I want Booette to be involved, and that I wanna play her. Anyone interested could play.. anyone, really. It doesn\u2019t have to be limited to Mario characters, since I feel that as a character, Booette has a kind of cross-genre and cross-platform appeal.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in working something out, PM me and we can go from there!\n\n(And for those wondering- yes, NSFW will PROBABLY be involved at some point. Doesn\u2019t have to be, but... it\u2019s Booette, so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)",

Despite all the flak the games have gotten over the years, I still find the universe and lore appealing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for someone that's a master at all there is to the games, not at all. I'm just looking for someone to have fun with, and to help me put together a wonderful story.\n\nAll that out of the way, I'm looking for something more surrounded around romance and adventure. An original story, between two characters. I'm completely open to dark themes, and bending the rules of the universe just a bit to fit, if need be. I'm flexible in these regards, and I'm open to doubling as well.\n\nAs for me, I prefer to keep my posts rapid fire. I find about 1-3 paragraphs per post enjoyable, and I'd prefer to stick around there so the story can move along. Other than that, I can't think of much else that needs to be said. Drop me a message if you're interested, I check Reddit often, so I should be able to get back to you rather quickly.",

(And other survivors we found\u2026)\n\nThe  Tragedy was hard on all of us, but at least we\u2019ve got each other to  stick it out with. Future Foundation are working on the outside to keep  us all safe. Hopefully we can stick it out and avoid cabin fever.\n\nOur  humble server was once a friend\u2019s only Canon character Danganronpa RP  server on discord. If you're looking for OCs, join and ask for the OC  server. Due to inactivity, people leaving and a desire to continue our  plot we\u2019ve decided to open this private club up to the public! Before  the inactivity wave settled in we ran event nights, these could include  anything from RP games such as truth or dare, seven in heaven or king\u2019s  game (From persona 4). As well as that we also did story focussed  events. We are a literate server so please be sure to write in third  person, use \u201c\u201d for speech and the like. You are free to play any  character and try any character you want. Although during events we do  keep it to first come first served due to plot reasons, there\u2019s no  logical way to explain clones. As for our server unique story:\n\n\u2606Welcome  to Hope's Peak Academy, or at least that\u2019s what it was before the  Tragedy. Now the schools acts as a survival shelter for all those who  were lucky enough to be let in by Jin. Here you will live, eat, sleep  and continue your studies whilst the world ends around you. After  Junko\u2019s plan to brainwash class 77 failed miserably, she was forced to  rethink her idea and wait another year allowing a new class (class 79,  comprised of the v3 characters.) to join the ranks of the gifted and  talented students. Shortly before the school was locked off for good  Junko pulled a sneaky move to gain the principal's trust, she claimed to  have found some survivors from the elementary school in Towa City. Then  the elementary school students managed to drag a survivor into school  with them. The Warriors of Hope and Junko were then safely sealed in  with the rest of the students. Those who you may recognize as the  captives of another universe (somewhere in the lands of DR:AE) have been  rescued solely because of their relationships with the other students.  We wouldn\u2019t want the hope of future society succumbing to depression  because of their lost loved ones, even if these new additions don\u2019t have  talents. Don't worry about running out of food or any other basic  necessities because Future Foundation on the outside are making sure the  place is stocked with everything a high school student could ever need.  Occasionally members of Future Foundation will visit the vault or even  stay for a short time. Some have even taken up permanent residence in  the school.\n\nCome joins us:\n\n[https://discord.gg/kVkmSdS](https://discord.gg/kVkmSdS)",

Here is what I have for a prompt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_++++\\_\\_\\_+++\\_\\_\\_+\\_++\\_\\_\\_\n\nI have never known a day of peace in my life. Matter of fact I do not even know what peace is. My country has been at war for what feels like hundreds of genrations. The thing is we still ahve no clue what we are at war with. Yes we know \\*what\\* it is but beyond the physical description we do not know anything. That is where I come in. I have been studing my entire life to try and find peace and I think I have finnaly figured it out. The key to peace is understanding.\n\nI am not a warrior, I know how to fight sure, but I am not a warrior. I am a bard. I find stories and I tell them. I know many laungages and hundreds of tales all with their unique lesson. I want to make my own story. I want the lesson to be PEACE. So here I am setting out on this quest for peace with our \\*enemy\\*. Wish me luck. END LOG 1\n\nJohn Eocene put stowed his journal to his back. He was human man from the town of Quatern  He had blond hair and a faint beard covering his face. His clothes were nothing special ust a light brown tunic and a backpack. He carried with him a small bow for hunting and a short sword for defense. Strapped along his chest hung a book full of spells he had picked up over time, some offence, some defense, and some just usefull. They were kept in a book no bigger than a fist and bound in leather all around on paper that could withstand almost any element. Across his back hung a guitar inside an impenetrable case of light metal.  The case had a symbol of an E with roses sourodning it. The same symbol could be seen adornded to his his chest on a small pin. To his face he wore round glasses that covered his brown eyes. He carried a walking stick with a green stone fixed to the top. \n\nOff he went on his journey of peace.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_++++++++++++++++\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_+++++++++++++\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis is the RP.\n\nI hope you can play the \\*enemy\\* and choose what the enemy is\n\nI figurefd they might be Elves, Nyphms, other humans. Please try to keep them huminoid unless you had a better idea. \n\nYour part will be to controll their culture while I controll the culture I come from. \n\nI do not know if this will become NSFW but please be 18+ incase this does enter that relm. Or enter the relm of romance. \n\nWe can do this first, or thrid person. Long replys or short, or a mix of both.\n\nThe world is DND esque with the same magic and combat and classes if that helps at all. \n\nLooking for a long term RP on Discord.  \n\nThank you for your time please feel free to message me if you have any questions.

            "selftext": "The Gods have walked on the ground of the earth for centuries. Unknown to us the high Pantheons of the Norse and Greek cultures were in constant feuds. Along with the great pain they caused mortals with their constant mettling, the primordial deities that birthed the gods decided to punish them. Gathered by Gaia they decided to cast them onto earth and scatter their symbols so they might never find them. The world that was once the Gods\u2019 playground was now their prison as they were stripped of their symbols and domains. While they maintained a portion of their power it was nothing compared to what they lost. Many Gods were eager to return to their domain above earth and started the quest for their symbols, hoping it was the first step in receiving favor back with the primordial deities. But all that searched reached no avail. They could not find the symbols of their power. So they started accepting their time on earth, blending in with the human cultures as they changed and warped; some better at adapting than others.\n\nNow here in the modern world the gods are all but forgotten beyond children\u2019s story books. The gods have been living their lives on earth throughout the centuries, but something is changing. Gods are disappearing, some even showing up dead. At first they were believed to be fading, their domains no longer existing in the modern age of humans but it didn\u2019t quite make sense with every disappearance. Then the Gods started to hear rumors of spottings; giants, and monsters of old. Their old foes, for some reason suddenly coming out of the woodwork, taking advantage of the deities\u2019 depowered state and starting to pick them off one by one. \n\nThey had to do something, despite their lesser state they were still too stubborn to allow themselves to go extinct. So for the first time since their curse on earth, Odin and Zeus have teamed up and called to all the Gods, using the few gifts they have left to spread word to the deities to come to New York and create a plan. They \\*will\\* get their symbols back along with their domains and true immortality. The real question is can they do it before too many more gods have been killed?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*This is a third person, literate roleplay.

I would prefer to rp as OCs bit could be convinced to play a Canon character. I mostly write around 1-2 paragraphs per response and try to reply several times a day, but that can vary due to availability. I will do my best to let you know if I will be unavailable for a long period.\n\nAlright, on to the fun stuff, the fandoms, I am currently looking for Star Wars, Naruto, and DBZ for rps. If you are interested in any other fandoms, then simply ask and if I am interested then we can rp in that universe. I hope to hear from you soon and find some new and fun adventures with you wonderful people.",

JUST DM ME :)\n\nI found this while digging around for a new place to hunt down fellow RPers.\n\nI am 32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job during the week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is to roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as intersex (some people are sensitive to general terms, so I cannot cite them here), and inhumans) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters.\n\nBe prepared for picture usage (real ONLY, such as actors/actresses/models). I've done writing descriptions for a while, but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years.\n\nI dabble in a few different genres and fandoms (there are more, but I have to recall them). Some examples:\n\n-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, or fantasy in the mix\n\n-Game of Thrones (alternate realities? Some point in the future? Why not!)\n\n-Marvel/DC (big points if you know and love the Arrowverse! It's a hard thing to find RP for compared to the MCU, which I play)\n\n-Harry Potter (I haven't dabbled in the Marauders Era that much, but Trio era is possible, and post-Trio era is likely)\n\n-Once Upon a Time (Guilty pleasure, I know, but I am of the mind the material and characters are there, but the writing needs to be)\n\nIf something isn't listed, then feel free to ask.\n\nI want semi literate to literate players. 3rd/third person, past tense. I mainly play on Discord since it's easier to bring on the go. There will be story, and there will be smut. I am of the mind that anything mature or adult can be enjoyable, but so can a good story.\n\nPLEASE BE THE SORT OF PLAYER WHO IS ON OFTEN DURING THE WEEK! I am sorry but it is what I am used to and enjoy :( .\n\nI am usually on from sometime in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play sometime, feel free to message me here to either drop your Discord name or ask for mine. Hope to talk to all of you soon! :)",

            "selftext": "Guardians. Defenders of the light. Great warriors of the common people, and bearers of epic power. Guardians led the people of Earth to greatness. They defended the city and its walls, while taming space, the lawless frontier. Their light was their sword, their shield, and their spirit. To have it all broken, taken from them in one days time.. it broke so many..\n\nGuardians killed guardians those next few days.. once great warriors were found dead through our the galaxy, torn apart by beings that needed no light, that served the darkness of the universe.. it was a time of great struggle, a time of death and sorrow.. a time where the true warriors stood above it all, and went on to survive this dark time.. the question now is who are you?\n\nHello everyone! As the title says, I'm looking for a destiny themed rp, with all the fun that entails. I've been looking into destiny lore a lot lately, and all the stories I hear of guardians and their lives makes me wanna make my own. So, here I am. I don't care what you play, how you play it, or (to a extent) how often you play, so long as these requirements are met. You understand destiny and its world to a decent extent, you are a literate or semi literate roleplayer, and that you make it a point to stay playful, and enjoy your time with me. I won't make it bad if you won't. If you like my opening idea above, we can totally use it as our plot! If youd like to do something else in this universe, let me know, and we can plan! With all that being said, I hope to hear from a lot of you. Give me your name, a bit about yourself, and what you desire from me, and we will go from there! ",

            "selftext": "Hello there!! I\u2019m looking for long-term partner for a Vikings themed RP. I\u2019ve recently watched The Last Kingdom, and the Vikings again..and I feel inspire to do a role play prompt based around that genre.   I have done many viking themed prompts before, and I have spent years gathering an understanding of Viking culture and normalities, and I would prefer if my partner could have some basic knowledge on the Viking life as well.\n\nAs for the prompt, I\u2019d like it if we can discuss this together so that we both get a plot that we can enjoy, instead of having someone become bored because it\u2019s not their style. I would like this role play to have a romantic prompt, but obviously not without the angst and hardships.  \n\nI consider myself a rather literate role player with years of experience, which is why I expect my partner to be the same. I write in third person, past tense only. I can\u2019t stand people who write in first person, although that\u2019s my personal taste. \n\nI\u2019m a male looking for a female partner, that has an original character to give to the prompt. I\u2019ve always preferred my character to play a \u201cAlpha male\u201d role. I feel like everyone enjoys the role play more when the characters are historically accurate, from clothing to personalities, and roles. For example, a Viking male may be more rough, dominate, and distant towards others.\n\nIf you want a Viking themed RP, please message me and we can exchange contact information(for kik) and then discuss the plot we want to take and other small details.. Also please be working on your character description when you message me, so we can focus more on the prompt.\n\nMy character description: \n\nName: Hrafn Gu\u00f0runarson (first name possible suspect to change)\nBasic Physical Appearance: Light brown hair, blue eyes, 185lbs, 6'4\", Caucasian\nAdvanced Physical Appearance*: A small scar along his chest from his father, rather normal nose, slightly big ears (not gigantic), slightly rounded face, square jaw. Hair is not overly long, but still a decent length.\nOccupation: Blacksmith's apprentice\nFamily Details: Father: Keith Farrar, farmer and militia when the call is out. Mother: Andrea Farrar. Not too wealthy, has a modest saving of money and gets free housing and food from his master. He's friends with most people, and very few have negative feelings toward him, but he's not adored either\nAge: 19\nAdditional Background: \n\nHrafn was born in the small village of Jorundal to his father, a farmer. His father was a tough built man, and was proud that his wife bore him several sons (and two daughters). Hrafn\u2019s father was born in the village as well, and is a farmer there like his father before him. Hrafn\u2019s father is also one of the men of the village militia, which was created to fend off any unwanted visitors and raids.\n\nHrafn himself was the youngest of the family, and as such was constantly picked on by his elder siblings. He and his brothers constantly fought and wrestled, which made Hrafn tough and well built, as it did his brothers. Around Hrafn\u2019s 14th birthday, he accidentally caused the death of a cow on his father's farm. The cow was the only one on the farm, and it cost his father a fair amount of money to replace it. Naturally the man was in a rage and beat Hrafn, then brought out his sword and swung. The blade scarred Hrafn along the chest, but his mother stopped anything from getting out of hand again.\n\nShortly before Hrafn\u2019s accident he found a job as a blacksmith's apprentice. He did a decent job, but not superb, and found he enjoyed the profession very well.  Hrafn secretly coveted the weapons in his master's shop, and was once caught practicing with one at the age of 15. His master, seeing that Hrafn was clearly interested in weaponry, quickly helped the boy get enlisted into the militia where he learned some light drills. The training never got put to use as of yet.\n\nLast year, Hrafn got into a fight with one of the village boys who was insulting his father. The fight was quick, and ended in the village boy bleeding, cursing, and running at the same time while Hrafn only got a few bruises. Hrafn once led a group of village boys scouting around the area outside of the village, he kept them in line and was complimented by his brother, a soldier.\n\nNow, Hrafn is ready to strike out and try and make a name for himself.",

I am seeking a 1 on 1 roleplay, but may agree to a group if I get enough interest.\n\nStory 1: Set on current day Earth exactly as we are now.  My character is a Male Wolvian from another dimension, he is of a race of wolf-like anthropomorphics (that may not be an actual word!) and is rather unique for his people....he is 7 feet tall immortal AND a cyborg.  As to how and why he is immortal and a cyborg is something I'd reveal as part of our roleplay, however whilst he is immortal he is not invulnerable and when healing from critical wounds he enters a meditative state and here is the key point of this story.  Your character will somehow discover my character who has for the last several thousand or maybe even million years been stuck underground in this meditative state unable to awake until released from his rock prison.  How, where and why your character finds mine will be up to you, but of course the event will change everything, not only do you find proof of alien life, but of advanced technology as well as the unexplained (the immortality is a form of magic).  I will add that I plan for his space-craft to also be on earth, either also buried or held by some secret agency who haven't been able to crack into it and that Earth will go through a rather rapid change from from being a pre-stellar people to being envolped in a war they knew nothing about and are barely coped to deal with....although that may come much later! (long-term goal)\n\nThings I want to stick with: Pretty much everything about my own character\n\nThings I don't mind changing: The planet being earth, if you want to play a non-human then I'm open to using a fictional planet, however I would like to keep it as being a non-spacefaring OR post space-faring but some incident has set the planet back in time (technology-wise).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory 2: Also set on Earth.  Similar to now, but meta-humans are starting to appear.  At the point we start the story they are still so rare that most people either do not believe they exist at all or put their feats down to miracles rather than a new truth to be accepted.  My character will be new to his powers, so new that he cannot control them and they occur mostly instinctively.  Whilst I'm not entirely decided on my characters powers I am thinking he has the ability to manipulate metal to use it as armour or a weapon initially this is very crude but later he can form complex creations that can make him look like Ironman, details are likely to be done on the fly.  Your character I'm thinking would initially be a friend, a guiding force, perhaps he first learns of his powers from protecting your character?  However later in the roleplay I'm thinking you develop powers of your own in a world that steadily gets used to meta-humans.\n\nObviously a bit shorter that one, but also more open to interpretation I think.\n\nI only want to run with one of these and I am hoping to roleplay with a female writer playing a female character, although if I get enough interest for a group then males/male characters are welcome (in this case we may need to use kik or Discord).  I'm not looking to start immediately (details are to be ironed out!) or write every day, but certainly 2-3 posts a week at least or more depending on how things go.  I will make it clear that I tend to play characters I consider Good aligned.  I also happy we share the responsibility of \"NPCs\", but do not directly control/write for each-others \"main\" characters.\n\nSend me a DM if you're interested and would like to discuss more?",

The vipers on the windshield doing their best to keep it clear. Lighting and thunder is really making a rather romantic weather kind of scary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe aren't exactly dating. I mean we've been friends for a while. I met her through a mutual friend and then we grew closer after a few coincidental hangouts together. One night she was too drunk to drive home so I let her crash at my couch. Imagine my surprise when I woke up to a breakfast in bed. She wanted to pay me back for letting her stay the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, we spent the next couple of hours talking. I learned a little about her. She wants to focus on her career. She learned to play a guitar in her teens but she doesn't anymore. She can apparently touch the back of her hand with her fingers. That part kind of freaked me out a little. She went home at noon but I found myself grinning to myself at her shenanigans till late night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was weird. I wanted to think about something else but it felt really sweet and giddy to think about her. I guess I really like her persona. So after a couple of days, we met again with friends at a movie theater. I saw her push her friend out of the way so she could sit next to me. I was secretly a little amused and happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the movie she kept leaning more and more into me. By the end of it, she was hugging my arm, snuggling into it. As we were getting out of the cinema, it start raining suddenly so everyone left in a hurry. But not before she leaned in to give me a kiss on the cheek. I was pleasantly surprised by it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was almost home when I got a call from her. Apparently her car had broken down and she asked if I could come pick her up. How could I say no? Obviously I turned the car around and started driving. It took me a while because she was a few miles in the opposite direction of my house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can see her car. I guess, I'll talk to MYSELF later now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI let out a little chuckle, amused at my own humor as I pull up next to your car.\n\n\\~ The End\n\nLeave me a message if you want to continue this roleplay.

The Ten Commandments and The Four Archangels were defeated. Meliodas was able to break the curse that was cast between him and Elizabeth, which where they were able to be together forever this time. Meliodas and Elizabeth went off together and disappeared then the rest Sins decided to split up once again and they haven't been seen since then. As the years passed by the demons have made their way back...but where are the Sins? Why haven't they come to stop them...Well if they won't come to save everyone then it's up to the Holy Knights! They will create their own Seven Deadly Sins and bring peace to Britannia once again! You are one of the holy knights who are fighting the demons in the Third Demon War. And you guys are losing. The 10 commandments are powerful and the demons are pushing you guys back and you are losing ground quick. However you receive orders from the higher ups to look for a man, this man was said to be the worlds strongest man when escanor died he took his title. He was a man who was speculated to rival the sun warrior. However you have no idea where he is. The only lead is that he was speculated to have saved a town a month ago.  \n\n\nIF ya like the rp please MSG me!",

            "selftext": "Good afternoon, all. I hope everyone is geared up for the weekend.  As usual, I'm looking for some more great partners for some of my cravings. Hopefully you'll find something that interests you.\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* First off, the all-important literacy expectations we all hate to talk about. I am a writer at heart. I have been a writer for longer than I can even remember. When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I am quite a stickler, and when I got my useless English degree, I didn't get it because I love the literary canon. Because...I don't. I got it because I love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* I do not use any IM service. I use *email* or, if necessary, reddit PMs.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Final Fantasy X(Yuna)\n* Final Fantasy XII(Ashe)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)[Preferably before season 7.]\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Ragnhild had hope to redeem herself by joining the Norsemen in the raid of England. This raid would secure both her and her son financially so that they could continue to live as they had before they were exiled from Norway. Unfortunately a storm changed the course of their destination, as the sea changed colours, and the wind blowed in every direction. The Norsemen were hoping that land would greet them with open arms at any moment, however land did not come too quickly. Food supplies were rationed as a way to make food last, and water was only drank once a day. Men and woman took turns rowing the gentle longboat along the water, until finally they reached the shores of Kingdom of Northumbria in south-east Scotland. The Norsemen wasted no time in hauling the longship upon the beach, and fighting. The warriors of the Christian army had already assembled to fight as we gathered supplies to sustain our hunger and thirst. The Christians had sent envoys to give a message of a peace treaty, although the Viking\u2019s had killed them to show that they didn\u2019t want any peace. They had fought after that, a bloody battle, with much men lost from both sides of fighting. Ragnhild had survived though, along with the other half of the Norse army. Ragnhild had captured a Christian warrior that had fought, and failed to attack her. Although he wasn\u2019t far from killing her, if he hadn\u2019t slipped on the mud his dagger would of been through her heart. Ragnhild had taken the man back to the longships after the battle had ended, and feed him water and food from her rations. \n\nWhat I haven\u2019t mentioned in that little insight is that this isn\u2019t just a woman captures a warrior, and then they fall in love and get married. I wanted to add something different, and I thought it would be that my character is a bit manipulative and abusive. So basically theprompt is: A Christian Warrior was taken captive in Scotland during a Viking raid by a shield maiden, where he was brought back on the longships to Greenland. The shield maiden holds ownership over the young warrior. The woman decides to use manipulation, emotion and physical abuse to get what she wants from him. Which is, a husband figure to help run her estates and give her children whilst under her control. Although the real reason could be that she is lonely ever since she killed her husband. \n\nI want your character to play the captive warrior. I don\u2019t want him to be fragile or weak, but instead strong, far stronger than my character. This isn\u2019t a slave-master role play, but instead it\u2019s a prompt based around manipulation. The reason your character wouldn\u2019t run away from my character, even given your strength, is because your character is a Christian and therefore hated in Ragnhild\u2019s society.My character, the woman, manipulates your character (this is one of the reasons) into assuming the family you once had as well as the life is now gone. In the eyes of the public my character would allow you to act the dominate one, to give the other northerners the impression that you are a warrior who is able to control his wife and children, although within the home my character becomes the dominate one and runs the house. This doesn\u2019t go to say that your character can\u2019t fight back. I expect them to be at each other\u2019s throats most of the time. I want smut to be involved later in the story, although the beginning is to focus on the roles. I also want the two to have children later on and to obviously get married. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a male partner that is literate, and has good grammar. I really don\u2019t want a partner who types \u201clik dis\u201d. Third person is a must, because i won\u2019t do first person at all. If you are a writer who does one-liners, I\u2019m not interested and would prefer if my partner could write at least 2 paragraphs. Below I have given a description of my character, and I would like you do do the same upon messaging me on kik so that we can get straight into the role play without having to deal with anything else. PM me for contact information if you\u2019re interested in this Roleplay. \n\n\nMy character description:\n\nCharacter Basic Application:\nName: Ragnhildr Hr\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir\n\nBasic Physical Appearance: Hildr has light brown hair, and green eyes. She stands at \u201c5\u20197, with a tan/pale complexion. \n\nAdvanced Physical Appearance*: rather normal nose, slightly big ears (not gigantic), rounded face, oval jaw. Hair is reaches midriff. \n\nOccupation: Cloth Maker. \n\nFamily Details: Father, Hr\u00f3lfr nefja, wood carver. Mother, Porunn. Modest collection of money. \nAge: 20\n\nAdditional Background*: RagnHild raises her son alone in Greenland after her exile from Norway, for the murder of her child\u2019s husband. Ragnhild had murdered him because he had denied her orders, and undermined her power by taking full possession of her estates. The Norsemen figured a reasonable punishment for a wife who killed her husband was to exile both her and her son to a new colony. Ragnhild had hoped that the exile would act as a new beginning for both her and her son. But she never escaped the disgusted expressions, and hushed whispers of the crowd even in a different country. She managed however, to make a modest saving of money from working as a cloth maker within the village to buy a longhouse once belonging to woman and her husband. The longhouse was of medium size, and had enough room for her child, herself and a thrall. ",

            "selftext": " Hi, I'm Leila!\n\nI've been roleplaying for well over ten years now, and writing short stories during dry spells of roleplaying, so I can assure any potential partners that I am 'literate' and write detailed posts. However, I give what I get - if I get five paragraphs, you're getting five paragraphs back. If we go down to one sentence, normally in dialogue, I will give you one sentence in reply.\n\nSo, I'm looking for modern, and male slash. Sorry, no straight or female slash, no fantasy, and the only canon roleplay I would do is Gundam Wing (Hit me up if you're into that; I miss doing it!)\n\nHonestly, it's a case of PMing me and discussing what particular modern-type roleplay you would like, or what pairings you would like. I write intros from scratch when needed, but I do have a few typed up to give examples of my genres -\n\n* Drug addict x Dealer/Drug addict\n* Stripper/dancer x Client\n* Roommates (this is very broad; could be friends, could be strangers, could be in a band together, could be gay x in denial)\n* Hitchhiker x guy-who-picks-him-up\n* Settings in a cafe, nightclub, college, rehab, mental health facility, etc. are all welcome suggestions. Just suggest what you'd like \\~ the very worst I can say is no!\n\nI tend to like gritty subjects such as drug addiction, mental health problems, etc. with some amount of drama but I also like fluffy scenes and I'm happy to write smut or fade to black; your decision.\n\nI'm on my laptop all day, most days, with a GMT timezone. But I know lots of people have these things called 'ly-ives' so I respect that going quiet, or going slow, is something that may happen. Even so, I would appreciate at least one post a day, or just let me know if you're going to be busy, going away, etc. etc. OOC chat is the best way to make a roleplay work, and I don't mind chatting about other things, either! Let's get to understand each other.\n\nLike I said previous, please PM me to begin the discussion :3 I roleplay over email and Discord primarily but will consider other avenues. ",

            "selftext": "Hi! My name is Brianna, I'm seventeen and I am looking for a long-term RP partner! I'm new to Reddit, but the Roleplaying community here looks incredibly active which makes me pretty happy considering I really wanna jump full force back into the RPing scene! I've been RPing for about two and a half years now and I primarily respond to my partners with a paragraph or two as I don't like to go on too long before having a response. \n\n I would prefer to do Oc x Oc platonic or romantic, but depending on which canon character you want to play I could give it a go sometimes! For example I've always kind of wanted to do a RP where my main character somehow falls in the pathway of Michael Myers as silly as it sounds. But again, I would prefer Ocs! I typically like to do a bunch of different Rps, not just one that can range from canon, such as my base story, or my partners base story though I would prefer to start with that. I would love to do Sci-Fi aus, Aus like maybe a coffee shop owner, though I prefer more adventurous RPs like Mafia stuff, pirates, to me the more tense and dramatic a RP can get the more I'm interested! My canon story is a more mythic and magic one, with my characters all being non-human, such as Satyrs, elves, Vampires, Harpies, Demons and that sort of thing.\n\n I enjoy all sorts of shipping,  \\[MxM\\] \\[FxM\\] and \\[FxF\\] primarily though I do prefer to play the more feminine role, my male characters though aren't simple soft boys though, I wanted to avoid that because I didn't just want to tailor them to me, I wanted them to be fun and dynamic! I would like it if your characters were a permanent thing, not made for each individual RP as I like to go back and do new things with the same or even new ships with those charas! \n\nI have Skype and Discord though I'm a bit more active on skype as I have more people I know there. I did just download Discord though, as everyone seems to use it! So if I make a mistake, or mess up a little it wont be quite so embarrassing! :D",
