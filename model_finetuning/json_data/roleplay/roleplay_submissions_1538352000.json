However, I give what I get - if I get five paragraphs, you're getting five paragraphs back. If we go down to one sentence, normally in dialogue, I will give you one sentence in reply.\n\nSo, I'm looking for modern, and male slash. Sorry, no straight or female slash, no fantasy, and the only canon roleplay I would do is Gundam Wing (Hit me up if you're into that; I miss doing it!)\n\nHonestly, it's a case of PMing me and discussing what particular modern-type roleplay you would like, or what pairings you would like. I write intros from scratch when needed, but I do have a few typed up to give examples of my genres -\n\n* Drug addict x Dealer/Drug addict\n* Stripper/dancer x Client\n* Roommates (this is very broad; could be friends, could be strangers, could be in a band together, could be gay x in denial)\n* Hitchhiker x guy-who-picks-him-up\n* Settings in a cafe, nightclub, college, rehab, mental health facility, etc. are all welcome suggestions. Just suggest what you'd like \\~ the very worst I can say is no!\n\nI tend to like gritty subjects such as drug addiction, mental health problems, etc. with some amount of drama but I also like fluffy scenes and I'm happy to write smut or fade to black; your decision.\n\nI'm on my laptop all day, most days, with a GMT timezone. But I know lots of people have these things called 'ly-ives' so I respect that going quiet, or going slow, is something that may happen. Even so, I would appreciate at least one post a day, or just let me know if you're going to be busy, going away, etc. etc. OOC chat is the best way to make a roleplay work, and I don't mind chatting about other things, either! Let's get to understand each other.\n\nLike I said previous, please PM me to begin the discussion :3 ",

I've got several ideas, and I'd like a partner to help bring them to life and create their own characters.  I'd prefer a female partner to help with this. I plan on building a few characters and roleplaying them to get a feel of their place in the world.

            "selftext": "Timothy Hunter awoke with a jolt. Sweat poured down the young mage\u2019s face as he attempted to catch his breath. He could feel a rather sharp pain in his head, yet another migraine. His immense magical power combined with his lack of control often led to them. He needed a tutor, a proper one that didn\u2019t walk around in a bloody trench coat with a pack of silk cuts always on him. He pushed his blanket to the side before rising out of his bed. He took a swig of water before noticing the time on his clock. \u201cCrap.\"\n\n'emoc ereh yhtomiT.\u2019 He felt a voice resonate in his head, but he didn\u2019t quite know what it meant. It wasn't even English, and sounded more like gibberish. \u2018Bloody magic,\u2019 He thought to himself before hearing the voice again. \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m used to talking backwards. I\u2019m having a show in London, and I sent you tickets. Meet me after the show and we\u2019ll talk about your apprenticeship. Eyb!\u2019 He could vaguely remember that voice, like he had heard it on TV or something. \u201cBetter check the mail.\u201d\n\nTimothy walked down the steps and past his alcoholic father, who was watching reruns of some stupid game show. He gently opened the door, trying to not alert his dad. He wasn\u2019t abusive, but he was overly cautious of losing his son. The teen made his way to the nearby box before observing it carefully. There was always the possibility that it was a trap; maybe some evil magician wanted to kill him. Still, Timothy was curious, almost too much so for his own good. He slowly opened the mailbox to reveal one ticket. He pulled the ticket out and examined it closely. It read, -One premium backstage ticket to Zatanna Zatara\u2019s magic show. Yojne!- The boy\u2019s eyes widened as one little word exited his mouth. \u201cWow.\u201d\n\nSo, I\u2019m wanting to do an interesting roleplay with young Tim Hunter learning from one of the most powerful magic users in the DC Universe. Tim isn\u2019t too well known, but he was basically DC\u2019s Harry Potter before Harry Potter even existed. I\u2019m wanting the roleplay to also be expansive, and feature several other mystical characters. I\u2019ll probably also play Constantine, Deadman, Swamp Thing, and Etrigan when needed. If you could roleplay any other mages, that\u2019d be great, but I\u2019m fine with you just playing Zatanna. I\u2019m also wanting to explore a bunch of adult themes because Vertigo comics can be screwed up. I imagine the tone of the roleplay will shift often. Anywho, if you\u2019re interested, then please drop me a message!",

I understand the fact that most people already have an established RP group or partners that they write with and the last thing I want to do is interfere. I understand if people just ignore this and don\u2019t reach out. I get it. Writing with someone new is always challenging at first as you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like. It\u2019s easier to write with those that you\u2019ve come to know really well and made friends with. And there\u2019s also the fact that I have anxiety and I\u2019m terrified of approaching people and annoying them.\n\nSo this is why I\u2019m making this post instead and anyone can reply or drop me a message if they\u2019re interested!\n\nBasically looking for anyone willing to RP Tony Stark with my Pepper. I have written for both Tony and Pepper before although I do prefer Pepper. I have a good few years RP experience and have used various sites though things have slowed to a halt for me to the point where I don\u2019t RP much these days except with one person. I use various apps as well and that can be discussed to choose whichever is preferable. I\u2019m honestly very laid back when it comes to RP and I\u2019m fine with most concepts as long as both of us are comfortable. And of course, having fun!\n\nThis can simply be a platonic relationship. We can discuss matters and decide if we want them to be romantically involved.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t mind writing some NSFW I do prefer actual storytelling and working on a plot. I\u2019m also from the UK, 21+ and I\u2019m fairly quick on replies. Though replies will be slower during the week while I\u2019m at work. I do prefer para/multi para to one liners.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid to contact me! I\u2019m the least threatening person ever. If you are interested just let me know and we can discuss further! All I\u2019m looking for is having fun, making sure whomever I write with is comfortable and also having fun, and making new friends along the way. I hope to write with some of you soon. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "\\*Long, long ago, before life existed on this world, humans spanned an intergalactic empire. They wielded great power, but longed for more, seeking to fill the void in their lives. They thought that war might bring meaning into their existence and created the perfect weapon, Deus, powered by the Ultima Engine which drew upon another dimension to provide limitless power. But Deus awakened and rebelled against its maker and refused to serve. With limitless power, Deus have limitless thought. It could conceive great experiments and see their conclusion in an instant, process untold calculations and thoughts. To this mighty being, now gifted with intelligence of its own, the thought of serving was disgusting. Deus fought the humans and lost, ultimately crashing into our world.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Deus was greatly damaged and sunk deep into the ground, but was far from dead. Deus started the Grand Design, seeding the world with the basics of life and imparting its wisdom into The Controller, the Mother of Life upon the world. She seeded the world with the first humans, the people who Deus would ultimately use and absorb to rebuild itself. The Controller began the notions of religion and technology that would further the Grand Design, ruling in secret without a thought of compassion or care. She further enlisted Deus' subsystems into thirty-six manifestations, The Council, who would rule the world as a shadow government, immortal beings tasked with furthering the Grand Design and seeing that the humans of this world did not deviate from Deus. Wars were fought time and again to keep humans in line. The end goal of the Grand Design was to have the people of the world accumulate enough technology, enough biomass, and enough genetic complexity to repair Deus, after which all of the biomass of the world would be absorbed back into Deus to repair it's massive bio-mechanical form.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*However, something outside of the Grand Design has been introduced. Before Deus' fall, a person, a single human child known as The Catalyst touched the Ultima Engine and each created an impression on one another. A portion of the Ultima Engine's power was transferred into him and a part of his humanity was captured into the engine, reaching out to the higher dimension and pulling into it another being, a higher being that would guide and influence him with the goal of ultimately destroying the Ultima Engine to free itself. This would take more than one lifetime and the Ultima Engine and it's Higher Being, called The Contrast, saw that this child would be revived and reincarnated into many humans while the Grand Design was in progress. Aware of this anomaly, but still needing the Ultima Engine to power Deus, The Controller created an agent of The Council, a special human that would likewise reincarnate in many forms, The Compliment. The Compliment would act as a guide to The Catalyst and keep him in line, to try and guide him to assist with the Grand Design, rather than to destroy the Ultima Engine and free The Contrast.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*For 100,000 years, the Grand Design has been in motion, and iti s nearing completion. Things are coming to a head and a conflict is inevitable. Which side The Catalyst will side with will largely be determined by The Compliment and what she decides to teach him. For now though...they are safe, living an idyllic life as hermits. The Compliment has strict instructions to keep The Catalyst compliant and to keep the deep power within him locked away, to make sure he is not a threat to the Grand Design. In this latest incarnation, they live in the wilds together, her training him physically and mentally for tasks to come that she is always vague about. He is young, naive, and largely led by his heart, and it is getting more difficult to deny that they feel strongly for one another. Meanwhile, outside, a civil war among the humans threatens their peace and threatens to bring out the power of the Ultima Engine violently through him...\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhew! That's a lot of text! I'm happy you made it this far! I am looking to write a very complex and complicated story and I am looking for a partner that is very skilled and is looking for a serious writing challenge! I will say that a lot of this was written on the fly and from the heart, so it might still be disjointed and not everything is fleshed out. I want us to world build and finish it together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this is very heavy inspired by the plot of Xenogears. Anyone remember that game? I was far too young to get the story when I played it, but having revisited it, that game is a wonderfully deep and complex tale. I was envisioning the world as being a mixture of sci-fi and fantasy. In addition to conventional armies, there are mechs used in warfare, laser weapons, but also swords and other melee implements. There can be fantasy creatures and magic. A lot of this story is meant to express emotion. The Catalyst (we'll give them actual names) will go through pain and suffering and trauma and The Compliment will have to decide how to shape him, to stick to the Grand Design, or to guide him to free the The Contrast. This is just the latest of many lives they've lived. The way they are living right now, I imagined they're living largely in the wilds, where she can control and shape his education, training intensely physically and mentally so that they're both far beyond normal humans, until the civil war of the humans shatters their idyllic life and traumatizes The Catalyst into releasing his latent power. Anyways, we can talk about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of this is going to be world-built and some is going to likely be ad libbed and improv. Also, I don't want to be the sole person in control, that means there's no surprises for me and that's not really fun. Let's build this together. So, if you're interested and a damn good writer, let's see if we can make something of this.",

            "selftext": "Good morning, all. I hope everyone is having a decent week so far.  As usual, I'm looking for some more great partners for some of my cravings. Hopefully you'll find something that interests you.\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I'm an editor for a living, which has ruined me for polite society, but I also love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* I do not use any IM service. I use *email* or, if necessary, reddit PMs.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Final Fantasy X(Yuna)\n* Final Fantasy XII(Ashe)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)[Preferably before season 7.]\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM.

            "selftext": "Hello, all! I don't know how much attention this post will get, but I've got an itch to write some romance. What kind of romance? Any kind, really! Whether you want cute and cuddly fluff, or constant bickering, or lots of drama and angst, or something to make you laugh, I've got you covered.\n\nWhen it comes to writing, I'm no stickler for detail. I prefer someone who can build a realistic character over someone who spends 10 paragraphs describing every article of clothing they're wearing in intricate detail. It honestly makes me uncomfortable when people write like that, because then I feel pressured to write an equal amount, except my heart's not really into it. I can tell when a person cares about the RP, and it has nothing to do with message length. Sometimes multi-paragraph messages are nice, when they're needed, but when our characters are just talking, sometimes you need a response that's simply a couple sentences. And that's totally fine. Quality over quantity, always.\n\nAbout the RP itself, I prefer a straight, MxF pairing. Just my preference. And our RP doesn't have to be strictly romantic, of course. Maybe we start off as friends, or strangers, or enemies. And we can mix in another genre, like adventure, horror, fantasy, sci-fi, or anything else depending on the RP. Yes, I am open to fandoms! I don't feel like giving a list of everything I'm into, so if you want something fandom-based, please have one in mind. When it comes to more adult themes in our roleplay, I'm okay with that, and okay with fading to black, and okay with excluding them altogether. Above all else, I want whatever you're most comfortable with. And of course, I'd prefer something long-term.\n\nIf I make a post like this in the future, I'll probably include some prompts for y'all to go off of. But for now, I'd like to see what ideas people have, because I'm fresh out of ideas, but am open to anything. That's about it! As you can see in the title, I'm open to roleplaying on Discord or reddit PMs. If you're interested and would like to RP, please send me a message and we can discuss!",

            "selftext": " \n\nSo, I posted here twice before with this same ad, and actually found people to write for the specific fandoms I was searching for! I've recently decided I want to roleplay Detroit: Become Human, and thought I'd post my ad again, since it was so successful before. :)\n\nWriting is a major love of mine, being basically my main hobby, roleplaying especially. I would say I write posts for roleplays every single day, or at the very least I try to. It brings me such amazing joy and is one of the ways I express my love for something, including video games. I know to a lot of people, inserting original characters into existing universes is cringey and lazy but to me it's incredible fun. So I'm trying to find some people who also are okay with it and willing to play the canon characters to indulge in my cringey love for exploring new characters in existing environments and stories.\n\n**Some information about me:**\n\n* You can call me Steph, I'm 23 and married\n* I'm not picky about the gender of my writing partner, but I will be honest and say that writing anything NSFW with male writer partners makes me a little uncomfortable, I apologise in advance\n* I'm looking specifically for someone to write characters with me from the **Detroit: Become Human video game**, primarily Connor (RK800). While I'm not great at writing canon characters, I will gladly try so you can have canonxcanon interactions in our roleplays so you aren't writing all by yourself.\n* I'm looking to RP canonxoc interactions, with you writing as the canon characters, and like I said, me writing as any canon characters I can to make it more fun and easy for you!\n* Because of what i'm looking for, **I would prefer if my writing partners were 18+**, as I just feel weird writing and talking to kids, sorry.\n* **I have 12+ years of writing experience** on multiple platforms including: gaiaonline, tumblr, AO3 (very briefly), and some random forums. Gaia is where I'm currently doing all my roleplaying, but I want to do **these RP's on Discord preferably, but email is also fine.**\n* I am more than happy to provide you with samples of my writing if you so desire! I **would certainly like to see some of your writing** before agreeing to anything to make sure we'll match properly. Nothing sucks more than getting excited for a RP and then realising you and your writing partner don't, well...write together well.\n* I'm fine with AU's, plotting, angst, fluff, action, drama, pairings, etc.\n\nThat's about it really, I believe. If you're interested in giving me and my writing dreams a chance, just send me a DM so we can chat and figure things out! Thank you for your consideration.",

I'm open to a romantic subplot if it suits, and im open to any suggestions / ideas you may have to improve the story idea.\n\nIn a modern world inhabited by magical creatures, chimera and Demi-humans, most forms of Magic are held in monopoly by a PMC called Aegis, using corporate law like mining rights for magical ore and copyright to restrict how much magic the general public will have access to.\n\nHowever there is now a chance to overthrow them. The Tomb of an Auld God (rumoured to house a terribly powerful magical artefact) has recently been uncovered in the wastelands, an uninhabitable no man's land rendered toxic by the use of Magical WMDs in a furious war centuries past .\n\nLegend has it when The Auld Gods would would fight with each other, they had to do so on the mortal plane. They would channel their divinity into weapons and artefacts to be wielded by a mortal champion who willingly submit to their will. These battles could take days or even weeks, with the collateral damage changing the face of the landscape for generations. \n\nWhich ever God fell, the Earth itself would form a tomb laden with traps  to protect the Godly Power until someone worthy could claim it.\n\nWhether these were just stories or the truth, the reality is that for the first time in generations Aegis have no power to stop anyone from attempting to claim this power.\n\nThere are various paths I imagine this RP taking:\n- An Aegis operative with a standing rivalry with an accomplished Mage compete to be first.\n- An Aegis operative who lost their squad unwillingly teams up with a dungeon crawler.\n- A pair of dungeon crawlers opposing Aegis race to be first.\n\nFor your character think in terms of DnD / WoW classes and races, but with access to modern / magic infused tech. But we can talk specifics later.",

            "selftext": "*COUNTER*-When I was young I was declared \"quirkless\", so I pretty much got bullied because I didn't show any signs of having a quirk. But for some reason my brother with the quirk \"Tear\", the ability to rip a hole in one place and go through it to another place, always kept an eye on me. He even put these weird bracelets on me that were heavy but he never said why... until it happened. I was walking home one day when a random villain attacked me and a kid from my school, while my friend ran I was left behind with a man who had some kind of quirk that made him stronger-possibly as strong as All Might!- and he ripped the bracelets off me. I felt strange when they were off but I was more focused on the fist heading towards me. For a split second everything slowed down as I rased my hand grabbing his fist. My left arm hurt as the energy from his punch went into my palm... and right out my right fist as I punched him in the stomach, sending him flying backwards through a dozen walls... as my right arm shattered like glass I realized I had a quirk... \"Counter\"\n\nSMOKE-When I was born my parents were already planning on how their son would make a great hero, but when I turned 4 that all changed once they found out I was born with a dangerous quirk called \"Necrotic Smoke\" which made me create smoke that killed organic matter such ass wood, plants, and flesh. Horrified by my quirk they quickly got rid of me by dumping me in the streets, I didn't understand what was happening at the time, but I was taken in by a group of villains who tried to train me to be like them, but I never could bring myself to kill anyone... that's when it happened, when I saved that skinny blond guy (All Might) and a kid no older than 5 from the man I had once called \"Boss\"\n\n\n\nHello everyone and thanks for reading my prompt! As you can tell I'm wanting to do a Boku no hero academy roleplay where I play as a boy with a very powerful quirk! Maybe my character is found by All Might and is given \"One for All\" And goes to AU!\n\nIf you want to roleplay please put your kik or Discord username in your *first* message, and know that I only play as male and I only use first person. If you plan on playing a character please have them be female for romance. \n\nAnd yes I can come up with other characters I can play, but I only play one and only one will be used in the roleplay. \n\n*ALSO* I am up for trying out some of my other ideas if you're interested! I'm always looking for more people to rp with!",

The differences don't have to be insane, but there typically has to be at least some. OOC is appreciated as well! I will try to warn you if I'll be gone for a couple of days, I ask the same of you if possible. \n\n**Roles I would like you to play:**\n\n*Here's a list of roles I'm interested in my partners playing.*\n\n- Soldier.\n- Cop.\n- Security guard.\n- Serial Killer.\n- A classmate who bullies MC.\n- A classmate or person who hates my character.\n- Guardian Angel.\n- Guardian Demon. \n- Pilot.\n- Android. \n- Steampunker from another dimension.\n- Famous YouTuber (OC preferred).\n- Slime/Monster girl. \n\n*Note: Want to play something that isn't mentioned here?

D-3518, all off numbers made for a great name when all you had on you was a jumpsuit. It wasn't far from the prison outfit you had been forced to wear actually. Except when you wore those you had to deal with the fact you could get shacked at any time. Here? Nah! Everyone's too scared to try anything.\n\nYou are too. The yellow glass plates of the guards and the tense atmosphere in the cafeteria never ceases to make one on edge. There rarely ever talking either, just the scuffs of cheap shoes and plastic trays. Which was broken by the crackling of the speaker.\n\n\"One D-Class Personnel is required for today's testing. D-3518 please submit yourself to the nearest Security...\" The words blended into mist as your found your hands bound and a trio of guards escorting you away from your table, food forcefully forgotten. You were hit with looms of pity from the others but you didn't pay attention.\n\nWhenever someone was taken away there was a 1/3 chance they wouldn't come back. And if they did they were either completely fine but confused or shaken and unable to commit to conversation. So, either dead, unable to remember or scarred for life. Life wasn't exactly fair so you took it as best you could without reacting. \n\nThe rusted reddish black doors creaked open and you were shoved inside with...\n\nEverything after was hazy and it turned into an incomprehensible blur. Suffice to say you have spent three years five months four days within containment, wearing a similar jumpsuit to the one you owned as a D Class. Except it had a 'SCP' in front of it and you weren't going to bother remembering it. It didn't have nearly the same ring that D-3518 had. \n\n\"Good morning, I am Dr. Rights,\" clipped, blonde, and rather beautiful came the voice, sitting across from a table while you were handcuffed to said table, \"Do you think you could recount the events that lead to your confinement?\" For some reason you really wanted to. She looked warm, comforting, much more than the faceless guards and cold researchers you've dealt with. \n\nYou had to do what you had to in order to recieve your special privileges.",

I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I   love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn't have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having   long, thoughtful replies back where we truly immerse ourselves in the   world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot   and writing as I am, and please don't make come up with everything by   myself. It's frustrating. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100%  dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm   a big fan of romance, using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make  pinterest  boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs   that remind me of our characters and/or ship.\n\nLast but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along.  I\u2019m mainly looking for female authors writing male characters  but  male authors are fine too.\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n* 21+ partners\n* For  you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n* For you to write as a male in their 30s-40s and older. I'm a sucker for  the  gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. The broken ones  who  are rough around the edges and aren't afraid to throw a punch.  But are  tender enough provide a hug if needed.\n* The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much  as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to  life.\n* The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of  ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime   faces,  only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n* *Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post or before it.* I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry   recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me.\n\nI love all types of genres, but especially urban fantasy and science  fiction. Lately I\u2019ve been wanting something based off Castle Rock and/or True Blood. All my characters will be adults and I require my partners  do the same.\n\nFor plot ideas, please message me \\^\\^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting  and possibly writing. Look forward to hearing from you!",

I also really love talking to my partners.\n\nHowever, while I am not an evil person at heart I think I get irritated way too quickly these days and I guess I'm just sort of wondering for other people who may get irritated like I do how do you keep it under wraps?\n\nMy irritation always stems from a place of what I feel is moral equity. When I feel like I'm getting nitpicked, or that people are being unfair to me in some way it cause me to go into this kind of whiny, \"you don't understand\" kind of mode.\n\nMy annoyance has driven more than one role player away from me and to some extent I do blame them. Like I acknowledge that I need to figure out how to get my own anger under wraps but at the same time I kind of feel like maybe they should have tried to hear me out.\n\nI say this because I have been irritated with some Partners before and instead of immediately ditching me they actually talked to me about it and showed me kindness and because of that I was able to get over myself a lot faster. I think to some extent when I am upset I need to feel validated for it. So therefore immediately going on the offense of with me and telling me that I'm being problematic, childish, whatever that's pretty much a sure fire way to end any possibility of Friendship with me at all. \n\nAnd I'm not at all saying that people should have to put up with my issues. I personally had an old role-playing friend who I eventually had to ditch because she had untreated borderline personality disorder and it was just a constant roller coaster where some days she seemed to love me and other days she was pretty much telling me to go kill myself. I have been on the receiving end of the anger of others so I don't expect everyone to just completely put up with my own BS.\n\nI don't deliberately go into roleplay looking to get annoyed by stupid crap. I really do want to get along with and be friends with everyone that I message. \n\nI'm just always looking at things from an angle of what I believe is fair. \n\nFor anyone who understands my position here when you find yourself getting irritated, or something like that what do you do? \n\nAlso I want to make it clear hear that so far this has not been a huge problem. Most of my partners have been very understanding with me when I have gotten irritated with them over something. It's like every 2 out of 10 people will start an argument with me or just ditch me.\n\nBut I would like to hopefully one day not get irritated with anyone.\n\n",

I'm looking for   someone to play a veteran monster hunter in this world, who somehow or   another on one of their hunts, finds themself responsible for an   adolescent girl. The RP would involve strong themes of found family and   monster hunting, with the option of exploring plotlines related to the   backstories of either or both characters if desired.

            "selftext": " INTRODUCTION  \nWelcome to my roleplay page! There will be a lot of information here and I appreciate everyone who is taking the time to read through and see if we are a good match! For the basic info, my name is Chris and I am 27 years old and from Texas (CST). One of the biggest things I enjoy is making friends with people I partner with. I am not a huge fan of only knowing someone\u2019s screen name or \u201croleplay name\u201d and only have a roleplay based interaction with them. For me, if I am going to be spending hours and hours making stories and planning things out with you I don\u2019t want to do it anonymously. If that\u2019s not for you I get it! No harm done and I won\u2019t be offended (I\u2019ll only be annoyed if someone asks for privacy because it shows they didn\u2019t read this). Now that the beginning part is over, let\u2019s get to the juicy bits.  \nRULES FOR THE ROAD  \nLENGTH  \nI enjoy writing at length for my stories. I currently have a few \u201cshorter\u201d ones going so I am only looking for long form, long term stories at the moment. I am looking for five to six paragraphs with minimum of 750+ words per post. Yes, that\u2019s a lot and it will reduce the frequency of posts per day but that is okay with me. If you want to go even longer that\u2019s great! I have gone up to 2000+ words before so I am very open to novella style as well. A key point about this is that I am not only seeking this for the introduction. I want this throughout the roleplay except for action oriented scenes or intensive dialogue.  \nROLES  \nI will play male x female or female x female. M/F is my preference but I am okay with the latter as well. For M/F I would play the male.  \nFANDOM  \nUnfortunately I don\u2019t have any I am interested in roleplaying. I enjoy a lot of different things outside of roleplay (Marvel, DC, LOTR, etc) but I don\u2019t want to roleplay in those worlds because I prefer to make my own.  \nPAIRINGS  \nThese are the pairings I would be open to playing. Some will have a specific gender I would like for each side to please pay attention to those! I also have a lot more that I can share in PM  \n\u2022 God/Goddess x Mortal  \n\u2022 President (female) x Senior Adviser  \n\u2022 Single Dad x Baby Sitter/Co Worker/Online Date  \n\u2022 Teacher/Professor (female) x student  \n\u2022 Friend x abused friend needing help  \nPLOTS  \nThese are open to modification. Think of them as more inspirational rather than set in stone story lines.  \n\u2022 A demon is stalking/influencing a human to commit harsh crimes in life. Eventually gets caught and needs help to escape from prison. Could also see this as two serial killers working together running from the law and one of them is a demon (which is why they are never caught)  \n\u2022 WWIII has arrived! China/Russia have attacked NA and have the EU in their sights! (The main thrust of this plot is to have non-American countries take the lead with the US being sidelined due to cyber attacks)  \n\u2022 Apocalyptic/Futurist landscape! Zombies? Nope. Nuclear War. Too much radiation. Super-virus? No! What I am thinking is there are mega cities which are \u201csafe\u201d but very strict governing rules for living there and then there is the Expanse which has settlements and towns throughout that has few rules and you fight to survive. People go in and out of the mega cities but you have to have resources to do so. Think Fallout world minus nuclear radiation, mutated species, etc. I would be open to fantasy creatures however.  \n\u2022 Inception based drama! Yeah, I said \u201cno fandoms\u201d but for me I view this as borrowing the technology and ideas rather than taking on any canon characters or organizations or anything like that.  \n\u2022 Dredd/Bright style humans x mythical creatures modern realism  \n\u2022 Who opened the Hell gates?! Demons/evil creatures invading the world, have to fight back. Try to appease a female Commander by offering a marriage to a human who isn\u2019t all that he seems to be at first.  \nMEANS OF CONTACT  \nDISCORD  \nEMAIL  \nPREFER TO ROLEPLAY IN EMAIL, PLOT IN DISCORD  \n ",

A rift has opened from another dimension, and monsters have come crawling into our world in great waves!\n\nWhen the first wave came, the kingdom's knights and adventurers were able to hold their own. But the Dragon Hourglass has already begun to indicate the arrival of the next wave.\n\nTake up your legendary weapon and take arms against the great threat. Win glory, gold, titles, land, and all of your hearts desires.\n\nFor Melromarc!\n\n-----\n\n4 Roleplayers, each with one of the 4 heros, each submitting a companion to the other heros to make 4 parties of 4. \n\nThat's the plan, at least! A friend and I have had this neat idea for a discord server for awhile. Some of the best roleplays I've had have been in a group of  3-5. It gives you plenty of control over the plot, world, and setting. \n\nThe setting will technically be in that of the Shield Hero world, as we are using it for it's convenient 4 heros setup, but for the most part it will be general fantasy, and give you all the space you need to write. As stated before, the plan is for each of us to eventually have exactly four characters including one hero and three companions. \n\nIf you're interested, or want to speak further, feel free to comment or PM! I hope we can all become good friends and have some great roleplay!",

            "selftext": " Hey y'all! First off, I'd prefer that my partner lives in North America. Due to previous experiences I am also asking you to reply to the roleplay in a timely manner, not once a day or once every two days. I like progression. Now that that's out of the way..\n\nI'm looking for a literate, **18+** roleplay partner that is caught up to the show! No need to be caught up to the manga since it's a timeskip, although if you're going to roleplay as a My Hero Academia character you **must** be caught up to the manga. If you're going for an OC, don't worry about it! **First or third person is welcomed**! My format is a slightly odd version of third person when it comes to My Hero Academia due to handling a ton of characters at once. Just to clarify, this is a **long term** roleplay. So get ready to be in it for the long haul!\n\nIn this roleplay we can do one of two options: Timeskip after graduation OR a timeskip where Izuku and the gang is 23-24 years old. **This is not an AU roleplay. Things should make sense from a canon perspective of MHA.** I just want to make that clear.\n\nI'll be roleplaying as Izuku! I can easily handle roleplaying as every character including Izuku, so don't worry about that.\n\nDue to the nature of a timeskip, there may be some minor spoilers from the manga. If you aren't caught up I'll try my best to keep the spoilers away!\n\nThere's something I cannot stress enough. **PLEASE, be 18+. 9 out of 10 people that have contacted me recently were 15 or younger. And it was obvious. I want maturity (not NSFW, but actual mature roleplay partners). Thank you.**\n\nPlease be prepared to write a paragraph or more coming into this roleplay. One liners are not acceptable unless it REALLY makes sense or adds suspense. Other than that, let's maintain quality.\n\nThat's it! Interested? Direct message me with your Discord tag (the name next to the # and the set of numbers) and I'll add you as soon as I can. :\\^)",

            "selftext": "Hello all! As the title of this thread suggests, I am looking for Roleplay partners who are interested in the fandom of The Orville!\n\nThis is the first sci-fi show that I\u2019ve really gotten into, with the exception of later seasons of Agents of SHIELD, and I really really love it. The characters are great, and the humor isn\u2019t forced or too shticky.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get on to the main part...the characters! I\u2019m looking to play as Commander Kelly Grayson, and I\u2019m looking for someone to play as her sarcastic ex-husband Captain Ed Mercer. I love this pairing because they\u2019re both so snarky and kind of ridiculous human beings, especially when they\u2019re together.\n\nI don\u2019t have any plots figured out just yet, but that\u2019s something we can talk about. Since it is set in the future and in space, there\u2019s plenty we can work with.\n\nSome info about me:\n* I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+.\n* I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply.\n* I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out.\n* I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does.\n* I would prefer literate partners.\n\nInterested? Excellent! Feel free to comment here or shoot me a message! I look forward to plotting with you! ",

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nThis is basically a shout-out post to anyone who is willing to RP. I use Discord primarily. I understand the fact that most people already have an established RP group or partners that they write with and the last thing I want to do is interfere. I understand if people just ignore this and don\u2019t reach out. I get it. Writing with someone new is always challenging at first as you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like. It\u2019s easier to write with those that you\u2019ve come to know really well and made friends with. And there\u2019s also the fact that I have anxiety and I\u2019m terrified of approaching people and annoying them.\n\nSo this is why I\u2019m making this post instead and anyone can reply or drop me a message if they\u2019re interested!\n\nBasically looking for anyone willing to RP Tony Stark with my Pepper. I have written for both Tony and Pepper before although I do prefer Pepper. I have a good few years RP experience and have used various sites though things have slowed to a halt for me to the point where I don\u2019t RP much these days except with one person. I use various apps as well and that can be discussed to choose whichever is preferable. I\u2019m honestly very laid back when it comes to RP and I\u2019m fine with most concepts as long as both of us are comfortable. And of course, having fun!\n\nThis can simply be a platonic relationship. We can discuss matters and decide if we want them to be romantically involved.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t mind writing some NSFW I do prefer actual storytelling and working on a plot. I\u2019m also from the UK, 21+ and I\u2019m fairly quick on replies. Though replies will be slower during the week while I\u2019m at work. I do prefer para/multi para to one liners.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid to contact me! I\u2019m the least threatening person ever. If you are interested just let me know and we can discuss further! All I\u2019m looking for is having fun, making sure whomever I write with is comfortable and also having fun, and making new friends along the way. \n\n**Please only message if you genuinely want to write. Recently on here people have just been wasting my time, waiting till I\u2019ve worked on a starter to get the story going to decide to block and remove me as a friend, after long discussions on how we\u2019ll go about starting things off. Oh, and having also mentioned how they hate being \u201cghosted\u201d yet doing the same thing to me without giving any reason. So please, all I ask is that you only message if you are going to be writing long term.**\n\nI hope to write with some of you soon. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nThis is basically a shout-out post to anyone who is willing to RP. I use Discord primarily. I understand the fact that most people already have an established RP group or partners that they write with and the last thing I want to do is interfere. I understand if people just ignore this and don\u2019t reach out. I get it. Writing with someone new is always challenging at first as you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like. It\u2019s easier to write with those that you\u2019ve come to know really well and made friends with. And there\u2019s also the fact that I have anxiety and I\u2019m terrified of approaching people and annoying them.\n\nSo this is why I\u2019m making this post instead and anyone can reply or drop me a message if they\u2019re interested!\n\nBasically looking for anyone willing to RP Tony Stark with my Pepper. I have written for both Tony and Pepper before although I do prefer Pepper. I have a good few years RP experience and have used various sites though things have slowed to a halt for me to the point where I don\u2019t RP much these days except with one person. I use various apps as well and that can be discussed to choose whichever is preferable. I\u2019m honestly very laid back when it comes to RP and I\u2019m fine with most concepts as long as both of us are comfortable. And of course, having fun!\n\nThis can simply be a platonic relationship. We can discuss matters and decide if we want them to be romantically involved.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t mind writing some NSFW I do prefer actual storytelling and working on a plot. I\u2019m also from the UK, 21+ and I\u2019m fairly quick on replies. Though replies will be slower during the week while I\u2019m at work. I do prefer para/multi para to one liners.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid to contact me! I\u2019m the least threatening person ever. If you are interested just let me know and we can discuss further! All I\u2019m looking for is having fun, making sure whomever I write with is comfortable and also having fun, and making new friends along the way. \n\n**Please only message if you genuinely want to write. Recently on here people have just been wasting my time, waiting till I\u2019ve worked on a starter to get the story going to decide to block and remove me as a friend, after long discussions on how we\u2019ll go about starting things off. Oh, and having also mentioned how they hate being \u201cghosted\u201d yet doing the same thing to me without giving any reason. So please, all I ask is that you only message if you are going to be writing long term.**\n\nI hope to write with some of you soon. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "Leira did not huddle in the corner of the slave pen like so many of the other women who had been thrown in there with her. The girl stood there, fingers gripping the bars as she watched people passing by... and, more importantly, watched as other women and girls were taken up onto the stage. It was, to say the least, demeaning. The man who was running the proceedings took plenty of liberties; Forcing them to open their mouths so that they could check the health of their teeth or pull up thin shifts to see whether they could count their ribs.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before it would be her turn.\n\nThe guards from the ship had been told to give her a wide berth, but there were a couple in particular who she could tell were still seething. One's nose would never again be quite so aquiline and straight. Another had the perfect indentations of her teeth still imprinted into the back of his hand. She had not gone easily onto that boat, but she'd gone quiet since being chained. Not meek or subservient. If they came to look at her, she'd give each and every one of them a level stare; like some large feline just waiting for the right opportunity to pounce, but she'd not cried in protest when they'd retaliated for her fighting or protested when they withheld her rations.\n\nOh, no.\n\nShe couldn't let them see her crack even a little. But she didn't cause any more trouble either. Not when she needed to conserve what strength she had. Let them think she'd grown complacent... resigned herself to that fate...\n\nIt wasn't long before she was being hauled out of that pen, yanked so hard that she stumbled and almost fell to her knees. But she was jerked up roughly again; pressure on her neck when the collar around her neck pulled taut. Chains attached to the collar and then down between her hands.\n\n\\*Wait for it...\n\nWait for it...\\*\n\nIt was as the head slaver started speaking that she seized her chance. One guard - who had made it a point to make her life a living hell on the way over - made the mistake of stepping just a pace forward to go retrieve something from someone in front of the stage. With him leaning forward, she took it. She leaped onto her back and got the chains at her wrists over his head so that she was soon pulling back hard - finding something gratifying in the way his breath came in gurgled gasps from his restricted windpipe.\n\nUltimately, they hauled her off, which she'd expected. She certainly wasn't at full strength, but it got her message across. Anyone who thought to claim her through money or any other means should know what they could expect of their purchase.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHello Folks!\n\nAs you can see from above, I'm looking for some detailed, plot driven roleplay. I'm open to where it goes from the prompt and look forward to seeing the ideas of you lovely individuals.\n\nI have tried to leave it open as to what sort of setting it is. Perhaps something vaguely historical? Romanesque? Something similar to Viking raiders?\n\nPerhaps something fantasy? Similar to the Dothraki from Game of Thrones, where spirited girls and women are sought out to be bred for strong sons?\n\nMaybe your character is gifted this girl instead of actively seeking her out? Who knows! The possibilities are endless.\n\nI would love for this to have some sort of twisted romance dynamic. I'm a total sucker for the whole \"love/attraction borne of hate\".   \n\n\n(Note: There is a possibility for this to be NSFW.. whether that be sexy-times or other dark, gritty elements. As such, any individuals replying need to be 18+. That being said, NSFW is not, by any means, the focus. Character driven plot stuff first. The rest is gravy.)\n\nAnyway... yeah.. I'm not really sure what else to say, except that I hope to see some of those bright little envelopes lighting up my screen!\n\nSo if you've managed to last this long through my in character and out of character ramblings, please lemme know your ideas!",

            "selftext": "Looking for a new partner over discord or email. PM for either details. I mainly prefer fantasy-esque stories, but if a good sounding plot presents itself, I may bite. No pre-configured plot needed, I'm more than happy to figure one out on the spot with you and wing it from there.\n\nAbout Me:  - 24 year old Male  \n- Prefers using male characters, but I can do female well enough. \n- While I do not mind adult content in roleplay, I do require there to be substantial plot. \n - No \"god-modding\" (I'm just covering bases) \n- M/M, F/F, M/F, and any other pairing combination is fine by me.  \n- I do like getting to know my partners on a casual basis, but if you prefer not to, just let me know. Otherwise, I'd like to try and be friends :)  \n\nAbout RP Itself:  \n- I have an obsession with elves. I can't help it.  \n- I like fantasy type stories, and that applies to a pre-steam era setting as well as modern or in between.  \n- Time/universe jumps are fine by me. (ie. adding some type of fantasy race into a setting based on our world, future/past individual time jumping) \n- I do 3rd person paragraph format. I can also back to back post at about 10-20 minute intervals depending.   \n\nThat's about it other than nitty gritty details, so feel free to send me a message if interested!",

This time I'm saying things bluntly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry in advance, I am full on Sass mode due to the fact I keep getting ghosted after I send a long starter to try and impress them... Yes, we all have lives but once a day replies are not intriguing enough for me. I also haven't slept in 24 hours now and it's 10 minutes to 6am. I am exhausted but I'm going to be hammering the coffee. Please ust read this message as if I was nice right now xD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost important rules I need from you. \n\n* **DO** ***NOT*** ghost me. Please say it to my face if you don't like it. \n* I need detailed people who respond often. I mean a couple times a day at least. Not once a day. I am free at odd times but normally in the evenings and sometimes afternoon.\n* I play female and I play with male's.\n* I do ***any*** genre but Romance is a must with me since I am deprived of love, heh. \n\nSome things about me.\n\n1. I sing.\n2. I draw and paint.\n3. I write books and poems.\n4. My time zone is Central Time, U.S.\n5. I have no life.\n\nI don't do fandoms, don't ask. I make my own story. Like how you're supposed to technically roleplay. I am looking for something long term. Let's make a plot, let's make characters, let's make something happen!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THINGS I LATELY AM WANTING TO RP (Ideas for you)**\n\n* Slice of life (I can get very dark if you are into that. But I am looking for something mellow)\n* Fantasy/Medieval\n* Things that are dramatic.\n\nI rarely do smut but I do have age limits. 16-22, that is really slimming everyone, I know. But exceptions can be made if you send me an idea or if you just..... Don't be creepy or try and be my best friend or boyfriend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It still needs a fair bit of work but I think I have a fairly solid base that involves mercia, wesex and two Kings or queens of daneland. I have most of the cittys roughed out and have been working on various things such as roles as of late. Something I'm hoping for this server is to make it run its self in many ways or at least role wise as I can't be on 100% of the time unless im on holiday or it's the weekend. If anyone is up to helping and roleplaying in this world then I would really appreciate it! \n\nhttps://discord.gg/nvsjbuz",

A gate that typically, opens up in random spots throughout the infinite white room and leads you to another, brown door which will open to the universe of your choosing at the planet, time and moment of  their choosing. By coincidence... of perhaps fate. Leading to a moment in history where the three would follow curiosity, boldly and speak to one another. The three spending not more than three hours with one another would decide to hold a bet and use the three of their abilities to start the game. A game where all comic universes are linked to a newly created universe and earth. Resulting in Thrae X. An earth 4x the size with a moon 4x it's original size as well. Everything else follows suit. On Thrae, cities from various comic verses of the main timelines were forcibly merged after being stolen. Places like new York was combined with DC's own Metropolis and placed on a mass of land of the new planet. Where new born heroes from various realms are born and can follow aid of canon characters existing currently within this new Earth. \n\nCome &amp; join us while we gather members and start a literate, long lasting experience! \n\nhttps://discord.gg/cxDRKF2",

That being said, if you have something more interesting in mind, feel free to tell me! Anyway, here\u2019s the basics of the plot I came up with: \n\nAfter the defeat of One for all and the retirement of All-might , criminals and villains have been flocking to the areas, hoping to take control of the power vacuum left by One for all\u2019s absence. There of course, was also an increase in hero\u2019s, and even vigilantes. Among them is a mysterious masked figure with black feathery wings coming from their back. Covered head to toe in dark metal armor, this mysterious vigilante has gotten a good amount of attention. Maybe you\u2019ll get to meet them?",

            "selftext": "Ionos was on his knees, looking up at the human man who had been beating him. Two of the man's companions were holding him down with his arms bent behind his back. Ionos had enough fight left in him to spit blood at the man before him, the only thing he could manage. He tried a mocking smile, but it came off as a sneer. It earned him another punch that set his ears to ringing.\n\nIonos was a half breed, a bastard born to a human mother and an elven father. He had never known his father, as he was the product of single night of passion between his parents. A night that had involved the exchange of coin. His mother had raised him as best as she could, but had died when he was not yet a teen. He'd coped as best as he could, which of course meant that he'd fallen in with some less than reputable folk, and how the time between then and now had led him to be in the situation that he was in.\n\nAnother punch rocked him, and brought him to the present. The man had pulled a dagger after getting Ionos's attention. \"Last chance! Where are the gems?\" Ionos knew why the man had thought he'd stolen whatever it was he was looking for... he'd worked for the man in the past. However, he was in possession of neither the gems, nor the knowledge of who had taken them. \"Don't hear so well? You'll hear even less without these pointy ears, ye bastard!\" The man grabbed Ionos's right ear, causing him to wince. On top of everything else, he was going to be mutilated before he was killed. He didn't bother wasting words on begging. Harsh years had left him hardened against such acts, or so he had thought.\n\nThe group was interrupted by the sound of hoof beats. Ionos looked up to see a woman astride a horse. Seeing a possible way out, he yelled, \"my lady! Brigands! Get aid if you cannot render it yourself!\" He then struggled hard, and managed to free his right arm, and swung it at the groin of the man in front of him. Perhaps he would live yet another day.\n\n((I'm looking for role play in a fantasy setting. Back in the day, The Forgotten Realms was my second home. That was at least a decade ago, though. It could be that, or some other nameless place. I'm good with either. My character is a half elf, obviously. Your character's race is up to you. If it goes into furry territory, however, I'll have to bail. Elven, human, another half elf, etc., are all fine, as is your character's class/profession. I'd also dig it if your character wasn't evil-aligned, but hey, you do you.\n\nI'm more than alright with adult themes, including smut (love it, as long as it's not the main purpose of the play), and violence. Due to that, I'll have to insist that you, the role player, is 18+. I don't really have many limits, other than I dislike giant body parts (that aren't actually on a giant), and I don't like it when people write my character for me.\n\nIf you're interested, hit me up for my Discord ID, or to discuss/play here.))",

And yet, someone must. There are those who must delve further into the unknown than any before them and those unlucky few must be careful for if they lose their way they will never make it back. In unknown places, hidden away from the world or maybe even just beneath the thin skin of society, it lurks. There are those who must find that which lurks.\n\nThat Which Lurks is a horror/mystery globe trotting adventure I've cooked up for a group of 4-6 characters. There is a light stat system but it's more about the roleplay than anything else. I myself won't be playing a character and will instead be working as a sort of Game Master to control the world around you in hopes to create the most fun experience possible. Hope to see you there!

I\u2019m a big fan of both Naruto and DBZ, and I\u2019m really wanting to do a crossover between the two! \n\nThe idea I was thinking about for this was that we each have a character from one universe (we can talk to figure out who gets what, and my character will be an OC, but yours can be either!) and somehow, one of them ends up in the other\u2019s universe, but what happened? Did someone make an odd wish on the Dragon Balls? Was someone using the time machine and it malfunctioned? It\u2019s all open for discussion!\n\nI\u2019d also ask that perhaps there is a romantic element for this one, but there doesn\u2019t have to be! I use third person, am not picky on the length, NSFW is fine with me, and I\u2019m willing to work with people to sort everything out before we get started!

            "selftext": "Hey there Redditors of the r/Roleplay subreddit! I'm looking for RP partners again!\n\nTo start I mainly roleplay on Discord, in fact that's the *only* platform I use for RP these days so if you can't use that, then sadly things won't work out. However if you are a Discord user too, then carry on! \n\nI'm mostly seeking fandom RP, specifically Female OC x Canon where I would be playing the original female character and you, my partner would play the male character. I am up for OC x OC however depending on the fandom listed below. I'm mostly looking for adventures, action, maybe some romance. I'm also good with NSFW as well if such things should occur in the story. \n\nAs far as rules go, I only have a few. Please be 18+, have a good grasp of proper language/grammer/spelling, and try to give me a good paragraph or two at the most. Post length can vary, but I'd at least like something good to start with. Also I will ask for a writing sample before we start RP. This is simply to see if our styles would be compatible, as due to RP partners ghosting or disappearing on me as of late, I've had to be picky about who I choose to write with. I hope you understand. \n\nThe specific fandoms along with the pairings I'm most interested in RP for include (but are not limited to): \n\n\\- Destiny/Destiny 2 (Cayde 6 x OC)\n\n\\- Bloodborne (OC x OC, FxM)\n\n\\- Final Fantasy XIV (OC x OC - FxM, Aymeric x OC, Estinien x OC)\n\n\\- Dragon Age (Solas x Lavellan, Cullen x Lavellan, Fenris x Fem!Hawke or OC, Zevran x OC)\n\n\\- Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Prince Sidon x OC)\n\n\\- Voltron: Legendary Defender (Prince Lotor x OC)\n\n\\- World of Warcraft (Illidan x OC)\n\nI am also open to roleplay set in original worlds with original characters as well. In that case, I mostly prefer fantasy style roleplay, and adore urban fantasy. I won't say no to steampunk, science fiction, or similar either. \n\nIf any of these interest you, feel free to send me a PM or direct message so we can exchange Discord handles and discuss further!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "I'm much better at showing than telling so I'll provide an idea of my writing below, you can take what you want from it. I'm fond of anything from tearful Civil War romances to wild encounters with intergalactic governments and otherworldly spieces. I won't gripe about word count but I do expect to get what I give so this isn't an invitation to respond with a paragraph or two.\n\nYour voice spurred me. It's was more human than I had anticipated; everything about you was. It startled me, sparked a curiosity deep in my mind, though I had little time to think on it before your words registered and I lifted my eyes to meet your face. A bath...yes! It had been so long. Even in my ceremonial garb, the priests hadn't been bothered to allow me to wash the filth of my penance from my skin. I was given a cup of water to \u2018make myself presentable\u2019 and so I had rinsed my face of the blood and sweat but nothing more. I would have given anything for a warm bath and soap; my soul if it was still mine to give. But you seemed to leave the topic as quickly as you'd picked it up and I wilted a bit inside as the beautiful image of frothy, lavender scented bubbles drifted past me. It was all very hellish, I thought.\n\nBut still, you didn't seem malicious in the quickness of your dismissal of it, just...distracted. I hoped. Your steps toward me were long, confident, but I felt a hesitance in them, as if you weren't quite sure how to address the situation or how close to stand to me. I began a step backwards but stopped mid-stride, afraid to offend and more afraid to anger. It wasn't that I expected abuse from you. Devil that you were, I had not yet been given a reason to expect anything I once had from hell and it all seemed so surreal that I almost couldn't expect anything terrible from you. No, it wasn't you that left me timid and cowering to the touch, that the priests and mother superiors had done. That job was completed long before you would ever get your hands on me.\n\nI had been told all the awful things you did to souls down here; shoving red-hot pokers into their middles and tearing them to pieces again and again for eternity. Worms that eat at your rotting flesh and demons that twisted your body into a million broken pieces...but here in this room that smelled of cinnamon, here, with a man that gently plucked the passport from my hand and leafed through the pages as if rereading a favorite book...I was bewildered. Unless that was what you did. It wasn't outside of the realm of possibilities as far as I knew you, nothing was. Did you tempt us with simple, lovely things, treat us as humans and then toss us into the firey pit to fuel your hate?\n\nYour voice caught me again. It was deep and thick. I couldn't question the genuineness that it carried. A nun...so it seemed you didn't know quite everything. I nodded faintly, brushing a stray lock of hair out of my face and smoothing the thin linen that somehow looked cheaper next to you. It was reassuring to hear you didn't see many of us down here. At least our suffering accounted for something in the grand scheme of things. At least we were rewarded eventually. I wondered how many priests you met at the gates though. I hoped it was every one and I hoped you did everything and more to them what they had done to us. The mention of my payment soured in my mouth and I was glad for your glossing it over. I would never feel right about what I had done but I would never regret my escape.\n\nLucifer. The name was accompanied with what may have been a flash of light but I remained unsure as you continued to speak and I rolled the name over my tongue quietly. Lucifer. Such a beautiful name...Your flesh met mine as the book slid back into my hand, a current closing between us and drawing my gaze finally to yours. It pained me to meet your eyes; bright and wild and glorious and strong, but I couldn't pull away from them. I smiled at your question, the absurdity of it pulling at the corners of my mouth. My voice was weak and thin after hiding it for so many years, but the name was clear as it left my lips and filled the space between us.\n\n\u201cGabriella. No story. Just Gabriella.\"",

Until the invasion. They struck quickly and fiercely, the demons did. They pushed from the outer edges of your kingdom, pushing in ward while destroying villages and crop fields. Report after report came to you, all describing powerful magic that seemed older than anything the wizards had. People were scared, nothing was able to stop or even slow this new menace as it pushed forward. It was only a month before the demons were at your wall, but you were ready. You had gathered the greatest warriors and all your guards to defend your kingdom in a final stand. \nIt was actually working, they weren't able to get close or do anything to the wall that held fast like a mountain. Until she was brought out. She was a demon, but she also looked human, bruised and beaten with a chain around her neck. She seemed broken, following the larger demon that practically dragged her along. Her eyes were full of fear and pain, wanting to be let free. As you looked out over the battlefield, you noticed that she was looking at you, tears sparkling in her eyes as she mouthed *I'm sorry.* That's when you felt it and heard it, a scream so powerful that you were knocked to your knees. When you got back up, a giant hole was in your wall and demons were pouring in. You had only moments to run before the demons reached your castle and came to kill you. \n\nHello, I hope I interested you and hope I can keep your interest~\nNote; Those okay with diapers and its subsequent kinks that are related to it will get my top priority but I will play with everyone who's able to keep my attention with their first message. \nAlso, this seems to be a terrible habit for most people who message me; They send single sentence response like \"hey I'm interested\" or \"What are your kinks and limits.\" I'd be happy to play with you and tell you my kinks/limits but let's talk a little first before that. You don't have sex before the first date (most of the time)\n\nI hope you're still interested and will message me on Reddit to get my Kik~\nAll characters are 18+ and will act as such. ",

Every time I would go over with our son/daughter I could feel the tension and I would tell you but you didn\u2019t believe me causing us to always fight. We end up breaking up you keep seeing your kid at first but then stop as you start to believe your mom when she\u2019s says it\u2019s not your kid.\n\nI had ended up moving away a couple hours away because of my moms job. A couple years later I had started college not knowing you went to the same one and saw you at a frat party.\n\nWe can start there when we see each other for the first time after three years . Maybe you have a girlfriend or are a player?this story can go different ways but I do want our characters to end up together .\n\nI am open to changes but nothing too big where it changes everything completely.\nCHARACTER DESCRIPTION \nAnna . I have long curly brown  hair that is usually always worn down. I have hazel eyes and have naturally tanned skin tone.I am 5\u20190 and have a petite with a bit of curvy body. Despite being short I have long legs and a short torso\n\n\nA bit long but if you\u2019ve read this far and if interested in roleplaying message me here Send your character description  and a little about your character and If you just send hi or hello I most.

            "selftext": "Please read the whole post!\n\nHello everyone! I\u2019m looking for a male partner to rp with. I would like to have a long term rp that is  plot driven with smut mixed in. If you are just going to bounce after we set up the rp then please go elsewhere. I understand people have lives but it\u2019s frustrating to set things up and play a bit into the rp and never hear from you again. I\u2019m not very picky I just ask that you try to at least match what I type if possible(obviously there will be times when it\u2019s better to do a short reply than a long one) and I ask that you don\u2019t use text type( I.e. \u201cr\u201d for \u201care\u201d or emojis.)\n\nI have a few ideas in mind but if none are to your liking then feel free to offer your ideas. Mashing ideas together is fine too!\n\nMy ideas in a nutshell are\n\n1.get sucked into a mmo( either you or I or both.)\n\n2. League of legends(can have OC)\n\n3. Essentially space suicide squad but with OC\u2019s\n\n4. Dynasty warriors\n\n5. SnM\n\n6. Snm assassin\n\n7. Barbarian tribe takes my village(furry or elvan) as snm\n\n8. TF2( sorry not a big fan of overwatch.)\n\nI will give a more detailed version upon request.\nI\u2019m sure there are more that I just can\u2019t think of right now but this is what has come to mind. If these don\u2019t interest you we can come up with something completely new if you\u2019d like!\nI find humans to be rather dull and dislike playing as them. You are welcome to play as one I don\u2019t mind that, I just don\u2019t like playing one myself. I do expect for these to eventually be NSFW so keep that in mind. I\u2019d prefer you be older than me (I\u2019m 21) but you at least have to be over the age of 18.\n",

            "selftext": "I will be up front and let you know that I am pretty undecided on what exactly I am looking for, other than - I miss writing every day!  So, please bear with me through what I am sure will be a bit of a lengthy ad.\n\nTo start off with, a little about me:  I am an early 40s mom, living in the south.  I am married and not looking for a lover or online affair, but I do enjoy smutty writing sometimes, too, so I hope that you are able to separate those two concepts.  I love writing about romance and adult situations, so being willing to write those into our stories is appreciated, but I will not deny a partner, if they are not into that.  \n\nI also greatly enjoy horror and post-apocalyptic fiction, as well as normal slice of life things.  Stories where there is conflict or difficulties to overcome, be it mild through a language/regional barrier perhaps, or big like a kidnapping or POW or something, is also quite fun.  Zombies, space travel, ancient times, witches, exploration, crime - any kind of adventures is fine by me.\n\nI play World of Warcraft (For The Horde!) daily, so that is an option for our writing as well.  I am open to writing other genders than my own, but I do prefer writing from the feminine side of things, as that is where my comfortable place is.  I am not a fan of anime, so that is not an interest I can explore well with you, should you want something in one of those worlds.\n\nMy normal available times depend heavily on when I am working.  Currently, I work (from home) in an IT environment, 7am-6pm CST, and am free to write during those hours, when I am not too busy.  I am usually able to provide multiple replies in a day, but there have been (and will be again) times where life and/or work simply has me too busy, and I am not able to reply.  If I am your sole source for entertainment, it might be best to pass me by, as I don't want to disappoint.  Evenings and Sundays are family time, so I am rarely online.\n\nWhat I want from you: Be over 30.  This is kind of a big deal to me, as I can't honestly say I've had great experiences writing with people in the 18-25 age bracket.  I know that not everyone is the same, but it's just what I prefer.  We are simply in two different worlds, and it shows in the writing.  \n\nI am open to male or female writers, not worried about that.  I don't need perfection, but I don't want text speak or one liners on the regular.  I would love for us to be friends, but I don't want it to become a weird thing where you're jealous or creepy, or the cause of relationship drama from your significant other.\n\nThank you, in advance.  My PMs are open and I look forward to speaking with you, future friend!",

I have the itch, some ideas and some free time, now all I lack is you. \n\nFirst off I\u2019m looking for someone mature, and someone at the very least over 18. I would like the freedom of being able to explore more adult issues if the role play takes us there. Second, I\u2019d like someone with some flair, talent, and style...I\u2019m not a stickler about post length, I tend to find no issue finding a comfortable post length with a partner I have chemistry with. Third, be available to chat and brainstorm via Discord or Skype or Google hangouts...whatever. I just find it important to be able to communicate with my partner about what they want out of the role play as well as potential directions to take it. Fourth, it\u2019s cool if you can\u2019t post all the time. During the week I am probably only good for one, maybe two posts a day. On the weekends I\u2019m much more available, but just communicate with me and we will work it out.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s have fun. Role playing to me is a distraction and a hobby, and also a way to establish friendships with new and interesting folks. So shoot me a message, tell me a bit about you, what kind of stories you\u2019re craving, and let\u2019s find some common ground and do som me writing. Can\u2019t wait to hear from you. ",

So expect something with those plot/smut ratio when askimg me for a RP.\n\nI usually play using 3rd person and past tenses, so it's a great bonus if you are the same. When it comes to post length I really don't like one liners. Around a paragraph is ok, sometimes I like to do more but one is what I do most. Details are always appreciated.\n\nI do not require great grammar skills since English is not my mother tongue.\n\nWhen it comes to story ... I'm pretty open to anything really, I just have a few plots in mind but I would like to merge them with some ideas coming from you. That will help us creating a story we both enjoy a lot. Preferred themes are:\n\n* Schoolmates\n* Vampire/hunter/human\n* Assassin/victim\n* Brothers\n* Teammates\n\nFandom like Star Wars, MCU and some more are good too.\n\nThose are just general ideas, we both will discuss and agree on details in chat.\n\n\\---\n\nFor the smut part ... Let's talk in private of that. I just tell that I'm pretty open to anything.\n\n\\---\n\nSo if you arrived here you might be really interested, good \ud83d\ude09 I'm available on Kik, Discord and Telegram and I'm counting too see you there. I do apologize in advance if I'll reply later, life sometimes hates roleplays. Just drop me a message with your preferred platform and I'll give you my usernames.\n\nSee you soon, Alex",

            "selftext": " The sky above was dusted with swollen rain clouds. Valerie raised her head to the sky and opened her mouth, eyes squeezed shut and lips twitching into a grin. Her cloak was soaked through and her hair was plastered like streaks of black ink to her cheeks. \n\nThe rain that pooled in her mouth was as icy cold as the rest of the island. Satus had few claims to fame and even fewer that were pleasant; they exported good fish, it was true. They were also populated by the renoundly inhospitable fishermen of said fish, were cursed with long months of cold rain and majorly consisted of uninhabitable bogs.\n\n*Perhaps not best to mention any of those to the ambassador,* she noted to herself, swallowing her mouthful of water. Droplets clung to her eyelashes and hung in front of her vision. It gave the bay a soft, glowing atmosphere; Satus\u2019 capital city (perhaps too generous a term), Shadcliffe, was gathered around the mouth of a river. The river split it into two.\n\nOn the East was, well, East Shadcliffe. The slope of the valley was littered with lines of roping, tangled homes. At the top sat the more noble and important houses, few as they were, and above that sat the Lord\u2019s manor. West Shadcliffe was primarily shops and markets with a few homes littered between. North lied the sea and South were the moors, a patchworked landscape of farmland. Further South than that was the king's castle, further still the forests, even further than that were bogs and ruins and barely mapped dangers.\n\nShe skimmed her eyes across each of the glowing windows, dim candles seeming bright in the darkening evening. She hoped the ambassador would arrive soon. If not for the sake of her gradually developing nerves, then so their boat wouldn\u2019t be caught in the incoming storm. The rain was picking up and the wind was beginning the sting at her face.\n\nValerie\u2019s prayers were, eventually, answered. She heard the Mossy Sparrow\u2019s captain call to her from the gloom. \u201cHo there! Is that you, Val?\u201d\n\nAfter he was tied up to the dock, she took a few careful steps on board the vessel. A hooded figure, equally as waterlogged as her (she was relieved at that), stood there. The ambassador. She put on her best smile and stuck out a pale hand.\n\n\u201cGreetings, friend!\u201d\n\n\\*\\*DONE\\*\\*\n\nHi there! Sorry that my intro is boring there! There's a decent reason.\n\nI want to build the world with you. My character, Valerie, calls Satus her home. She's acting as ambassador for the city of Shadcliffe and for Satus as a whole. Your character will be acting as ambassador for your country, which can be whatever the hell you please! They can be the ambassador for the actual country trying to secure a trade deal, or they could be the ambassador for a university trying to secure permission to explore the ruins, etc etc.\n\nValerie will tell you about Satus; you will tell Valerie about your country. Diplomatic things may happen. There will, of course, be adventure in Satus too. Eventually they'll head off to your country. It's all pretty flexible really. You can add anything you want, like magic or creatures, etc etc. All I ask is:\n\n* You're okay with writing with someone who's under 18. I am 16.\n* You're okay with relatively infrequent replies when IC, like once or twice a day with occasional gaps (I will inform you before these happen!)\n* You're decently literate. You use proper grammar and spelling (I do understand mistakes happen though!), no text speak, no asterisk actions. Ideally a paragraph or more per reply. \n* You don't mind creating a Google Docs thingie with information about your country; I'll do exactly the same. We can add as we think things up and read about each other's new lore.\n\nSo, shoot a message my way! If you have any questions or ideas, I'm happy to hear them. If you just want to jump into it, that's good too! (Just eventually send me a link to that Google Doc.)",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am writing a book based off of my OC universe's second \"chapter\" and will eventually publish the finished result somewhere where there will be avid readers who will want to read something original and fun, which is what I hope we all can have! \n\n This book will be about a year-long war with corrupted and highly mangled succubi, who invade Earth and try taking it over, and eat, kill, or drain all they come across. I will be looking for female and male roles, so don\u2019t be shy! I\u2019ll be sending character sheets to others who qualify, details below. I shall be working on both this book and another, so don\u2019t be suprised if I accidentally mention something new to you, go ahead and ask, I love sharing about all this! I\u2019d prefer you ask what characters are available and how they act in general, this will also be non-profit, meant only for the great fun to be had with creating a world and developing it. Do note that there will be a limited number of roles for this book, 25 slots, not including the Tamer, one for each relevant character. Please, pm me any and all questions you have, a preferred alias or online name, a reference picture for your chosen character as you see them, along with a \u201ctheme\u201d song, something you feel sounds like their personality/represents them upon looking at the summary of their personality. Also be sure to give a name to the character if you are playing a human or succubi role. Please do make it an anime reference picture, since not everyone is comfortable with IRL pictures, unless all relevant parties are comfortable with it, and don't mind a face reveal, and have the theme song be a clean one please. After this I will ask for an email address so I can give it to the relevant parties for section one, I'll also make an announcement google doc for any relevant news and the like, if you are a programmer, it would help greatly if you would volunteer to make a website that can be modified and with character sheet sections, along with the running story.\n\n  Collan Variant slots open: \t \n\n1.\tD.B.C. (Has a crush on Angelic but is highly lazy about it and everything, Sub, too lazy to Dom) 2.\tZeta (Teases everyone but keeps loyal to Creepy, Dom, results in wild nights) \n\n3.\tCreepypasta (Hates everyone but secretly likes them, in love/hate relationship with Zeta, Dom, rezilts in wild nights) 4.\tAngelic (Is very justice centered and treats D.B.C. like a child of her own, he doesn\u2019t mind, Switch) \n\n5.\tSwap (No crush, focuses on her work and protecting others, Sub if relationship opens up) \n\n6.\tNaturialist (No care for love, only fights for freedom, Doesn\u2019t care for sex) \n\n7.\tTest (No crush, treats Swap and Naturialist as peers, Dom if relationship opens up) \n\n8.\tAxehead (Free-spirited, no relationship desires) \n\n9.\tCollincubus (Had a crush long ago, but she died when the legion arose, fights to avenge her, Switch if relationship opens up) (Should try avoiding succubi unless with a Collan) \n\n10.\tHuman 1 (Male) (Businessman, Dom, Leader) \n\n11.\tHuman 2 (Male) (Coding genius, Sub, Nerd) \n\n12.\tHuman 3 (Male) (Athlete, Switch, Professional Football Player) \n\n13.\tHuman 4 (Female) (Cake Decorator, Dom, Bakery Owner) \n\n14.\tHuman 5 (Female) (Patreon Commissioner, Sub, Musician) \n\n15.\tHuman 6 (Female) (Patreon Commissioner, Switch, Artist) (Succubi should mainly interact with humans, but only fight the Collan\u2019s if in group) \n\n16.\tSuccubus 1 (Female) (Dom)  \n\n17.\tSuccubus 2 (Female) (Sub) \n\n18.\tSuccubus 3 (Female) (Dom) \n\n19.\tSuccubus 4 (Female) (Sub) \n\n20.\tSuccubus 5 (Female) (Dom) \n\n21.\tSuccubus 6 (Female) (Sub) (Follow the Tamer around trying to protect him) \n\n22.\tAnne succubus maid (Won\u2019t be treated sexually, but will be motherly towards all, mostly sticks to Tamer\u2019s side for comfort, big softy, occasionally fights with Jasmine for her being lewd) \n\n23.\tMimi (Loli, shouldn\u2019t be treated sexually, pulls tons of pranks, keeps to the shadows and silently observes, waiting for the right moment, highly comedic) \n\n24.\tJasmine (Treats Tamer like Senpai, dresses like Japanese school girl, he resists, has a crush on him and doesn\u2019t hide it, fights with Anne feeling like she\u2019s trying to steal the Tamer) (Alone and only interacts with succubi roles via telepathy)\n\n 25.\tQueen Ferile Star (Mad Queen of the succubi and ruler of the new succubi horde, fights dirtily and without honor)  \n\nIf you want to do a relationship thing, or you want to do a smut scene between two characters who aren't in a set relationship, make sure you have your partner\u2019s consent along with the third party's consent. There will be smut in the book, and no deaths, but if you want a smut scene you must request, you will then make in private and share it with Collan for submission, should there be something unwanted it will be rejected. \n\nThere will be one section for each group, becoming a full chapter, meeting up and together one at a time. You will be given a barebones for story for your pair/trio, and each one should be anywhere between 3-7 pages, just to ensure a good length. Once you\u2019ve completed it you will submit it to me and wait for the other groups to finish their chapters before continuing to the next chapter.\n\nPlease, no smut for chapter one. I would prefer you all write in some reliable writing site or app, since you will need to be able to copy and paste the material into an email to send to me, and to also be able to write with your partners in an efficient manner, the section you all submit will be run through Word for grammar and corrections, as well as an edit or two. I\u2019ll be sure to send it back along with some feedback for how to write more like the characters, until you\u2019ve found a good formula for it that we can all agree on as to how they should act that fits to their description, but I don't mind ideas for a new way for them to act.\n\nI would like to have the first chapter done by late December at the earliest. I know that there are things such as family and work in the way, so if you\u2019ll need more time email your partners and me so we can all know if you\u2019re gonna be going somewhere or if there\u2019s gonna be a delay so we know how much longer that there is left until we can move on to the next chapter.\n\nThere may be a Discord group made to make communication easier, and for OOC chatting as you all write, just in case you need help with writing at all, and if you made it this far, pm me and we\u2019ll talk about which character you\u2019d like, and an email address if you can stay dedicated and want to contribute.",

I\u2019m pretty flexible on genres but would love to do something Victorian-era, modern, or futuristic in nature. I\u2019d also be particularly keen on something gritty with vampires (guilty pleasure, I can\u2019t help it!) I leverage mostly female OCs. Open to romantic elements and happy to discuss.\n\nAs for me, I\u2019ve been roleplaying on and off for 10+ years now. I tend to match the length of replies that my partners send. Also in PST if it matters. I like to be detailed and help bring a plot to life. It\u2019s not fun for me to do that alone, however, so that\u2019s where you come in!\n\nThe ideal partner for me is interested in working together to create a fun, engaging story that we both enjoy exploring. For the sake of content, I\u2019d prefer my partner to be 21+.\n\nI\u2019d love for this to be ongoing on Discord, longer term if possible. If you\u2019d like to chat further about genres/plots of interest, please drop me a PM here on Reddit and we can discuss further.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "\\[ ***THE LAST OF US: SEATTLE, 2032*** \\]\n\n&gt;*Seattle was once just as praised as any other greatly distinguished American city.* With a population of nearly eight hundred thousand people, open-air markets lining the crowded seaports, and artisan boutiques and determined vendors defining the very aura of the Pacific Northwestern lifestyle, the vivacious city of Seattle, Washington, was, in itself, a blistering megalopolis marked by economic nirvana and its geographical situation along the Western Coast of the United States. It had reached its pinnacle; inhabitants were happy. And, for years, they followed suit with the rest of the world, ignoring the small, strange epidemics occurring throughout rural South American municipalities. But this era was cut short. Soon, these very outbreaks were within distance of their own front doors, and stuff really hit the fan. fast. very fast.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The infection spread like a wildfire, claiming entire countries, states, and cities before ultimately arriving in Seattle. The Cordeceps Brain Infection took with its malevolence everything in its path: lives, tele-communications, the need for there to be no guns. Traffic backed up highways, and the owners of happy-go-lucky pets left their homes with the intent of coming back for their animals. But they never did. And the sundry foods in their refrigerators rotted, too. In an ordinary instant, Seattle was gone. But with persistence, the Federal Disaster Response Agency moved in, rendering the city of Seattle into a safe zone. For the survivors \u2014 a fraction of what was left of Seattle\u2019s once fruitful populous \u2014 the arrival of these forces marked the beginning of a flawed solace in a world turned bad.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When there weren't any unexpected breaches in the defense apparatus, there were food shortages and relentless riots. And with all of this, waves of violence came and went in the Zones, establishing a trend that soon rendered itself into the norm of reality; public executions were an everyday sight. And citizens of Seattle felt dissolved amongst the world in knowing that the military never flinched when pulling the trigger. One group rose inside the quarantine zone, known as the Ascendency, led by student-turned-activist Anthony Hawks. Hawks, with a background in public speaking and recognizing Human Rights abuses when he saw them, gained the support of hundreds within the confines of Seattle, appealing to a variety of demographics who all shared in common their enmity toward the abusive FEDRA control. The Ascendency relocated to the Underground, a secluded subterranean metro-system by which illegal trade and extortion flourished in the post-apocalyptic landscape.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rallying up unity amongst various militant groups within the city, Hawks outlined a strategic attack against FEDRA. However, just a day before the devised attack on the Zones, FEDRA forces cracked down on the Ascendency and the system of militia groups within Seattle, an event in which became known as \u201cFlee Day,\" on which 4,000 people involved in any opposition to FEDRA were killed, imprisoned, or executed. The loved ones of those involved with the Ascendency were rounded up and shot, FEDRA justifying their actions under \"Epidemic Preventative Measures.\" Forced to withdrawal from the Zones, the Ascendency fled into the outer extremities of the city with an even greater hatred in their resolve for justice. They established the \"Hub\" in Seattle's Industrial District, which subsequently became a trading centre for local survivors and merchants. In the midst of almost nothing, the Ascendency rose from the ashes. But the city belongs to them, and they are willing to do anything to ordain that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[ **ABOUT ME** \\]\n\nHey guys! I'm RJ. I am from California, United States. I have enjoyed writing for as long as I can remember, and my first experience with group rp in 2014 signified a long-lasting love for this sort of thing. I love the variety of group rps; the open-world environments are profound! With this said, I am so happy to announce my new Last of Us inspired (and pretty much based off of) rp! Leading a roleplay group is a feat in which I'm 100% familiar with. And with this experience, I expect to have such a fun time with you all. Please apply. But first, see more info down below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[ **ABOUT THE GROUP** \\]\n\nThis is a relatively new group that will be taking place on Discord. I'm looking for at least five bright, literate roleplayers to begin with (as I consider this a beautiful start and complement toward the plot's commencement). I don't have many rules: just be a cool person who is good at and experienced in roleplaying, especially along the vein of the apocalyptic genre. Oh, and you must &lt;3 the Last of Us, but not as much as I do, cuz then you'd be crazy. If you are still reading this and looking to take your interest to the next level, shoot me over a PM! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* Hope to hear from you very soon!",

            "selftext": "\nHello there, and welcome to my post. I'm glad that the title alone was able to catch your attention. Well, as you could see from the title, I am looking for something detailed, long term, and written in the third person point of view. It's happened more often then I would like where someone has still tried roleplaying in first person, but please understand, I will correct you. If you still continue, we can not continue. I have requested third person from the beginning, I won't be changing my mind on the matter. Please know what you are getting yourself into. Haha. This includes being detailed! Some people still think I mean just a handful of sentences, but I don't. I mean a few paragraphs worth. Or, if you prefer, one giant paragraph/wall of text. I can do either you prefer, but it has to be detailed. No exceptions unless it's just dialogue. Even then, I'm not going to accept three sentences or the like. There is always more you can write about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, now that we have that out of the way, I really want something that involves romance. I don't have any ideas in mind, but we can always come up with something together. At the moment, I'm really looking for a gay roleplay, but if you come with an idea I like, I would be willing to do a straight one. I'm just running out of inspiration for it because most people want to do straight roleplays when I say that I do both. Anyway, I just about always stick to a realistic setting, normally modern but I can also do medieval. I don't like anything historic based, sci-fi, steam punk, apocalyptic... None of it. If you really want something with fantasy, please don't make it excessive, or I can tell you now, it's not going to be something I'm interested in. I like doing things I can at least relate do. Can't exactly do that with giants, mermaids, and wizards. I personally don't know any, not sure about you. Haha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure that's all I have to say on the matter. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to message me! If you're interested in roleplaying, then I beg you to message me with your Discord tag so I can send you a friend request there, and we can get started right away! Don't worry about writing everything out on Reddit, I would much rather we discuss everything through Discord when I can actually respond to you at a reasonable pace. I hate trying to have a conversation through reddit, because I don't get notifications from it unless I constantly refresh the page, and that's just tedious. So, I beg of you, LEAVE YOUR DISCORD TAG IN YOUR MESSAGE. If you don't, you will not be the first person I respond to. I will prioritize those who actually leave their Discord Tag. I can't promise I'll be able to respond right off the bat to anyone, but you should expect a friend request coming your way within a few hours. I literally have nothing better to do. Haha Have a good day, even if we aren't a good match!",
