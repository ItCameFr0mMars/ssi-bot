My name is Viktor and I am looking for a literate long term roleplay partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI absolutely adore fantasy, and most of my roleplays will be fantasy based. But i am willing to work with you! When doing a romance based roleplay I will mostly want to do MxM but, I will be willing to do others if it fits the situation...And, I would want it to be built up within the roleplay.\n\nDrama, blood, guts, and other things like that are my specialty!  Do if you love building up characters and then ripping their little hearts out piece by piece then you will love to roleplay with me!\n\nI am willing to do smut, as long as it is part of the plot... I don't want to just dive directly into that- it kinda ruins the mood of it all for me. \n\nI will be needing a partner who is willing to write more than one paragraph per response.. I don't want to write a super long post, and only get a three word response. I understand in some places like in the middle of a conversation if you cannot have a huge post, but for the most part I'd like for it to be longer.. \n\nI usually prefer to use OCs but, I am willing to do fandoms! \n\nI prefer to roleplay on discord, but if I have to I can use Skype as well. \n\nPlease feel free to message me or comment down below if you have a question about anything or if you want to roleplay! I am pretty much active 24/7 and, can almost always reply! I will also be willing to show examples of my (third person) writing style from past roleplays if you would like to see them, therefore you can know if my style will fit yours!\n\nI look forward to talking with you!!

            "selftext": "Hello, fellow writers!  \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my roleplay post.  Let me start off by introducing myself \u2014 I\u2019m a man in his late-20s who (like many of you) is seeking to find a roleplay partner.  I've been somewhat busy due to a combination of work and grad school, but as of late, it has been truly refreshing to connect with so many other like-minded people in this community of writers.  Given that I\u2019m expecting to have a bit more time on my hands in the upcoming weeks, I figured I\u2019d reach out again, and hopefully find a few more mature, talented writers.\n\n**Preferred Genres:**\n\nMy writing tends to span a wide variety of genres\u2014including science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic modern fiction.  My writing has spanned both a personal as well professional nature, and as a result, I\u2019m always up for experimenting with new genres and writing styles.  Recently, I\u2019ve been dabbling a bit more in fantasy themes; however, I\u2019m still a novice when it comes to taking on high-fantasy themes.\n\n**Writing Style:**\n\nI will humbly admit that I tend to be a voracious writer, and as a result, my posts frequently range in the 3-4+ paragraph range.  Granted, there are certain occasions when a shorter length is more desirable (especially in conversational, or dialogue-intensive scenes)\u2014and this is certainly something I implement when necessary.  I\u2019m a strong believer in quality over quantity, and I\u2019m hoping to find a fellow writer who has an appreciation for packing a large quantity of details in a condensed post (within reason).\n\n**Collaboration:**\n\nFor me, the pre-writing, collaborative stage is as enjoyable as the writing process itself.  I know that some writers prefer to jump head-first into writing the story itself\u2014with minimal discussion.  Based on experience, this approach is due to the fact that some writers fear that too much discussion may \u201creveal\u201d too much of the plot prior to writing.  While this is certainly a valid point, it is important for me to mention that my discussions do not pertain to plot;  rather, they pertain to exploring the characters\u2019 backstories, emotional orientations, cultural groundings, and other such factors.  It\u2019s more with regard to developing a creative discourse with my writing partner to truly immerse\u2014and \u201clive\u201d\u2014the experiences of our characters.  To me, it is this level of exploration and collaboration that truly make roleplaying a much more engaging process as compared to solo writing.\n\n**Writing Platforms:**\n\nI prefer to write my stories via email; however, I strongly prefer to collaborate with my co-writers via a text IM platform such as Skype, Google Hangouts, or Discord.  This is largely because an IM platform allows for a truly conversational, back-and-forth discourse about the story (rather than a static series of isolated messages via email).  I also find that my best stories tend to emerge with individuals with whom I am able to cultivate a strong intellectual chemistry with\u2014and as a result, this has led to several long-term stories.  I would be absolutely thrilled to find other writers in this subreddit who are also looking for long-term stories.  \n\n**Hard Requirements in a Writing Partner:**\n\n* **Be over 18 \\[ideally over 21\\].** This is not to suggest that my stories always involve adult themes.  In fact, many of my stories do not involve NSFW themes at all.  However, I feel exponentially more comfortable discussing literary ideas with fellow adults.  As a result, I set this as a strict limit, and I have a zero tolerance policy for those who lie about their age.  As a result, I will be firm for only this particular issue\u2014 *do not contact me unless you are 18 years of age.*\n* **Interested in conversation and collaboration.**  As I mentioned above, I\u2019m seeking a writer who is truly interested in forming a long-term collaborative writing partnership.  This means not only focusing on issues pertaining to our story at hand, but also to broader issues concerning our writing as a whole.  Ideally, it would be nice to connect with other working professionals who are looking to use writing as a creative outlet, of sorts.\n* **Mutual respect.**  As I\u2019m sure is the case with many of you, I simply cannot be in front of the computer 24/7 due to real life responsibilities and obligations.  Because of this, I hope to find a writer who is committed, yet flexible\u2014someone who is willing to maintain open communication while at the same time, respecting one another\u2019s autonomy.\n\nIf this post has captured your interest or imagination, then by all means, I would love to hear from you!  In your post, please tell me a bit about yourself, and your background in writing.  Hopefully we can get a conversation going, and weave our way into writing a story together.\n\nThanks for your time; I hope to hear from you!",

BNHA: WC is a roleplaying server featuring original characters made by you and your fellow roleplayers! The server's plot and setting are completely separate from the canon BNHA universe, so please keep that in mind when considering to join! A plot description will be given below! This server is brand new and is looking for members to participate in the unique narrative that will be carried out. Students, staff, villains, and pro-heroes are all welcome to be created!\n\n\n**Boku No Hero Academia: Wild Cards is a literate roleplaying server. This means that all posts must be written in a third person narrative POV and must have a minimum of at least three sentences. Descriptiveness is key and always appreciated. Failure to comply with any of the server's rules will get you removed, as we wish to ensure the best possible roleplaying experience for everyone involved.**\n\n\n*One day long ago in Quig Quig, China, a luminescent baby was born with a unique power. Then, as time passed, the similar phenomena happened all over the world, and soon the majority of the population had obtained superhuman powers\u2014known as \u201cQuirks\u201d. Due to that, people were able to pursue heroism as a profession. However, with the changing pace of the world, it was no surprise when tensions began to rise. People with quirks became the norm and the quirkless were left to watch them rise to the occasion whenever trouble was afoot. While most quirkless individuals tended not to mind the heroes and even appreciated their valiance, a growing number of quirkless people felt that they had been completely forgotten by society.*\n\n*These quirkless individuals decided to take matters into their own hands, a select few even going so far as to bring about the production of \u201cartificial\u201d quirks. Artificial quirks are quirks that are given to a quirkless individual through a procedure specific to its type. Slight mutation quirks were distributed through surgical procedures, emitter quirks were given through implantation of various devices in the body, and transformation quirks had yet to be mastered. The scientific field unveiled artificial quirks to the public and the world began to change yet again. With the influx of artificial quirks, competition to get into hero schools skyrocketed to an all time high while several pro-heroes experienced a shift in their ranking. On account of all of this, there is typically a great deal of tension between those with artificial and natal quirks\u2026 Society had begun to change and as fate would have it, artificial quirks eventually fell into the wrong hands.*\n\n*Today, there is a large ring of villains attempting to bring about change to the world once more. By forcing their hand, they believe that they can usher in a new breed of heroes and villains\u2014Heroes and villains that are practically hand crafted. Your story begins in Las Vegas, Nevada, a cesspool for crime and a hot spot for heroes to be. With Lady Luck Academy nearby and a plethora of budding heroes, paths are bound to cross and adventures are sure to be had. The only question is; Who will you be?*\n\n\n**If you've made it this far and you're interested, congratulations!

From the story tellers and cave painters of long ago, to the most carefully preserved computers filled to the brim with date, the tales of Bralisela were stored carefully for all Braliselarians to remember. Bralisela began as a simple island, apart from the rest of the world and alone in how it was run. \n\nThe gods of main land saw nothing more than a piece of dirt, but two of them saw magic in the piece of earth. They renounced their membership of the Great Council, and took control of the small land, together. They ruled as man and wife, populating the earth and growing love into the plants that flourished under their care, until the day the Great Council grew angry at how well the small island was doing, and took their rage out on the pair.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for reading this far!

Or explore the vast forested cavern of Boreas, the north, where magic and mystery dwells in the shadows.  Set up shop in the cheerful fairytale kingdom of Eurus, the east, where even humans can find safe haven.  Experiment in the catacombic libraries of Notus, the south, where the sharp-eyed furtive lady holds the keys to treasures untold.  Or... wander the blood-soaked stone of Zephyrus, the west, a nest of carnal sin.\n\nThere's a place for all.\n\n\n---\n\nNSFW and SFW channels are available for play. NSFW channels are free-for-all, SFW are soft and smol.

            "selftext": "Hello there, you can call me Shadow! I am a 23 year old male and live on the eastern coast. I'd just like to be forward and get this off my chest now, but if you're wanting somebody to play a female for you then you're in the wrong place. I only play female if we're doubling, otherwise I'm playing a male. Sorry but I just don't like it when the only rps I'm offered are ones where I'm stuck playing a female.... I know that is probably a dealbreaker.\n\nI'd like things to be literate/semi-literate, no script play! Length doesn't bother me, so long as your replies aren't always just a single sentence it is perfectly fine. But I also don't want to write a full novel for a singular reply.... 1-2 paragraphs is my limit, sorry. Third person please! I can respond daily, I don't expect you to do the same.... but if it's been awhile and I ask 'Are you still interested?' just a simple 'Yes, I'm just busy' would suffice, please don't leave me in the dark or ghost me. If you want to end the rp I'd much rather hear the words rather than get ghosted. Being ghosted isn't fun, if there's an issue please just tell me.\n\nI prefer OCXCanon, just as a heads up. I'm not much a fan of OCxOC, I find it hard to make OCs click together. Especially if the rp is revolved around nsfw themes and no plot. And I love nsfw themes... if that bothers you, sorry. But plot and nsfw themes are my favorite kind of rp! Though I do enjoy an rp with just nsfw stuff in it.\n\nHere are the list of my fandoms\n\nPokemon(For this, I'd honestly rather do a journey based rp... *preferably* with nsfw themes. And to be clear I mean TrainerXTrainer)\n\nNaruto\n\nSaints Row\n\nTotal Drama (Not the Daycare one obviously)\n\nMarvel/DC\n\nHarry Potter\n\nSonic (Comics, Cartoon, Games... whatever, just not the IDW run as I haven't read that yet)\n\nScooby Doo (Honestly, if you can rp as Daphne for me....)\n\nLimits/personal restrictions: The one thing I'll flat out refuse to do is MxM, I'm sorry but I don't swing that way. I have nothing personal against it, just not into it. I hope you can respect how I feel about that\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-&gt; Contact:\n\nI mostly rp over on Discord, I don't kik sorry. Roleplaying here isn't out of the question though, I'd just rather do it on Discord. Message me for the information if you're interested\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking forward to hearing from some of you!",

After explaining that this was a project to be done in pairs of two Miss Woods then called out the pairs one by one before reaching the final two \"Amy Foster and [Your character]...\" Amy was the typical loner girl who just kept to herself and was often bullied.

I love the idea of a shy, introverted girl and the popular queen of the school being put on a project together and being forced to get to know eachother. \n\nFor this RP I'm looking for people who are literate, can write in 3rd person and someone who won't hit me with one liners.\n\nIf this has caught your interest feel free to hit me up and we can discuss this some more.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I\u2019m interested in roleplaying with you! I have lots of vague plot ideas that we can brainstorm on and I\u2019d love to hear yours as well! Please understand that I\u2019m a student so during the week days my replies will be less consistent than on the weekends, but i do have a social life. I will let you know if I\u2019m going to be busy or if my replies will be slower. My time zone is EDT, keep that in mind as well. I\u2019m willing to play male or female characters, gay or straight relationships, and I\u2019m also very willing to play as mythical creatures (personal favorite of mine) NSFW is allowed and i do actually enjoy it, but i don\u2019t want a roleplay based purely on it, i want it to work in the plot. \n\nWriting style of third person or first person is fine by me. Please be literate and write more than two sentences. But i do want quality, two sentences that are good quality is better than a poorly written paragraph that you just threw together. I have Kik, discord, and instagram. I do not have a preference on which one you use! If you\u2019re interested, please leave a comment or pm on reddit so we can exchange info. Thanks! Hope to hear from those who are interested soon!",

I believe that role-playing is a good way to practice language skills for non-native speakers and to share grammar notes from native or near-native speakers. \n\nIf there are enough speakers for a particular language, then I will create a new role-playing channel for that language. I will probably not be able to moderate that channel, so I may have to select a trustworthy person to moderate the language-roleplaying channel. \n\nWe will use English as a lingua franca in out-of-roleplay discussions. \n\nPM me for the Discord Server Invitation.

Looking around, you see that you are in a victorian era stiled bedroom, and are wearing similarly stiled clothes. Near the bed, you find a bag and a card that simply says your name. In the bag, is something related to your skill. Walking out of the room, you find yourself in a strange mansion. \n\n\nThere's a murderer in the mansion, and no apparent exit. Every hour that passes in the mansion, another strange occurrence. From the lights going out, to ghostly apparitions roaming the halls. Alone, you must escape.

            "selftext": " Premise:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou wake up on a seemingly deserted beach, with no immediate memory of how you arrived there. Ahead of you is open ocean as far as the eye can see, and to the left and right of you is many miles of shoreline. Behind you are tall granite cliffs, with no way that you can make out of safely climbing them. \n\nHeading along the coast in search of a way up, you find bits of wood planks washed up on the beach, along with old rope, smashed barrels, and other items which look like they may have come from wrecked ships. After about an hour, the cliffs slowly give way until the slope has become small enough for you to make your way up. Climbing up, you find nothing but a large pine forest, with a path leading through the trees. Taking the path, you find yourself walking through the silent forest, with no sounds of animals, and no birds save for the occasional gull on the beach. Eventually, you come to an old Victorian mansion, with a well kept lawn and comforting air. As far as you can tell, it is the only home on the island. The only other structure you can see is a lighthouse in the distance. You find it strange that there is a single house on a relatively large island, but wonder if the occupant(s) might be able to help you out of your current situation. \n\nThe only option you can see at the moment is to knock on the door....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that intro catches your attention. I've recently gotten into text-based roleplaying, and find it to be an interesting exercise in writing. I can do either Discord or Kik, and am open to discussing ideas on where the story goes once you reach the mansion. If you're interested, feel free to PM me, and we can talk.",

Capable, I hope, explains itself!\n\nIf you stuck through that dour monologue thank you very much!\n\nI'm a very adaptable roleplayer but favour the genre of fantasy as that is what I write on my lonesome. Saying that, although I will always opt for original stories when given the option, I would always enjoy an oc-based fandom roleplay, some of mine include: GoT, ATLA, HTTYD, Disney etc. That isn't to disregard original ideas completely, quite the opposite, I have a lot of ideas bubbling up here but it may be best to leave those to the PMs or Discord as I couldn't do them justice on here!

            "selftext": "The year is 2030, and the United States had been fighting in a war with Russia for seven years. The fighting in the bitter cold of Siberia, and all over Eastern Europe was brutal on the soldiers, but in June, Russia formally declared surrender, and the peace treaty was signed. \n\n  Women had been allowed to participate in combat roles after a new authorization before the war, and now that the soldiers return home, both husbands and wives await their loved ones return, but not all are themselves anymore. \n\n\n Hello all! My name is Emma, and I\u2019ve been rping for just over a year and a half! I thought of this story idea just off the top of my head, and would love to have a partner for it! Either or can be discussed as to if I or your character is the soldier, but I wish to RP a soldier and his or her significant other reuniting, and dealing with the struggles of post war mental scarring! \n\n Obviously, this is an 18+ RP with nsfw themes! If you\u2019re interested, send me a small sample of how you would rp in my prompt in a DM, and we will go from there! :D",

            "selftext": "Hi, hello! My name is Bria! I\u2019ve been role playing for maybe 5 years now, maybe even more? Probably more. Maybe venturing close to double digits. It\u2019s been a while. I like to think I know what I\u2019m doing. I like to be semi-descriptive, extremely descriptive... basically, I like details and I tend to ramble... like right now. \n\nI\u2019m very chatty OOC and I can/will hook you up with pictures of a cute pitbull. I also like to quote vines and memes.. all of the time. \n\nMy phone is always on me at work so I\u2019m very easy to get ahold of most days. \n\nI like my roleplay partner to also be literate. I get it. We all have typos. We all make mistakes.... but if it\u2019s constant, every single response.. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll work out.\n\nAlso, please don\u2019t ghost. I\u2019d rather you bow out then just ghost me.\n\nI\u2019m a full time employee with a lot of time on my hands when I\u2019m off, plus I also like to do stuff on my breaks at work. When I\u2019m bored, I get really bored.\n\nI\u2019ve done mostly fandom, but I\u2019m open to do anything really! Completely an open book, but fandom is where I\u2019m most comfortable.\n\nThe fandoms I like/feel most comfortable in are\n\n-Harry Potter (mostly marauders! I\u2019ve played a lot as Sirius and I\u2019m also game for Golden Trio era.)\n \n-Marvel MCU! Mostly Avengers however. I\u2019ve played as Clint, T\u2019Challa, Steve, Bucky, Pietro... but I\u2019m open to play anyone and give it a try! \n\n-also the MCU on Netflix... mostly Daredevil and Punisher. \n\n-sons of anarchy cause I love me some bikers.\n\n-aaaand maybe a select few others I can\u2019t think of right now? It\u2019s too late for my brain to work  and I\u2019m killing time at work here.\n\nI usually do OC x Canon, but I am partial to canon x canon, but mostly leaning towards oc x canon. I do like to double so we each have a couple we can both play female in. It just seems fair tbh. I\u2019m all about fairness.\n\nI tend to gravitate towards MxF pairings. Nothing against LGBT+... because I myself happen to be part of the spectrum. But I just am better adept at writing MxF. I also mostly write SFW because most of the time.... I am at work. But I\u2019m also comfortable with writing NSFW. Nothing... super explicit however, because again, at work most of the time.\n\nI do use discord quite often, I\u2019m also a fan of using email. I don\u2019t have a preference. If you wanna go the discord route, sure. If you wanna go the email way, sure. Either way... feel free to message me and we can work something out! I don\u2019t bite, I promise.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, congratulations! Hope to hear from anyone who wants to role play!",

            "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI've never written an advertisement like this before, so I've broken it down how it makes sense to me.  If you have other questions, please just ask.\n\n**About me**\n\nI'm a 19 year old student entering my sophmore year of undergrad.  For better or worse, I've been writing since I was little, and I like to think I've developed enough mastery to fit in nicely with the advanced, literate crowd.  I am a student, so my availability varies from day to day and week to week, and will change every few months.  I don't see that ever becoming a significant enough problem that we won't be able to write together, but if it ever appears that it will I will let you know.  I am a very upfront person.  If the timing isn't working, or the story doesn't catch a hook in me, or we aren't connecting well as people, I will say so.  That doesn't mean I'll cut ties right then and there.  I believe that all problems should be given a chance to be solved, but it only harms both of us to move forward with only half our hearts on the table.\n\nIf you'd like to know anything else about me, just ask!  I'm a fairly private person, but unless you ask for something identifying, I'll probably answer.\n\n\n**What I'm looking for**\n\nI'd love to find a partner that will journey with me through our imaginations for the long term.  As I've grown as a writer, I've fallen in love with a story written between two or more people.  When the right personalities blend together, it becomes a perfect storm of both reading an engaging novel and putting your own direction into where it ends.  \n\nAll stories burn and die eventually.  I want to find a partner that will move from me from story to story over months or years.\n\n\n**Genre**\n\nThis is an open-ended section.  I don't have any strong desires or grand plans, though science fiction sticks just a hair above the rest.  Existing universes are super okay with me on a case by case basis.  Star Wars (or similar) is one example I'm often excited to build a character in.\n\n**Bonus points if...**\n\n(Here's where we test if I read the formatting guide well)\n\n - You are okay with romance, but won't force any of it.  I have tried to write romance as an intent from the start, and I have never had a good experience with it.  I have had characters that naturally fall in love due to the plot between them, and that was some of the most powerful writing I've ever had.\n - You are okay with sex, but it is a maximally small portion of the story.  I'm not even asking for it to happen at all.  If it does, it's something that makes sense for the characters.  That can mean many different things, and you can ask me specifically if you'd like.\n - You are okay with grit.  I prefer not to obfuscate what happens behind closed doors, however horrible it might be.  I am sensitive to the limits of my partner, but beyond that, I believe in submerging my mind into a character and putting myself through their experiences as best I can imagine to better understand their choices.\n - You read the above, and understand that though the last three items were mentioned, I'm not interested in writing The Notebook, Fifty Shades of Grey, or torture-porn.  Sex, love, and uncomfortable themes are elements of a story, but they are not what I'd like to base one on exclusively.\n - You won't judge me for being on the younger side.\n - You like side chatter and aren't opposed to becoming friends.\n - You are interested in being a guide to the story.  I'm hesitant to call this \"Game Master\" or a related term, as it sometimes implies a complete lack of creative direction from the player, or that the focus will be on numbers and dice.  If you are interested in this role, please understand that while I don't mind if you use numbers and such behind the scenes to make decisions, I want to remain entirely focused on the story.  I don't want to know they exist for my character as attributes, nor for anyone else.  **This is not a requirement.  Just bonus points.**  I have had positive experiences writing with others in the past who filled this role, and they were not disappointed in the content and direction I helped give the story from my side.  Please ask more if you're curious what I mean in this.\n - You are capable of writing multiple paragraphs, but understand that not every reply needs to be that long.  If our characters are chattering back and forth, and we're both sitting there with the story as our forefront activity, sentences are fine.  Five or so paragraphs is a healthy maximum I prefer to receive.  I won't throw a textbook (Chemistry textbooks are heavy with sharp corners!) at you if you send more, but in line with the bullet after this, I like a reply I can compose an answer to in a reasonable time.\n - Big points: You like the idea of being seated together writing back and forth live.  I love sitting back with a movie in the background, chatting and going back and forth.\n\nI wrote this as a dump of my conscious in what I'd like.  If there's anything you feel I haven't said that you're curious, please send me a message to ask!\n\nWhen you reply, please let me know a few things: What you like to get out of a story, what you like in a partner, whether or not you're okay being a 'guide' (again, not required), any genres or ideas you're on the edge of your seat to write, your Discord address, your favorite color, and as detailed a description as you'd like on how you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  There's a point.  I promise.",

I'm not going to ghost you so I hope you have the same opinion on that matter, I do only use discord so please include your tag in your initial PM as it would help a bunch!\n\nIf you stuck through that dour monologue thank you very much!\n\nI'm a very adaptable roleplayer but favour the genre of fantasy as that is what I write on my lonesome. Saying that, although I will always opt for original stories when given the option, if not I would always enjoy an oc-based fandom roleplay, some of mine include: GoT, ATLA, HTTYD, Disney etc. That isn't to disregard original ideas completely, quite the opposite, I have a lot of ideas bubbling up here but it may be best to leave those to the PMs or Discord as I couldn't do them justice on here!

            "selftext": " \n\nHey everyone. I've posted this before but it's been a little while, so I figured I'd throw it out there again and see if anyone else is interested.\n\nTo introduce myself, I'm a 24yo uni student who is looking for someone to RP in the Marvel universe. I feel like the movies and RPs have largely focused on the current Avengers lineup, so if at all  possible I would love for this to have a focus on the New Avengers (Hulkling, Wiccan, Noh-Varr, etc.) But in that context, be whoever the hell you want! The idea of utilizing the Young or New Avengers is incredibly flexible; I don't mind complete OCs one bit if that's your poison, or even utilizing some of the current Avengers (to a slight degree, however).\n\nI prefer flexibility with these different universes, and although I would love to keep the superhero theme strong I also don't mind other 'supernatural' beings existing. Romantic and/or NSFW  elements are certainly welcome, but it would be M/M pairings (that being said, if we're getting into NSFW stuff I would like there to be some kind of romance behind it). For that kind of thing I absolutely require my partner to be 18+ as well.\n\nSo, on to the format, structure, etc. I try my best to be as detailed as possible; when I RP I really enjoy forming a mental image of the scene, and so I  would prefer you be detailed as well. I would love a character reference, but if you don't care to use one then a good and thorough description of them will suffice. Though I'm flexible when it comes to post length, we will have a hard time working out if all I see is \"Character X  says \"Ha\" and sits down on a couch\". Obviously there will be time where our characters will mostly be engaging in dialogue, so again I'm not trying to sound like a stickler here. All in all, let's try to have a happy balance.\n\nI definitely prefer to RP over Discord. This gives us a happy back-and-forth dynamic which I LOVE. I typically respond quickly, but I also understand that life happens. I'm not going to harass you for a response if two days pass by and there's nothing, but if you'll be gone  for more than a week or some serious stuff is going down, I'd definitely appreciate some communication. That being said, you'll make me one really happy character if there's a regular back-n-forth between our characters. That being said, if we are RPing and you don't feel it's a good match after a few posts, please let me know. We're adults in this, I promise I'm not going to attack you if you don't feel like we're meshing incredibly well.\n\nFinally to the last bit (I promise), even though this is RP I would love to develop some kind of conversation alongside it. The best kind of RP is when you can go OOC and  have a laugh about what your characters are doing, and that kind of  dynamic would be greatly appreciated. So if you are at all interested in what I'm offering or even a hint of this post  caught your eye, feel free to send me a message! Let's see what kind of fun story we can  strike up. Thanks for reading and take care.",

            "selftext": "I posted a prompt like this a few weeks ago after seeing the trailer and getting jazzed up, but now that the first two episodes of the new season of Doctor Who are out I wanted to take another crack at it!\n\nI've been absolutely dying for a Doctor Who roleplay lately, particularly one with the Thirteenth Doctor. I'm madly in love with her already and would love to play opposite her as her companion. I would be willing to play her, but I've done a number of roleplays where I've played the Doctor and would prefer not to have to at the moment!\n\nI figure this roleplay will be a bit slice-of-life (on the TARDIS) at times, a bit action/adventure at others. I'd also like it to be a little shippy/have some romance in it because I love that in my roleplays \\^\\^ Obviously there's a lot standing between the Doctor and their companion, but I'm a sucker for romance. I very much prefer F/F for romantic relationships, though if the characters mesh well we can talk about other pairings. We can hash out details before we start, talk about plots, and discuss things like limits. \n\nIn regards to plots, I figure some kind of monster-of-the week type scenario could be fun, and I have *plenty* of episode-type plots already down. I went through a phase where I wanted to write an entire season and I came very nearly close to doing so, so if you find you're having trouble thinking up an adventure for our characters to chase, I've got tons to choose from!\n\nI like to roleplay over Discord for the most part, but if you have something else that works better for you I'm happy to try it! I usually have long introductions (between 4-10 paragraphs depending on what the roleplay calls for) but settle into 1-3 paragraph responses. I write in novel-style and in third person pretty much exclusively. I'm also very willing to double if you want me to!\n\nAs a rule, I like to roleplay with people over the age of 20, because I'm 25 and do like to write mature themes!\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you! I hope this interests you and you get in touch!",

            "selftext": "**Seventh Shock Trooper Roleplay**\n\nThe  RP is set in the gritty atmosphere of the Halo universe amid the  Human-Covenant war. Battles across the galaxy have already taken  millions of lives and left countless colonies turned into barren  wastelands of what they used to be. You will play as an Orbital Drop  Shock Trooper, an elite soldier in the UNSC Marine Corps, and take the  fight back to the covenant fleets, defend UNSC colonies, or protect the  homeland from the internal conflicts like the United Rebel Front.\n\nBy now you may be thinking, *\"Well this must be when my character comes in and saves the day, right?\"*  I'm sorry to disappoint, but no. The closer you begin to think your  character is immortal, the closer they get to having a stray round go  through their head. This is **war**. Characters **will**  die. It is by no means a rare occurrence. As an ODST you will be the  vanguard for the UNSC against any alien, rebel, or any other poor  bastard to get between you and your objective.\n\nSeventh  Shock Trooper Roleplay prides itself on three characteristics; realism,  logic, and reason. While other roleplays may have magic to protect you  or godly amounts of training to get you out of any sticky situation,  Seventh RP relies on your gun, wits, and the guy next to you to keep  your character alive.\n\nThere will be no  Mary Sue's or Gary Stu's in this RP. If your character messes up, there  will be no \"retcons\". There will be no \"redos\". And there **will** be consequences.\n\nIf you are interested in an RP where your decisions **actually**  matter to the outcome of your character, where chaos rules over order and morals, and where the odds aren't always in your favour, don't waste your time any longer.\n\nBecome a Helljumper, and jump feet first into hell.\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/jRGhJA9](https://discord.gg/jRGhJA9)",

There's no minimum word limit, and whether you have originals or canon characters doesn't matter, you can use as many as you want! We'll ask periodic character development questions and allow for bot games to be played with your OCs. Otherwise, if you want to just test out a new character's voice, vent about something in-character, or just do some light roleplaying, this is the place to do it and more!\n\nI'm also looking for mods, so if you have experience modding rp servers and don't mind taking on a mod position with probably light maintenance duties, I'd be very glad to have you! \n\nhttps://discord.gg/CpJQHgP",

I have long blonde hair that falls in waves down to the midpoint of my back, tanned skin, sharp but kind green eyes, and a petite and fit body frame, standing at 170 cm (5 foot 6).\n\nIn this time period (you can pick the era, whether it be historical, modern, futuristic, etc) there are two main governing powers: the North and the South. The west is landlocked, with brisk winter air throughout the year. The mountains stretch high into the clouds above and the streams cut the mighty paths between them, making it accessible for trade and settlement. The North\u2019s power lies in its domineering force and its vast stock of minerals, lumber, and other vital resources. The South is the complete opposite. Settled up just against the sea, the South depends on its oceanic trade. With diet based on the fresh fruit and fish and permeating warm climate, it\u2019s not difficult to become friendly with the South.\n\nThe two kingdoms are powerful in their own unique ways but are at each others throats for all the power. With rising tensions since establishment, the political climate is near reaching its boiling point and small skirmishes have begun, although not full out war. However, each side has been vying to make a move to try and win the war before it could even begin. You are the Prince of the North and I, the Princess of the South. It\u2019s the evening of my 22nd birthday, and as the eldest daughter, my family has decided to have a celebration, inviting many neighboring families and nobles from the South. It was, at the surface, for my birthday, but also in order to make sure alliances were set in stone. Your father, however, caught wind of the celebration and the snub of an invitation, so he decides to take matters into his own hands, assigning you the task to sneak in and infiltrate the party. The goal? Well, he leaves that up to you: make me fall for you, kidnap me, get me intoxicated and spill any secrets I may have: anything just to get the ball in your court.\n\nIf interested, please message  your name, a description, and continue the RP. This can go really in any direction you\u2019d like. I also speak French and Spanish if you\u2019d prefer another language.

And whoever comes out victorious of this civil war will shape the future of Tamriel, forever. This is the beginning, of the War of the Ruby Throne\"*\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe War of the Ruby Throne is the popular name for the currently on-going civil war that is building up across Tamriel. Three people are all seeking to claim and sit on the Ruby Throne, all of them whom are the children of the Last Dragonborn. A person of the Dragonblood, and all the claimants believe that their Dragonblood give them divine right to rule.\n\nFormally, the war was officiated and declared in 4E 265 by the Aldmeri Dominion and the Mede Empire when the high command of the Imperial Legion, decided to abandon the Mede Empire to align with one of the three claimants, this event has later been known as the Imperial Defection.\n\nIt's now 4E 266. The War is properly raging across Tamriel, three siblings caught fighting each other and their supporters, as well as fighting the High Elven dominance established in the form of the Aldmeri, and their puppet Empire.\n\nThe real question is, who are you?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow that I've set the scene a little. Hi there! Thanks for reading my post so far! I'm Tez, a 21-year old, genderfluid Norwegian seeking one or two new RP partners for a specific idea! Namely the one above. So if it interested ya' then keep on reading! Bear with me as this could get lengthy.\n\nOkay so. Before I tell you what I'm looking for in you as a partner, let me tell you a little more about the plot itself, I'm really looking to get a mutli-character view, I love having a large casts, with one or two main pairs or characters, and a grand supporting cast to accompany them. I wanna see this civil war from several sides, maybe one of the pairs are a group of soldiers serving one of the Claimants? Perhaps Imperial nobles in Cyrodiil, and their struggle to remain neutral in the growing tension? All are valid options, but there is one pairing I'm really looking to play;\n\nI want to play as one of the claimants, Emperor-Claimant Kordillus 'Stormcrown'. The eldest of the three children. Ideally we'd play him and his spouse/romantic interest. You play mine and I'll play yours! Easy peasy, right? Details can be worked out and chatted about!\n\nSo, about you;\n\n* Dedicated to playing long-term.\n\n* Be comfortable playing characters of any gender and orientation.\n\n* LGBT+ friendly\n\n* Over the age of 18. (Sorry, minors!)\n\n* Creative and comes with your own ideas and suggestions, I don't wanna pull the plot alone!\n\n* Friendly and interested in OOC chatter, not required but greatly appreciated\n\n* Good grammar and sentence structure, some typos happen and what not, no one is perfect!\n\n* Between 2-5 paragraphs, ideally. I don't mind more, but I'm not the most capable on keeping up with 7+ paragraph posts\n\n* A sucker for romance, political intrigue, scheming and all that good jazz\n\n* Knowledgeable in Elder Scrolls (I'm not an encyclopedia about ES, but I can hold my ground.)\n\n* Ideally okay with NSFW-themes.\n\n* Consistent in writing, I don't do much so I usually can do several replies per day, that doens't mean you gotta do that, but definitely more frequently than once a week!\n\n* Uh, more probably. Can't think of anything right now though!\n\nGenerally, if you're interested in playing in the Elder Scrolls universe, with many, diverse characters in a large cast with two or three focal pairings, I'm your person! When you contact me, please make sure to send me some text to work with. I'd like to know a little about you as a person, and a little about you as a writer. Sample not required, this is fun, not a job application~\n\nBasically, send me something to work with so I can decide if we should try and work something out! I hope to hear from y'all!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm Cas and I'm looking for partners that are at least 21+ as that's old I am. Mature themes will be in my plots though limits will be discussed. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn't have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having long, thoughtful replies back where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and writing as I am, and please don't make come up with everything by myself. It's frustrating. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance, using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship.\n\nLast but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I\u2019m mainly looking for female authors writing male characters but male authors are fine too.\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n21+ partners\n\nFor you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and **out of character.** (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies).\n\nFor you to write as a male in their 30s-40s and older. I'm a sucker for the gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. The broken ones who are rough around the edges and aren't afraid to throw a punch. But are tender enough provide a hug if needed.\n\nThe more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs, preferably more) and really bring the story to life.\n\nThe use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\nSomeone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post or before it. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous. \n\nI love all types of genres, but especially urban fantasy and science fiction. Lately I\u2019ve been wanting something based off The X Files and/or True Blood. All my characters will be adults and I require my partners do the same.\n\nFor plot ideas, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and possibly writing. Look forward to hearing from you!\n",

I\u2019d like to roleplay in a world extremely similar to our own, but with certain strange and unexplainable attributes to it that may or may not be hidden from the general population. I\u2019d rather let you choose your poison than impose a choice, but I\u2019d be pretty interested in anything from eldritch horrors, to superpowers and strange abilities. Afterwards, we can decide on the basic plot points and whatnot, and develop the world a bit since I really enjoy worldbuilding, but things should be rather simple since we don\u2019t have to worry too much about the geography of the world of the history of it, since it happens to be our own. Unless you can convince me otherwise, but that remains to be seen!\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a long term partner is pretty simple! I\u2019d like fairly detailed responses that might range from a paragraph to 2 or 3 if you\u2019d like, and I\u2019ll try to match you both in quantity and quality if possible, although I\u2019ll have to admit I\u2019m not a professional writer! I\u2019d also like you to be consistent, try and keep a certain level of quality throughout the entire thing, if you\u2019re feeling a bit tired I\u2019d rather just wait a bit more, honestly, maybe it would be a good time to plan out some aspects of the world?\n\nI\u2019d also really appreciate it if you could try to avoid \u201ctext speech\u201d as much as possible, I can\u2019t stand emojis most of the time or \u201clols\u201d and \u201clmaos\u201d. I know some people might be using their phones but I\u2019d simply recommend using your autocorrector in that case for those long and complicated words.\n\nWith all of that out of the way, I\u2019d also like to apologize for this relatively bad first impression of me, I swear I\u2019m not such an asshat when you get to know me, but I\u2019ve had far too many bad experiences in the past that could\u2019ve been easily avoided if people just read the post. Speaking of which, please name a random animal if you\u2019d like to send me a PM and give me a chance, I\u2019d really appreciate it!\n\nThanks for reading through this entire thing!",

            "selftext": "When a few New Yorkers wander their way through a fairy circle into the magical land of Eventyr - a realm straight out of a storybook, complete with beautiful princesses, their dashing heroes, and woodland-creature companions - it seems, at first, to be a great adventure. A time-travel Netflix series, an immersive virtual reality game, or a weekend trip LARPing: slay a few zombies in the morning, save a damsel around dinner, unwind in the most authentic medieval inn and pub into the wee hours, and home for work by Monday morning.\n\n \n\nHowever, when the King dies suddenly, the land is thrown into chaos. And, strangely, not just the political kind, where once-respected knights turn warlord, but also pestilence and disease plague the people. Our heroes have to face the fact that this isn't just an escape from the been-theres-and-done-thats of city life - there is more going on here, and their next quest may well be saving not just the Realm, but Earth as well. \n\n \n\nCharacters might be New Yorkers juggling two lives--their busy city life and their escape-turned-disaster in Eventyr; New Yorkers who have decided to make Eventyr their home permanently; or natives of the fantasy kingdom who don't know anything about Earth. \n\n \n\nEventyr is an original fantasy game, drawing inspiration from high fantasy like Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and classic folk and fairy tales, as well as time-travel or dimension-hopping tales like 10th Kingdom, Jumanji, Outlander, or Westworld. Our first game day will be the day of the King's death. \n\n \n\nFor more information, including contact emails, check out our Info Site or send me a PM. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\n \n\nInfo Site: [https://sites.google.com/site/eventyrrpg/](https://sites.google.com/site/eventyrrpg/)\n\nMain List: [https://eventyr.groups.io/g/main](https://eventyr.groups.io/g/main) ",

            "selftext": "Howdy! Looking for a partner to do this cyberpunk-styled story. Starting off with us not even knowing what we look or sound like because of power suits that we wear. Your character will know a good amount about mine, but mine will know nothing of yours. I've made the role my partner would play purposely vague so you'd be able to give your character your own lore and personality. \n\nHere's the prompt!\n\n&gt; We\u2019re the chosen ones. The pilots of the Midas Battle Suits; named thusly because it\u2019s been said a single moment of contact is all it takes for an opponent to be killed or maimed beyond repair. Super strength, impossible athletics, plasma beams, energy weapons, and more. The suits capacity seems only limited by its pilot\u2019s imagination. Originally designed ages ago for elite soldiers of the government\u2026 now used as guards, hitmen, and watchdogs for the most prestigious aristocrats in a half-crumbled megacity. \n&gt; \n&gt; The aristocrats call themselves the \u201cRing of Apostles.\u201d The ones they believe were chosen by the Gods themselves to continue living lives of luxury.\n&gt; \n&gt; I\u2019ve been one of the leading Midas Champions for almost 5 years now. The public knows me simply as \u201cRad.\u201d Popular in the arena and the favorite of many. I tend to keep it easy outside of the competitive scene, doing chores for the Apostles every now and then but no big missions\u2026 or at least not any known to the public.\n&gt; \n&gt; You yourself are a prodigy who has come out of seemingly nowhere. You\u2019ve risen up, earned your Midas Suit, and have finally reached high enough to be able to challenge me.\n&gt; \n&gt; You and I meet on the platform that will raise up into the arena, looking almost identical. Our suits are only different in the way they\u2019re painted and decorated. My suit always looks brand new, sleek glossy blue and silver painted metal; emblems of swords and axes here and there with swords crossing on my chest. Beneath our visors, our voices are modulated to the same robotic tone, originally intended so soldiers treated each other the same on the battlefield, not having to worry about personal friends in the heat of battle\u2026 Despite this, you can still tell I\u2019m a hot-headed jackass. \u201cTell ya what, kid. If you win today, I\u2019ll owe you drinks for an entire month? How\u2019s that sound?\u2026  Y\u2019know what? I\u2019ll throw in two of my bikes as well.\u201d\n\nI plan on you inevitably kicking my ass. Haha!\n\nIf this sounds like something you'd be interested in, please send me a PM, and we can get the ball rolling! I'd love to hear any ideas or suggestions you have as well to make the story more interesting. Thanks for your time!\n",

            "selftext": "Hi there~! The name is Sam, and I'm looking for a literate partner to write some stuff with! I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a story revolving around the time of the Peloponnesian War, and for it to take place solely in Athens. Inspired by the new Assassin's Creed, I would love to play a Misthios (Mercenary) who finds herself suddenly apart of all the city has to offer. I would love if she even stumbled into some sort of government role. The themes I'm looking to explore with the story are very much 'fish out of water', with a woman who has spent her whole life in War suddenly having to face a different enemy; One she can't face on the battlefield, while also coming to terms with new friendships and what life with privilege is like. When it comes to fighting in the story, I'd like to avoid it as much as possible, or have it be only experienced in the aftermath of itself. I'd prefer to focus on no combat and all politics/character development, but will partake in a Mythological type adventure If the idea is good.~\n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well. So, if you're going to play a male character just keep in mind I wouldn't want a romance arc. But, I expect heavy debauchery in most regards. Sex, Alcohol, and Violence are part of the game!\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

After recovering from a hand injury, I think I\u2019m ready to get back into roleplaying! \n\nSome notes about me: my schedule tends to get busy so their may be stretches of two or three days where I may be unable to post. However, I\u2019m more than happy to do OOC chat between posts. We can chat about the story or something off-topic. I typically write three paragraphs if not more per post in third person perspective and in the past tense. I\u2019m okay with romance and smut and other graphic content as long as it isn\u2019t gratuitous or makes up most of the story.\nAlso, I ask that my partner be over the age of 20 due to the likelihood of mature scenes and themes in the story.\n\nIdeas I\u2019ve had:\n\n- A \u201czombie\u201d RP where the zombies retain the movement and skills they had before infection. Kinda like The Crazies or maybe The Crossed where they can carry out plans to kill. \n\n- Noir crime RP. Our characters work for an organization and are part of a job gone wrong and have to make up their debt in a limited amount of time or face stiff consequences.\n\nAnother take on the crime RP is having our characters be partners trying to take down a killer or crime family. Maybe a PD and their assistant or two vigilantes trying to solve the case for themselves.\n\n- Cyberpunk has been big recently and thought I\u2019d give it more of a try. No real plot for a cyberpunk RP but would love to try the setting out. \n\nThose are the cravings I\u2019ve had recently but if they don\u2019t catch your eye but you think we might work well as partners then feel free to reach out! \n",

My timezone is **EST**, and I have 6+ years of experience in roleplay, though this would be my first time finding a partner like this online, as most of my experience has been on video games or forums.\n\nAs for responses, I'd prefer **paragraph roleplay**. Responses should be *at least* one lengthy paragraph or two short ones. For genres, I prefer **medieval**, **fantasy**, or **D&amp;D based settings**. I'm open to discussion though. I also will only be playing OCs.\n\nI will only roleplay romance if it's FxF or MxF when I am the male counterpart. That's just my preference, sorry! \n\nMy availability is **at least once a day**, usually more but I don't want to make any promises I can't keep. I'm very **lenient with response times**, but **I will not wait longer than 4 days without a reply**, unless it was discussed beforehand because of something IRL or the like. I'd prefer to use **Discord** for roleplay, but I wouldn't be opposed to Kik (if it's short replies), or email. If there's something else you'd like to use, hit me with it and we'll see if it'll work out. I write in **third-person**, and in **either past or present tense**. I'm also not against mature themes, but my roleplay partner must be 18+ for this.\n\nAnyways, if any of this has caught your interest, shoot me a PM on reddit and we can exchange contact information. I can send a writing sample on request. Cheers!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It\u2019s easier to write with those that you\u2019ve come to know really well and made friends with. And there\u2019s also the fact that I have anxiety and I\u2019m terrified of approaching people and annoying them.\n\nSo this is why I\u2019m making this post instead and anyone can reply or drop me a message if they\u2019re interested!\n\nBasically looking for anyone willing to RP Tony Stark with my Pepper. I have written for both Tony and Pepper before although I do prefer Pepper. I have a good few years RP experience and have used various sites though things have slowed to a halt for me to the point where I don\u2019t RP much these days except with one person. I use various apps as well and that can be discussed to choose whichever is preferable. I\u2019m honestly very laid back when it comes to RP and I\u2019m fine with most concepts as long as both of us are comfortable. And of course, having fun!\n\nThis can simply be a platonic relationship. We can discuss matters and decide if we want them to be romantically involved.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t mind writing some NSFW I do prefer actual storytelling and working on a plot. I\u2019m also from the UK, 21+ and I\u2019m fairly quick on replies. Though replies will be slower during the week while I\u2019m at work. I do prefer para/multi para to one liners.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid to contact me! I\u2019m the least threatening person ever. If you are interested just let me know and we can discuss further! All I\u2019m looking for is having fun, making sure whomever I write with is comfortable and also having fun, and making new friends along the way. \n\n**Please only message if you genuinely want to write. Recently on here people have just been wasting my time, waiting till I\u2019ve worked on a starter to get the story going to decide to block and remove me as a friend, after long discussions on how we\u2019ll go about starting things off. Oh, and having also mentioned how they hate being \u201cghosted\u201d yet doing the same thing to me without giving any reason. So please, all I ask is that you only message if you are going to be writing long term.**\n\nI hope to write with some of you soon. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

Botan/Kieko/Koto etc. I do have a preference to play opposite Botan as the main. \n\nAbility to play multiple characters is a major plus! \nI can do the same for the males to flesh out the world as do really enjoy world my building. \n\nI have been playing this character for a long time now and would really like to explore him deeper with a serious plot line and relationship to work through. I typically like to start post Anime for more of a blank slate however I am open to ideas and plots- like to balance the nsfw side with story! Character development is super important..\n\nMy post style is what used to be known as \"multi\" (multiple paragraphs) say 3-5 per post. \n\nI like to RP in real time and live in session so Skype/Discord preferred.\n\nPM me and let me know if you are interested!",

I have many ideas from marvel, Supernatural, Sherlock, etc. However I prefer to do canon x oc character. I also like yandere boy roleplays with characters from black butler, Boku No Hero Academia, and a few more. I'm very detailed, I use proper grammar, and I always find inspiration for new ideas. \n\nSupernatural, Heathers, Sherlock, and many more! Just message me to find out the rest.\n\nPlease don't ask for pictures, i do not like that. I'm literate, the amount of detail I put depends on you. Please no real face profile pictures, it takes away from the rp.  I would prefer a long term rp as well.  If you haven't watched any of the things on the list (or the one I'll send on kik), then please don't bother.\n\nPlease say \"Marvel\" for a marvel rp when you message me to show you're interested. For the list of fandoms I enjoy for more ideas, please say \"interests\".  Must say one of these or I won't answer you. I don't answer to \"hey\".",

My connection isn't reliable, so bare with me if it takes a while to send a request, or to answer you once we start talking if it's before I get home.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, as you have read above, I am looking for something detailed and long term! When I say detailed, I don't mean a handful of sentences. I mean, detailed. Haha. At least one LARGE paragraph, or hopefully many of them. I want something where it is obvious how much effort is going into the plot and relations, not just something for back and forth to keep you busy for a while. I love effort, and really seeing that my partner is enjoying the roleplay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does lead into my next point, romance! I love all sorts of romances! The cute, cuddly kind. The sort where they are always at each other's throats but make up in the end. The forbidden love sort of thing but not like Romeo and Juliet. Haha Now, this also includes sexuality and roles! I can play male or female characters. I can play the one in charge, or passive. Gay, or straight. (Although I have very very little experience in lesbian. As in, one roleplay, and it was omegaverse.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have sort of been hoping to do an omegaverse roleplay, because it's been a while since I've had a good one where my partner didn't go missing. Of course, this isn't all I'm open to though! There are a bunch of roleplays that I do, it's just a matter of asking, and keep in mind that I will ask you the same thing! I don't make roleplays on my own. I always come up with plots together. You should also know, I'm not that big on fantasy based roleplays. Minimal, if any fantasy. I really only have experience with werewolves.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, feel free to PM me about any ideas or pairings you enjoy! If not, you will be questioned about it over Discord. Haha. I beg that you leave your Discord tag in the PM so I will be able to send you a friend request right away if I'm interested. I really don't check Reddit enough to hold a conversation here. Haha. It's been happening more often where people don't leave their tags, and it takes a lot longer for us to start talking, because I have to wait for you to respond back with your tag, which I already asked for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny further questions or comments, leave them in the PM and I will respond either here, or on Discord. Depending on if you're still the little rascal that doesn't leave their tag so I can't send a request right away. Haha. I will talk to you then!",

            "selftext": "Good morning, all. I hope everyone had a decent weekend. As usual, I'm looking for some more great partners for some of my cravings. Hopefully you'll find something that interests you.\n\nBut, of course, I do have a few things for which I'm specifically looking in a partner; let me lay those out for you: \n\n* When I write, I take it very seriously. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not silly and chatty OOC, because I totally am when I hit it off with someone. What it does mean is that I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I'm an editor for a living, which has ruined me for polite society, but I also love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. Realize that it's just as important as the story it's trying to tell.\n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving, hopeless romantic, but if that's not what floats your boat, we'll find something that does.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor *Saw V*, and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* I do not use any IM service. I use *email* or, if necessary, reddit PMs.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Final Fantasy X(Yuna)\n* Final Fantasy XII(Ashe)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)[Preferably before season 7.]\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: Thank you!",

For this, I'll make an exception. I'm looking someone to play Soldier/Jack. We could start our story within the early days, like when Uprising takes place, or after the fall of Overwatch. I think it would be pretty interesting starting in the early days and working on up. With that said, I'm looking for a long term partner. It is my hope that there is romance and adult themes included in this story, though I've always been one to let it play out in character. I have been role playing for well over a decade, so I bring a lot to the table. If you feel passionate about Overwatch like I do, hit me up. We can have a lot of fun! As for the details--I like my partners to write in third person and be able to produce more than a few sentences per post (c'mon guys, at least a paragraph. I'm not asking much). I also want someone who is excited and willing to contribute to the story. No one likes being the single ideal mule. The point of this is to create something we *both* can enjoy. I will say that I'm not insanely anal about getting all the details of the world/characters correct. This is my first time writing Angela, so I don't even expect myself to be perfect at it. Anyway, I hope to hear from you guys! &lt;3 Have a good one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "Good (whatever time of day it is for you)! As the title of this ad notes, I'm looking to RP some lines within the Pok\u00e9mon game/anime-verse, and I'm seeking to keep the anime's lighthearted and cheery mood. Over-the-top adventure, copious humor and comedy, witty/snarky banter, meaningful conflict (no constant bleakness or perpetual angst), quiet moments of character growth, good battles, romance (I'm cool with smut, but I wouldn't want it to be the proverbial endgame), our characters genuinely having fun and enjoy each other's company, that sort of thing. (And in full disclosure, I do have a present preference for canon x OC lines. I know I'm trash.) \n\n***All partners must be 21+ years old, and all characters must be written/played as 21 years old if they aren't already older.***\n\n___\n\n[This RoleplayGateway post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/9auwtv/vyces_roleplay_gateway_profile/) has all my OOC info, so I won't repost it here. (You're welcome for that. :P) Instead, let me note what I'm **not** looking to involve in any such lines... \n\n\u2620 *Mere glancing familiarity with the setting.* I'm asking partners to have fairly up-to-date knowledge on the games/anime (at least Gen 4 or 5) so we aren't significantly restricted regarding location or what Pok\u00e9mon we involve in a line. \n\n\u2620 *Making Pok\u00e9mon \"darker and edgier\".* I'm fine with a Pok\u00e9mon Origins-type tone sometimes. Something with a self-serious grimdark tone fitting Pok\u00e9mon Apok\u00e9lypse, however? That's not really my cup of tea. \n\n\u2620 *Fixating on game mechanics (mechanics of levels, stats, movesets, IVs, etc).* \n\n\u2620 *Enforcing the games' \"Four Moves of Doom\" limit.* Considering the anime doesn't and the games only do so for the sake of memory, why should we? :P Let's just have it so a Pok\u00e9mon can use--and learn--any of their given moves (which could be part of a plot in itself). \n\n\u2620 *Dry or one-sentence battle descriptions.* I'm certainly not demanding every single nuance receive a paragraph, but I **am** requesting partners be willing to describe moves and battles much like the anime. Just writing/reading *\"(Name of Pok\u00e9mon) used (name of attack)!\"* all the time gets boring, you know?\n\n___\n\nI have a few general and open-ended ideas here to set the stage, but I'm certainly open to hearing yours...\n\n\u25d3 **The typical Pok\u00e9mon journey** is always a classic fave, our characters just traveling and having highspirited adventures fitting the series in general. (In this case, I'd prefer an *in media res* approach where both our characters are already fairly seasoned and experienced, bringing up their greenhorn days if needed.) Perhaps our characters have been traveling a long time together, or have just started doing so.\n\n\u25d3 **Perhaps one of our characters are a member of Team \\[fill-in-the-blank\\] while the other's a trainer they're tailing for whatever reason**, but they end up battling on a regular basis and ultimately falling for each other? (Think a similar version of the dynamic Ash has with the TR trio, only with some romance added to the mix.)\n\n\u25d3 **One--or both--of our characters are Gym Leaders, Frontier Brains, Elite Four members, Team Rocket members, Top Coordinators and the like.** Maybe exploring the day-to-day deal behind being one of the greats, from training their chosen creatures to dealing with some cocky greenhorns wanting to challenge \u2018em.\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters initially meet battling over a Pok\u00e9mon.** Perhaps they each have a fair case for capture, forcing a temporary team-up if the target's exceptionally clever. Or maybe they join forces to deal with a third party trying to Pok\u00e9-block them?\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters are part of an elite academy for Pok\u00e9mon trainers.** Think Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s answer to Hogwarts or something like that.\n\n___\n\nNow, let me list desired characters (especially craved ones in italics)...\n\n1. I'd love to find a partner willing to play as *Misty*, *Jessie*, Officer Jenny, *Bianca (anime version)*, Fantina, Georgia, Iris or *Delia Ketchum* from the Pok\u00e9mon anime.  \n\n2. There are also some non-Pok\u00e9mon canon ladies I'd love to see transplanted into the setting somehow:   \n*Hermione* or *Ginny* (Harry Potter)  \nPrincess Peach or *Princess Daisy* (Mario)  \nMai Shiranui (King of Fighters)  \n*Korra* or Kuvira (Legend of Korra)\nSuki or Azula (Avatar)\n*Elsa* (Frozen-Disney) \nTifa (Final Fantasy)  \nFemale!Ranma Saotome (Ranma \u00bd)  \n\n3. I'd possibly be open to a lady OC (I admit having a few particularly desired faceclaims). A strong-minded, confident female who is a friend, a  partner, a rival, a romantic interest or any combo platter of the above. \n\n___\n\nSo if interested in this, please feel free to send me a PM. And if you aren't, then I hope you soon find something more appealing. (And make sure to stay out of the tall grass!)",

Yet two men has pulled the effort of the two together, United Heroes Alliance and the League of Rogues, with the president of the UHA setting rules within the world. Showing that anyone can be a hero, yet anyone can be a villian, the choice is yours. Some have even rejected either sides, brandishing their own ways in the world, even fighting both heroes and villians. What will you choose? \n\nYet forces outside of anyone's control is a foot, reworking and reconstructing the world around you at all times, always present and always watching. Events are option though and not required.\n\nEvents have 3 focuses which might be on Heroes, Villians and others. Civilians are an option and  if they participate in events have the chance to gain powers by staff's choice. Teams even among the 3 types are present. \n\nUnited Heroes Association both incorporates and even houses heroes if needed, having heroes register within the terms of the group and possible team placement, although sub-teams are optional. The United Heroes Association is ran by a Superhero named King Powers, holding council elections to decide the UHA president and thus, the president of the United States of America.\n\nSupers Rebellion- This group is against the way the UHA run the world, demanding that people with powers shouldn't have to register to live in society, some even using their powers to fight back again the UHA.\n\nLeague of Rogues- Led by the council known as the Terrifying Ten, the LoR is a faction that aims to destroy the UHA so that they may gain control, offering up the same things as the UHA. \n\nPick a side or don't. The choice is yours.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/3fMnaJX",

The sun beat down upon them making the work they were tasked with ten times as hard. \nThough, the sun didn\u2019t seem to bother a young woman who ran down the street, a basket full of greens in her arms.

This cause her eyes to be take away from her path and she ran straight into someone\u2019s chest.

            "selftext": "I'm looking for somebody that would be willing to write a RWBY AU with me. The basic premise is one that, at base, is simple and a bit cliche: Summer is evil instead of being good. Again, I know it's cliche and doesn't sound interesting, but it's where the butterfly effects down the line that things start to get interesting.\n\nBasically, Summer was found on the streets pretty young and raised in Salem's court. becoming a pretty powerful weapon for her to use. When Summer was seventeen, she was sent to be an insider in Ozpin's court and feed information back to Salem. STRQ still formed and she ended up partnered with Qrow in the forest. This eventually led to them falling in love with her having Ruby. She left shortly after Ruby was born, leaving Qrow as a single father to raise their daughter along with helping Taiyang raise Yang after Raven left. About a year later, though, Summer and Qrow met in battle in the tribe's territory and she injured him to the point he had little choice but stay and be cared for by them. He requested Taiyang raise Ruby as his own daughter.\n\nFast forward about eleven years and Ruby realises she looks nothing like Taiyang and Yang and learns the truth about her heritage. She meets Qrow and Raven and ends up interested in her tribal heritage and becomes extremely involved with them for the next three years. (In this universe, the tribe actually has a cohesive history and culture and isn't just a bunch of random people banding together as bandits, but that's a whole other can of worms). She ends up becoming very loyal to them, but she remains with Taiyang and Yang during the winter, but she spends basically the entirety of spring, summer, and fall with the tribe. She's set to join them entirely after she graduates Beacon, but until then, she's allowed to travel back and forth.\n\nSo now that the exposition dump is over, what is this RP about?\n\nI'm looking for someone to play out this AU with in terms of how different it would be from normal canon. I want a few of the plot points will remain the same (definitely the Fall, possibly the Breach at the end of V2, the dust shop robbery), but other than that, I'm admittedly really open to how the plot should progress. \n\nWhat am I looking for in terms of a partner for this? \n\n* Someone that can obviously throw suggestions for plot around. It doesn't matter how crazy the idea is; I'm willing to roll with anything within reason. \n* Someone that can double at least Weiss and Blake and possibly more people. I don't want to have all of Team RWBY because that'd kind of defeat the purpose of an RP like this. I mainly want to RP Ruby and can handle Yang, but if you think you could work within this framework with her, then I welcome you to do that. If you can handle people more than Weiss and Blake, that'd be even better. It's not necessary *at all* but it'd make things overall more enjoyable for me at least. About the only characters that I need to have are Ruby, Raven, Qrow, Summer, and Salem. Anybody else is fair game. I can also handle almost any other major character in the series sans ones like Jacques and Adam.\n* Being able to write at least 1-2 solid paragraphs. Personally, I tend to only write about 1-2 paragraphs on average myself, so I'm not gonna push for novella. I just need more to work with than the absolute bare minimum of dialogue, tag, action. \n* Laid back about shipping and not trying to force anything. I know people have their preferred ships. I'm no different. I'm also an ardent multishipper because it's fun to leave options open and allow things to progress naturally. It doesn't have to be the focus of the RP; I just wanted to say that it's a possibility. I don't want to get into a debate over what ships are best. I just wanna write things that are fun, unique, and interesting.\n* On that, I would prefer a 21+ partner but I'm open to 18+. Mainly just in case things get a little bit hot at some point. \n* Do your characters deviate from canon minorly to majorly? I don't care. As long as they're still somewhat recognisable, we're good. Plus, this is a pretty heavy AU anyway. Ruby's still Ruby and Yang's still Yang, but they're really different. \n\nSo about me:\n* I've RPed too long and I'm honestly *super* chill because of it. If you're a beginner and can write the characters well, that's great. If you're a veteran and can write them well, that's great. I absolutely *do not care* about your experience level. As long as you're clearly putting your best effort forward and respect me, the characters, and the source material, we're golden.\n* I'm 26 and in EST.\n* I'll only be willing to do this particular RP over Discord, email, or Google Docs. \n\nI know this was one hella jampacked post that was intimidating, but I hope it doesn't discourage anyone from asking about things! I really want to play it out!\n",

It's one of the most enjoyable ideas that I have personally played with, so I wanted to see if anyone wanted to join me in the idea. \n\nI think the normal idea is where I want to land. Being on the run constantly, fighting zombies and people out in the world, searching for supplies constantly, etc. \n\nNow, I personally am a hopeless romantic, so a love-interest or romance in the plot, is something that I am usually a pretty big fan of. With that said, in real life, and my characters are heterosexual, so if you're also a fan of romance, females are my preference. If you can care less about romance, that's cool, and where the 'A' in the header above come into play. If you are however interested in romance (or more than that) be 18+ please.\n\nMy play style:\n\n\\- 1st person (for immersion)\n\n\\- 1-2 paragraphs roughly \n\n\\- Semi-lit (not perfect grammar, but pretty close to it\n\nYou can play in any person you want to, I just enjoy first person. I'm not expecting the best writer of all time, just someone to try and give the story so content. I will usually match my partners style. \n\nThis may have not been the most sound description ever, but theres so many paths we can go down.

If you're not into indulging in AND enjoying these themes, than this is not for you. No compromises.\n\n\n~ The year is 2037. We live in a world where there are people born with special abilities. Mutants, if you will. Albeit very rare, the common population and government are scared of what they don't understand. What do they do instead of getting to know their counterparts? They lock down their cities and outlaw the presence of mutants within city limits. The civilians that sympathize with mutants are charged with betraying the US and executed, leaving no tolerance for anything mutant related. \n\n~ We live in Stormport. A city that is as dreary as it is dangerous. The crime rate is high, it's raining 90% of the time, and there are MCF (Mutant Control Force) patrols everywhere. It's like a more urban, modernized Gotham City if you're into comics. But you know what? We call it home. We mutants.. call it home. You and I, along with three of our good friends (Who are also mutants.) live together in the grungy part of town inside of a cheap apartment. We're young. We live life. Going to trashy parties. Smoking. Drinking.. among other vices. It's all about having fun for us. Here's where the path branches. We could decide to turn over a new leaf and use our powers for good, Use them for our own personal and selfish reasons, or just cause pure havoc and try to take over the city. Maybe we could just have regular drama like pregnancy, or addiction. Hell, we could even turn ourselves in after an accident of some kind. \n\n~ I would like for our characters to have a really close, fun, flirty, and inseparable bond with each other, as they've known each other for 5 years. It could be more, like FWB or a relationship if you would like. Just specify. Please note that if we just have the close bond, it will eventually lead to heavy romance.\n\nMessage me on Reddit so we can move to another platform.\n\nYou WILL need a character with a reference picture or detailed description complete with your power.",

            "selftext": "\nHello there, and welcome to my post. I'm glad that the title alone was able to catch your attention. Well, as you could see from the title, I am looking for something detailed, long term, and written in the third person point of view. It's happened more often then I would like where someone has still tried roleplaying in first person, but please understand, I will correct you. If you still continue, we can not continue. I have requested third person from the beginning, I won't be changing my mind on the matter. Please know what you are getting yourself into. Haha. This includes being detailed! Some people still think I mean just a handful of sentences, but I don't. I mean a few paragraphs worth. Or, if you prefer, one giant paragraph/wall of text. I can do either you prefer, but it has to be detailed. No exceptions unless it's just dialogue. Even then, I'm not going to accept three sentences or the like. There is always more you can write about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, now that we have that out of the way, I really want something that involves romance. I don't have any ideas in mind, but we can always come up with something together. At the moment, I'm really looking for a gay roleplay, but if you come with an idea I like, I would be willing to do a straight one. I'm just running out of inspiration for it because most people want to do straight roleplays when I say that I do both. Anyway, I just about always stick to a realistic setting, normally modern but I can also do medieval. I don't like anything historic based, sci-fi, steam punk, apocalyptic... None of it. If you really want something with fantasy, please don't make it excessive, or I can tell you now, it's not going to be something I'm interested in. I like doing things I can at least relate do. Can't exactly do that with giants, mermaids, and wizards. I personally don't know any, not sure about you. Haha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure that's all I have to say on the matter. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to message me! If you're interested in roleplaying, then I beg you to message me with your Discord tag so I can send you a friend request there, and we can get started right away! Don't worry about writing everything out on Reddit, I would much rather we discuss everything through Discord when I can actually respond to you at a reasonable pace. I hate trying to have a conversation through reddit, because I don't get notifications from it unless I constantly refresh the page, and that's just tedious. So, I beg of you, LEAVE YOUR DISCORD TAG IN YOUR MESSAGE. If you don't, you will not be the first person I respond to. I will prioritize those who actually leave their Discord Tag. I can't promise I'll be able to respond right off the bat to anyone, but you should expect a friend request coming your way within a few hours. I literally have nothing better to do. Haha Have a good day, even if we aren't a good match!",

Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n \u2022 I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n \u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n \u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n \u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\n \u2022 Real Life Romance\n\n \u2022 Fantasy\n\n \u2022 Sci-Fi\n\n \u2022 Mecha\n\n \u2022 Halo\n\n \u2022 Elder Scrolls\n\n \u2022 Destiny\n\n \u2022 Superhero\n\n \u2022 Apocalypse\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon!

I'm looking for some RP partners to share some of my original(ish) ideas with or to just shoot the shit and come up with something together, which is something I find a lot of fun. I'm honestly super chill to just chat ooc too, either about possible new ideas to happen in the rp or whatever's on my mind at the moment, because I'm always down to make a friend as well as a new RP buddy. For last, I'm also cool with a majority of topics and other stuff. I'll give a list of.. rules I suppose, and then a bunch of stuff I like. \n\n&gt; I\u2019ll only RP on and, preferably, Discord. Fastest would be Discord.\n&gt; Being the age I am, I'm looking for others over the age of 18. This is, of course, mainly do to the fact I do allow NSFW and very heavy, dark topics that can come up.\n&gt; Going on with NSFW; I'm good with a lot of kinks. Just ask first because everyone has things they are comfortable and uncomfortable with. Also, kinks won\u2019t be inputted into every character I have/make, everyones got different tastes.\n&gt; I am not picky when it comes to gender either. I myself am female and can RP as... well, anything frankly. Doesn't matter to me. Same when it comes to potential pairings, I'm fully comfortable when it comes to straight pairings or LGBTQ+ pairings.\n&gt; Partner wise, I like someone who's active. I understand life happens and there can be a day or two when you can't reply, because it happens to me. School, work, etc. \n&gt; I also prefer a partner who can be detailed. Length isn't something that I'm picky with because I will try to match what you put out, as long as it's not something lazy and two sentences. (I understand a lot of scenes regarding nsfw topics and fighting wise can be shorter) As a preference, I ONLY do Third-Person and I only use my own OC's as well. I do have a few... fandom character's as well. I just don't find enjoyment in playing canon characters.\n\nBack on track after that long ramble.. here's a few things I enjoy in my roleplay!\n\n&gt; Modern, Real-Life Romance, School setting, etc.\n&gt; Fantasy, High Fantasy, Magical, etc.\n&gt; Sci-fi, Neo Tokyo, etc.\n&gt; Apocalyptic, abandoned worlds, etc.\n&gt; Historic, Medieval, etc.\n&gt; Anything with Japanese lifestyle and culture (sorry not sorry)\n&gt; [Fandoms] Pokemon, Dramatical Murder, The Last of Us, Sonic, Assassins Creed, Catherine, Persona, many others.\n&gt; Whatever ideas you might have!\n\nWell, if you got this far, I\u2019ll be quite shocked.

A world where werewolves, vampires, and the rare bit of ritual magic clash with the neon glow and cybernetic upgrades humanity had been expecting.\n\nPlayers are free to join Division, a government agency responsible for investigating supernatural-based crimes, the mega-corp Argus, an entity whispered to be funneling resources into preserving humanity\u2019s place in a world quickly outpacing it, or make their own way as an independent character or in one of Seattle\u2019s many gang factions (several of which are player-created and run!) We encourage the creation and pursuit of a personal narrative for everyone's character, and try to make it easy for them to progress and develop as they see fit, so long as what they have in mind is within the rules and lore, but we do allow some things to bend a little bit as long as it doesn't allow for an OP character.\n\nWhile we encourage freedom of choice with characters. However, this doesn't mean there is freedom of consequence. We like to keep things here somewhat realistic, and there is always a chance for repercussions if you make a criminal type. This universe is heavily monitored and has heavy law enforcement. Your character **can**be caught, and **will** be caught if things get carried away. However, you will be contacted directly before anything is done, to ensure that you understand why, how, and how long, ect.\n\n(We are currently looking for active **Argus** and **Division** members)\n\nOur server features a detailed catalog of lore for the setting and a work-in-progress timeline from present day to 2175 to help players looking for world details they can employ to fully immerse their character creations into a setting populated by all walks of other players. We even have a map, featuring the general locations of all the places featured in RP channels.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our luck to have a relaxed, friendly community of players who are always more than happy to help a new member or write a new scene (no worries about being out of the loop!) New members are expected to treat others with the same respect, and are encouraged to contact a mod on the side if they have an issue with another player (so far we\u2019ve been very drama-free!)\n\nWhile this server does not have an age limit, we do warn new members that due to the tense nature of many story lines content may be regarded as 18+. NSFW content is to be left to private messages between the players involved, but violence, gore, strong language, and drugs are allowed in general server channels.\n\nJoin us for some roleplay fun, all experience levels are welcome!\n\n[https://discord.gg/6kwzyvg](https://discord.gg/6kwzyvg)",

            "selftext": "Hey!\n\nThis is basically a shout-out post to anyone who is willing to RP. I use Discord primarily. I understand the fact that most people already have an established RP group or partners that they write with and the last thing I want to do is interfere. I understand if people just ignore this and don\u2019t reach out. I get it. Writing with someone new is always challenging at first as you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re like. It\u2019s easier to write with those that you\u2019ve come to know really well and made friends with. And there\u2019s also the fact that I have anxiety and I\u2019m terrified of approaching people and annoying them.\n\nSo this is why I\u2019m making this post instead and anyone can reply or drop me a message if they\u2019re interested!\n\nBasically looking for anyone willing to RP Tony Stark with my Pepper. I have written for both Tony and Pepper before although I do prefer Pepper. I have a good few years RP experience and have used various sites though things have slowed to a halt for me to the point where I don\u2019t RP much these days except with one person. I use various apps as well and that can be discussed to choose whichever is preferable. I\u2019m honestly very laid back when it comes to RP and I\u2019m fine with most concepts as long as both of us are comfortable. And of course, having fun!\n\nThis can simply be a platonic relationship. We can discuss matters and decide if we want them to be romantically involved.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t mind writing some NSFW I do prefer actual storytelling and working on a plot. I\u2019m also from the UK, 21+ and I\u2019m fairly quick on replies. Though replies will be slower during the week while I\u2019m at work. I do prefer para/multi para to one liners.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid to contact me! I\u2019m the least threatening person ever. If you are interested just let me know and we can discuss further! All I\u2019m looking for is having fun, making sure whomever I write with is comfortable and also having fun, and making new friends along the way. \n\n**Please only message if you genuinely want to write. Recently on here people have just been wasting my time, waiting till I\u2019ve worked on a starter to get the story going to decide to block and remove me as a friend, after long discussions on how we\u2019ll go about starting things off. Oh, and having also mentioned how they hate being \u201cghosted\u201d yet doing the same thing to me without giving any reason. So please, all I ask is that you only message if you are going to be writing long term.**\n\nI hope to write with some of you soon. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "Mary had suffered incrediable heartbreak during her early childhood, when her father and brother had died during a fishing expedition. She waited days and nights for her father and brother to return home, however she knew that the sea had taken them to her depth like it did with her grandfather. She was left to look after herself, forced out of childhood and into adulthood in order to survive. Her mother had completely given up, deeply sadnened by her husband\u2019s and sons death. She lived with her mother in Scotland, on a small coastal village. The citizens of this village all lived in stone huts, which were all identical. They were round, dug deep down into the rocky soil so the lower half walls were dirt and the upper parts were rocks fitted together, with the cowhide across the doorway and the smoke hole above the fireplace. There hut was positioned on a grass hill, looking down at the beach. There was a wooden fence that surrounded their property. The cow they owned was tied to a fence post, to stop it from eating the barley. Every house had a large barley field, as it was easily obtained and was their main source of food. The people mostly lived on barley cakes, dried fish, and milk, with the occasional boar. When she was fourtneen, her mother fell off a cliff while looking for quail eggs. Mary felt nothing when her mother died. However heartless that made her, she didn\u2019t care. Her mother had never been there for her when Mary needed her the most, and therefore they had become distant, as if they were strangers. She had now come under the care of her aunt and uncle, however she stayed in her home by the shore.\n\nOne day, when she had finished taking her cow to the chiefs bull, she walked back down the hill in the afternoon light. Her dark red hair flowed behind her as she walked. Mary froze when she spotted a corpse lying a few feet away from her. This wasn\u2019t an elderly, and by the amount of blood coming from the body made her think this wasn\u2019t an accident. It was against the law to kill another person without a proper trial beforehand. A distant scream made Mary shake. There were invaders, she could see it now, giant men and woman fighting her neighbours, and friends. Mary wanted to intervine, to help, but what help was she to men with iron swords. Mary looked around her, and ran for cover behind a rosemary bush. Mary screamed as she felt a firm hand grasp her arm, and pull her out from behind the bush. She tried not to show her fright as the giant foreginer pulled her back to their longships. She didn\u2019t know what was going to happen, but she would try everything to escape..\n\nHello there!! Thank you for reading all of that. So if you couldn\u2019t tell, this is a Viking themed role play set in 900 AD. Your character is the man that captured me after their raiding party was caught in a storm, and washed up on land. I want your character to bring my character back home with you to either be a thrall (slave) to help around the house and eventually grow a relationship with, or your character could force Mary to become his wife after bringing my character home. Now, for either of these choices, I always want your character to more of a \u201cAlpha male\u201d type of man, who demands respect and believes what ever he orders should be obeyed. I want him to be possessive, angry, and perhaps deeply disturb. This role play isn\u2019t really for the type of man who believes that after you capture someone, everything will be absolutely perfect. I want our characters to hate each other, I want my character to be afraid, and I really want to bring out the angst in this role play. I don\u2019t mind if there\u2019s violence in this role play, as I\u2019d like for the Viking image to be portrayed properly. That goes to say that I don\u2019t want him to be completely harsh all the time, he can have a gentle side. Keep in mind that I want a character who is literate, 18+ and is able to keep the role play going and alive. I also don\u2019t want to be the one doing all the work, so I want a partner who can develop the role play. \n\nIf this is a Roleplay that you would be interested in, please message me on here and we can exchange info. Unfortunately I only use discord, nothing else. From there on we can discuss anything we need to add to the prompt, our characters, and then start. \n\n\n",

I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons, so bonus points if you're familiar with the race and class systems. To sum up the fantasy I'm looking for: Tolkien-esque, magic and mythos, action packed! Although this is my preference, I'd also be down for anything Sci-Fi, Apocalypse/Dystopian, etc.\n\nA little bit about me, as a writer: I like to focus a lot of my writing on creating dynamic characters and strong visuals. Character relationships (in general, not strictly romantic) is something I hold dear, so I'll work my butt off to compliment yours. Whether that means a slow-burn romance or a friendly rivalry, I'll try my darndest. I've been roleplaying and writing for 6 years, and I feel as though my experience shines through!\n\nFor my own comfort, please only contact/DM me if you're 18+ (I am 19, myself). Thanks for reading!",
