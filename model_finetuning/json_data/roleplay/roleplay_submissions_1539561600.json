            "selftext": "*This is not related to World of Warcraft*\n\nFor many years a war was waged by monsters and undead creatures against humans, elves, dwarves, and many other creatures. A prophecy spoke of the Lich King being reborn in a human with a pure heart, so a woman with a pure black heart brought herself to the undead man in hopes of ending the war, but he refused to take her body and then killed her. But, a human baby was born and the Kind suddenly vanished. For 16 years people feared his return, expecting a even worse war was coming do to a pure evil child with the King's ability to control the dead... *but the prophecy never said the child would be pure evil, just pure*\n\nI was sitting outside on a cool night, gently petting a cat that had started to stay near my home. Dispite working on the farm I was a pale boy with jet black hair, one light blue eye and one green eye that made people nervous, but everyone in the village tried to treat me like they would anyone else. I knew I was different but... something always felt off with my father as I grew older before he one day said \"Lad... it's time for you to head into the world and find *yourself*\". Before then I had never left the village but I had dreamed about it my whole life, so it wasn't long before I was leaving the village, unaware of how dangerous the world was or of what I was capable of...\n\n\n\nHello! As you can tell I'm wanting to do a roleplay where I play as a character who is going to be the new lord of an undead army, The Lich King. At first he'll only be able to control one damaged skeleton but will soon lead an army of undead and be the king of monsters, but the true question is will he be good or evil? Will his human side shine in his darkest hour or will he fall into the darkness of his necromancy and his past life? I'm really looking forward to seeing anyone interested in my idea! \n\nAlso, if you want to be a DM (dungeon master) and you want to make this similar to DnD please tell me! And if you like how my idea is but want to try something else I'm more than happy to chat about rp ideas with you\n\nAnd while I'll use Discord I greatly prefer Kik ",

I love witty and interesting dialogue, and I\u2019ll always try to incorporate that. Right now I\u2019m kind of craving a romance plot, possibly antagonist x protagonist, but we can figure that out as we swap ideas. Really, I\u2019d just like to hit the ground running with writing. It\u2019s my favorite way to express myself and distract from my ~ daily grind ~, which basically just entails a 9-5 job. \n\nI don\u2019t care much about what the plot entails, and I\u2019d love to workshop it out with you. I don\u2019t do full NSFW either, just as a quick warning. \n\nMy typical experience is playing opposite another female who plays male characters. Honestly, I would prefer this scenario. I already have an OC in mind, but I will tailor aspects of her personality/appearance based around the needs of the RP. \n\nI do enjoy fandoms such as The Legend of Zelda, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Miyazaki universes, etc. I don\u2019t watch much anime, so I wouldn\u2019t be good for that sort of thing. \n\nPlease PM me for more information, or if you would like to swap contact information",

I love details, but that doesn't mean you have describe everything with a couple of paragraphs! I'll be happy with a simple description as well! Reply length isn't a super big issue for me. I can easily do 2-3 paragraphs per reply (given proper time, of course.) I don't mind if your replies are shorter/longer. I'll try to match your reply length! As long as you aren't constantly putting out one line responses, I'll be happy! \n\n- Someone who has a nice awareness of the show. I absolutely love RWBY, and I have a nice amount of knowledge about the show. You don't need to know every single thing about the characters of the show! As long as you have a general idea who the characters are, it'll be fine. I'm not too much of a stickler about how you make the characters act, either! I would prefer if you have watched up to volume three, however. Most ideas I have in mind would be in an AU, or simply before the end of volume three. Note: I don't mind if your male or female irl, as long as your alright with playing female characters!\n\nIdeas I have in mind:\n\nAlright, so these are all generally vauge ideas, they are that way on purpose. I'm open to whatever input you have about them, or any changes you'd like to make to the plot. Also, I'd love to hear your ideas if you have any!\n\n- My character would be a thief in Vale.  Eventually caught, but instead of being sent to a detention center, the headmaster of Beacon Academy has a better idea. He would be put under the watch of one of the teams of the academy. It could be team RWBY, JNPR, CFVY, Cinder's \"team\". Heck, I'd even be willing to give a team STQR approach. (They would be a bit younger, of course.) Maybe of unique team, composed of various different characters?\n\n- Same character as above, different scenario. What if all of the main cast of the show were put in one large house? Chaos would ensure, definitely. Chaos that my character would be thrown into. I'm pretty open to any character roster for this!\n\n- My character would be a new student to Atlas Academy. A bit of a troublemaker, until an dust incident results in him being put under the watch of Winter, much to his dismay. ((This could be done with Raven, Glynda, or Pyrrha as well!))\n\nSo, that's about it for now. If your interested, pm me! I look forward to hearing from you guys! ",

Also, the point of this is Romance too. I am fine with any pairings, except FXM. Though I am fine with doing FXF, MXM, and MXF, that's really the only point I can stress. I would like development, not our characters instantly in love or anything like that, a crush is different. I am open to your ideas as long as you don't control and force my Role. \n\nI do plenty of Fandoms, I have been Roleplaying for five years now and I can say I am very literate. I strive for that, makes everything better for me. I don't mind smut, as long as it's plot driven. I do love a dark Roleplay, but if anything like that doesn't suit you then tell me.\n\nI Roleplay Naruto, Pokemon, Marvel, DC, Last of Us, Avatar, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Legend of Korra, My Hero Academia and Teen Wolf. I can play canon Characters, we can also mash together ships that don't exist too. I also love themes with Supernatural. I always wanted a Werewolf Roleplay, or even a Vampire Roleplay would sound good to me. It is a great outlet for me, and don't forget to list your themes too. Or any you were interested in.\n\nWhat I look for in my Partners I wish for them to be understanding of lives. We do not always have free time, and business does come around eventually. Try to accept that I won't always be here 24/7 to Roleplay. Another, being literate and creative is a must I can only find find motivation if my partner is doing their best in a response. I do understand some areas will be shorter given the ordeal. I'm pretty laid back, so it's hard to bother me. \n\nLet's not shy away from OC either, I'm more than happy to create one with you! So if you're moderately interested, give me a message. Within the message, tell me about yourself a little bit and what topic you wish to Roleplay in. \n\nP.S I only use Discord! ",

            "selftext": "The dragon Knights were a formidable force, mainly centered in Orsis, and fought primarily in the first calamity war, though the use of the dragon golems were used sporadically in other wars, and one of the oldest was rumored to be used alongside the magi.\nDragon golems themselves are massive undertakings of craftsmanship and magic, a fusion of rare metals, and the still beating heart of a very ancient dragon. The massive humanoid construct is adorned with the scales of the dragon, and a weapon made from its bones, as a symbol of respect to the beast. It requires an entire lifespan of mana to use, and because of that, dragon Knights are linked to the golem, until retirement, forfeiting their mana so the golem can move and fight.\n\nHowever, it has been suggested that someone with near flawless mana control, or alternatively, a special type of aetherium could theoretically be used as a buffer and an amplifier, allowing the knight to possibly use magic alongside their golem. In recent years, golems have been seen using an array of armaments, most notably, a powerful, and primitive mana based weapon. Not a lot is known about this weapon just yet, other than its ability to erase entire platoons of armored Knights.\n\nA golem hasn't been made in several decades, as the dragons themselves have disappeared off the face of earth. However, there have been rumors of a young man searching for a dragon, to create his own construct....\n\n(Hiya! If this interested you, I'd be more than happy to try and figure out something! I would like to mention that this will be primarily a romance/adventure RP, with sporadic action here and there. That being said, please, go ahead and pm me! That's all, for now at least. Have a good day! Err, and before I forget, sorry for the blob of words. Mobile formatting is awful.)\n\nEdit: please, only contact me through PMs. I won't be answering comments on this.",

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nI am looking for a GM to play out unusual freeform RP ideas. These ideas all involve action and thinking, but they vary greatly in execution so feel free to tell me which one you like:\n\nMy favorite idea is based on Shadow of Mordor/War and High Fantasy. I want to play a wraith-like being with mind powers and then grow in ability and knowledge through roleplaying. Mind control, mind battles, and such things are a key part of the RP.\n\nAnother idea I am interested in is based on Eador: Masters of the Broken World and Tone: The Rebellion. The idea is that the world has been shattered and now various wizards, warlords, and other creatures fight for control of the pieces, trying to unify them under their command.\n\nYet another I would like to explore is based on Tyranny. Here I would play an agent of the overlord during a new campaign, growing in power and influence until my character can challenge the overlord's authority and duke it out with said overlord, using fear and loyalty to achieve my character's ends.\n\nLastly, I would be willing to RP something like Homeworld or even playing as a phoenix, both are things I never had the chance to do and would gladly try to work something out if you are interested in them.\n\nAbout myself: I will not ghost you, although we might very well not end up matching well (I will tell you if this is how I feel as I will be honest with you in my criticism, if I have any). I tend to prefer scheduled sessions, but daily roleplaying is completely fine by me as well and I will not hurry you up - although I might ask you if you are busy or something. Finally, let me add I am fine with romance but it will not be the RP's focus if you want to include it, and also I have a profound distaste for dice - so if you only tabletop, please kindly look for someone else.\n\nIf after reading my post you find these ideas interesting, would like to try them or maybe something similar feel free to send me a message, I eagerly await your PMs!",

            "selftext": "Hi there! Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n- I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n- I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n- I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n- Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\n- Real Life Romance\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- Sci-Fi\n\n- Mecha\n\n- Halo\n\n- Elder Scrolls\n\n- Destiny\n\n- Superhero\n\n- Apocalypse\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

            "selftext": "Good evening, \n\nI am currently looking for a few more role play partners who love fantasy.  I love all kinds of fantasy, whether it\u2019s medieval, modern, low or high.  Some quick things you may need to know: \n\nI am in my mid 20s and therefore request my roleplay buddies be 18+. This is a must. \nI only do mxf pairings right now. I apologize. \nI\u2019m okay with any NSFW topics but I don\u2019t want them to consume the entire story. Plot and character development are key for me, otherwise I get bored. \nI am not picky about length as long as It\u2019s at least a paragraph and something I can work with. Do keep in mind though that I tend to write longer responses because I get very involved with my roleplays. \nI write third person, past tense and request you do the same. \nI prefer to double or triple. I will rarely agree to just play one single character. \nI only roleplay via email!! This is important as I see a lot of people requesting discorde. I apologize for any inconvenience this causes but this is my preferred method. \n\nI do not roleplay fandoms, only original worlds and ideas (but they can be loosely based off fandoms or existing universes). I have only currently have one modern fantasy plot/idea so if there is something you have been craving, don\u2019t hesitate to bring it up! I\u2019m down for pretty much anything and I love brainstorming. \n\nPM me if you are interested! I look forward to hearing from you! ",

            "selftext": "Writing is a major love of mine, being basically my main hobby, roleplaying especially. I would say I write posts for roleplays every single day, or at the very least I try to. It brings me such amazing joy and is one of the ways I express my love for something, including video games. I know to a lot of people, inserting original characters into existing universes is cringey and lazy but to me it's incredible fun. So I'm trying to find some people who also are okay with it and willing to play the canon characters to indulge in my cringey love for exploring new characters in existing environments and stories.\n\n**Some information about me:**\n\n* You can call me Steph, I'm 23 and married\n* I'm not picky about the gender of my writing partner, but I will be honest and say that writing anything NSFW with male writer partners makes me a little uncomfortable, I apologise in advance\n* I'm looking specifically for someone to write characters with me from the **Detroit: Become Human video game**, primarily Connor (RK800). While I'm not great at writing canon characters, I will gladly try so you can have canonxcanon interactions in our roleplays so you aren't writing all by yourself.\n* I'm looking to RP canonxoc interactions, with you writing as the canon characters, and like I said, me writing as any canon characters I can to make it more fun and easy for you!\n* Because of what i'm looking for, **I would prefer if my writing partners were 18+**, as I just feel weird writing and talking to kids, sorry.\n* **I have 12+ years of writing experience** on multiple platforms including: gaiaonline, tumblr, AO3 (very briefly), and some random forums. Gaia is where I'm currently doing all my roleplaying, but I want to do **these RP's on Discord preferably, but email is also fine.**\n* I am more than happy to provide you with samples of my writing if you so desire! I **would certainly like to see some of your writing** before agreeing to anything to make sure we'll match properly. Nothing sucks more than getting excited for a RP and then realising you and your writing partner don't, well...write together well.\n* I'm fine with AU's, plotting, angst, fluff, action, drama, pairings, etc.\n\nThat's about it really, I believe. If you're interested in giving me and my writing dreams a chance, just send me a DM so we can chat and figure things out! Thank you for your consideration.",

            "selftext": "Howdy, folks! Back again with another post seeking RDR2 roleplayers who either want to portray canon or OC characters in the gang. I can play Arthur Morgan or my own OC, who is featured in the starter/writing sample below. I am only seeking people who are 18 or older as this roleplay can and will feature some harsh topics, and if you want to do a romance or something, please know that I only do MxF pairings wherein I play the male character. Beyond that, though, I hope to hear from you! Enjoy the writing below! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n\u201cWe are forlorn like children, and experienced like old men, we are crude and sorrowful and superficial\u2014I believe we are lost.\u201d   \n\u2015 Erich Maria Remarque, All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nThe wind clawed at the old grey barn like a mountain lion on the flanks of an old, tired deer. No blood came from those venerable boards, only the groans of the tall building, the scent of hay long forgotten accompanied by the smell of a dozen or so cold bodies, men and women and a child, all huddled around one man whose stomach was red, far more red than the other pale flesh of his poor body.\n\nThe dying man was twenty years old, with a mop of red hair that drooped out from under the beaten down soldier's cap he often wore and waved around during the fireside dances and music that he so deeply loved in life. The voice that had once shouted and sang and hollered was now a threadbare whisper, his body both sweating with the exertion of remaining alive despite the shivering that made him tremble like a glass on a busy railroad track.\n\nThey had laid him on a few hay bales and placed a blanket over him, which was not pulled down to just at his waist, while an older version of him laid a hand on the belly full of buckshot. This older self was more lupine, with a strong nose and jaw, though the second was decorated with a beard with all the red and orange and gold that his brother's hair was, and that his own hair was, though his was pulled back in a mane like a lion.\n\nTheir amber eyes met, and words passed from one brother to another, two decades worth of knowing passed in an instant, and the dying man spoke up, using the last of his strength.\n\n\"Take me outside, Ulysses. I don't wanna die indoors.\"\n\nA murmur of something ran through the group, but the man named Ulysses only sighed and stood up. He wore a heavy and black woolen overcoat over a black and red flannel, which had been tucked into a pair of dark trousers laid over boots. The hint of a gun belt could be seen by the big buckle in the front, and he donned his hat, the black flat top and wide rim decorated with the biggest canines of a wolf on one side and a bear's crooked claws on the other.\n\n\"I'm gon' take him out.\" Ulysses said, in a voice like rolling thunder in the far distance, blessed with the old rhythms of Appalachia, a dialect not often heard outside of those mountains. \"Y'all stay in here. Don't wanna see nobody get sick.\"\n\nHe didn't bother dressing his brother, nor did his brother want to be dressed. Ulysses took the blanket off of his brother, and he scooped him up into his strong arms like a husband carrying a bride. The difference between them struck true. Ulysses was tall and broad at the shoulders, and his beard and burning eyes and dark clothes made him all the more intimidating. His brother had shrank in from the mortal wound dealt to him and the cold, becoming small and pale and closer and closer to a ghost in the days since Blackwater.\n\nThe two brothers left silently, into the howling blizzard, into which Ulysses ducked his head and against which his brother didn't even respond. He carried him up into the trees a dozen odd feet away, and then to the iced over stream, the snow coming up to his mid-thigh until he touched the bank. He sat his brother down at it, letting him look at the water. Ulysses then leaned down and pressed a kiss into his brother's hair, feeling it the one last time.\n\n\"I love you, Peter.\" he said into the hair, and Peter brought up one weak hand to touch his brother's face one last time before he let it fall back into his lap.\n\n\"I love you too, Ulysses.\"\n\nUlysses squeezed his brother's shoulder one last time and stepped back, his hand moving to the oak grip of his revolver, but something in his brother broke, and he fell back, his eyes rolling up into his head, a rattling breath leaving him. His body convulsed once, twice, tightening and then relaxing, tighten, relax, tighten, relax, and the glossy eyes rolled back around, amber looking into the void of the sky.\n\nUlysses watched the body until it relaxed the final time, and he stood there, tightening and loosening his fists, his face doing much of the same, as the silent tears left him, making his nostrils flare, his chin waver, and he rocked in place, trying to force it all back down, to take it later. He took in a deep breath and counted.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nHe exhaled and counted.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nHis brother was gone, but his family needed to eat, and he was one of the few who could hunt well. He could hunt best. He had to hunt better. He closed his coat and ducked his hands back into his thick wool-filled leather gloves, pulling up the black scarf around his neck until it covered his mouth and nose. He went back to the barn, pushing open the doors to concerned looks, soft apologies, and shock. He went to the wagon holding his things and pulled out his leather quiver and his recurve bow, bands of red at the top of the limbs marking it, to the learned eye, as being Cherokee in make. He held it by his side.\n\n\"Folks, we need food an' a fire. Who wants to go hunt with me?",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I'm looking for someone for a hopefully long-term partnership via email. A little bit about me: I'm over 21 and would like my partner to be as well. I work full time, and post at least once a day (more if I'm having a slower day at work). English is not my native language, but I have a pretty decent grasp. I write 3rd person, past tense, and most of the time write female characters. Totally understand if that's a deal breaker.\n\nI'm looking for a partner who's older than 21, okay with writing via email, and aware that real life comes first. I'd like someone who is okay with writing a few paragraphs per post and with a nice grasp on grammar and spelling. And, for this plot, willing to write a male. Your RL gender doesn't matter.\n\nA plot blurb: MC (my character) has woken up at home and found her husband dead and the crime weapon in her bedroom. She supposes she hasn't killed him, and that anyone could (he had quite a few enemies), but she can't prove it, since they were home alone when she woke up and last night's events are missing from her mind. Terrified of being accused of a murder she's not sure to be committed, she looks for a private investigator and enlists his help to find out what happened... before the police can draw their own conclusions or whoever finished her husband off comes for her next.\n\nDetails can be arranged, I'd like this to happen in the 20s/30s, and the location to be a cosmopolitan city, like New York or Los Angeles. \n\nIf you're interested, please PM me! Thanks in advance!",

I\u2019m looking for something maybe to do with the mafia and am hoping to come up with a interesting plot together. I do have a couple of ideas and would love to discuss yours with you.\n\nI don\u2019t mind whether you are also a veteran or if you\u2019re on day one, so long as you are going to write literately and try to contribute with character development and plot. I am a quality over quantity kind of girl. I tend to match my partners length and style, and am happy to roleplay in 1st or 3rd POV and on Kik, Discord or email. I also prefer to do original roleplays. I am up for NSFW content, but it should fit into the plot and be a part of the build-up of the relationship, not just thrown randomly for fun. \n\nI\u2019d be up for FxM (including F who want to play M), or FxF, so message me ladies, if anyone is interested. \n\nI look forward to hearing from people x",

A gate that typically, opens up in random spots throughout the infinite white room and leads you to another, brown door which will open to the universe of your choosing at the planet, time and moment of their choosing. By coincidence... of perhaps fate. Leading to a moment in history where the three would follow curiosity, boldly and speak to one another. The three spending not more than three hours with one another would decide to hold a bet and use the three of their abilities to start the game. A game where all comic universes are linked to a newly created universe and earth. Resulting in Thrae X. An earth 4x the size with a moon 4x it's original size as well. Everything else follows suit. On Thrae, cities from various comic verses of the main timelines were forcibly merged after being stolen. Places like new York was combined with DC's own Metropolis and placed on a mass of land of the new planet. Where new born heroes from various realms are born and can follow aid of canon characters existing currently within this new Earth.\n\nCome &amp; join us while we gather members and start a literate, long lasting experience!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/bKxR5kj",

            "selftext": "Hi guys! So, a little bit of background info on me, I'm a 23 year old girl from Puerto Rico! I RP on Discord and I'm on fairly regularly. I'm in between jobs at the moment so I'll be available for the majority of the day until I find another one! Even with a job, I do try to respond a few times a day during breaks or after I get home, so don't be afraid to send me a message! I'll be sure to respond as soon as I see it, or when the time is available to me if it's an RP post! With that being said, I do like it when my partner is the same. I'm not too demanding on that front, but since I have quite a lot of free time now, I'd like my partner to also be consistent (totally understand if not though!)\n\nRegarding literacy, I don't expect or demand text walls. I would prefer my partner to be literate and capable of keeping the rp going (and if for some reason you can't-- let me know! We can brainstorm no problem!) Also, communication is key! If there's something you don't like, uncomfortable with an NSFW portion, want to change, need a break or just want to brainstorm some new ideas, please don't be shy to let me know! I'm all about keeping a fun and entertaining experiencing, so please let me know!\n\nSo, phew, let's talk about the RP! I'm a big TES fan and recently I've playing the games in order and after getting my full of Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, I'm craving a game set during Skyrim! I'm looking for someone 18+ to play a male Canon character, or a male or female OC for my female dark elf. If you go for an OC, he can be Dragonborn or not; as a heads up, mine IS NOT Dragonborn, as her own backstory is quite different and has more ties to the Morrowind story than the Skyrim one. I can also double if you want to!\n\nThe canon characters I'd be interested in you playing as, if you choose to pair Canon x OC for my own are:\n\n-Farkas or Vilkas\n-Ondolemar\n-Brynjolf\n-Teldryn Sero\n\nAs I said, I do include romance, so it could stray into NSFW. Just let me know what makes you uncomfortable! \n\nThanks for reading and sorry for making it so long! PM me if you're interested and I'll give you my Discord!",

            "selftext": "Greetings and stuff ain't my thing so I'll just be to the point.  I've been RPing for 10 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. ~~When I say consistently available I MEAN consistently available.  I've been approached and then immediately ghosted for a  week+ after the first day by **several people** and it's getting REALLY annoying now.~~  It'd also be great if you didn't ghost me before even getting my Discord added, that's even worse.  I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\nRecently I have noticed a lot of people approaching me and either not knowing what I'm looking for in a story/setting or in a character as a whole and leaving cause they weren't getting what THEY were looking for upon being the ones to approach ME.  So at the bottom there's going to be a random little code word of sorts I expect to see in one's opening message that tells me they read this whole thing and actually understand what I am looking for/okay with.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a **Female** character.  Or if the person in question wants to be a DM/GM of a story in one of the settings I'm fine with, a focus being on female characters. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within a few tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters.  I also only do FemaleXFemale romances too. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.\n\n**Age Preference:** 18+ would be best. While I for the most part don't do smutty things. I've found it helps in finding more ideal partners. Character age don't particularly matter to me with that said. Although I'd prefer that the YOUNGEST anyone goes with is 14 (and that it remains entirely SFW if that is the case).\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** There's a number of fandoms I'm interested in and while with some I'm fine with both of us playing an OC or my partner playing a canon character, there are some fandoms I prefer to only play if the partner plans to play as a canon.  So as far as ones I'm fine with someone playing either one in it'd be: Pokemon, My Hero Academia, Dragonball Z, Splatoon or HunterxHunter.  As far as fandoms I prefer my partner at least playing a canon for it'd be: Little Witch Academia, Legend of Zelda, Skullgirls, Shantae, and Kingdom Hearts.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Terrene  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",

Since I'm playing Kassandra in game, I'm aiming to do so in rp and I'm looking for someone interested!\n\nA little bit about me: I have been role playing since I was about 11. Role playing is a hobby and a passion for me. I love replaying at least once a day, including rich insight into my character's thoughts and feelings. I prefer to role play via email and can use some instant messaging service for OOC (I prefer hangouts). As I like to flesh out every character with virtue and sin and quirks, I tend to need about one to three paragraphs to be able to express it. I prefer to write in third person and tend to gravitate to past tense, though the tense is rather irrelevant and will adjust to your preference. As for the relationships, I am happy with any sort of pairing, I love it all and will play any orientation and any preference, though I do have a preference for M/M, but I'm currently looking for F/F.  I also love to include NSFW scenes in a good role play and I'm profanity and violence friendly. As for the characters, I love playing both OC's and canon, but for this one I'm looking for canon mains. I double!\n\nNow, the actual thing:\n\nI'd love to hear who you'd like to play. As said before, I'm OC friendly and would love to hear about yours. If you have any canon preference, I'm likewise interested!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading this far and I'd love to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, I\u2019m Kong! \n\nA friend of mine, Insomniac, and I have created a Discord server dedicated to play-by-post longform roleplay that takes place within an AU of the My Hero Academia Universe. Over the years I\u2019ve been an admin for quite a few roleplay forums and servers that have seen quite a lot of success, attracting some minor celebrity attention from people like voice actors and sponsors like Roll20!\n\nThe way the server works is that you join the server and get to apply to play an **original character** within our universe, of which there are no canon characters in existence. Deku, All Might, etc. do not exist within our AU. At that point, after creating your character and getting it accepted, you\u2019d be able to build up your character through roleplays and self-contained stories via writing as if you were part of a literary \u201ccinematic universe\u201d. It\u2019s a **collaborative** storytelling server. Meaning that if you\u2019re here, you want to write a story in conjunction with your fellow users and create the best narrative you can. It\u2019s not just about you and your character, it\u2019s about the larger story you can create with one another. And most importantly, it\u2019s about creating memories and crafting relationships with your fellow users.\n\nSo what\u2019s the premise for our AU? Mostly the same kind of world, however, recently a series of benefactors have created an artificial island off the coast of Tokyo, Japan called the Itagaki Island Academy, which they have made into an international high school to train pro heroes. The best and brightest prospects from around the world have all been brought together for the first school year. And while we\u2019re getting this server started, you as users are required to either create a first year student in Class One or a faculty member on the Itagaki Academy staff. However, with time and more users , we will be opening up the world to include pro hero and vigilante characters not related to the academy.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to join, please click on the link below and we\u2019ll welcome you with open arms so you can get to writing!\n\nJoin Here: https://discord.gg/WQ626tN\n\nThanks - Kong",

Don't message me offering up Ronon or Sheppard, or any other non-Wraith, canon or OC. While I'm open to other Wraith aside from Todd, including OCs, I'm going to be prioritizing him over any others.**\n\n\n* My character will be human, though that's probably a big ol' *duh*. Her inclusion will turn things into a bit of an AU situation, but I promise it's not too far-fetched/out of line of SG:A's general feel.\n\n* As the title suggests, I'm currently looking for *Todd* the most and would absolutely adore it if someone could write for him against my OC. I *am* open to other canon Wraith, such as *Steve*, *Erik*, *Rhys*, and *Eddie* and most of the other named ones I haven't listed proper, within reason (there are some that're just great big *no's*, like Michael), and even *OCs*, particularly ones that are *based* (at least as far as appearance is concerned) on the ones I've listed. Shocker, huh?\n\n* Yes, **long-term** too. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy one-shot wonders. But, if you\u2019re no longer feeling the RP, I can understand the desire to stop. I can also understand life getting in the way of replying. Just tell me if you\u2019d like to stop, or if you might not be able to reply. Definitely try to give me a heads up if you won't be able to reply soonish.\n\n* I only RP over **Discord**, **Telegram**, and *very hesitantly* Skype. You might be able to convince me to use something else, but I can just about guarantee I\u2019m not gonna use email, and I'm *very tentatively* open to using notes/PMs.\n\n* I do expect **NSFW/Mature/18+/21+** themes. Plot and character development over *one particular gritty subject*, obviously, but it's still expected and not something I'm willing to gut. If you're not of age, then *please* do not contact me.\n\n* I don\u2019t have many limits, and the ones I do have are rather commonplace ones that I feel most people share. Keep in mind that while I don\u2019t have very many limits, I am still rather *plain*. I\u2019m willing to incorporate certain *things*, as I have a few of my own that I enjoy, and I\u2019m willing to listen to what you might like as well, within reason. Grittier details will (hopefully) be discussed after contact details are given, or in PM. \n\n* I RP *third person*, past tense, and am capable of cranking out 12-14 paragraphs. Sometimes *more*, sometimes *less*, but no fewer than 2-3 paragraphs. I *don\u2019t* expect you to match me, but please don\u2019t throw one-liners at me. I need something to work with, and it's super discouraging to crank out 6+ paragraphs and get practically nothing in return.\n\n* I love details, and I love fluff, but what I really adore is stuff I can genuinely reply to. Give me things that convey emotion and I\u2019ll love you to bits!\n\n* I can double or do a split RP of your choosing, if either would 'sweeten the pot\u2019. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Keep in mind that I'm a little rusty when it comes to writing for *two* main characters, but I will most certainly try.\n\nI\u2019m online more often than not, at all hours of the day, so catching me shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue.

I'm not always up to date on specific roleplay terminology, but i like to provide roughly 3 paragraphs for you to work with, depending on the given scenario. This is not a cap, simply a baseline. \n\nI am a fan a many a fandom and i am willing to do a watch trade: you want me to watch/read something, I will if you'll do the same. Additionally, genres of all sorts tickle my fancy, I'm sure we can build something together.\n\nIf you're the type to ghost, you need not inquire further. As the title suggests, this requires some level of commitment: I don't care for your first born son though, promise.\n\nGods, I always fear I've forgotten something in this recruitment posts.

I am 21 years old and I have been roleplaying for a few years now, writing is something I'm really passionate about and its something I just love to do, I'm looking for a long term partner to play out a realistic, romantic role with me. \n\nI do roleplay in first person past tense, No one liners, tend to prefer older guys 25+ but if you are younger still feel free to hit me up but only 18+ please, I also prefer guys who are dominant by nature but can still be very sweet as I'm very feisty I have a big mouth. My characters for the most part reflect me that being said I would love to play ourselves so no picture references from the internet.I do love the story of the roleplay and a good story always has drama so in the role there will be; Drama, Jealousy, Romance, Fights, Twists and turns to keep the story interesting. \n\nThis being a romantic plot will have a few NSFW scenes but this is to be discussed in Private. I don't have any specific roleplay in mind but I would love to come up with something fresh and new together so feel free to hit me up for my discord, thanks for reading \ud83d\ude1a",

I may be open to multiverse RPing too depending on the situation. Het pairings only.  I do fandom watch trades. Code word: Listen. Got some anime you are itching to roleplay from?  I'll give it a watch and play a char for you in exchange that you do the same. ",

Its a place the locals call Boston, and i should make my way to a place called Diamond City. The local wildlife is very simular to the creatures in the Mojave, minus the larger presence of Super Mutants. Once i get within the gates will record more, Ranger out\" hitting the button again stops the recording.

            "selftext": "America. The once shining pinnacle of justice and freedom, now reduced to a mere shadow of what it was. Once quirks started rolling around the human population, America welcomed this with open arms. But that was what got the best of them. They didn't really keep check on those with quirks. Quickly, a lot of urban areas were taken over by gangs with quirks in their favor. The police forces were blown away, even the military was in certain places. Slowly but surely America fell. Now ruled by corrupt people that have strong connections to mobs, gangs, and terrorist groups, it's basically a villains playground. it's not in popular opinion to be a hero there. Not like in Japan where it's a viable career path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there is one smaller school that mimics the U.A. in a few certain ways as it's a hero school. Given that it's only there to try and quell the presidents corruption, to make it look like he's actually doing something with his election. The far few hero's mostly designated there. And the students there, essentially are vigilantes under law. But, an olive branch from japan aims to change that. Reluctantly, the president accepts this offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo first things first, this is a My Hero Acadamia Role Play. Or it doesn't have to be, could be modified for straight OC play.\n\nSo I have a few different arcs for this. I have one where a portion of the class in the American school goes to Japan, to be trained by real hero's in a more professional environment. or a section of the main cast along with a good few hero's go to the american school to try and quell some of the corruption. Either way I have a character for this that I'll be using, and a few side characters from america to go along, hero's villains, and students alike. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can play either cannon or OC. All I really care about on your end is that you don't use asterisks when writing and no one-liners. Also that you can play multiple characters as I will be playing a good few characters as well. I can RP here, E-mail, or on discord. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way this subject popped into my brain as there really isn't a lot said about other countries beside Japan in My Hero Academia. So I thought about a few what if's. And this is what I thought about first. \"What happened to America? The Land of the free and home of the brave? What if it wasnt so free anymore or so brave?\". So I thought about this. So if you're willing to see this out with me, I'd love to talk with you.",

JUST DM ME :)\n\nI am  32  years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job during  the  week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is to  roleplay.  I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI   play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as   intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters   (IRL gender doesn't matter). \n\nPlease be prepared for picture   usage. I've done writing  descriptions for a while, but I am used to  visuals after playing in SLs  for many years. I would prefer someone who  is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real pics  (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some animated  pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter,  Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon Age, etc. Anything else unlisted is better to bring them my way and see if I know   them. If any above appeal, feel free to come my way. :)\n\nI  like some literacy at a minimum, third person only, past tense. I am  also VERY lenient with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I am very  nice, I promise, and I want to farm niceties out of people in turn. Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a chance!\n\nI do work during the day, so posting  will be sporadic, but I am good at night and on weekends/holidays for  regular posting. I am hunting for people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day or more.\n\nI am usually  on from  sometime in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you  want to  play sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours.  Hope to talk to all of you soon! :)",

For most of this time there were great divisions between the various species, each with their own tribes and civilizations. They didn't much like to interact with outsiders beyond absolutely necessary trade, and generally kept to their own business. Unless of course they were at war with one another.\n\nThis was all changed with the founding of the Victorian city of Arcadia. Arcadia was initially proposed as an idealistic experiment, in an attempt to unite the best and brightest of these various species in one community under a single government. The idea was that if they could grow and succeed together better than the isolated tribes could alone, it would cause a demand for similar growth across the world and cause real social change and inter-species co-operation.\n\nWithin this city is a black-ops organization known as Tartarus, used to crack down on crime without being seen by the public eye.\n\nSend me a message if you\u2019re interested!",

I have a dragon character and I\u2019m looking for someone to play the role of a human (or human-like creature) that befriends him! I have several different plots to share and choose from but either way, together, you and this dragon will hop between worlds, undergo perilous adventures and forge a bond unlike any other. Little but little, you\u2019ll piece together the mysteries of each other, this fantasy world, and undergo a heroic journey. If you\u2019ve ever dreamed of having a dragon friend and a world of your own, you\u2019ve found the rp for you!\n\nI would like to do a fantasy style rp that is detailed with consistent responses. \n\nI do have a few unique setting/plot to go off of, but I want this to be your world as much as it is mine. That means come prepared to world and character build with me! Share your ideas with me! No question or suggestion is bad! I enjoy world/plot building usually just as much as the rp itself! :)\n\nSome things you should know: I\u2019m quite the writer! I enjoy complex plots and character developments that make RPs personal and connected. I usually type at least a paragraph per response and expect my rp partner to be detailed too.\n\nALSO: I\u2019m looking for someone that is a dedicated roleplayer! This is going to be a complex, well designed long-term rp. I hope to rp just about everyday with timely responses. A rp just isn\u2019t as fun when you have to wait forever for your partner to respond. That being said, I\u2019m also really understanding if you have things going on one day or if life happens! \n\nMy time zone is CST and I tend to be very active in the evenings and nights. So if you\u2019re a fellow \u201cnight owl\u201d we\u2019ll get along just fine. ^.^ Most importantly, I\u2019m hoping to make a friend out of this! I always make friends with my rp partners. Let\u2019s be friends too!",

I will play as a male character that either is nerdy, doesn't get along with people well, or is new to town. You happen to take an interest to me, whether as a friend, or something more. Maybe you hang out with me, and maybe try to help me fit in. I know it sounds kind of cliche but we can throw in a twist here and there and I'm a fairly good role player. We can do long-term, and if we get tired of it, we can find a new role play idea. Please do not message me at all if you plan on ghosting me at any point. If you're tired of the role play, or you need to leave for a while please just let me know instead of straight up disappearing. If there's something I need to work on, let me know. please message me if you want to role play. I like kik the most, but I am flexible between Discord and maybe Reddit PMS if you're good enough. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope you'll show up! PS, if you're a male, but can play female, you're fine. ",

It is this reason I'd love to do an  roleplay about it.  I want the story to take place in the universe of  the original series, not the Fam the Silver Wing.  Now I can either play  a character from the show, or even one of my own characters I've  created, luckily most of them fit almost any role.  As for the plot  itself I'd love do discuss what would happen, would we follow the plot  of the original show?  Or perhaps create our own alternate plot instead?   Obviously I'm looking for people who know about the show, as for smut  I'm fine with it in moderation but if you're just looking for a smut rp  with no story I'm afraid I'll have to let you go.

I will be playing an OC of mine - the character Michael finds himself feeling confused and infatuated over. This may cause him to react in a number of ways, which is why I'm itching to play his love interest. \n\nI love all of the Halloween movies, so we can pick what point in the timeline we would play, or just come up with a completely alternative time line and setting. We can discuss plots, settings, character ages, characters, etc, meaning there are plenty of possibilities and routes our story can have. \n\nI would like our story to develop into some sort of romance sooner or later. I really want to explore various topics within our writing and I would like to have something long term.\n\nI will not reply to messages with poor grammar and/or messages that only contain 'hello' or 'hey'. I am searching for an experienced writing partner to create a fun story with. \n\nThanks!! ",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, how are you all doing today?  Good, I hope!  Anyways, let's keep this short and sweet, as it says on the tin, I'm seeking a female to help me satisfy my cravings for a DBS/Xenoverse and/or a Resident Evil kick that I've been having!  Only accepting 18+ due to the possibility of smut/violence/gore that will likely happen during the RPs.\n\nSo, onto the larger of the two cravings, which is the Dragon Ball one!  So, with the upcoming Dragon Ball Super: Broly movie, I've been super craving a RP where I take the role of Broly himself, but with a huge twist.  My current theory is that Broly truly will be redeemed in the movie, and might end up as a Z Fighter or at least an occasional ally.  Now, I'm thinking that, during the Xenoverse plotline, when Xeno Trunks wishes for a mighty hero to join the Time Patrol, the dragon responds by sending Broly.  I think it could be fun to have Broly learning to control his berserker rage while working for the Time Patrol, then keeping the power suppressing collar on him to help him gain control.  Given the family history, a gender bent Vegeta would be utterly amazing fo pair with Broly, but I would love to hear your ideas!\n\nNow, onto the Resident Evil plot.  With the RE2 Remake coming out shortly, I actually had the idea of playing Leon Kennedy opposite Jill Valentine.  I think the dynamic between a rookie cop thrust literally into hell on his first day would be a fun contrast against the seasoned S.T.A.R.S. operative.\n\nHope to hear from you all soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! My name is Adrienne. I am 28 years old and live in Canada, and I'm searching for someone particular. I'm searching for someone who is  interested in taking me on an exciting adventure through a unique and original world. \n\nI have been writing for 12 years and role playing for 5. I've had a lot of fantastic mentors, and have spent a long time creating my own settings and stories. But now I am wanting to take an intricate, and long term stroll through someone else's imagination.\n\nI don't mind going over things with you to help flesh out the specifics of our story, but I am specifically looking for someone who is willing to take the reigns on the narrative and be in control. I am hoping you are interested in long format posts of at least 2-4 paragraphs in length, and have a particular focus on those little details that make a setting truly feel alive!\n\nI would prefer some kind of fantasy or sci fi setting- I personally find slice-of-life style roleplays boring. I want *escape.* But if you have a particularly interesting setting that takes place in the real world, I am more than willing to hear it. You get instant bonus points if your prompt involves the occult/demons.\n\nPlease be 20+, I am not looking for ERP but I want the maturity and experience of an adult, and the ability to discuss what we want to explore. \n\nI prefer to stick to PMs on reddit, or email because of my desire for long format, detailed posts and the time it may take to make them. I am available extremely frequently and late into the night (Hence the time this was posted). I am open to using Discord if we happen to hit it off, and want to chat about more than just planning our Roleplay.\n\nIf this post interested you, please contact me! I am so eager to escape to somewhere new.",

            "selftext": "\nGood day!\n\nWe, at Midra Academy for the Gifted, have become aware of your certain predicament. You have a power, yet you don't know how to use it. Or perhaps, you are someone who is seeking shelter from the outside world, wanting for unique company just like you. Fortunately, for both of us, there is an opportunity waiting just for you. We have several students at our academy, already learning on how to use their powers. We not only have the resources, but the funds to take care of you and your powers, no matter how dangerous it is.\n\nWe truly do hope you come and join us!\n\nSincerely,\nHeadmaster Tesla \n\nNow for the technical information\n\nSo, you want to join our little roleplay? Well, I would be glad to welcome you into our fold! Of course, there are a couple of things to clarify before we can interview you, and yes, that is indeed a thing.\n\nWe conversate via Discord, due to it being a convenience for most of the people involved. We also try and reply via paragraph form, but that does not mean we necessarily reply with short stories every single entry. Just try to keep it decent!\nThat's all you need to know as of right now. Try to make your character limited and moderated. If you are permitted to join, there will be more information provided.\n\nWe are currently looking for students and a teacher.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/cHQXCYN",

I\u2019ve recently watched The Last Kingdom, and the Vikings again..and I feel inspire to do a role play prompt based around that genre.   I have done many viking themed prompts before, and I have spent years gathering an understanding of Viking culture and normalities, and I would prefer if my partner could have some basic knowledge on the Viking life as well.\n\nAs for the prompt, I\u2019d like it if we can discuss this together so that we both get a plot that we can enjoy, instead of having someone become bored because it\u2019s not their style. I would like this role play to have a romantic prompt, but obviously not without the angst and hardships.  \n\nI consider myself a rather literate role player with years of experience, which is why I expect my partner to be the same. I write in third person, past tense only. I can\u2019t stand people who write in first person, although that\u2019s my personal taste. \n\nI\u2019m a male looking for a female partner, that has an original character to give to the prompt. I\u2019ve always preferred my character to play a \u201cAlpha male\u201d role. I feel like everyone enjoys the role play more when the characters are historically accurate, from clothing to personalities, and roles. For example, a Viking male may be more rough, dominate, and distant towards others.\n\nIf you want a Viking themed RP, please message me and we can exchange contact information(for discord) and then discuss the plot we want to take and other small details.. Also please be working on your character description when you message me, so we can focus more on the prompt.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello! **General story spoiler warning for Persona 5**. If you haven't finished the game (Or at least gotten relatively close to endgame) I recommend avoiding this.  \n\n\nI'm not quite sure how to start this, so I guess we can go with some general information about me:  \nI'm 18, Recently graduated high school, And like to keep most sessions relatively casual. I don't have a mandatory post length, I just like to have some emotion and detail in replies. I try to be online when I can, which is pretty often, though I might have a few days of inactivity every once in a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for characters we're playing, I enjoy both my own and any OCs you wanna bring to the table. That said, I'm more than happy to play a number of the canon characters so long as you play a few too. Romance is welcome between any pairing you want, so long as it makes sense within the story. Same with any 18+ material you want to include- It won't be the main focus, but having these things around are perfectly fine with me.  \n\n\nAs for the story itself, I was wanting to set it after the Okumura Palace, but with some small alterations to the story-\n\nRather than being killed by the unknown assailant, President Okumura is placed into a coma once his shadow self is slain\n\nInstead of being blackmailed by Akechi, the Phantom Thieves decide to focus more on helping random civilians and stopping notable scumbags where possible  \n\n\nBasically what I'm going for here is a setting wherein the Phantom Thieves are still able to regularly act in public, without worry of a traitor, along with creating an environment that allows for public discourse about the Phantom's morality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm only being a bit vague about this because I want the story to be a little flexible. I have plenty of ideas for my character and scenarios involved (Such as a palace where he's recruited, a Persona, a set of strengths and weaknesses, and maybe even a love interest) but you're gonna be a lead character here, so I wanna know about all your character information and such before we commit to anything specific. If you have any ideas to throw my way I genuinely wanna hear em. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope to hear back soon\\~!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m just your typical college student looking for a writing partner to kill some time with. I\u2019d like to do a long term slice of life roleplay with romance. I\u2019m open to a variety of different themes/story prompts, however the one I had in mind was a simple college setting, boy meets girl type of situation centered around us being in a co-ed fraternity. I had a more relaxed/fun theme in mind however I am ok with more serious or darker themes if that\u2019s your cup of tea.\n\nNaturally having a long term roleplay with no overarching theme can be kind of hard, so we would have to be creative with the story. Again, if you have any ideas for the roleplay I am more then happy to give the reigns over to you, but some creativity will be required regardless. I can use 1st or 3rd person and can use email or discord. I would like a more rapid fire type of messaging, although obviously there might be breaks for real life stuff (for example Wednesday and Thursday we might send a bunch of replies but Friday and Saturday only a couple due to real life.) I like multi paragraph responses although depending on the scenario short responses can be fine. I\u2019m really just looking for a chill, fun roleplay that can be used to break up the monotony of studying.\n\nI know this is very open ended, but if you\u2019re still interested feel free to let me know and we can sort out the finer details before diving into the roleplay!",

I am not very strict on the requirements for that partner... the only thing I ask is a passion for writing.. the response length can vary depending on where we are within our writing: \n\n1.)\u201dNow you're king of the mountain, aren't ya, but it's all garbage!\u201d- This role-play is my newest role-play idea. Loosely based off of the contents of the popular retro-anime \u201cAkira\u201d, it would follow the story of our OC\u2019s and how they meet within this Neocity. Some of the teens in the city have been deemed as danger and classified with a mental disorder but in reality they\u2019re battling with the ongoing growth of their new psychic abilities which they often use to cause trouble with the city\u2019s martial law as well as with each other. They keep their powers hidden for the most part to maintain a normal appearance ( I.E. going to highschool , parties, etc). Plot is still in development so we can make this our own!\n\n2.) \u201cTitans GO!\u201d- This role-play feeds more into my own love for the teen titans and I wanted to create a plot around the day in and day out lives of the titans... we could play our own OC(s) who have been added to the team or we could plays as some of the titans ourselves evolving their characters in whatever plot we see fit.\n\n3.)\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the Winchester\u2019s\u201d- This role-play takes place within the realm of the hit-tv show \u201cSupernatural\u201d. I am a huge fan of the show and of almost every single character brought to life on the show either as hunter or hunted... why not write our own story based off of their rules. \n\n4.) \u201cWe ain\u2019t in Kansas anymore\u201d- This idea is actually the brainchild of my recent rewatching of two staple retro anime\u2019s \u201cCowboy Bebop\u201d as well as \u201cSpace Dandy\u201d. I thought the idea of my OC exploring all of time and space with another\u2019s OC for the exploit of currency would be fun . This plot is extremely volatile and we could discuss more details of this is a tune you\u2019re tapping your feet to.\n\n5.)  \"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed \u2014 or worse, expelled.\u201d- this Roleplay idea sets place in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, we don\u2019t have to necessarily write off the canon storyline but in fact create our own plot(s) within their \u201crules\u201d with our own oc(s). \n\n6.) \u201cThe world is full of monsters with friendly faces\u201d.- I wanted to dust off the old vampire cliche and create something new with a roleplaying partner who is interested in creating something different. \n\nI am extremely open to other ideas... these are just some I had kicking around my noggin. \n\nPM if interested!\n",

I will be playing an OC of mine - the character Michael finds himself feeling confused and infatuated over. This may cause him to react in a number of ways, which is why I'm itching to play his love interest. \n\nI love all of the Halloween movies, so we can pick what point in the timeline we would play, or just come up with a completely alternative time line and setting. I'm really looking to play with gore, psychological elements, and romance. You may choose however Michael may look, sound, smell like, etc - you are in charge of this character, so alter his appearance as much as you like!\n\nGround Rules:\n\n1) I only want experienced partners, please -- someone who\u00a0\ncan write more than a paragraph.\n\n2)  Please write in 3rd person, present tense.\n\n3) Lastly, please do not abandon the conversation without\u00a0\nnotice. I absolutely despise that. Of course, I'll understand emergencies.\n\nFinal Note: Please do not just say \"hello\". You will be ignored, if\u00a0\nnot blocked. Please introduce yourself properly and tell me what you're\u00a0\ninquiring me about. Thanks!\n",

            "selftext": "We all know the stories. The snooty princess falling in love with the simple peasant, the prince who finds love in the mysterious poor girl from his ball, all of this has been done and will be done because it is mostly fantasy. Most people today are shallow creatures who can't look past social status and wealth to see the true beauty. A beauty that, in no uncertain terms, may be hiding just under a thin layer of grime or a simple cloth hood. That's why we love these stories, because it makes everyone feel all gushy and warm inside. That's why I want to do something like this.\n\nThat's the base of this roleplay; a romance story that pits two people of slightly or drastically different social classes in the fighting pit of love. Everything else about this story is up in the air. A cyberpunk setting focusing on a CEO and their encounter with someone who leads a much more different life? A sci-fi centered space adventure involving exiled royalty enlisting the help of a smuggler to reach safety. A wild west/Jurassic setting where the laws of the land don't mean much to the residents living without the government, nor do titles. \n\nI'm open to it all and willing to assist in coming up with our setting, nothing is off limits to me. I obviously prefer fictional settings over non-fictional slice-of-life's but I'm willing to give it a shot with the right person. Maybe that right person could be you? If you still find yourself reading and are a literate, detailed partner we might be right for one another. We'll have to see.\n\nIf you're interested hit me up. If you aren't then good on you, I hope you have a wonderful day/night/morning/whenever you're reading this.",

I did have another account I used for writing, but after things got really cluttered over there, I've made this one to kinda keep things separate and more organized for my sake.\n\nI'm going to be honest in saying this isn't your typical search ad. Normally, I would try to condense things into a short little post, but I would then end up feel like I wasn't clear on certain things. So, I've written up a Google Doc that you can find below that lays things out in a manner that I'm happy with. \n\nLet me first off say thanks for reading through it. Fair warning, it's long, but hopefully by the end you'll get a pretty good sense of me as a partner. If at that point you think we'd be a match, just drop me a PM and I'll get back to ya!

I\u2019m based in the UK and am online practically all day (I always notify when I am leaving and when I am back). I\u2019m typically friendly, I like to natter if you\u2019re a natterer too; getting excited about RP concepts is my jam.\n\nI only write my own characters.

I have no problem with world building or leading RP story lines if your character(s) has depth.\n\nOkay, now for a biggie I\u2019m having issues with: I can and will write in-depth, detailed posts. Though I do not expect length where it is not due, I would like a literate roleplayer to actually capture their character, story and interactions well.

I will write two or more paragraphs depending on the situation of the RP - I am very happy to GM or whatever, but I really do love a co-made concept.\n\nNothing is too dark nor gruesome.",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here",

Anyways here is the starter~|\n\nAndressa Colombo, or Andi for short. \nMedium brown loose long wavy hair, with light blonde highlights. Light blue eyes, lightly-tanned skin, and freckles speckled across her cheeks and nose. She had a slim-thick body, that any guy would try flirting with her. \n\n-\n\nMy Dad is one of the greatest football coaches\u2019 at our school. Your one of the best football players on the team, and my boyfriend. Most guys tend to be jealous of you, hence that you were popular, buffer, and more good-looking.\n\nIt was the night of a big homecoming game, and you and the football team were practicing on the field, of course it was an away game. But you and the others had 3 hours before going to the game. \u201cAndi, make sure these knuckleheads are practicing, and staying out of trouble got it?\u201d my Dad said with a half-smile \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I just need to get a quick coffee break,\u201d He said before going inside the building. \u201cSure thing! I\u2019ll keep an eye on them.\u201d I smiled laughing softly.\n\nI was wearing a quarter-sleeve shirt, and a pair of yoga pants, alongside a pair of sneakers. I was half a tomboy, and half a girly-girl but you know I was more sporty as I was pretty good at playing football with you. And at running, as that\u2019s how I got in the track team....\n\n((Continue in PMs..~))",

            "selftext": "Hi! I usually get a huge overflow of messages from these, so **please** only respond if you're positive we would be a good match. Thanks! \n\nI'm a dude from the US and I spend my mornings working usually, leaving me the rest of the day to do just about anything I want! It's been a while since I've had a solid writing partner and I'm desperately looking for someone to fill that void! I'd prefer it if we were friends outside of our writing as well, because I feel that I write better with someone that I know rather than a total stranger. Hell, I'll even show you what I look like if that interests you! But, onto the reason why we're here...\n\nI'm a DM. For the uninitiated, that means 'Dungeon Master', which is just a term taken from tabletop RPG's. It means that I fulfill more of a storyteller role within the scene whilst your character is the protagonist of our story. You can lead your character to the heights of fame or infamy, or keep them in a low position. Regardless, it's my goal to create a beautiful and memorable story for us no matter what direction you lead your character in.\n\nAs a storyteller, I aim to provide realistic obstacles that make things severely more difficult for your character. I will harm the character if she makes bad decisions, although I will rarely go further than that when it comes to their health. My ultimate goal is character and story development!\n\nThat being said, I primarily only write original characters, and that is mandatory of you. I'd like you to be able to traverse a sandbox-type of world and create a life for your character, rather than just writing a little scene that they're apart of.\n\nI typically write several hundred words in a response, however I'll also reduce that significantly when the situation calls for it! I also don't mind rapid-fire dialogue sometimes.\n\nAs for a setting, I'm open-minded! I have no issues with writing in a Video Game universe, such as Fallout or Elder Scrolls. Of course, I wouldn't mind original settings or an Earth-based setting either!\n\nSome ideas:\n\n* A Crime-Drama sort of story where your character is either a member of Law Enforcement or an opposing criminal organization. This would ideally take place in modern-day earth, but it's up for discussion.\n\n* A Medieval Warrior style of story (similar to the game For Honor, maybe!) where your character fulfills the role of a soldier in a time of war. If your character is a female, we could either include themes of her hiding her gender or move to a light-fantasy/exaggerated setting. In any case, I'm a huge fan of Scandinavian, Roman, and Knight culture, so maybe we can mix some of that stuff in!\n\n* A Greek/Roman fantasy story that includes theme of cultural mythology.\n\n* An apocalyptic scenario in modern-day or near-future earth.\n\nI have plenty of ideas and I'd love to hear yours!\n\nI'll wrap this up soon, but I would like to mention that I do **not** put an emphasis on smut. I can not stress this enough. I have no issues with writing NSFW content, however, it is secondary to anything else. I'm absolutely fine with going into detail with certain aspects and even having an in-depth NSFW side to the story, but I refuse to write for the sole purpose of someone else's sexual satisfaction. Sorry!\n\nAnyways, if any of this interests you or you'd like to talk, send me a message!",
