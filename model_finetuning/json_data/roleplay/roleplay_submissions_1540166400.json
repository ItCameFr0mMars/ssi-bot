            "selftext": " \n\nHi there, This is a group dedicated to creating a fun and welcoming environment for all roleplayers. I want this roleplay to offer plenty of opportunities to its players to help create and shape the world around them for the sake of creating a fun and interesting story. Below, you'll find a bit of lore to help situate you so you can get a general feel of how things go down on this server:*\" In a small and quaint town basically forgotten (or at least overshadowed by all the other ones) deep in the heart of Utah, everyone seems to know each other's name and its so safe that some people can even sleep without having to so much as lock their door. However, this town is known for something else amongst its residents, as is the rest of the world at this point that sets it apart from our own: mythological creatures. You see, in this world, creatures big and small truly do exist and finally decided to make themselves known to the humans. However, there is one small catch: they aren't exactly liked by humans. Humans have always been top of the food-chain, they've always been able to adapt and overcome any challenges that they've faced as a species. Now that these \"mythos\" as they often refer to them as have come into their lives, they see them as simply another issue that is meant to be adapted to and overcome.*\n\n*The mythos tried to be nice to the humans, they wanted to basically be like neighbors with them. However, humans were fearful of them. Things soon escalated and now it's a bit cultural split between mythos and humans. The mythos are now essentially treated like second-class citizens if they so much as step foot into a human town or city. Some, are even captured as slaves and forced to serve under the oppressive rule of humanity. Things have even gotten to the point where anti-mythos departments have been establish for the sake of \"protecting the people from the threat of the unknown\" as they so claim.*\n\n*Of course, there are a few unspoken rules that applies to humans. For example, the dense forest that surrounds the forest is to be left alone. Any human that so enters it could potentially face certain death.*\n\n*Now, here we are. Be you mytho or human, you still have a life to live. Whether you try and create peace between the two opposing groups or instead prefer to keep old values intact and destroy all who oppose you is a choice all your own.\"*\n\nIf this is appealing to you in the slightest, please feel free to drop by and say hello! Hope to see you soon! Remember, this RP changes along with whatever decisions the characters of this RP make. I only jump in if things begin to get out of hand. Even right now, we're at the near finish of an event ran by one of our very own. This would be the perfect opportunity to come and create a character during this moment of down time between events and get to know the server a bit better.\n\nLike I said, I want this to be an environment where everyone can pitch about whatever ideas they like, so long as it fits within the general lore and rules.\n\nOtherwise, everything is up to you guys.The link to the server: [right here](https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw)",

            "selftext": "Hello there! So I have just remembered how much I loved the manga and anime of assassination classroom! And developed a love and crush on the character ry\u016bnosuke chiba (the quiet boy with long black bangs that covers his eyes) I have fallen in love with his character design and personality \n\nThe way the roleplay will go is, my character will transfer to class 3-E and are pretty shy but try to make friends with other kids and try to learn and make plans to assassinate koro-sensei before our class takes the trip to the city for a learning and assassination time, you are paired with ryunosuke and start to learn many new things about him and starts to develop a crush on him,..and it will go from there and end at the killing of koro-sensei. \n\nThank you all for listening and if you have a liking to the idea please don't be afraid to pm me about it so that we may talk, this is a roleplay I would really like to do with someone who really knows ry\u016bnosuke, so please don't be afraid to pm me about any questions or anything!..thank you again ~cheers \ud83d\udc9e",

            "selftext": "So, Hello. My name is Hannah (some may also know me as \"Alex\" but I go by Hannah now). I took a hiatus, and ended up actually \"ghosting\" a few people with good stories and relationships I loved. I'll start out by saying I am \\*incredibly\\* sorry for that. I have a damn good reason, though, and it was not completely in my control. That is, if you're willing to hear me out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that the scary part is out of the way, I'd love to get back into RP again. I'm at a better point in my life with lots of free time and am finding my passion for writing and other hobbies once more. I'll go over a few of my personal guidelines and few expectations, then provide a sample of my writing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo start I only RP with people 18+ just to avoid any drama. I am open to email, google docs or discord, but prefer discord for over all IM chat! I love a fair balance between action, romance, comedy and drama in all my roleplay's. Imbalance burns me out quickly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty well-versed and literate, I generally can bust out 3-5 paragraphs per post. I generally can also bust out one or two posts \\*at least\\* a day. I don't expect much in terms of length out of a partner, just need enough to work with! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dont do fandoms simply because I'm not very well invested in any at the moment. Some genre's I'm interested in would be: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Slice of life \n\n\\-Fantasy\n\n\\-Cyberpunk\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to plan at least an opening scene but if you'd like to plan more in depth I'm totally open to that as well! My writing sample is just meant to be a sample and not a starter, I'm totally open (and encouraging) to hear your own ideas as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading. I hope to hear from you! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Lyra walked down the cold, cobblestone street, wearing thin shoes of leather that allowed her to move as silently as possible, a necessity for where she was headed. The crisp air of the autumn night nipped at her button nose and caused her soft, grey eyes to well slightly with tears. Her long, dark hair was tied back in a single braid, and the night breeze caused the few small pieces that fell loose around her pale face to sway.   \nThe thick black cloak she was adorned in billowed behind her with the wind, revealing underneath a simple outfit of a white, peasant-style, long sleeve shirt, and black trousers, held up by black leather suspenders. She wore two black leather harnesses; one across her chest and one across her hips. The chest harness held an assortment of things; wooden stakes, daggers with blades of silver, silver crosses. The hip harness held one thing; a sheathed sword, with a long, lethal blade of silver. It wasn\u2019t the typical choice of clothing for a normal villager lady, but, she was far from normal, anyway.  \nThe cold stones of the streets in this small French village pressed against her feet as she walked, the sensation sending a chill up her spine. She toyed with a wooden, beaded rosary as she approached the cathedral; the vast, dark, wooden doors lit by two torches on either side. As quietly as possible, she pulled a torch from its procurement on the stone wall, then pushed open the heavy door, cursing that it groaned in protest as she did so.  \nInside the cathedral, she walked hastily down the aisle, right to the bottom of the 4 small steps to the altar, where behind it a podium stood in front of a large, wooden cross, draped in the white cloth and thorny crown the Savior had so diligently worn at his time of crucification.   \nLyra ascended the few wooden steps, then dropped to her knees at the altar, clasping her hands over the cross at the end of the rosary and bowing her head in prayer, the beads swaying slightly back and forth as she did.   \nCompletely immersed, she prayed to her God; for safety, for courage and for luck, for she would need these things on her hunt tonight.\\*",

You can call me Fleur; I\u2019m 30 and have been roleplaying for 15 years. I play FxM, and looking for any partner than can play M, though on rare occasions I will play FxF. It depends on the other person.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a literate partner, not necessarily someone who can write an essay. I don\u2019t mind one-paragraph responses, as long as the quality of the response is there. I\u2019m someone who typically matches my partner in terms of replies, but anything smaller than a paragraph won\u2019t hold my attention, sorry. That being said, I need someone who knows their spelling and grammar. Third person is preferred, at least once daily is preferred.\n\nI work an 8-5 job M-F, and so my only options for daily responses would be over email, Google Docs, or reddit pm. Otherwise I am on discord at night when I get home. There will be some NSFW themes, obviously not the focus, so please be 25+. I\u2019m no longer offering to RP with anyone younger than that, sorry. NSFW details can be discussed privately.\n\nI don\u2019t do fandoms. I\u2019m looking to find a partner who I can build a world with. I wasn\u2019t kidding about being long-term! The three main ones I\u2019m looking for are **fantasy/medieval**, **space opera**, or **post-apocalyptic**. If you have any specific ideas, I\u2019d love to hear about them.

            "selftext": "Kara looks up at the night sky as she contemplates what she\u2019s been through over the last few months. Ever since the incident with the  Daximites and Mon-el leaving, being Kara Danvers hasn\u2019t felt the same. She\u2019s been lonely. \n\nKara sighs softly as she jumps up and flys into the night sky as she listens to the night life of National City, saving people every day brings great pride there\u2019s no denying that, but she wishes she had someone to come home to every night to snuggle with and eat pot stickers while watching TV. At least she had her amazing friends and family, Alex, John, Winn, James and Lena who help her feel less alone. But she needs a relationship that\u2019s above simply family and friends, she needs intimacy, she needs love.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOk so this is just a basic premise of what this huge role play will be about. I will be playing Kara who is struggling after the Mon-el and is seeking someone to connect with. Our story will start off at the beginning of season 3 and will follow the general plot of the season but with our own twists and turns. \n\nNow to talk about your character. You have a wide variety of characters to pick from, mainly females from the DC universe. Some easy characters to integrate as a romantic interest for Kara are: Lena, Cat Grant, Sam or even Alex but I\u2019m open to other DC women as long as you play them well and have a reasonable way to put them into the Supergirl world eg Iris west gets transported to Earth 38 etc.\n\nMajor details such as plot and relationship developments can be discussed in PM\u2019s, I\u2019m also down to use discord and actually prefer it as it\u2019s very easy to make a small private server to role play in. \n\nAnyway if you read all the way down here and are not sure how to start out your reply, just message me with your character and preferred message service out of reddit or discord.\n\nI eagerly await those orange letters :D",

Just message me to find out the rest.\n\nI'm literate, the amount of detail I put depends on you. Please no real face profile pictures, it takes away from the rp.

            "selftext": "Hello! I am a 21 year old US\nmale looking for a Roleplay partner. I am not very strict on the requirements for that partner... the only thing I ask is a passion for writing.. the response length can vary depending on where we are within our writing: \n\n1.)\u201dNow you're king of the mountain, aren't ya, but it's all garbage!\u201d- This role-play is my newest role-play idea. Loosely based off of the contents of the popular retro-anime \u201cAkira\u201d, it would follow the story of our OC\u2019s and how they meet within this Neocity. Some of the teens in the city have been deemed as danger and classified with a mental disorder but in reality they\u2019re battling with the ongoing growth of their new psychic abilities which they often use to cause trouble with the city\u2019s martial law as well as with each other. They keep their powers hidden for the most part to maintain a normal appearance ( I.E. going to highschool , parties, etc). Plot is still in development so we can make this our own!\n\n2.) \u201cTitans GO!\u201d- This role-play feeds more into my own love for the teen titans and I wanted to create a plot around the day in and day out lives of the titans... we could play our own OC(s) who have been added to the team or we could plays as some of the titans ourselves evolving their characters in whatever plot we see fit.\n\n3.)\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the Winchester\u2019s\u201d- This role-play takes place within the realm of the hit-tv show \u201cSupernatural\u201d. I am a huge fan of the show and of almost every single character brought to life on the show either as hunter or hunted... why not write our own story based off of their rules. \n\n4.) \u201cWe ain\u2019t in Kansas anymore\u201d- This idea is actually the brainchild of my recent rewatching of two staple retro anime\u2019s \u201cCowboy Bebop\u201d as well as \u201cSpace Dandy\u201d. I thought the idea of my OC exploring all of time and space with another\u2019s OC for the exploit of currency would be fun . This plot is extremely volatile and we could discuss more details of this is a tune you\u2019re tapping your feet to.\n\n5.)  \"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed \u2014 or worse, expelled.\u201d- this Roleplay idea sets place in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, we don\u2019t have to necessarily write off the canon storyline but in fact create our own plot(s) within their \u201crules\u201d with our own oc(s). \n\n6.) \u201cThe world is full of monsters with friendly faces\u201d.- I wanted to dust off the old vampire cliche and create something new with a roleplaying partner who is interested in creating something different. \n\nI am extremely open to other ideas... these are just some I had kicking around my noggin. \n\nPM if interested!",

It had been a long walk from his hunting trip and the people of this little farm were nice enough to let him stay here when he passed through. It's funny...the little acts if kindness that would've been an insult to him a decade ago. He looked around the barn, hearing their cow chew. Listening to the rain fall down outside, looking up at the ceiling he couldn't help but smile. Maybe...this wouldn't be so bad. Living off the land, moving from one small town to the next. He closed his eyes, letting the sound of the rain falling on the roof lull him to sleep.\n\nAs he slept, he tossed and turned, dark dreams torturing him. The sounds of screams clawing at his every fiber. But it was the begging...the begging that tortured him the most. Not because he regretted causing such pain, not because he was tortured by remorse, but because he missed it. He missed hearing their screams and missed how they always begged for mercy...\n\nHe woke up with a start, the first thing he noticed was that the rain had stopped... But the second...was that sweet sound of desperation. \"Please, you don't have to do this. We promise we will have the money by next harvest!\" The farmer yelled. The knight rolled out of the hay, grabbing his sword and glancing out of the cracked door. \n\nThat should be enough to start us off. So I will be playing the part of a dark Knight with a...deeply disturbing history. You will be playing a member of the family being extorted. The goal of this story is your family is about to he killed, and you will join my character to learn how to fight and avenge your family...or at the very least never be made a victim again. When you message me give me an idea of what kind of character you'd like to play. 3rd person only.\n\nFair warning play whatever you want but the dark Knight is only sexually attracted to women and fem males. \n",

We don't have to follow the D&amp;D rules but we can base the game on  it so we have some basic rules, rolls, etc. The focus would be less in extended battles and more in living in the world and enjoying your life.\n\nWe would start with our first Pokemon in the first city, and then start leveling up and catching other Pokemons, and basically do whatever we  want in the world, or even not really focus on becoming trainers but on  something else, truly whatever we want!\n\nWe  would be texting the whole thing in an application like Skype or Discord. Extra points if you are a funny person and want something fun  and silly where we just have fun and possibly even become good friends!\n\nSo if you like this idea that I had, comment here or send me a private message to start discussing.\n\nThank you for reading :)",

            "selftext": "*A harsh wind is blowing over the lands of Greece, bringing with a war that will tear the Greek people apart at the seams. The unity forged years before, a necessity to turn back the Persian tidal wave, has disintegrated, relegated to history. The Delian League, under the leadership of Athens, has spread its influence far and wide across the Aegean Sea. Once considered an alliance to prevent any further Persian invasions of Greece, there are now many dissenters who would prefer the term \u2018Athenian Empire\u2019. In response, the city-states of the Peloponnesus and elsewhere, under the leadership of Sparta, have formed their own alliance to combat the perceived hegemony of Athens. Aptly named the Peloponnesian League, then aim to be a counterbalance to Athenian power. The unity that was created to oppose Xerses II is gone, and war will fill the void.*\n\n*The armies of the Peloponnesian League, famed for their strength, discipline, and resilience, aim to march in Athens and secure her surrender. The navies of the Delian League, famed for their numbers, strategy, and effectiveness, aim to choke the life out of Sparta by blockade and starvation. The stage is set, the powers of land and sea will battle to secure total domination over the lands and islands of Greece. Many fierce battles will be fought in the fields and on the waves. The outcome is uncertain, as anything could shift the tide of the conflict at any moment. But one thing is known, many Greeks will join Hades in the Underworld before the war is over. Ares will have his fill of war and bloodshed.*\n\n*But through the hardships, the struggles, and the turmoil, men and women of strength, courage, and honor are forged. The flames of bloodshed and destruction temper these souls into the stuff of legends. Heroes who refuse to be let others dictate their own lives, who are determined to write their own page in history. Whose names will ring out through the generations, long after they\u2019re gone.*\n\nCome with us as we seek to tip the scales of power in Ancient Greece! Create your own original character, and fight for what you believe in. Join the ranks of the Delian or Peloponnesian League, and leave your mark on history. You just might be the difference that wins this war.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/PSvVkhv",

            "selftext": "Hello there, you can call me Shadow! I am a 23 year old male and live on the eastern coast. I'd just like to be forward and get this off my chest now, but if you're wanting somebody to play a female for you then you're in the wrong place. I only play female if we're doubling, otherwise I'm playing a male. Sorry but I just don't like it when the only rps I'm offered are ones where I'm stuck playing a female.... I know that is probably a dealbreaker.\n\nI'd like things to be literate/semi-literate, no script play! Length doesn't bother me, so long as your replies aren't always just a single sentence it is perfectly fine. But I also don't want to write a full novel for a singular reply.... 1-3 paragraphs is my limit, sorry. Third person please! I can respond daily, I don't expect you to do the same.... but if it's been awhile and I ask 'Are you still interested?' just a simple 'Yes, I'm just busy' would suffice, please don't leave me in the dark or ghost me. If you want to end the rp I'd much rather hear the words rather than get ghosted. Being ghosted isn't fun, if there's an issue please just tell me. Honestly being ghosted hurts a lot more than being told you want to drop the rp or are losing interest\n\nI prefer OCXCanon, just as a heads up. CanonXCanon is alright. I'm not much a fan of OCxOC, I just find it hard to make OCs click together. Especially if the rp is revolved around nsfw themes and no plot. And I love nsfw themes... if that bothers you, sorry. But plot and nsfw themes are my favorite kind of rp! Though I do enjoy an rp with just nsfw stuff in it. That is why I ask that you be above 18!\n\nHere are the list of my fandoms:\n\nPokemon (For this, I'd honestly rather do a journey based rp... preferably with nsfw themes. Think of a journey similar to the anime only with less filler and more action and nsfw themes!)\n\nNaruto\n\nSaints Row\n\nTotal Drama (Not the Daycare one obviously)\n\nMarvel and DC\n\nHarry Potter\n\nSonic (Comics, Cartoon, Games... whatever, just not the IDW run as I haven't read that yet)\n\nScooby Doo (Honestly if you can rp as Daphne for me.... I'd do whatever after that)\n\nFallout\n\nFar Cry\n\nGrand Theft Auto\n\nRed Dead Redemption (So hyped for RDR 2!)\n\nFeel free to hit me up with any ideas you may have for any of the above\n\nLimits/personal restrictions: The one thing I'll flat out refuse to do is MxM, I'm sorry but I don't swing that way. I have nothing personal against it, just not into it. I hope you can respect how I feel about that\n\nI mostly rp over on Discord, I don't kik sorry. Roleplaying here isn't out of the question though, I'd just rather do it on Discord. If you don't have a Discord I'm perfectly okay with that, I'm willing to try an rp on Reddit. Message me for the information if you're interested\n\nLooking forward to hearing from some of you!",

Today I\u2019m in the mood with something involving cheating. I have my own prompt/idea in mind, but feel free to message me any ideas of your own. \n\nMy idea; \n\nHe was a prominent lawyer, he built a successful life with the help and support of his loving wife. For ten years they had never been so in love. That all changed the moment his wife brought Ashilee in their lives. His wife was a few years younger than he was and always seemed to bring fresh young woman around him all the time. She ran a yoga/meditation studio and he noticed that most of her clients were young gorgeous women. His wife seemed to take a liking to Ashilee and the two developed a fast friendship. They had been friends for a few months, and he was starting to get the feeling that Ashilee had ill intentions when it came to him. Take tonight for instance, his wife had surprised him with a wonderful party for his 35th birthday. Ashilee had show up late dressed in a skin tight red dress. The way it hugged her curves you would have thought it was painted on. The entire night he noticed he kept running into her. She would laugh to loud at his jokes, and she kept squeezing his biceps. It was hard to reject her, she was beautiful. Don\u2019t get him wrong So was his wife, but this girl was something new. She flirted with him with his wife just feet away..  She had a dangerous sort of vibe about her. \u201cSo if you could have one thing for your birthday what would it be?\u201d He was so deep in thought it took him a moment to realize she was speaking to him... \n\n\nSo this is my idea as you can see the more detailed for me the better. The idea is basically a happily married man trying to resist his urges to be with his wife\u2019s new friend.  If this idea interests you feel free to message me on kik: Ashilee96. If you don\u2019t really care for the idea but have some of your own, send them to me! ",

There is also areas for gaming, self-assignable roles for race, gender, etc. and there is moderation and there'll even be more added as people request and apply for new functions. The lore is also very concise and put together.

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello, my name is Josh and I've been RPing for about 5 years now but I always like to say that my enthusiasm makes up for any inexperience. I can of course provide sample of my writing if you'd like and my replies tend to run long in the beginning but as the story progresses, I can still usually do between 500-1,000. Of course I understand that sometimes the story doesn't warrant that long of a reply so I have no problem with shorter, more organic responses. As opposed to just trying to cram in a bunch of filler. I also love to brainstorm and chat OOC as well to help discuss the story, upcoming developments, and even just getting to know my partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI enjoy long-term partnerships and I usually keep a story going for well over a year and have even kept a partner for over three but now that things have slowed down, I thought I'd wade back into Reddit and see if anyone wanted to create something together. \n\n \n\nI love just about any setting for a story, high-fantasy, urban-fantasy, gothic horror, sci-fi, noir, and even regular day-to-day life sometimes. I can RP via email, PM, or Discord (my experience with this last is a bit lacking so I apologize for any learning curve). I would love to hear any ideas you might have, plus I have more if you're interested, the one I'm pitching below is just my most recent idea on for the \"damsel in distress\" trope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially, a princess would be captured by a fiendish dragon which had recently moved into the area. After several weeks of captivity and torment, and to her monumental surprise, another dragon would appear to save her. Unbeknownst to the princess however, her father had put out a bounty for the return of his daughter and the payment was her hand in marriage. Since she is the youngest of his children, her claim to the throne is minimal and any man who can wrest her from a dragon is worth keeping around. Unfortunately however, the king must now uphold his end of the bargain and wed his daughter to yet another dragon. I'm up for discussing the exact terms of such an arrangement but I figured the dragon gets his bride and promises to keep the small kingdom safe in return. Of course the princess is less that thrilled at her new circumstances but it is for the good of her people and there is the question as to why the dragon even saved and wed her, instead of simply taking what he wanted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the record, I am in my thirties and good with adult themes. Her time with either dragon can be as dark or a lighthearted as you'd like and even eventual romance might be expected. If this sounds interesting to you, please feel free to PM me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "The dragon Knights were a formidable force, mainly centered in Orsis, and fought primarily in the first calamity war, though the use of the dragon golems were used sporadically in other wars, and one of the oldest was rumored to be used alongside the magi.\nDragon golems themselves are massive undertakings of craftsmanship and magic, a fusion of rare metals, and the still beating heart of a very ancient dragon. The massive humanoid construct is adorned with the scales of the dragon, and a weapon made from its bones, as a symbol of respect to the beast. It requires an entire lifespan of mana to use, and because of that, dragon Knights are linked to the golem, until retirement, forfeiting their mana so the golem can move and fight.\n\nHowever, it has been suggested that someone with near flawless mana control, or alternatively, a special type of aetherium could theoretically be used as a buffer and an amplifier, allowing the knight to possibly use magic alongside their golem. In recent years, golems have been seen using an array of armaments, most notably, a powerful, and primitive mana based weapon. Not a lot is known about this weapon just yet, other than its ability to erase entire platoons of armored Knights.\n\nA golem hasn't been made in several decades, as the dragons themselves have disappeared off the face of earth. However, there have been rumors of a young man searching for a dragon, to create his own construct....\n\n(Hiya! If this interested you, I'd be more than happy to try and figure out something! I would like to mention that this will be primarily a romance/adventure RP, with sporadic action here and there. That being said, please, go ahead and pm me! That's all, for now at least. Have a good day! Err, and before I forget, sorry for the blob of words. Mobile formatting is awful.)\n\nEdit: please, only contact me through PMs. I won't be answering comments on this.",

I'm a massive Mortal Kombat fan, but I've never had the chance to have a roleplay set in the universe. I was thinking that we could roleplay during the timeskip to MKX. I think that would give us the most freedom to roleplay and without breaking the lore too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm fine with you roleplaying any character, but I would prefer to stay away from any OCs. I'm capable of roleplaying the following characters: Sub Zero (Kuai Liang), Smoke, Kenshi, Takeda, Erron Black, Kano, Bo Rai Cho, and Kung Lao. I'm open to trying other characters though! I ask that you be fine with adult themes (this is Mortal Kombat after all.) Besides that, I ask that you be open to doubling and be advanced literate. I absolutely love having all those details. Anywho, if you're interested in exploring the MK universe, please send me a message. I look forward to roleplaying with you all!",

You were reduced many times to begging on the streets for food, but the sun god's clerics were glad to give you what you needed. Your hope and will were broken long ago, but the sun god's kindness and teachings have helped you mend yourself again.\n\nAnd now, when your time of coming of age has arrived, the sun god will touch your life in an even greater way.\n\nJust as the sun begins rising over the horizon, a soft golden light fills your bedroom and wakes you from your sleep. The light is coming from a brilliant shining woman standing near your bed.\n\nShe's almost seven feet tall, and radiantly beautiful, with light blond hair and bright golden eyes. She's clad in white and gold robes, all perfectly clean and made of fabrics the wealthiest kings could never dream of. She also wears a white and gold breastplate and guantlets, while carrying a round shield that bears the sun god's symbol and colors. Her bright white wings and burning halo of sunlignt leave no room for dount; this is an archangel of Saronraye himself.\n\n\"Hail, this morning sun means you are a child no more\". The woman says with a smile like a painting and a voice like music. \"My lord has sent me on a task regarding your future. He is glad your life has been made better by your faith, and has found you worthy to be a higher servant of his than even an archcleric\". She keeps smiling, and waits for you to respond.\n\nWhat will you do now? (PM me and we can talk turky)",

I prefer third person past tense, and working with someone to create a something really based off of what happens with our characters, I'd rather let their decisions lead where we go then a plot that we've decided and have to force in. I really don't like it when someone godplays and creates situations where my character has to do something. Also while I'm totally cool with there being things about a character that aren't shared, please lets build the plot together so that you aren't DM of the whole thing.\n\nI like playing romances, and like playing them realistically, with characters that aren't perfect, make mistakes and that sometimes those mistakes have long term ramifications within the line, and have to make the relationship work.\n\nI'm open to playing doubles as well! I've always done it and really enjoy playing two characters, while I rarely use female cannon characters by and large I'm open to playing a lot of male cannon characters!! I don't care about your actual gender as long as you're happy playing a male character for at least my character! I normally play M/F or M/M\n\nThe Cannon I'm most comfortable with is Harry Potter, and would love to either play OFCxCannon or completely play new characters in the universe! I would also be open to doing something from Percy Jackson!\n\nIn terms of original worlds I do like slice of life and historical fiction! I'm a bit of a history nerd so if we choose to do a historical line I like having some sort of knowledge about it and being able to play within the rules of that era. I've also wanted to do some sort of circus based story as well so if you're interested in that let me know!! I\n\nI prefer Discord!\n\nPM me to talk more! I like to get a good idea of characters and then start with the roleplay!",

            "selftext": "Hey! Here\u2019s a brief summary of of my rp idea: So the rp I\u2019m looking to do takes place in modern times. Magic and fantasy creatures exist, but are hidden in society. My character (let\u2019s call him bob for now because I haven\u2019t thought of a name) discovers that he\u2019s a warlock and tries learning more about magic. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t have much luck when it comes to finding more information. Until one day a black book shows up on his door step. Written in a different language, the book contains detailed spell, potion and summoning instructions. After loosely translating a few of the pages, bob stumbles across instructions to summon a demon renown for wisdom in hopes it would teach him more about magic. Instead, the summoning ritual gets messed up and he summons you...\n\nSince your character is a demon, you can have whatever powers and abilities you want. Since the summoning ritual was \u2018botched\u2019 your character can\u2019t kill mine, but minor injuries can occur. I have a few ideas for world building, but the main \u2018plot\u2019 of this story would be bob learning about magic and helping your character blend into society. We can also brain storm a few subplots and other characters if we feel like it. \n\nI primarily rp on discord and I live in America (est). I like to type in third person and I use as much detail as I can. Please write a few sentences in response, I\u2019m not really picky, just put in some effort and reply once a day. DM me if you\u2019re interested!",

We can hop on ye old nostalgia train and play directly in Hogwarts - either while Harry is there or otherwise - or we can just use the magic from that universe!\n\nPersonally I'd like to play at hogwarts after the books / movies end where the world is returning to normal... roughly of course. Nothing like being a part of one of the 4 houses, eagerly searching for new things to learn and places to explore. A ride on a broom stick or dinner in the great hall, complete with the seasonal elements that make you feel warm and fuzzy inside\n\nAs the title says, RomCom is the general setting, and most other themes are accepted! I am M looking for F for this one. (Sorry if thats too bland lol)\n\nNsfw is tagged. Thats because I like to leave that door open at night, adds some thrill to the romcom edge.\n\nAnywho, pm me  if you are interested! Discord preferred, I set up a server for this so we can have multiple channels going.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

As the title of this thread suggests, I am looking for Roleplay partners who are interested in the fandom of The Orville!\n\nThis is the first sci-fi show that I\u2019ve really gotten into, with the exception of later seasons of Agents of SHIELD, and I really really love it. The characters are great, and the humor isn\u2019t forced or too shticky.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get on to the main part...the characters! I\u2019m looking to play as Commander Kelly Grayson, and I\u2019m looking for someone to play as her sarcastic ex-husband Captain Ed Mercer. I love this pairing because they\u2019re both so snarky and kind of ridiculous human beings, especially when they\u2019re together.\n\nI don\u2019t have any plots figured out just yet, but that\u2019s something we can talk about. Since it is set in the future and in space, there\u2019s plenty we can work with.\n\nSome info about me:\n* I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+.\n* I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply.\n* I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out.\n* I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does.\n* I would prefer literate partners.\n\nInterested? Excellent! Feel free to comment here or shoot me a message! I look forward to plotting with you! ",

The dragons are rather peaceful but the other creatures fear them as dragons have both physical and magical strength unrivalled by any other creature, this triggered a war that most dragons don't care for. Some dragons made things worse in major battles (typically losing by the sheer number of creatures attacking at once) this clearly didn't help things.\n\nYour character is someone that by chance or freak accident (depending on how sci-fi you'd like it) appears one day in this strange world \n\nMy main character will be a dragon that was somewhat close to where you appear, more of an expert at transformation magic and one that isn't too interested in fighting and more coming together. They're more 'civilised' than most dragons and would like to integrate into the mix of creatures but feels extremely nervous when they've tried to do so previously (if they got found out then things would become much worse) \n\nFor this roleplay, I'd be happy to include romance and NSFW themes if you would like that as well but only alongside the story and not just a sex roleplay.\n\nFor my roleplay partner, they need to be 18+ and not have every reply being more than a couple of paragraphs (I can match reply length buy I find it hard to do after a couple of paragraphs) \n\nIf this interests you then please send me a message!",

I am 33, Female, EST Timezone and looking for other writers who are passionate and committed to writing 1-3 paragraphs, into world building, playing NPC's as needed, and willing to add to the story we create - not just play a character in it. My longest lasting roleplay was 13 years. The most recent has lasted 3-4 years. I am dedicated to the stories I make with people so you won't find me flaking out on you if you pass the \"screening process\". lol. *(Please have a writing sample ready to share)*\n\nI will roleplay just about anything in plot or genre, though mine typically lean towards having a slow burning romance in them. I do not have just one type of setting that I enjoy, but excel at ancient historical drama and modern types. I am mostly into a role dynamic that I can be the female with someone playing a male char. If you are any good at being evil/villainous, or can play characters who are well thought out, tortured, and draw me in with personality - PLEASE APPLY. \n\nPlease be 18+. *(Preferably older)* \n\nAble to post 1-3 paragraphs OFTEN. \n\nYes, I ERP. No, I do not have any triggers and most fetishes are fine with me. \n\nHere are some fandoms I'm into: \n\n* Peaky Blinders\n* Taboo\n* Mad Max Franchise\n* Boardwalk Empire\n* AHS\n* GoT\n* Vikings\n* SOA/Mayans\n\nHere is what I am **NOT** into: (Its a shorter list than what I am) \n\n\\-Anime\n\n\\-Video game RP\n\n\\-Comics ^(()*^(Unless you are playing Jack Napier/Joker with one of my OC's)*^())\n\n\\-Aliens/Sci-fi\n\n\\-Straight up Military scenario RP\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Message me to play one of your dudes with one of my chicks to potentially bump uglies in a cool story that we decide on playing together.

            "selftext": "Looking for a partner for a high school slice of life or romance roleplay. Specifically, character-wise, I\u2019ve been looking for (don\u2019t feel pressured if you\u2019re against it) a kind, somewhat shy and quiet yet playful, smart, and geeky boy. That\u2019s just my ideal partner, and I\u2019d actually love to get one to even three people to roleplay, but I\u2019m a bit hesitant since good group roleplays are hard to pull off.  \nGenerally, I\u2019m looking for a long-term and very slow progressing friendship to romance experience with an actually in-depth plot just besides the fact that some characters like each other. Events happen in the world and our lives, affecting the environment, both of us, and our relationship. If you\u2019d like to plan out the basics of a story, that\u2019d be great.  \nSome information you might want to know:  \n\\- I\u2019m EST. You don\u2019t have to be, but it\u2019d be preferable if we were somewhat close time-wise.  \n\\- I can play male or female but really prefer female.  \n\\- When I say non-sexual, I mean neither of our characters may be sexualized whatsoever, unless they\u2019re both over 18 (which could happen but still I\u2019m against it). The characters may canonically commit sexual actions, but we have to skip those events in roleplay.\n\n\\- My responses are 2 - 4 sentences in length on average. I\u2019d rather my partner stayed SOMEWHERE around there, so I\u2019d say two to five sentences on average are the minimum and maximum I\u2019d allow, respectively. It\u2019s obviously okay to go under or over both of those situationally, but I\u2019m against paragraphs or one-liners constantly.\n\n\\- I\u2019m good with first or third person, and I can do whatever you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\\- Character depth is important. If your character was abused, don\u2019t just make it a sob story; entwine it into your character\u2019s life, personality, nature, etc.\n\n\\- Grammar, spelling, and general literacy is something I\u2019m looking for. Misspelling is totally fine, grammar mistakes every now and then is acceptable, but both of those in copious amounts paired with emojis and shorthand being used in-roleplay is awful.\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re interested, send me a message/chat with your discord. If need be, I can roleplay here in reddit chat, but I\u2019d rather it didn\u2019t come to that. Thanks for your time!",

By his side had been Mera, his true love who was his queen. With the two in power, Atlantis thrived incredibly, more then it ever had under the rule of any king before Arthur. If the two were being completely honest with themselves, it was starting to become a bit....boring. The two loved Atlantis and everything it offered, though the two just simply wanted to explore the land the world had to offer. Coming to the conclusion that the two would come and check on Atlantis periodically over time, the two traveled to the surface and made their way to Greece. \n\nThe two had awoken early in the morning inside their living quarters, the two having a bit of fun in bed before getting out and deciding to go do a little exploring. In Mera\u2019s possession  had been a map she\u2019d brought with her from Atlantis which displayed Greece and it\u2019s landmarks. She was always one for exploring. The two had now been taking a break near some shattered statues and pillars, Mera focusing on the map before smiling at Arthur. \u201cWhat a beautiful place huh... I\u2019m beat though...\u201d she sighed. \n\nHELLO! Hope you lot are all having a wonderful day! As you can obviously tell, this is a movie focusing on the relationship between Aquaman and Mera. I\u2019d love for this roleplay to be filled with smut, romance, and plot. As for requirements, I don\u2019t have much. All I ask is that you be fluent with typing English, are able to at least average two paragraphs, and are able to keep the story moving. Hope you\u2019re interested! Feel free to message me on here and ask for either my kik or Discord, can\u2019t wait!",

But instead adventure found me. In our darkest moments, when life flashes before us, we find something; Something that keeps us going. Something that pushes us.\"\n\n---\n\nHello! I'm looking for a long-term writing partner presently. I'll be taking on the role of the notorious 'tomb raider,' Lady Lara Croft. I'm a huge nerd for the series and I've written as her for a very, very long time. I'm very passionate about my darling archaeologist. \n\nI prefer to write her as she is in the reboot timeline; but I'll take up the classic version, if offered the right plot. I'm pretty open in terms of story suggestions for her. I will say, however, that I have little interest in playing her opposite \"rival tomb raiders.\" I get offered that a lot and ... no. I just want something a little less cliched. \n\nI really love doing crossovers with Lara, particularly opposite characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe - though I'm open to other suggestions. I also really love playing Lara against villains. She's very pragmatic herself, so it's interesting to see how she reacts to baddies [ especially ones she has an attraction to. ;) ] However, I'm not interested in playing her opposite Nathan Drake or Indiana Jones. Sorry! \n\nIn terms of her appearance, I use Lara's mocap/voice actress from TR2013 and ROTTR, Camilla Luddington: [1](http://danielmusto.com/wp-content/gallery/editorial/MG_0914_Retouched_Filter.jpg). [2](http://danielmusto.com/wp-content/gallery/editorial/MG_0835_Retouched_Filter.jpg). [3](http://danielmusto.com/wp-content/gallery/editorial/MG_0270_Retouched_Filter.jpg).\n\nMy back-up faceclaims are Alicia Vikander and Karima Adebibe. I use Rhona Mitra for the classic iteration. \n\n---\nPlease:\n\n- Be at least twenty years old!\n- Be polite!\n- Have Discord or Skype!\n- Be enthusiastic and polite!\n- Be creative! ",

            "selftext": "Hello Dragon Riders! I came up with an idea I would absolutely love to write out with some of you. \n\nThis takes inspiration from How to Train Your Dragon, in a sense. Ideally our characters will be Dragon Riders on an isle named Velen. Inside Velen when your character becomes of age, and proves their might to our Chieftain Freydis the Master of the Frost. With the other League of Riders. The League of Riders is an ancient guild tasked with protecting Velen from their enemies of Bandits, Rogue Dragons, and the Eastern Isle our natural enemies of Dragon Riders. Very little young adults go after their lust of taming Beasts. Dragons and Vikings did not get along until the last decade. Anxieties festered, and people feared even looking in a Dragons' direction. However on Velen they were half of the community. \n\nI don't intend of filling out everything about the Roleplay and it's plot right here. This is still in works, and we can build off of this, I won't limit you to what you have happen. As long as we discuss it before you write about it! I'm seeking literate and dedicated people for this, I've gotten too many three line responses to my other prompts. That does not win the race, if you show me how creative or even dedicated you can be with your introduction proves to me whether or not I'll hit you up. I only use Discord, it is my favorite way of Roleplaying anything. As long as you have a good and even slightly enthusiastic attitude I'll welcome you with open arms. Romance is a must, slow burn ideally.\n\n*Our characters.*\n\nOkay, I normally only play male and it is my preference. Here's the thing, I can be convinced to Roleplay a Female if and only if my partner shows great literacy. Anyway, what I dislike is anyone with a overpowered character. Even their Dragon they create. They would still be Rookies, the Dragon and Rider. I doubt your character would be off alone befriending a Dragon. It would be different if your character did make good friends with it, and brought it back to Velen to seek help. If that is the way you wish your character to be then go on ahead. Feel free to be creative, I love details. You can send a picture of the dragon, or not. Maybe even both, that is absolutely up to you. You can even play someone from the Eastern Isles. Our enemies, you could have ridden here on your Dragon to take refugee. You would be seen as an outsider, and likely banished out from Velen. Again, that is your choice. Our characters could even be friends of Velen, with passions of joining the League of Riders. Until it officially happened. Lastly, if I did not make myself clear our characters will be in the age of 18-19. We also will fill out character sheets, but if you aren't into that tell me.\n\nI believe I went over all of it, I hope I caught a few of your attention. If you survived this long I appreciate it, but again be creative when you DM me. I only take direct messaging, but just show you're interested. Lastly, the topic of Nsfw, if you want it or not tell me if you're comfortable or not! Communication is key within a Roleplay, friends. I tend to fade to black either way. If you ever have any questions, you can feel free to ask me about it!",

            "selftext": "This is a reupload of a message I posted on my old reddit account. I recently got a new phone and couldn\u2019t log back in. Anyway...\n\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of my to idea: so the rp I\u2019m looking to do takes place in modern times. Magic and fantasy creatures exist, but are hidden amongst society. My character Isaac discovers he\u2019s a warlock and tries to learn more about magic. Unfortunately he doesn\u2019t have much luck when it comes to finding information. Until one day a black book shows up on his door step. Written in a different language, the book contains detailed spell, potion brewing and demonic summoning instructions. After loosely translating a few of the pages, Isaac stumbles across instructions on how to summon a demon renown for wisdom and hoped that it would teach him more about magic.. instead, the summoning ritual gets messed up and he summons your character\n\nSince your character is a demon, you can have whatever powers and abilities you want. Your character can\u2019t kill mine because the summoning ritual was \u2018botched\u2019, but is still capable of inflicting injuries on Isaac. I have a few ideas for world building but the main \u2018plot\u2019 of the story would be Isaac learning about magic and helping your character blend into society. We can also brainstorm a few subplots and side characters if we feel like it. \n\nI primarily rp on discord and I live in America (est). I like to narrate in third person and use as much detail as I can. Please write a few sentences in response. I\u2019m not picky, just put some effort in and reply once a day. DM me if you\u2019re interested!",

We can discuss plots, settings, character ages, characters, etc, meaning there are plenty of possibilities and routes our story can have. \n\nI would like our story to develop into some sort of romance sooner or later. I really want to explore various topics within our writing and I would like to have something long term.\n\nI will not reply to messages with poor grammar and/or messages that only contain 'hello' or 'hey'.

I have been RPing for 15 years now (Since the time of the Yahoo Instant Messenger RPs!...before they got rid of the user rooms). \n\nI have been searching for someone who can Roleplay as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. But heres the catch. I use an Original Character...but fear not! I don't make Mary Sue characters and I have been working on a full bio for my OC that\u00a0 I use just for the Dragonball franchise. It would be post Frieza Saga and go off in an Alternate Universe (no Trunks and the androids will probably come but it'll end up different) and it WILL be a romance! With action and adventure. Fights will be slightly included but if it gets too long we can time skip and try to figure out who is the winner between the characters.. Any more questions about this don't be afraid to ask me!\n\nNow, Rules... I am pretty lienient when it comes to Roleplays. Some literacy is a MUST. Of course we all make grammar mistakes (I know I make quite a bit as I look at myself typing this out lol). I do Semi paragraph to multi paragraph replies and starting posts as well full of detail. I would hope and wish that someone out there would be willing to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0also, this is in 3rd person. This will be romance like I have stated..but if you need to do a time skip through the lovey dovey bits please dont hesitate to tell me and we can time skip. Also...please DO NOT GOD MOD. its annoying.. Also...PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I know real life gets in the way and I'm understanding of that (trust me I work 40 hours a week I understand lol) I LOVE fast repliers they make me really happy trust me. If you get uninterested please just let me know I wont be mad I promise. also..PLOTTING. I love to plot out an idea that you might have or I might have before installing it into the RP.\u00a0also about my OC I can tell you alot more about her if you are interested and I can even supply artwork of her as well.\n\nWell that seems to be the lot of it! I think I remembered everything...I hope I remembered everything lol. But please if you are interested hit me up with a PM or comment here and please don't be shy to ask me questions! I am always happy to answer any questions regarding everything I'm looking for. I hope I hear from someone!! Thanks!",

Will be looking for moderators to help keep the savages in line (Lol). Anyway, if you wanna get your fight on and meet some, at the very least, interesting people, hit me up and let's talk about how you can help get this thing off the ground. ",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, I\u2019m Kong! \n\nA friend of mine, Insomniac, and I have created a Discord server dedicated to play-by-post longform roleplay that takes place within an AU of the My Hero Academia Universe. Over the years I\u2019ve been an admin for quite a few roleplay forums and servers that have seen quite a lot of success, attracting some minor celebrity attention from people like voice actors and sponsors like Roll20!\n\nThe way the server works is that you join the server and get to apply to play an **original character** within our universe, of which there are no canon characters in existence. Deku, All Might, etc. do not exist within our AU. At that point, after creating your character and getting it accepted, you\u2019d be able to build up your character through roleplays and self-contained stories via writing as if you were part of a literary \u201ccinematic universe\u201d. It\u2019s a **collaborative** storytelling server. Meaning that if you\u2019re here, you want to write a story in conjunction with your fellow users and create the best narrative you can. It\u2019s not just about you and your character, it\u2019s about the larger story you can create with one another. And most importantly, it\u2019s about creating memories and crafting relationships with your fellow users.\n\nSo what\u2019s the premise for our AU? Mostly the same kind of world, however, recently a series of benefactors have created an artificial island off the coast of Tokyo, Japan called the Itagaki Island Academy, which they have made into an international high school to train pro heroes. The best and brightest prospects from around the world have all been brought together for the first school year. And while we\u2019re getting this server started, you as users are required to either create a first year student in Class One or a faculty member on the Itagaki Academy staff. However, with time and more users , we will be opening up the world to include pro hero and vigilante characters not related to the academy.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to join, please click on the link below and we\u2019ll welcome you with open arms so you can get to writing!\n\nJoin Here: https://discord.gg/WQ626tN\n\nThanks - Kong",

            "selftext": "Hey there! You can call me Era! Just to start with here's a quick overview of stuff to keep in mind:\n*I live in EST and work full time, but can manage relatively frequent replies depending on how busy I am.\n*I'm in my mid-twenties, so while I am not seeking smut, it is perfectly fine if anything naturally veers that way.\n*My preference is to write in 3rd person, present tense.\n*For the length of replies, just give me at minimum a few sentences to work with! We can certainly go longer! I try to match my post length to my partner's.\n*I really love getting to create and write OCs and writing multiple characters, so I'm more than happy to double! (Or more!) Playing either male or female characters is no issue for me; I'm comfortable with both.\n*I *thrive* off romance. The messier the better, to be honest! Give me all those romantic entanglements! Dark relationships that aren't necessarily healthy are also a love of mine, though I am also pleased to write more stable romances!\n*Any combination of genders is good with me, but I particularly enjoy FxF content.\n*Be if OC x OC or canon x OC romances, I got ya.\n\nSo, as for what fandoms I'm interested in:\n* **Fire Emblem** - I\u2019m one of those unfortunate fans most familiar with Awakening and Fates, the latter in particular I fully acknowledge as messy, but am terribly fond of it. I don\u2019t have much in the way for plot ideas, but I\u2019d be fine with just following along with the any of the canon plots and shifting things along as we go. We can substitute canon characters with our own OCs if that works for you, too!\n* **Naruto** - I *really* want to do something set in the Warring States era, but I'm also open to any other ideas. I'm really just charmed by the setting.\n* **Final Fantasy** - I've played VII through XV, minus the MMOs, and would be down for considering something with any of them.\n* **Drakengard/Nier** - probably a massive long shot, but if you happen to be a fan...!\n* **some other more misc fandoms I enjoy** - Boku no Hero Academia, Persona (2-5), Pillars of Eternity, Tokyo Ghoul, Yugioh (not sure how well I'd write it, but I'm an *enormous* fan of all six anime series), and Dragon Age\n\nHit me up if any of this strikes your fancy!",

I will be playing an OC of mine - the character Michael finds himself feeling confused and infatuated over. This may cause him to react in a number of ways, which is why I'm itching to play his love interest. \n\nI love all of the Halloween movies, so we can pick what point in the timeline we would play, or just come up with a completely alternative time line and setting. We can discuss plots, settings, character ages, characters, etc, meaning there are plenty of possibilities and routes our story can have. \n\nI would like our story to develop into some sort of romance sooner or later. I really want to explore various topics within our writing and I would like to have something long term.\n\nI will not reply to messages with poor grammar and/or messages that only contain 'hello' or 'hey'. I am searching for an experienced writing partner to create a fun story with. \n\nThanks!! ",

I get positively twitterpated! Thus, this prompt is all about him and the incredible characters he's played. \n\nPerhaps we could do something with the mischievous trickster god - **Loki?** Or a plot featuring the brooding, virtuoso vampire - **Adam?** Or the tragic, inventive - **Sir Thomas Sharpe?** Maybe the chaos-consumed - **Dr. Robert Laing?** Or how about hotel manager turned agent - **Jonathan Pine?**\n\nIf none of those appeal to you, then we could definitely do something with an **original character** that utilizes Mr. Hiddleston as their faceclaim. \n\nMy own role in each scenario is negotiable; though easily altered to fit your personal preferences. I aim to please. &lt;33 \n\n---\n\n#RULES\n- I only write in third-person, past tense. \n- No first-person POV. \n- I will not write with anyone under the age of eighteen. \n- I will only roleplay over Discord or Skype. \n- Please be polite, enthusiastic, have proper grammar/spelling, and be kind.

I WILL ALWAYS BE WILLING TO MEET THOSE WHO SEE THIS AND WANT   TO  START SOMETHING. JUST DM ME :)\\**\n\nI   am  32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job   during the  week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is   to  roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI    play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as    intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters    (IRL gender doesn't matter).\n\nPlease be    prepared for picture usage. I've done writing descriptions for a while,    but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would    prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real    pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some    animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some    fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC,    Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon Age, etc. Anything else    unlisted is better to bring them my way and see if I know them. If any    above appeal, feel free to come my way. :)\n\nI    like some literacy at a minimum, third person only, past tense. I am    also VERY lenient with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I am  very   nice, I promise, and I want to farm niceties out of people in  turn.   Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a  chance!\n\nI   do work during the day, so  posting will be sporadic, but I am good at   night and on  weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for   people that  are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day   or more.\n\nI  am usually on from sometime   in the morning to late at night Eastern  time. If you want to play   sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord  name or to offer yours.I   hHope to talk to all of you soon! :)",

            "selftext": "Hello there, you can call me Shadow! I am a 23 year old male and live on the eastern coast. I'd just like to be forward and get this off my chest now, but if you're wanting somebody to play a female for you then you're in the wrong place. I only play female if we're doubling, otherwise I'm playing a male. Sorry but I just don't like it when the only rps I'm offered are ones where I'm stuck playing a female.... I know that is probably a dealbreaker.\n\nI'd like things to be literate/semi-literate, no script play! Length doesn't bother me, so long as your replies aren't always just a single sentence it is perfectly fine. But I also don't want to write a full novel for a singular reply.... 1-3 paragraphs is my limit, sorry. Third person please! I can respond daily, I don't expect you to do the same.... but if it's been awhile and I ask 'Are you still interested?' just a simple 'Yes, I'm just busy' would suffice, please don't leave me in the dark or ghost me. If you want to end the rp I'd much rather hear the words rather than get ghosted. Being ghosted isn't fun, if there's an issue please just tell me. Honestly being ghosted hurts a lot more than being told you want to drop the rp or are losing interest\n\nI prefer OCXCanon, just as a heads up. CanonXCanon is alright. I'm not much a fan of OCxOC, I just find it hard to make OCs click together. Especially if the rp is revolved around nsfw themes and no plot. And I love nsfw themes... if that bothers you, sorry. But plot and nsfw themes are my favorite kind of rp! Though I do enjoy an rp with just nsfw stuff in it. That is why I ask that you be above 18!\n\nHere are the list of my fandoms:\n\nPokemon (For this, I'd honestly rather do a journey based rp... preferably with nsfw themes. Think of a journey similar to the anime only with less filler and more action and nsfw themes!)\n\nNaruto\n\nSaints Row\n\nTotal Drama (Not the Daycare one obviously)\n\nMarvel and DC\n\nHarry Potter\n\nSonic (Comics, Cartoon, Games... whatever, just not the IDW run as I haven't read that yet)\n\nScooby Doo (Honestly if you can rp as Daphne for me.... I'd do whatever after that)\n\nFallout\n\nFar Cry\n\nGrand Theft Auto\n\nRed Dead Redemption (So hyped for RDR 2!)\n\nFeel free to hit me up with any ideas you may have for any of the above\n\nLimits/personal restrictions: The one thing I'll flat out refuse to do is MxM, I'm sorry but I don't swing that way. I have nothing personal against it, just not into it. I hope you can respect how I feel about that\n\nI mostly rp over on Discord, I don't kik sorry. Roleplaying here isn't out of the question though, I'd just rather do it on Discord. If you don't have a Discord I'm perfectly okay with that, I'm willing to try an rp on Reddit. Message me for the information if you're interested\n\nLooking forward to hearing from some of you!\n\nAnd one last thing.... lately I've had problems with people ghosting me after day one, never talking to me again or bothering to tell me the rp is off. Like if you're busy I understand, just please tell me if you can't rp for a few days don't ignore me when I ask if you're still interested.",
