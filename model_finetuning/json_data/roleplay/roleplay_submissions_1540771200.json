            "selftext": "Hello all! So I\u2019ve been binge watching quite a few crime shows and have been inspired by a particular one. I\u2019m searching for someone to play a male character named Thomas Blunt, who is a charmingly young and brilliant CEO of a modern tech company. He\u2019s arrogant and cold, but as you can see this is a romance RP so while he\u2019s still a rich prick, that might change over time.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch though! Thomas has committed a murder.. If you can\u2019t tell already, the 26 year old has some issues. To be specific, anger issues. As a young billionaire, people are always trying to use him or sue him. One day, a particular employee of his attempts to sue and steal credit for one of his newest tech ideas, and Tom simply threatens for him to stop trying. He gets ticked off at the attempt by his own employee though, and takes his anger out on his innocent flight attendant - basically, he accidentally takes her life after excessively expressing his anger and pushing her down the stairs, to which she broke her neck.\n\nOr was it an accident?\n\nThat\u2019s the fun part of this plot, because you can make Thomas however you like. He could be a psychopath if  you really want him to be (who has a soft spot for her), or he could feel awful about what he did. Obviously, let\u2019s not kill off the female character I will be playing as, because it is a romance RP after all! I just think it\u2019d be interesting to see how she might handle his situation (liking and eventually having feelings for a murderer), and how he might handle her.\n\nThe female character I will be playing is Mika Durand, and she could either be his right hand man at the company who keeps things running smoothly, a mere stranger who recognizes him from the news of his temporary arrest, or perhaps even an intern at the police department who takes a strange liking to him.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, I apologize for how lengthy this turned out to be and thank you for your time. If you\u2019re interested in playing as Thomas Blunt, please send me a message and I\u2019ll be happy to use whatever platform you like!",

            "selftext": "Good morning, all (or whatever greeting suits your time zone). I hope everyone had a nice weekend. As usual, I'm looking for some more great partners for some of my cravings. Hopefully you'll find something that interests you.\n\nJust a few things first:\n\n* I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I'm an editor for a living, which has ruined me for polite society, but I also love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. Just...respect the language. \n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving hopeless romantic.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor \"Saw V,\" and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* I do not use any IM service. I use *email* or, if necessary, reddit PMs.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Final Fantasy X(Yuna)\n* Final Fantasy XII(Ashe)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)[Preferably before season 7.]\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: (I don't answer or pay much attention to comment replies.) Thank you! ",

I have gotten a sick day and don\u2019t have much to do so i decided to get back into it. Now I have a few ideas but I am willing to do a few of your ideas as well. I will include a list of likes and dislikes and links at the end of this post  this can be safe for work or nsfw depending on how interested you are. Now for my idea my ideas have loose plot and I am a little rusty and am mostly\nLiterate I use kik, Snapchat, Skype, and discord, I am also open to group rp but for this particular idea is two people. I usually do 1st person but I am decent at writing in  3rd person, So the idea is there is a girl I know who hates me (and I can provide pictures)  and my goal is to win you over and have a relationship with her. She is cute funny, nerdy, loves Harley Quinn  and the Dc in general. If you are interested please  pm me. If you are interested in the nsfw version I will provide more information and and kinks but I am open to your ideas as well. A little about me: I am 5\u201910 living on a farm in the United States, I\u2019ve had a rough child hood but things are looking up, I love making new friends.\n\nLikes:\n-Pok\u00e9mon\n-DnD\n-Video games\n-Cosplay\n\nDislikes\n-Gore\n-Anger/hostility/racism or anything political i would rather make friends\n",

I already have the characters and basic plot figured out so please, pm me if you're interested! I'm craving something fluffy and sweet and vanilla, though there WILL be some darker moments as well. I plan on including a hurt/comfort scenario later in the story, as I'm a huge fan of those. If this sounds like something you're interested in, I look forward to hearing from you. :) and I'm more than happy to give you more details in pm. I'm looking for a serious, literate partner for this. You don't need to be a history expert, just be familiar with the basic details is all I ask. I'm extremely bored at the moment and hope I can find someone to do this with.",

I'm looking to join a group that could/will contain at least some element of ERP while still being an actual ttrpg! PBP is preferred, but I do have some experience doing voices? I mean I have a mic and the voice for it. (my voice is super-high... I'm always mistaken for a girl..) TBH I just want a group of people to play a campaign with! One that would likewise contain NSFW elements that would also include some form of ERP? An RP heavy campaign would be nice too! PM if you're interested, and we can talk more! \\^\\_\\^",

Im looking for a partner who wont just message with one word (well I guess it depends on the situation)\n\nMy idea:\n\nRent has been low for a long time now and we are starting to worry that we will be kicked out. We tried everything we could but nothing has worked out. Sitting on the sofa we look at each other.\n\u201cThere is one last thing we can do\u201d I see you raise a eyebrow at me \u201cwhat if we sex cammed, people make loads of money from it and well I think we\u2019d be a good and different angle\u201d\n\nThis could be done daddy/daughter, roommates.\nThe type of sex could be anything from ddlg, Abdl, petplay/neko, bdsm etc.\nIdeas could include allowing highest bidders to meet us at hotel and use me whilst it\u2019s on cam.\n\n Hope to hear from you soon",

            "selftext": "Hi there, This is a group dedicated to creating a fun and welcoming environment for all roleplayers. I want this roleplay to offer plenty of opportunities to its players to help create and shape the world around them for the sake of creating a fun and interesting story. Below, you'll find a bit of lore to help situate you so you can get a general feel of how things go down on this server:*\" In a small and quaint town basically forgotten (or at least overshadowed by all the other ones) deep in the heart of Utah, everyone seems to know each other's name and its so safe that some people can even sleep without having to so much as lock their door. However, this town is known for something else amongst its residents, as is the rest of the world at this point that sets it apart from our own: mythological creatures. You see, in this world, creatures big and small truly do exist and finally decided to make themselves known to the humans. However, there is one small catch: they aren't exactly liked by humans. Humans have always been top of the food-chain, they've always been able to adapt and overcome any challenges that they've faced as a species. Now that these \"mythos\" as they often refer to them as have come into their lives, they see them as simply another issue that is meant to be adapted to and overcome.*\n\n*The mythos tried to be nice to the humans, they wanted to basically be like neighbors with them. However, humans were fearful of them. Things soon escalated and now it's a bit cultural split between mythos and humans. The mythos are now essentially treated like second-class citizens if they so much as step foot into a human town or city. Some, are even captured as slaves and forced to serve under the oppressive rule of humanity. Things have even gotten to the point where anti-mythos departments have been establish for the sake of \"protecting the people from the threat of the unknown\" as they so claim.*\n\n*Of course, there are a few unspoken rules that applies to humans. For example, the dense forest that surrounds the forest is to be left alone. Any human that so enters it could potentially face certain death.*\n\n*Now, here we are. Be you mytho or human, you still have a life to live. Whether you try and create peace between the two opposing groups or instead prefer to keep old values intact and destroy all who oppose you is a choice all your own.\"*\n\nIf this is appealing to you in the slightest, please feel free to drop by and say hello! Hope to see you soon! Remember, this RP changes along with whatever decisions the characters of this RP make. I only jump in if things begin to get out of hand. Even right now, we're at the near finish of an event ran by one of our very own. This would be the perfect opportunity to come and create a character during this moment of down time between events and get to know the server a bit better.\n\nLike I said, I want this to be an environment where everyone can pitch about whatever ideas they like, so long as it fits within the general lore and rules.\n\nOtherwise, everything is up to you guys.The link to the server: [right here](https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw)",

JUST DM ME :)\\**\n\nI  am  32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job  during  the week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is  to  roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI   play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as   intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters   (IRL gender doesn't matter).\n\nPlease be   prepared for picture usage. I've done writing descriptions for a while,   but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would   prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real   pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some   animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some   fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC,   Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon Age, etc. Anything else   unlisted is better to bring them my way and see if I know them. If any   above appeal, feel free to come my way. :)\n\nI   like some literacy at a minimum, third person only, past tense. I am   also VERY lenient with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I am very   nice, I promise, and I want to get niceties out of people in turn.   Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a chance!\n\nI   do work during the day, so posting will be sporadic, but I am good at   night and on weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for   people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day   or more.\n\nI am usually on from sometime   in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play   sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours. I   hope to talk to all of you soon! :)",

You knew exactly what riding on the central backseat of your mother's car meant - it was a sort of punishment, at least in your eyes. You could feel her gaze on you, one of concern, letdown and that particular brand of guilt-inducing disappointment all mothers were naturally able to do.\n\nYou felt her eyes bore through your very being, piercing your soul and burning inside, igniting that voice in your head, the one that kept telling you that your *friends* were a bad influence and that you would have ended up in trouble because of them.\n\nAnd while you tried to be a good friend and play dumb when the police found out about the shoplifting, they immediately handed over your name after the slightest bit of pressure, leaving you shocked, and a little heartbroken - your *boyfriend* was one of them.\n\nIn the end, being your first real crime - loitering and annoying the mall cop by mocking him for using a Segway to go around wasn't punishable by law -, you ended up getting away with several hundred hours of community service, in part thanks to your father's friendships, and yours didn't even sound all that bad, at least on paper.\n\nYou were to provide 'emotional support to patients undergoing long-term therapy' as the judge put it, which was a lot better than having to clean up the city park or serving at a soup kitchen or whatever the Salvation Army did. To make sure you actually presented to the assigned hospital, your mother decided to take you there, despite the fact you were old enough to drive and gave you a little speech once arrived.\n\nAfter filling out yet more paperwork, a nurse with a bright smile welcomed you and took you to a room with what looked like a dialysis machine, telling you to wait there, on those weird hospital metal chairs, designed to make anyone feel uncomfortable.\n\nYou were expecting some old dude or decrepit lady with malfunctioning kidneys, but after 15 minutes, a tall, lanky young man with raven black hair walked in. His face was covered in freckles and looked pale and sickly, but overall handsome. The nurse at his side helped him sit down at the machine and began connecting him to it, and noticing you, he gave you a smile.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nGiven that I once again watched \"The Fault in Our Stars\" and cried rivers, I wanted to make a bit of a story-focused, bittersweet roleplay prompt, and see how it could go and where we could take it.\n\nI can't stress enough that this is but a guideline for what our story might be, and we could modify any part, should the need arise.

            "selftext": "Hi there! This isn't a prompt, so to speak, but rather an overall analysis of my preferences, likes, dislikes, and habits pertaining to roleplay in general.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am looking for a literate partner. Detailed and well-crafted writing is one of my biggest turn-ons; if it's worth writing, it's worth almost experiencing! I'm of course reciprocal with this request in the fact that I will try to match my partner's effort, especially if I am starting the roleplay/moving the plot. Mistakes are alright, of course. We all make them! I would also like something, possibly, longterm\u2014not in the sense that we have to perform the same storyline/roleplay (that's okay too!), but rather that, if we mesh well, we create other roleplays to enjoy.\n\nSecondly, I quite like exotic, unique, and immersive worlds. Of course, some of my favorite scenarios are fantasy, with worlds involving magic and fantastical creatures and beasts, typically in a historical setting. Speaking of history\u2014I love historical roleplays, fantasy or not! Some of my favorite time periods include Greco-Roman Europe, medieval/Renaissance Europe, the Age of Exploration, and even modern history up to the Victorian Era, or WWI/WWII. I also enjoy dystopian, sci-fi, futuristic, or apocalyptic roleplays. I'm perfectly fine with modeling roleplays off of certain series, like Corruption of Champions, or books shows.\n\nNow, down to the juicy stuff. Kinks, preferences, and all that:\n\nMy biggest kink is domination; I LOVE power play, in the sense that one character is made into sort of a serf of the other, especially if it's between two masculine/youthful characters. Alpha/omega play is also fun. My other two big kinks include hypnosis/mind control, and foot worship/foot play, because they both play into domination. Other kinks include body worship, tentacles, magic users, non-human creatures or beasts, demons, unique cocks, special or unique (we'll talk about this one) precum/cum, and generally a casual attitude about sex among one or both of the characters.\n\nMy turnoffs are a little less varied. I can't do scat, I'm not a fan of a lot of body hair/poor hygiene among characters, and I definitely won't deal with excessive blood or gore. Implied death of a character is fine. If my partner really likes it, I can do vore.\n\nNow, what sort of character do I typically play? Well, it's usually pretty simple. I'm adaptable, but I almost always play some sort of masculine character, like a noble, a warrior, a knight, etc., between the ages of 18 and 25. Usually, they're human or elf-like. I rarely err outside of this paradigm, but I am willing to if it better fits the roleplay. This character is typically pretty arrogant or poised in some ways, and ripe to be dominated physically and mentally. I'm perfectly fine with playing multiple characters, as well.\n\nWhat sort of character would I like you to play? The possibilities are endless! If it's going to be a human, I would of course like a male, but beyond that, I'd like someone that is as masculine/more masculine than my character, attractive (duh!), clever, manipulative (evil, even), arrogant, and with a strong desire to dominate. If it's not going to be human... well, we'll talk about that. I do always enjoy demons, minotaurs, and orcs.\n\nIf you're interested, just message me.",

I'm currently looking for a writing partner, long term or short term, it doesn't matter :) \n\nI've been roleplaying for ten plus years and prefer details over anything else. I've always discovered it's easier for me to write in third person than it is to convert back to first. \n\nMy limits are on a small list but I'm open to pretty much everything as long as there is some sort of discussion beforehand and we both are on the same terms. \n\nI'm more of a slice of life writer than stuff that involves supernatural and apocalyptic themes. Just my preference, so if you have any ideas don't be afraid to send them my way. :) ",

Please, I need an rp.\n\nPlease message me for my kik, I don't get dm's because my app is an older version.  \n\nI only use Kik, I don't really see the big deal with Discord.\n\nI've been conjuring up some awesome ideas inside my head for some of my rp ideas. I have many ideas from marvel, Supernatural, Sherlock, etc. However I prefer to do canon x oc character. I also like yandere boy roleplays with characters from black butler, and a few more. I'm very detailed, I use proper grammar, and I always find inspiration for new ideas. \n\nMy interests:\n\nMarvel\n\nSupernatural \n\nRocky horror picture show \n\nHeathers\n\nIT (1990 and 2017)\n\nSherlock \n\nAmerican Horror story \n\nHemlock Grove \n\nHarry Potter \n\nThe Walking Dead\n\nAmerican Mcgee's Alice series (game)\n\n The Last Unicorn \n\nRepo the Genetic Opera\n\nStranger Things \n\nTim Burton films\n\nHorror movies (classics to new)\n\nPhantom of the Opera \n\nCrimson Peak\n\nGotham \n\nAnime \n\n\u25aaPuella Magi Madoka Magica \n\u25aaDramatical Murder \n\u25aaRozen Maiden\n\u25aaAnother\n\u25aaChobits\n\u25aaKill la Kill \n\u25aaDiabolik Lovers \n\u25aaBlack Butler \n\u25aaDurarara\n\u25aaHetalia\n\u25aaSankarea\n\n\nI'm literate, the amount of detail I put depends on you. Please no real face profile pictures, it takes away from the rp.  I would prefer a long term rp as well.\n\nPlease say \"hopscotch\" to show me your interested in getting my username. For the list of fandoms I enjoy for more ideas, please say \"interests\".  Must say one of these or I won't answer you. I don't answer to \"hey\".",

I haven't roleplayed in a short while due to school taking up my time, but I have some more time to myself now to write with others. I enjoy doing scenes that are based around young love which are realistic and easier to develop characters with. I don't have a particular scene I wish to do because I enjoy doing unique, different scenes with different people for me to ensure interested. I have a few disclaimers, I am not looking for an entirely lustful roleplay; that can only happen when the time is right in the story as I don't want the roleplay to depend on that. Another disclaimer is that I may not always be active, for instance, I have school and that takes up a lot of my time, but, I will try my very best. \n\nThank you for reading, please PM with some information about you, any plots you have enjoyed recently and most importantly, your discord name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Create our own cast of characters and cause drama, sadness, hope, and blossoming romance between them all! I have my own ideas on where the story could go if you are the \"play now, think as we go\" type, but if you wanna spend hours, maybe even days, crafting out our characters, story, and setting, then I think we would get along just fine. Please contact me with any questions you might have, or just send me your Discord and we can discuss anything you wish there!  \nJust a few quick disclaimers though. I am 21, so I would prefer my partner be 18+, not because of NSFW stuff, but because I always have anxiety about getting in trouble and all that jazz. My apologies. For POV, I do not mind at all what you use. Third or First is fine with me, but I always use first for myself. I've been doing it for 6-7 years and its a habit at this point I don't think I can change.   \nAny other questions can be asked through PM!  \"**Ma serannas!\"**",

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nI'm new here and am trying to get back into RP after a fairly long hiatus from it. Going to do my best not to make this too long winded and keep it simple.\n\nI'm looking for someone that's 21+ that is up for some 3rd person perspective RP that will be heavily focusing around romance. I don't mind if there are hints of fantasy in it (I.E - Life is Strange) and would like there to also include NSFW and dramatic themes. I usually post anywhere from 1-2 paragraphs, but anything beyond that is a bit much for me. I do my best to be detailed, use correct grammar, and run my posts through spell checks but I'm not perfect and do make mistakes. If you're looking for some insane, super literate writer that can write you novel like posts, that isn't me. I will however do my best to keep my posts interesting and intriguing.\n\nFor a setting, I'm really open to suggestions here, but in the past I've enjoyed supernatural based or just normal based colleges/schools (Characters MUST be 18+ for this, no exceptions), roommates in a new a city, or even co-workers that have or develop a crush. I know none of these are wildly original or imaginative, but that's why I said I'm up for suggestions. I like there to be fun twists and turns in the story, like adding in other characters that can bring on some jealousy, disapproving friends or family, reappearance of ex's, or anything else we can come up with. I really like the idea of my character being straight and either seduced or persuaded into dating women! Would also love if my partner\u2019s character was a little more on the thicker side, though this isn\u2019t required! I'll just be using Discord for this so please don't try and convince me to use another platform.\n\nI think that's about it, if you have any questions or are interested feel free to send me a DM and I'll be sure to get back to you as soon as I can. Oh, and please, no messages regarding group RPs, I'm only interested in 1x1 for the time being, thanks!",

            "selftext": "Good (whatever time of day it is for you)! As the title of this ad notes, I'm looking to RP some lines within the Pok\u00e9mon game/anime-verse, and I'm seeking to keep the anime's lighthearted and cheery mood. Over-the-top adventure, copious humor and comedy, witty/snarky banter, meaningful conflict (no constant bleakness or perpetual angst), quiet moments of character growth, good battles, romance (I'm cool with smut, but I wouldn't want it to be the proverbial endgame), our characters genuinely having fun and enjoy each other's company, that sort of thing. (And in full disclosure, I do have a present preference for canon x OC lines. I know I'm trash.)\n\n***All partners must be 21+ years old, and all characters must be written/played as 21 years old if they aren't already older. Also, I'm only looking to roleplay over E-mail.***\n\n[This RoleplayGateway post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/9auwtv/vyces_roleplay_gateway_profile/) has all my OOC info, so I won't repost it here. (You're welcome for that. :P) Instead, let me note what I'm **not** looking to involve in any such lines...\n\n\u2620 *Mere glancing familiarity with the setting.* I'm asking partners to have fairly up-to-date knowledge on the games/anime (at least Gen 4 or 5) so we aren't significantly restricted regarding location or what Pok\u00e9mon we involve in a line.\n\n\u2620 *Making Pok\u00e9mon self-serious, bleak, or \"darker and edgier\".* I'm fine with a Pok\u00e9mon Origins-type tone sometimes. Something fitting Pok\u00e9mon Apok\u00e9lypse, however? That's not really my cup of tea.\n\n\u2620 *Fixating on game mechanics (mechanics of levels, stats, movesets, IVs, etc).*\n\n\u2620 *Enforcing the games' \"Four Moves of Doom\" limit.* Considering the anime doesn't and the games only do so for the sake of memory, why should we? :P Let's just have it so a Pok\u00e9mon can use--and learn--any of their given moves (which could be part of a plot in itself).\n\n\u2620 *Dry or one-sentence battle descriptions.* I'm certainly not demanding every single nuance receive a paragraph, but I **am** requesting partners be willing to describe moves and battles much like the anime. Just writing/reading *\"(Name of Pok\u00e9mon) used (name of attack)!\"* all the time gets boring, you know?\n\nI have a few general and open-ended ideas here to set the stage, but I'm certainly open to hearing yours...\n\n\u25d3 **The typical Pok\u00e9mon journey** is always a classic fave, our characters just traveling and having highspirited adventures fitting the series in general. (In this case, I'd prefer an *in media res* approach where both our characters are already fairly seasoned and experienced, bringing up their greenhorn days if needed.) Perhaps our characters have been traveling a long time together, or have just started doing so.\n\n\u25d3 **Perhaps one of our characters are a member of Team \\[fill-in-the-blank\\] while the other's a trainer they're tailing for whatever reason**, but they end up battling on a regular basis and ultimately falling for each other? (Think a similar version of the dynamic Ash has with the TR trio, only with some romance added to the mix.)\n\n\u25d3 **One--or both--of our characters are Gym Leaders, Frontier Brains, Elite Four members, Team Rocket members, Top Coordinators and the like.** Maybe exploring the day-to-day deal behind being one of the greats, from training their chosen creatures to dealing with some cocky greenhorns wanting to challenge \u2018em.\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters initially meet battling over a Pok\u00e9mon.** Perhaps they each have a fair case for capture, forcing a temporary team-up if the target's exceptionally clever. Or maybe they join forces to deal with a third party trying to Pok\u00e9-block them?\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters are part of an elite academy for Pok\u00e9mon trainers.** Think Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s answer to Hogwarts or something like that.\n\nNow, I'd love to find a partner willing to play Misty, Jessie, Bianca, Fantina, Georgia, Burgundy, Delia Ketchum, or Iris from the Pokemon anime.\n\nBut there are some non-Pok\u00e9mon canon ladies I'd love to see transplanted into the setting: Mai Shiranui (*King of Fighters*); Peach, Daisy (*Mario*); Korra, Kuvira (*Legend of Korra*); Suki, Ty Lee, Azula (*Avatar*); Mai Valentine, Ishizu Ishtar (*Yugioh*).\n\nI'd possibly be open to a lady OC (I admit having a few particularly desired faceclaims). A strong-minded, confident female who is a friend, a  partner, a rival, a romantic interest or any combo platter of the above.\n\nSo if interested in this, please feel free to send me a PM!",

            "selftext": "The month of October had me feeling all kinds of spooky, and I'd been in the mood to write something creepy and supernatural. Sadly, October has come and gone, but I'm still feeling that itch that I desperately want to scratch if I can find the right partner. \n\nBetween movies like *The Witch, The Blackcoat's Daughter, Castle Rock, Hereditary, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina*, amongst other movies and TV, I've been very tempted to dive into something dark and unsettling. If it involves things like witches and demons, even better. If there is an idyllic backdrop, set somewhere rural, isolated, or has a small town feel, color me happy. As for other themes, I would love to explore manipulation, power struggles, and of course, the supernatural. I want there to be mistrust, bloody violence, up-to-no-good happenings during witching hour, gnarly creatures, summonings.\n\nAs for plots, I'm pretty open. I already have a pretty good idea of the sort of setting I might want, as already mentioned above, but the actual premise is open. Upon giving it a few minutes of quick brainstorming, here are just a few I've pulled out of my ass that we can explore further, or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**A summoning gone wrong.** The setting for this could be anywhere. My character summons a demon to do her bidding, but soon finds that he has somehow tricked her into breaking his magical binds after the fact. She makes a second deal with him (and whatever that is can be up to us) and while the two of them are off getting into trouble, she's devising a second way she can bind him again, this time by turning him into her familiar. Whether she is successful or not is debatable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Academy/boarding school setting for witches and warlocks.** I rarely play youngish characters, but after watching *The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina*, I figured the school backdrop might be a fun setting. My character could be a student or a teacher, who for some reason finds herself at odds with a powerful being (High Priest of the school, the Dark Lord/Satan himself, a famous teacher) and wants him dead (the motive I can make up, like him having placed a hex on her family line or something). But being much less magically inclined, she will need to gain his trust before getting close enough to be able to do the deed. Perhaps he senses it anyway, and ends up making it very difficult for her and/or tormenting her for it, or it backfires on her in some other way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Gritty small town crime.** Set somewhere in a pretty small town, with a beautiful backdrop of lush mountains, pristine lakes, and sprawling woods. A series of homicides have shaken the town and its residents, and a few of its supernatural entities suspect it to be the doings of a couple of witches dwelling in the depths of the forest. My character would be a witch, living under a human guise. Your character, ideally, would be an out-of-towner, perhaps a detective, or journalist, or hell, even a paranormal investigator. Perhaps there's some clashing, weird identity issues on my character's part, nasty run-ins with our wood witches - but inevitably they might be forced to work together to rid the town of these Devil worshippers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, all of that aside, there are just a few things I am looking for in a partner:\n\n* Be 21 and over. Older is even better.\n* Be alright with violence and other adult themes. I am not opposed to NSFW elements, and I don't usually require it, but for these prompts I would happily welcome it. \n* Be fairly experienced. I'll most likely ask for a writing sample to make sure we're compatible, but I want the basics (spelling, punctuation, grammar), and more. Multiple paragraphs is preferred; I write anywhere from 2-5 depending on pacing and scene.\n* Do not be apathetic. I want you to be able to take a loose premise and run with it, come up with your own ideas and help me drive things. \n* Please communicate with me. It's alright if you lose interest, or if things come up. I expect both of us to be adults and have our own lives. But if writing with me ever becomes a chore rather than something you look forward to, please let me know. Otherwise, I have no issues with telling you it's dragging and I'd rather not prolong the inevitable. \n* For these prompts, I'm not really expecting anything super long term, unless it turns out that way. It could be something that we write for a few weeks to a few months.\n* Regular replies. I'm looking for a reply every one to two days. Please do not reach out to me if that is not doable. Again, if something comes up, that's fine - just keep me in the loop.\n* Play on Discord only.\n\nLooking forward to those orange envelopes! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, Pokemon and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind). (Admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am mainly looking for as a partner. And hopefully one who has no limits, like me.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me!\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have to urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)",

I have so many OC's that I would love to RP as, either with you writing canon characters, your own original characters, or a mix. I'm even okay with having multiple threads with one of the same character (ie. connorxoc1, connorxoc2, ocxwhoeveryoulike, oc2xwhoeveryoulike, etc.) I hope that makes sense, if you'd like me to clarify further please feel free to ask!\n* I'm looking to **RP canonxoc interactions**, with preferably you RPing as the canon character(s). I can also try to RP as some canon characters as well for any canonxcanon interactions you would like, or for your own original characters as well.\n* Because of what i'm looking for, **I would prefer if my writing partners were 18+**, as I just feel weird writing and talking to kids, sorry. DBH is also a mature-rated title.\n* **I have 12+ years of writing experience** on multiple platforms including: gaiaonline, tumblr, AO3 (very briefly), and some random forums. Gaia is where I'm currently doing all my roleplaying, but I want to do **these RP's on Discord preferably, but email is also fine.**\n* I am more than happy to provide you with samples of my writing if you so desire! I **would certainly like to see some of your writing** before agreeing to anything to make sure we'll match properly. Nothing sucks more than getting excited for a RP and then realising you and your writing partner don't, well...write together well.\n* I'm fine with AU's, plotting, angst, fluff, action, drama, pairings, etc.\n\nThat's about it really, I believe. If you're interested in giving me and my writing dreams a chance, just send me a DM so we can chat and figure things out! Thank you for your consideration.",

            "selftext": "Hi, hello! My name is Bria! I\u2019ve been role playing for maybe 5 years now, maybe even more? Probably more. Maybe venturing close to double digits. It\u2019s been a while. I like to think I know what I\u2019m doing. I like to be semi-descriptive, extremely descriptive... basically, I like details and I tend to ramble... like right now. \n\nI\u2019m very chatty OOC and I can/will hook you up with pictures of a cute pitbull. I also like to quote vines and memes.. all of the time. \n\nMy phone is always on me at work so I\u2019m very easy to get ahold of most days. \n\nI like my roleplay partner to also be literate. I get it. We all have typos. We all make mistakes.... but if it\u2019s constant, every single response.. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll work out.\n\nAlso, please don\u2019t ghost. I\u2019d rather you bow out then just ghost me.\n\nI\u2019m a full time employee with a lot of time on my hands when I\u2019m off, plus I also like to do stuff on my breaks at work. When I\u2019m bored, I get really bored.\n\nI\u2019ve done mostly fandom, but I\u2019m open to do anything really! Completely an open book, but fandom is where I\u2019m most comfortable.\n\nThe fandoms I like/feel most comfortable in are\n\n-Harry Potter (mostly marauders! I\u2019ve played a lot as Sirius and I\u2019m also game for Golden Trio era.)\n \n-Marvel MCU! Mostly Avengers however. I\u2019ve played as Clint, T\u2019Challa, Steve, Bucky, Pietro... but I\u2019m open to play anyone and give it a try! \n\n-also the MCU on Netflix... mostly Daredevil and Punisher. \n\n-sons of anarchy cause I love me some bikers.\n\n-aaaand maybe a select few others I can\u2019t think of right now? It\u2019s too late for my brain to work  and I\u2019m killing time at work here.\n\nI usually do OC x Canon, but I am partial to canon x canon, but mostly leaning towards oc x canon. I do like to double so we each have a couple we can both play female in. It just seems fair tbh. I\u2019m all about fairness.\n\nI tend to gravitate towards MxF pairings. Nothing against LGBT+... because I myself happen to be part of the spectrum. But I just am better adept at writing MxF. I also mostly write SFW because most of the time.... I am at work. But I\u2019m also comfortable with writing NSFW. Nothing... super explicit however, because again, at work most of the time.\n\nI do use discord quite often, I\u2019m also a fan of using email. I don\u2019t have a preference. If you wanna go the discord route, sure. If you wanna go the email way, sure. Either way... feel free to message me and we can work something out! I don\u2019t bite, I promise.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, congratulations! Hope to hear from anyone who wants to role play!",

That'd be odd if magic wasn't commonplace in the world. The same can be said with all the...racial diversity. Elves and dragons in the high class, watching everyone below them suffer. The usual, looking back at history. \n\nOf course, the police force is wrapped around their fingers, the augmented officers dealing with problems that the upper class finds unsightly, or bad for themselves. One of such problems, being Ga1ahad, and his troupe of information brokers. Nothing much is really known about the infamous group, the few that have been captured keeping their mouth shuts about their boss. Though, a few did snap under pressure. The man in charge never shows himself, not wanting to get caught so easily, but most important, has never seemed to have any boundaries when it came to selling information. Everyone had a price, in his eyes. Even the people sitting on top of the world.\n\nIt was just a matter of time before he got the dirt on them he needed.\n---\n\nHiya! This is my latest brainchild. This starter/peek into this world is really sloppy, you'll have to forgive me. But anyway, onto the juicy details! Yes, the title is exactly what you think it is. I've tossed high fantasy, and a dark Cyberpunk world together. Anything goes, so long as it's within the realm of reason. The same goes with the direction of the story, in fact. \n\nAs for me, you can expect daily replies around 1-3 paragraphs each, with multiple replies a day if I'm not busy. Romance will be a *secondary* part of this, so, by all means, if that's your thing, let me know! I think that's all from me for right now, shoot me a PM if you're interested or have any questions, I'll be sure to get back to you as quickly as I can.",

            "selftext": "\nLong ago, there was nothing. \nNothing had ever existed, nothing would ever exist, and the nothing itself was nothing.\n\n\nBut then there was something, a spark of creation referred to simply by the name of \"The One Who Does\". What was nothing quickly unfolded into the complexities of existence, realities, and worlds. It was not perfect, for nothing ever was, but the Creator was satisfied. His final two creations were two beings, one might call them brothers, but that is only true in terms of their shared father. First there was the chief Overseer of existence, serving as a second in command to the Creator. He watched over existence and made sure that the flow and time and space continued as it should, and that the balance of order and chaos held firm. Next was the Servant, a younger creation who served the Creator at a closer level. He learned of the universe, documented its complexities, and fulfilled the Creator's personal wishes upon existence. \n\n\nThere came a time however, when the Creator decided to move on, to breath the spark of life into a new nothingness. Upon deciding this, he left two portions of his power behind. The first share was smaller, and went to the Overseer, who was already quite strong. The larger share went to the Servant, who was prior far weaker than the Overseer. After giving these gifts, the Creator declared the Servant to be the new ruler of existence, and charged the Overseer to serve the Servant as the Overseer had served the Creator. \n\n\nThis did not please the Overseer however, and once the Creator had left he rose in rebellion against the newly crowned Servant, believing that what he had been robbed of what rightfully belonged to him.\n\n\nThe newly crowned Servant was inexperienced with his powers, inexperienced in leadership, and was caught utterly unaware by the rebellion. Thus began a game of cat and mouse, with the Overseer pursing the Servant and his creations across the entirety of existence. The horizon was grim for the Servant, and he nearly fell many times. Eventually the Servant came to decided they would never win the way things were, and that a sacrifice would have to be made. It would be a risky sacrifice, and one he could not be certain of the outcome of. But it was the only thing he believed could have any effect, and so it was done.\n\n\nWelcome to the Chronicles of Light and Dark, a story of gods and mortals hopefully unlike anything you've ever experienced before! The Chronicles of Light and Dark is a minimum semi literate RP detailing the story of 12 individuals who have been plucked from their worlds and sent into a strange series of events. Throughout this tale both your characters and your worlds will develop and change, though for better or for worse will have to be seen. \n\n\nThe question is, are you interested?It is necessary for you to have (or create) both a character and a world behind said character, whether it be original or a pre-existing one (ie from a fandom). Daily participation of some form is generally desired, and this RP is *Very* long term. There is no determined genre to this RP, as it spans across many. The RP floor is set at semi literate and above. Also, the RP base timezone is EST, so it\u2019s advised that you only attempt to join if you can plan around that. Finally, it's required that you be at least 16. This is a hard limit, and if you are found to be lying about your age you *will* be booted immediately. \n\nIf you think you're up for this, shoot me a PM and I'll shoot you a discord invite so we can give you a look. Just be aware the standards are a bit high, but if you think you can meet them we\u2019d be glad to have you!",

Ideally, I would like it to have drama and a sturdy storyline to keep it interesting and long-term. I expect good grammar, (or I can't enjoy the writing,) and for there to be a good flow..No bland work, I like something that'd flow with imagery..It really opens up to me. :) \n\nThank you for reading, PM me any ideas that you have or if you want to brainstorm with me, send me your Discord and we can get thinking together.\n\nHave a good day,\n\nLauren.

            "selftext": " \n\nhey,\n\nfirst of all thanks for reading my post, I guess my headline was interesting enough xD. To get to the point I am really looking forward to doing a Star Wars romance roleplay. I am a huge Star Wars fan especially the EU (Legends) and would love to find a partner who is into that as well. My favorite Star Wars eras are either the clone wars, the dark times (between Episode 3 and 4), the Kotor games or the old republic. Personally I sadly dislike episode 7 and 8 which is why I don't want to have the rp set in that era. If you like that I am happy for you but this might not be the roleplay you are looking for so ... move along.\n\nSome ideas I've had which could be interesting, of course, we can also always use an idea you have:\n\nImperial Spy x RebelSet during the dark times an Imperial Spy managed to get into a Rebel Cell, constantly sending reports about their activities. One day she gets put into a squad with some other rebels. One of them, in particular, is really interesting to her and she eventually falls in love with her. Now she is conflicted with her duty to the empire and her love for the rebel.\n\nJedi x Bounty hunter\n\nThis would be set during the clone wars. At the end of the clone wars, the republic gets desperate using more and more bounty hunters and smugglers for their purposes. A young Jedi is forced to team up with one of those Bounty hunters. She at first really dislikes the idea of working with basic criminals. Luckily for her, the bounty hunter is there during Order 66 and saves her from some of her fellow clones. After that, they are on their own and eventually a romantic relationship develops, while they try to find their place in this reformed galaxy.\n\nSith master x Dark JediWar has broken out during the old republic. One young prodigy padawan, always finishing exams and trials as the class best, has enough of stupid training. Especially since a war just started so she steals herself onto a battleship which is heading from Tython towards a war zone. This ship is being attacked by a Sith fleet. The crew get's killed including the Jedi master and the Sith Lord leading the attack breaks the young Jedi. She becomes a dark Jedi seeing reason in the Sith philosophy and understanding that they are not just demons because they use their emotions to her advantage. Now being the apprentice of the sith lord they grow closer and eventually become lovers as well.\n\nWell, I hope we will roleplay soon just message me on Reddit don't be shy &lt;3.\n\nAnd remember may the force be with you ... always.\n\n(Palpatine voice) No ... Noooo ... fulfill your destiny ...",

Pretty much players get the opportunity to act as members of Parliament and draft bills and propositions which are then voted on. Parliament determines every feature of the After Action Report after voting sessions I then go along and play Stellaris and carry out the requests of Parliament.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where Can I Read This After Action Report?** \n\nYou can access the After Action Report in the Paradox Interactive Forums which is where I make bi-daily updates on the situation of the game. These forums can be found down below. \n\n[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-patrian-republic-a-semi-interactive-aar.1125277/](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-patrian-republic-a-semi-interactive-aar.1125277/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Want To Be An Active Member in the After Action Report Or just watch Parliament Up Close?** \n\nIf you are interested in participating or learning more about the AAR then feel free to join the Discord Server linked down below and check out the IAAR Stellaris section which includes rules as well as Parliamentary Conversations. \n\n[https://discord.gg/SXrCcmn](https://discord.gg/SXrCcmn)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Elections**\n\nEvery ten years in game (usually weekly IRL) we do elections that determine the composition of the political parties within Parliament. These elections are the life and blood of the Roleplay and we want as many people to vote as humanly possible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Political Parties in this Years Elections**\n\nListed down below is a small list of all of the Political Parties participating in this  years Elections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*United Patrian Front \\[U.P.F\\]*\n\nCurrently holds the most seats within Parliament controlling 36%. The Party believes in the maintenance of a capable navy that can deal with any threats as well as non-stop expansion in every direction. The United Patrian Front currently controls both Parliament and the Chancellorship and is responsible for quadrupling the economy of the Patrian Republic as well as expanding the galactic borders of the Republic tremendously. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n *The Social Progressivist Confederation \\[S.P.C.\\]*\n\nThe S.P.C. currently holds that second largest majority within parliament controlling 22% and has been a close cooperator with the U.P.F. they believe in healthcare for all and believe that in the event that alien species are to be discovered then it is detrimental we take the diplomatic route with said aliens to ensure peace.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n *The Humanity Protection Front*  \n\nThe Humanity Protection Front currently controls 14% of Parliament and  believes that the discovery of Sentient Aliens is all but guaranteed and that said aliens will pose a massive threat to the Republic if mankind does not prepare itself properly.

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 19, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 19, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\nThemes marked with an [X] are my primary genres.\n\n\u2022 Real Life Romance [X]\n\n\u2022 Fantasy\n\n\u2022 Sci-Fi [X]\n\n\u2022 Mecha [X]\n\n\u2022 Halo [X]\n\n\u2022 Elder Scrolls\n\n\u2022 Destiny [X]\n\n\u2022 Superhero [X]\n\n\u2022 Apocalypse\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon!

With that being said, this is Earthland as you have never known it. Your story starts in the Kingdom of Fiore. Once upon a time, about 300 years ago there was a Dragon civil war which wrecked havoc all across the world, but most notably in the Kingdom of Fiore. The human populace had few means to fight back. There were dragon slayers but they were hardly a match for actual dragons. When the war began coming to a close, most of the Dragon slayers had died, only a few remaining, these weapons of war went their separate ways. Over time the world would begin to rebuild and bring structure and order to a world left in chaos. However even though the world was getting back on it's feet, it was far from peaceful. There were still the occasional dragons, though not all meant harm, humans did their best to kill them out of fear. Adding onto the troubles there were also roaming bands or bandits and marauders. To combat these criminals, people who had the innate ability to use magic, banded together to fight them. Eventually Magic Guilds would form and jobs of varying degrees and and parameters would be taken to help the citizens. Those who would still rather prey on the normal everyday civilians would also come together forming Dark Magic and otherwise Guilds to combat the Legal wizard guilds. And so Dark Guilds were born. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://discord.gg/AET6nnN](https://discord.gg/AET6nnN)",

That'd be odd if magic wasn't commonplace in the world. The same can be said with all the...racial diversity. Elves and dragons in the high class, watching everyone below them suffer. The usual, looking back at history. \n\nOf course, the police force is wrapped around their fingers, the augmented officers dealing with problems that the upper class finds unsightly, or bad for themselves. One of such problems, being Ga1ahad, and his troupe of information brokers. Nothing much is really known about the infamous group, the few that have been captured keeping their mouth shuts about their boss. Though, a few did snap under pressure. The man in charge never shows himself, not wanting to get caught so easily, but most important, has never seemed to have any boundaries when it came to selling information. Everyone had a price, in his eyes. Even the people sitting on top of the world.\n\nIt was just a matter of time before he got the dirt on them he needed.\n&gt;\nHiya! This is my latest brainchild. This starter/peek into this world is really sloppy, you'll have to forgive me. But anyway, onto the juicy details! Yes, the title is exactly what you think it is. I've tossed high fantasy, and a dark Cyberpunk world together. Anything goes, so long as it's within the realm of reason. The same goes with the direction of the story, in fact. \n&gt;\nAs for me, you can expect daily replies around 1-3 paragraphs each, with multiple replies a day if I'm not busy. Romance will be a *secondary* part of this, so, by all means, if that's your thing, let me know! I think that's all from me for right now, shoot me a PM if you're interested or have any questions, I'll be sure to get back to you as quickly as I can.",

I have a full time job and a life so I am not necessarily looking for someone who post all the time but a post a day would be ideal. I am hoping to find someone who likes quality story telling rather then just trying to get somewhere. I like to generally write three-five paragraphs. If you don\u2019t think that you could do that, then we are probably not a good match. I understands that sometimes there will be more or less depending on what\u2019s going on. I will be providing a sample that I have used for roleplays before and would expect one as well. \n\nIt is nice a writing partner adds to the story. I am tired of feeling like I am the only one to move things along. We are writing together. If I wanted to control every single thing I would just be writing a book. \n\nI generally do romance themed roleplay but would be open to platonic. The pairings I like and are good at is f/f and I would have to be convinced with a good story to do f/m. \n\n\nNow I what do I like to roleplay? I don\u2019t currently have anything that I\u2019m craving. I will put a small list of things that I have done and have plots or ideas for. \n\nHistorical: Any time period, even alternative history\nSlice of life\nModern fantasy(think witch and demon)\n\n\nShot me a PM if you are interested!\n",

JUST DM ME :)\\**\n\nI am 32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job during the week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is to roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters (IRL gender doesn't matter).\n\nPlease be prepared for picture usage. I've done writing descriptions for a while, but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon Age, etc. Anything else unlisted is better to bring them my way and see if I know them. If any above appeal, feel free to come my way.\n\nSome literacy at a minimum makes me happy, third person only, past tense. I am also VERY reasonable with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I am very nice, I promise, and I want to get niceties out of people in turn. Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a chance! Treat people the way you want to be treated, right?\n\nI do work during the day, so posting will be sporadic, but I am good at night and on weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day or more.\n\nI am usually on from sometime in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours. I hope to talk to all of you soon! :)",

I'm looking for a partner to play any canon character from DC, Marvel, Image, Valiant, IDW, or Dark Horse. I am capable of roleplaying the following characters: Invincible, Tempest, Red Robin, Timothy Hunter, Robin, Ninjak, Hawk, Marko, Spider-Man, Shazam, Batman Beyond, Red Hood, Mister Miracle, Kyle Rayner, Ted Kord, Zachary Zatara, Jaime Reyes, and a few others. The characters listed offer a broad range for genres and scenarios. \n\nNow let's go onto the boring rules part of the post. I ask that my partner be very literate and able to write quite a bit. I absolutely love having a bunch of details. I also ask that you be open to any NSFW themes. I do enjoy not having limits to the roleplay experience since it allows me to fully involve myself in my character's role. I hope I don't sound too demanding!\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message. I look forward to exploring some comic book worlds!",

            "selftext": " \n\nI posted this about 8 months ago, and I am now back to looking!\n\nI am an amateur roleplayer who is desperate to expand my horizons and experiences. I have a great imagination, so the work will not be all put on my teacher/partner, but I will need him or her to start us off. I'm not quite sure what to put here so I'll try and post what I deem to be important information. Please pm me or post here with any questions.\n\nAge: 30\n\nRequirements: Please be 18+\n\nExperience: 3 years of RP within various games followed by 4 years of sporadic long-term 1-on-1 with the same partner.\n\nRP Type Preferred: Third-Person, world-building, not because I am stubborn but because I have no knowledge in popular fandoms and it would be a struggle.\n\nCharacters: I can play any characters, both male and female. I don't mind fantasy characters at all and I find them intensely interesting. Even the more out there options are okay. My partner/teacher can play any character and any gender they desire. No pickiness or preferences.\n\nRP Medium: I would prefer email, google doc or discord.\n\nLength: Can easily write a few lines to a few paragraphs, but I will match my partner to the best of my ability. Please excuse any moments of excitement where I write a couple paragraphs.\n\nFrequency: I very much prefer post-style as opposed to real-time RP. It allows my partner and myself to get in replies when free instead of trying to fit in some continuously present sessions. Once every day or so is perfect. More is definitely okay.\n\nRomance preferences: Romance and the like is not at all off-limits, but any RP should not consist solely of smut. It is hard to hold my interest in roleplays that feel like a never ending date with no excitement or adventure to be found. The theme of romance is perfectly acceptable however.\n\nWhat I expect from you: Leadership, patience and communication. Daily replies are not necessary or expected but appreciated.",

Fantasy, modern day, Steampunk, Various historical eras... I\u2019m open to some fandoms as well, though I\u2019m only interested in playing original characters within those sorts of pre-existing worlds. (Please feel free to browse my profile for more specific scenarios and interests of mine!) Really, I\u2019m pretty willing to try anything that allows us to come up with an interesting, character driven plot. I\u2019ve always felt that where I excel most is with character creation and development, which I think you will find is reflected in my style of roleplay once we get started.\n\nI\u2019m not opposed for there to be darker themes and/or NSFW elements, but I\u2019m not looking for pointless boinking that doesn\u2019t fit in with the story we\u2019re trying to tell. My views on romance are similar - I'm a sucker for romance and would love to incorporate it. Still, it needs to work with the plot.\n\nI prefer to play in 3rd person, and quality is, of course, more important than quantity. That being said, you can expect an average of three paragraphs from me. Sometimes, more. Sometimes, less. (Probably considerably more when we\u2019re in the earlier stages, setting the scene and introducing characters and the like). Ultimately, it depends on the flow of the scene.\n\nThe medium that I find works best for me is Discord, but I am open to other services upon request!\n\nWell, I think that covers the basics?

This fort has been repurposed by wizards to house students. The fort itself is where the dorms are largely kept meanwhile the island is where the actual school is.  \n\n\nWe have had to make minor additions to the lore of the world to support this location. This includes adding creatures from the lore of the land as well as including new RPable races.  \n\n\nCome check out the RP! We're all excited to meet you and form bonds with you as students and teachers!  \n[https://discord.gg/VCxx2Fj](https://discord.gg/VCxx2Fj)",

Would you believe I had more when I started typing this?\n\nStill, like I said, I'd be happy to do things if you have anything in mind, and I'm always down to make completely new plot types and work with genres I have no experience with yet.\n\nI roleplay in third person, and I try to give at least a few paragraphs when I can, but I understand that paragraphs won't always be viable depending on the scene. I'm active fairly often, and it's fine if you aren't, but if you're gonna disappear for a bit, give me a heads up and we can work around whatever it is, because I know how it can be, life comes first, all that stuff.\n\nNSFW is a possibility, so anyone responding please be 18+.\n\nI welcome people both new to roleplaying and old hands, so if you're interested in what I have to show and wanna try setting something up with me, I'd be happy to see what we can do!

            "selftext": " \n\nHey there, 19 M here, I'd love to find a buddy thats equally into Roleplaying as me, preferably someone that is willing to play as F (we can switch position). I'm pretty detailed when it comes to Roleplay so I'd love for you to be equally detailed. I am a switch and pretty much willing to play dom F/M and Sub F/M. I've been Roleplaying actively for the past few years and I'd say I'm a pretty capable and extensive writer, so I am preferably looking someone that is similar.\n\nKinks including: Degradation, anal, outercourse, grinding, teasing, dirty talk, humiliation, public, dressing up, corruption, ageplay, incest, Body modification, Magic...\n\nAs for the settings, I'm available to plenty of different universes, be that: - Modern - Sci-fi - Fantasy - Canon Worlds (WoW, League of Legends, Overwatch, Borderlands, Starcraft...)\n\nIn general I prefer a decent amount of build up, if that is a given, even the most mundane or clich\u00e9 settings can be pretty fun, be that teacher and student or room mates. For that, I usually like if we get a bit unrealistic here and there even, a bit of modification is always something I enjoy, be that mentally or physically from growing assets to full on gender transformation. Things like that are by no means a requirement, but I rather mean to say that I'm available and would be happy to do some more open, creative and unrealistic scenes and settings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn regards to the characters, I love using both real life references and drawn ones, celebrities and canons as visual reference work as well and I'd be equally interested in playing out Dm'd adventures as I have made a decent amount of experience with a smut-centric DM journey as well, however, I prefer a male hero in that case.\n\nIf you're interested, PM for my Discord.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm Cas and I'm looking for partners that are at least 21+ as that's old my age range. Mature themes will be in my plots though limits will be discussed. I write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn't have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having long, thoughtful replies back where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and writing as I am, and please don't make come up with everything by myself. It's frustrating. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance, using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship.\n\nLast but not least, I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. **I\u2019m mainly looking for female authors writing male characters** but male authors are fine too.\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n21+ partners\n\nFor you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character. (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies or those who English isn't thier first language).\n\nFor you to write as a male in their 30s-40s and older. I'm a sucker for the gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. The broken ones who are rough around the edges and aren't afraid to throw a punch. But are tender enough provide a hug if needed.\n\nThe more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs, preferably more) and really bring the story to life.\n\nThe use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\nSomeone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post or before it. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\nI love all types of genres, but especially urban fantasy and science fiction. Lately I\u2019ve been wanting something based off The X Files and/or Red Dead Redemption. All my characters will be adults and I require my partners do the same.\n\nFor plot ideas, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and possibly writing. Look forward to hearing from you!",
