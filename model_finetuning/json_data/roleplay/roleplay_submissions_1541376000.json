I roleplay through the kik messaging app or we can instant message on Reddit. Please be a great descriptive person to make it as real as possible!\n\nMy kik is: SpankingDiscipline\n\n**NON-SEXUAL PLAY**\n\nI would like the scene to be you coming home from work or me coming home from school and you being completely tired of me not doing my chores and having a terrible attitude. In order to teach me a lesson you decide that my punishment should include spanking, mouth soaping, and babying, I'm also okay with milking if the circumstances are right. For the babying punishment you decide to treat me like a baby again since I cant't act my age. This would include diapering, feeding, bathing, etc.\n\nSo, if you're a dominant girl interested in playing this strict mommy please don't hesitate to kik me! :)",

Something romantic but nonsexual, something cuddly and happy and snuggly. I know it's not for everyone but I'm just looking for someone who'd want to give it a shot. I roleplay third person paragraph style and I can play either a man or a woman. I prefer to work over PM or Discord but I'm openminded. If you'd like we can discuss plots and scenarios over PM :) And if you'd like to try a fandom we can discuss it! I'm open to trying a fandom, perhaps Overwatch! Or My Hero Academia since I just got into that! I know they\u2019re real life people but maybe something with the Rooster Teeth personalities, I\u2019m open :) if you have a fandom you wanna suggest please do! Also I would like a partner is 18+. Just personal preference! Hope to hear from you soon!",

Depends on what you want to play. Although, I'm interested in playing the master where I summon you to be my servant to fight in the grail war. We can use heroic spirits used in the fate series or we could make one up. :P\nAnyways, pm me and we can talk details later. Please be 18+ as I would like mature stuff in the story. I hope I find someone! :)",

Don't message me offering up Ronon or Sheppard, or any other non-Wraith, canon or OC. While I'm open to other Wraith aside from Todd, including OCs, I'm going to be prioritizing him over any others.**\n\n\n* My character will be human, though that's probably a big ol' *duh*. Her inclusion will turn things into a bit of an AU situation, but I promise it's not too far-fetched/out of line of SG:A's general feel.\n\n* As the title suggests, I'm currently looking for *Todd* the most and would absolutely adore it if someone could write for him against my OC. I *am* open to other canon Wraith, such as *Steve*, *Erik*, *Rhys*, *Edgar* (oh look, Christopher Heyerdahl again!), *Shawn* (the food-obsessed one from season two, fifth episode), and *Eddie*, and most of the other named ones I haven't listed proper, within reason (there are some that're just great big *no's*, like Michael). And even *OCs*, particularly ones that are *based* (at least as far as appearance is concerned) on canon Wraith.\n\n* Yes, **long-term** too. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy one-shot wonders. But, if you\u2019re no longer feeling the RP, I can understand the desire to stop. I can also understand life getting in the way of replying. Just tell me if you\u2019d like to stop, or if you might not be able to reply. Definitely try to give me a heads up if you won't be able to reply soonish.\n\n* I only RP over **Discord**, **Telegram**, and *very hesitantly* Skype. You might be able to convince me to use something else, but I can just about guarantee I\u2019m not gonna use email, and I'm *very tentatively* open to using notes/PMs.\n\n* I do expect **NSFW/Mature/18+/21+** themes. Plot and character development over *one particular gritty subject*, obviously, but it's still expected and not something I'm willing to gut. If you're not of age, then *please* do not contact me.\n\n* I don\u2019t have many limits, and the ones I do have are rather commonplace ones that I feel most people share. Keep in mind that while I don\u2019t have very many limits, I am still rather *plain*. I\u2019m willing to incorporate certain *things*, as I have a few of my own that I enjoy, and I\u2019m willing to listen to what you might like as well, within reason. Grittier details will (hopefully) be discussed after contact details are given, or in PM. \n\n* I RP *third person*, past tense, and am capable of cranking out 12-14 paragraphs. Sometimes *more*, sometimes *less*, but no fewer than 2-3 paragraphs. I *don\u2019t* expect you to match me, but please don\u2019t throw one-liners at me. I need something to work with, and it's super discouraging to crank out 6+ paragraphs and get practically nothing in return.\n\n* I love details, and I love fluff, but what I really adore is stuff I can genuinely reply to. Give me things that convey emotion and I\u2019ll love you to bits!\n\n* I can double or do a split RP of your choosing, if either would 'sweeten the pot\u2019. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Keep in mind that I'm a little rusty when it comes to writing for *two* main characters, but I will most certainly try.\n\nI\u2019m online more often than not, at all hours of the day, so catching me shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue.

            "selftext": " \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat\u2019s up roleplayers! I\u2019m commonly known as \u201cThe Tolkien Black Guy\u201d, \u2018cause I\u2019m that *one* nerdy black friend in my group of friends. Anywho! I\u2019ve been roleplaying for a little over a year now and I\u2019m looking for an eager, advanced and literate roleplayer who loves worldbuilding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Timezone***  \nI live in the mountain standard time zone! As I\u2019ve stated before, I have a desk job which allows me a lot of free time during the day to write and bounce ideas off one another! However, I won\u2019t be available from 1700 MST to 2000 MST on Mondays through Thursdays, making Fridays the freest weekdays for roleplay! However, being that we both would have our own schedules we can always sit down and talk about what times would work the best for us!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Length***  \nI do quite a bit of writing in my free time and what with NaNoWriMo being upon us, that level of writing has jumped through the roof. I\u2019ll have carpal tunnel in *no time*. That being said, I tend to write paragraphs upon paragraphs upon content--I tend to write anywhere between 500 to 1000+ words per post. It may seem daunting which is why I\u2019d like a partner who can write at least 500 words *minimum* per post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Frequency of Reply***                                                                                                                                                                                                          500 words is a lot to try and crank out all the time! So, I\u2019d like a partner who can do at minimum one 500 word post a week. Anything more than that would be outstanding, of course. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Worldbuilding and Storytelling***                                                                                                                                                                          Now we\u2019re getting to the fun part! One of my favourite parts of roleplaying is the worldbuilding. I like to create playlists based on the story itself and I scroll through Pinterest for visual inspiration. Now, this isn\u2019t something that you would have to do. But you should be ready to dive headlong into deep world building. Everything from cultures, to starship classifications, to rituals to magic systems. Worldbuilding is a huge part of beautiful storytelling and this should be something that you\u2019re prepared to do.   \nAlso, I ask that you be ready to play several characters at once. I\u2019d like us to have a handful of characters that play and move and interact with one another as the story continues to develop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Genre***                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I\u2019m not very picky about the genre. I\u2019m a huge nerd--as my moniker would suggest--and I love all substyles of sci-fi and fantasy. However, I\u2019m not huge on slice-of-life. It\u2019s not a route that interests me. I\u2019m very \u201caction\u201d oriented in my storytelling and love a good conflict that doesn\u2019t just involved people just standing around shouting at each other because grandma didn\u2019t leave an inheritance for the eldest grandson. If we go down that route I\u2019d much rather we set it in the vacuum of space with laser fire zipping past us. \n\nI already have a few stories in mind that I\u2019d love to play out, but I\u2019d also like to hear what\u2019s up your sleeve!\n\nI don\u2019t do fandom roleplays. I\u2019d much rather us create our own fandom!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Contact***  \nLast but not least is the preferred method of contact. I can use Discord and Google Docs! I prefer using Discord for quick, zippy communication and we can either create a separate server for the story itself or we can use Google Docs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Friendship***  \nThis is also an important thing to me. I find that the better roleplayers get along with one another, the easier it is for the ebb and flow of a story. In between throwing around ideas, worldbuilding, and plot setting I\u2019d like to build a friendship with my partner!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Closing***  \nIn closing, I\u2019d like to have an advanced, literate and long-term roleplaying partner and friend. Someone I can build strange and beautiful worlds with for a long time. Someone who will I can call my brother or sister in pen and ink and someone I can call my friend. If this sounds like you, I\u2019d love to hear from you! Tell me a bit about yourself!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Congratulations! If you read this all the way through, you\u2019re probably the kind of person I\u2019m looking for. So tell me, who is your favourite superhero?* ",

I\u2019ll say now that I have watched the anime up to its current point, but I haven\u2019t read the manga, though I honestly wouldn\u2019t care if I got some spoilers. \n\nI\u2019m looking to play as an OC, and you can play either an OC or as a canon character. I can handle playing multiple characters at once if needed. \n\nI had a few ideas for possible story prompts. We can discuss these in reddit messages or once we move to discord. Anyways, my ideas: \n\n1) my character is an American exchange student who joins class 1A at some point in the story, possibly replacing a canon character if he\u2019s brought in right at the start. \n\n2) still an American exchange student, but this is in an alternate version of MHA where most (if not all) of the canon characters don\u2019t exist. Good if you have a bunch of OCs and can\u2019t choose just one. \n\n3) my character is a professional hero from America that is now working for a hero agency in japan with you, either an aged-up canon character or an OC. \n\n4) something involving the league of villains. I haven\u2019t thought of anything good for this one, but the idea is out there. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, feel free to send me a reddit message, and we can figure things out from there!",

I see lots of posts cause I\u2019m subscribed and it slowly builds up my desire to try once more to roleplay myself. I am a pretty busy person, so if you\u2019re looking for consistent daily replies I doubt I will be able to do that for you. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for someone more laid back/patient. I\u2019m very shy and socially anxious so I would very much like to find an extrovert who would enjoy engaging me and drawing me out. I promise I have a lot of substance, intelligence, and writing skill to make this effort worth your time.\n\nI write fanfiction for fun, and I know I have good writing skills, definitely above average, so I\u2019m looking for a partner who can give me the same. I always feel *so* awkward when I don\u2019t like someone\u2019s writing style and I don\u2019t know how to say so without sounding pretentious, so if you could show me some of your writing style when you message me I\u2019d appreciate it. Sorry if I don\u2019t reply, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I didn\u2019t like your writing, sometimes I get busy and things slip through the cracks.\n\nAs for content of the RP: I like fantasy and supernatural elements above all. Sci fi is possible, I like it sometimes and not others, but your enthusiasm can definitely influence my interest. I like magic/gods/supernatural creatures. I like romance/smut when it\u2019s well placed in the storyline, and I like dark themes like violence/gore/horror, nothing is really *too much* for me, let\u2019s run through some ideas.

            "selftext": "\"Hoh!\" The choked noise came with a quick sidestep, crunching the snow under her boots. \"That woulda been a bitch.\" She leaned over, peering downward, and carefully kicked away the snow to reveal a steel-jaw trap. Small enough for a coyote or a lynx to get caught up in, probably not big enough to break her foot, not through her winter boots, but it'd probably send her into a flurry of expletives.\n\nMore importantly, right now it was illegal. Trapping season ended a week ago, which was why she was traipsing around in the snow today. Any traps set now were either forgotten and the animal would be wasted, or the trapper was operating outside regulations. Given the undisturbed nature of the snow around the trap, evident by the fact she'd nearly walked right into it, she guessed this was a care of the former. Some hunters were fastidious about their traps, others were less conscientious. She took a knee and dug out the trap until she found the spring lever on the bottom that would close the jaws without snapping shut on her fingers. Then, she shrugged off the pack she'd been carrying, from which she took a pair of bolt cutters. The padlock securing the trap's chain to the tree broke quickly in the bitter cold. Both the trap and the bolt cutters were placed in her back, joining two others she'd already found. If she had to bet, they'd all probably come from the same negligent trapper.\n\nHoisting the pack back on her shoulders, she pushed onward, up the gradual slope. Over this rise there was another stand of trees she wanted to track through, especially since she'd already found three illegal traps.\n\nImmediately, she sat it. A flash of red against the near-monotone snowscape. She stopped suddenly, brows furrowed, pale eyes squinting against the light reflecting off the snow. Was it an animal? A person? The pack was off her shoulders again, this time a pair of binoculars were produced. The first distinct shape she was was a boot, dark against pure white, after that the rest of the form started to make sense. Someone on their stomach, wearing camouflage. She didn't see any gear, no backpack, no visible weapon.\n\nWhat was someone doing this far from the highway with nothing? Regardless, her first corse of action was to find the radio tucked inside her jacket.\n\n\"Central this is 847.\" It was possible this deep in the hills she wouldn't get reception, but sitting at the top of a rise gave her confidence.\n\nThe response came through clear, \"847 go ahead.\"\n\nShe shouldered her bag again and started down the hill, right hand resting on the handgun at her side. \"I'm comin' down into Moher Valley. Got what might be a 10-39, haven't gotten down there yet, but I'm seein' a lotta blood and they aren't movin'.\"\n\n\"10-4, any description on the individual?\"\n\nPrompted, she hesitated and brought the binoculars to her eyes again, looking towards the body, hoping that she might see it stirring. \"Negative, Central. Looks like they're wearing camo, but they're face down in the snow.\"\n\n\"10-4, do you want me to start medical 847?\"\n\n\"Negative for now, let me see what we got first.\"\n\n----\n\nHey all, here I am again with a little story and some hope to find an interested party. This little slice was heavily influenced by the movie Wind River, so if you've seen it you might have an idea of the vibe I'm going for. I envision my character as a wildlife state trooper (in what state is up for grabs), initially in the area doing a little after-season clean up, who stumbles upon the dead body of a hunter. What killed him and the implications are up in the air, as is who your character might be. Ideally, I'm imagining some kind of investigator who might need my character's help navigating the area, but let's go wild.",

Please don't push it on me, chances are that I'll get bored and leave. I \\*\\*do\\*\\* enjoy having romance incorporated into the story, and tend to lean that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I enjoy crime RPs as my OC is a criminal in the Realistic world, but any pairing will do, not just criminal x criminal. I really do enjoy law enforcement x criminal too!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- SW wise, I'm down for anything and any era! This is my favorite genre too!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I don't do Fantasy or Sci Fi other than SW.. sorry!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRules:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Please please please be literate!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I tend to write longer posts, especially in the beginning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I do have a busy schedule, but I try to reply every day as much as I can! I'm very patient, so I hope someone else is too\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Please write in 3rd person! I can't really work with 1st person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Communication is important and I'm flexible with ideas! I kind of plan ahead but not a lot to limit the story completely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- NSFW/Romance is welcome, but please build it up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I tend to play my characters realistically, which might involve some darker themes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Common sense is the best rule!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- \\*\\*\\*I only use Discord\\*\\*\\* and making your own servers for RP might make me reply a bit slower (I tend to have notifications off for servers since I'm in so many..), but I'll do either!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm very open to ideas, suggestions, plots, pairings, and well, anything.",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm a 27 year old housewife with a part time job looking to get into RPing again. I've been doing it for about 15 years, fell off the bandwagon due to work, but now that I have more downtime, I wanna get back into the swing of things.\n\nFor medium, I only do Discord. Pretty much because I hate anything mobile. It's that simple.\n\nGenres: I don't have anything too specific. My favorite is fantasy (dark and gritty, high fantasy, etc.), though I'm not opposed to a really good sci-fi, dystopian, or modern story. I'm not huge into fandoms (I know the basics like Harry Potter, Star Wars, a little bit of Supernatural) but the only onee I can honestly play without having my browser constantly on wikipedia are HP and Game of Thrones (my personal favorite). \n\nThe only thing I'm not really into is smut. I'm married and any smut should be non-existant or tasteful and minimal, at most. I'd prefer if romance is a part of the story that it would have a sort of \"fade to black\" kind of moment.\n\nI generally play as one character, though can sometimes play more if needed. I prefer to focus on the main, though. \n\nDespite sounding so stingy, I'm really laid back with plot and whatnot. I'm a go-with-the-flow type RPer. If you're a DM type, even better. My last partner (we RPed for about 3 years) was one of those and we pretty much had a whole book by the end of it. \n\nI can do first or third person, but my only requirement is literacy. I'm an English major, so things like poor grammar annoy me. I can generally overlook minor errors, but as a whole you should be able to type well enough to be understood clearly.\n\nSo if it sounds like I fill a gap that you're looking for, send me a message and we can hash out details.

            "selftext": "Hi guys! \n\nI have been playing a lot of Red Dead Redemption 2 lately and my muse for a western styled roleplay is high. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 28-year-old guy living in GMT +1. Partners need to be above the age of 18 because there's no way I'd feel comfortable writing mature content with minors. I do want the roleplay to contain explicit violence and smut as long as it's not the main focus of the story. It would be best if you have Discord so we can discuss plots and stories there but I'd prefer to do the roleplay on google docs because I'm not a fan of Discord's character limit. I always seem to hit that and I get annoyed with having to split my posts into pieces. I'm also a sucker for faceclaims but I'm not the kind of person who will spam you with edits or gifs. I just really like to have a mental image of what mine and your character look like when interacting with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a historical (1870-1890) wild west roleplay. I would love to play the female part in an F/M ship. I have a few ideas for a story we could do; maybe tomboy girl meets a tough cowboy who doesn't want to settle down? Maybe they're both in a gang of criminals together and sorta always hated each other but start developing feelings for one another when they're forced to work together? Maybe she's a pleasure girl at a saloon and he tries to convince her to come run away with him? I can probably think of some more and I'm totally willing to brainstorm ideas with you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested, send me a pm with your Discord id and I'd be happy to add you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I've had a few people contact me on here before who referred to their characters as \"me\" and people who wanted to be a gamemaster toward my characters. Please know that I'm not looking for either of these. If this is your style of roleplay, that is completely fine, but we need to be on the same page and both have fun here. It would be best if we have our own characters and control their actions ourselves, - heck, I'm even willing to play multiple characters to further along the story with you!)",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least. \n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP! \n\nThemes marked with an [X] are my primary genres.\n\n\u2022 Real Life Romance [X]\n\n\u2022 Fantasy\n\n\u2022 Sci-Fi [X]\n\n\u2022 Mecha [X]\n\n\u2022 Halo [X]\n\n\u2022 Elder Scrolls\n\n\u2022 Destiny [X]\n\n\u2022 Superhero [X]\n\n\u2022 Apocalypse\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon! Thanks again for taking the time to read my post! See you soon!",

            "selftext": "   Hey there!!! I'm out here looking for anyone interested in a fantasy-styled roleplay centered around a dungeon-delving system. Our roleplay would be based on our characters travelling throughout a dungeon with multiple floors and rooms in each floor, along with some-sort of boss every few rooms (or at the very end).\n\n   For this roleplay, I'm looking for anyone with a literate writing style and a love for fantasy-styled roleplays!!! More specifically, I'm in need of someone who can play the Dungeon Master, or the person who controls the world the roleplay is based in. You would control what happens in each room, events, monsters, extra characters, the bosses, etc. If you're not interested in playing as the Dungeon Master, then still send me a message to let me know more about you and what you're looking to play as!!\n\n   For those of you who want to play one-on-one, then let me know!!! The groups are optional, and I'd love to try a roleplay with just us on any messaging software you'd like!!!\n\n   I'll be creating multiple discord groups for those of you who are interested in a group-roleplay. Below this paragraph, I'll be more specific on what each group is. When you message me here on Reddit, let me know what group you want to join and if you want to be an explorer or the DM.\n\n   1 - Vanilla. This group will be mixed with explorers of both males and females. This group will be clean of all smut, and will only include the explorers making their way through the dungeon through different means to beat the boss. Straightforward and open to everyone!!!\n\n   2 - Mixed-Smut. This group will have many explorers of both male, female, and/or futa sexes. This group can include smut or sex-scenes, but it shouldn't be the base of the roleplay.\n\n   3 - Female-Smut. This group will have exclusively female explorers, and the DM will be given the power to do as they please in the dungeon. This may be mainly smut-based, but the DM could have clean elements.\n\n   Send me a message here on Reddit with what group you want to join and what role you want to fill. If you're interested in DMing a roleplay with just me and you, then let me know!!! Unfortunately, if all DM positions are filled, then you might have to settle with a one-on-one roleplay. Lets try to fill every group!!",

            "selftext": "Hi guys!  \n\n\nJust like the Cranberries, zombies are what's in my head lately. I'm looking to play a relatively dark post apocalyptic story. I am willing to change the reason why the world ended from zombies to something else, but they are still my number one go to. I'm looking for good, detailed players who come to the table ready to contribute. Additionally, I'm also looking to role play some canon characters within the Overwatch universe (Mercy x Soldier). I would be interested in starting a story within the old days of OW (like 'Uprising' era) and move forward to a more modern story. However, I'm open to suggestions and willing to bend for the right person.   \n\n\nA little blurb about me--I've been writing for a long time so I consider myself to be good at it. I prefer to write female characters alongside males. I really don't care what gender you identify as out of character. I'm a chill kind of person looking for fun people to write with. I role play over Discord. If you are interested in playing something else, message me anyway. I want some new partners to spruce things up again. Anyway, thank you for reading! &lt;3",

Rather, I would like to find a proper literate RPer who would RP on discord with me.\n\nAbout me:\n\nI'm 18, female and my time zone is UTC +1 and I have years of RP experience under my belt.\n\nIn game, I play a female Keeper of the Moon. Shimi Haru is her name, although I'll change that to the acronym Simhi Haur as soon as I can afford it.\n\nAbout my interests:\n\nMainly, we will just RP daily life or the occasional meeting and adventure together, depending on what your character is like. We could become travel companions and more - I don't mind whether it's friendship and romance. It just seems to me that Keepers rarely settle, which is why I suggest this passing travelers setting, but feel free to convince me otherwise.\n\nIn addition, I'd like to expand on the lore of these feline folks. The pre-established dynamics create some interesting conflicts we could explore throughout our RP. I mean, basically, we have the independent Keeper females vs the alpha Seeker males. Or the Keeper lady's man and the loyal dutiful Seeker female. Either way, as of now, I'd prefer to play a Keeper female and am searching for my mate. Will we become best friends? Will it be romantic? Or are we destined to be fiends? Let's find out!\n\nAlso: If I can find enough people, I'd actually like to open a server instead of only RPing in the DMs.\n\nAbout whom I'm going to keep:\n\nPlease be experienced in actual literate RP. I'm looking for decent grammar and orthography - however, I'm not going to rip off your head for every single mistake either.\n\nAbout being +18...well, I don't mind either, because I don't necessarily need anything that would require such a rating. If that is of interest to you, please ensure yourself that your age passes the threshold.\n\nI also do not absolutely require you to be a Miqo'te as well. Any race will do, although same kind will be preferred.\n\nFinally - please contact me if this applies to you and the topic interests you - we can discuss further details on discord.\n\nLooking forward to future campfires and nights spent beneath the moon and stars,\n\nShimi Haru\n\nPS: The \"F4M\" tag found in older versions of this does NOT apply. That was a mistake created by habit",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I'm here with a 1 x 1 RP Search! I have been RPing for 15 years now (Since the time of the Yahoo Instant Messenger RPs!...before they got rid of the user rooms). \n\nI have been searching for someone who can Roleplay as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. But heres the catch. I use an Original Character...but fear not! I don't make Mary Sue characters and I have been working on a full bio for my OC that\u00a0 I use just for the Dragonball franchise. It would be post Frieza Saga and go off in an Alternate Universe (no Trunks and the androids will probably come but it'll end up different) and it WILL be a romance! With action and adventure. Fights will be slightly included but if it gets too long we can time skip and try to figure out who is the winner between the characters.. Any more questions about this don't be afraid to ask me!\n\nNow, Rules... I am pretty lienient when it comes to Roleplays. Some literacy is a MUST. Of course we all make grammar mistakes (I know I make quite a bit as I look at myself typing this out lol). I do Semi paragraph to multi paragraph replies and starting posts as well full of detail. I would hope and wish that someone out there would be willing to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0also, this is in 3rd person. This will be romance like I have stated..but if you need to do a time skip through the lovey dovey bits please dont hesitate to tell me and we can time skip. Also...please DO NOT GOD MOD. its annoying.. Also...PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I know real life gets in the way and I'm understanding of that (trust me I work 40 hours a week I understand lol) I LOVE fast repliers they make me really happy trust me. If you get uninterested please just let me know I wont be mad I promise. also..PLOTTING. I love to plot out an idea that you might have or I might have before installing it into the RP.\u00a0also about my OC I can tell you alot more about her if you are interested and I can even supply artwork of her as well.\n\nWell that seems to be the lot of it! I think I remembered everything...I hope I remembered everything lol. But please if you are interested hit me up with a PM or comment here and please don't be shy to ask me questions! I am always happy to answer any questions regarding everything I'm looking for. I hope I hear from someone!! Thanks! ",

            "selftext": "Sunday. It was Sunday on a cold November night. It had been a long day at work for me. I had walked inside my small home out in the woods and snarled as I saw a leak in the roof. I stripped from my uniform and placed a bucket beneath the leak. My blue eyes began to shut as I laid on the old couch with a cigarette hanging from my cold lips. It took a lot to scare me. The sound of a fist banging on the front door made me jump, however. I check the time. No one should be here. No one should know how to get out here. I stared at the door for a moment before lifting myself off the couch. In a pair of old work jeans and o worn down flannel, I clutched my fist to the door handle and opened it. \n\nA girl. It was a girl. She couldn\u2019t have been much older than nineteen. Maybe twenty. I took a long drag from my cigarette and let it hand there from my lips as I barely opened the door. \u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked in a low, gravely voice. I could see your scared eyes wander. You didn\u2019t seem to say much. You weren\u2019t wearing much, either. I could see the panic in your eyes as you looked around. Someone had been... following you. \u201cPlease,\u201d I could hear you mutter under your chilled breath. \n\nI stuck my head outside and looked around before opening my door. \u201cCome in, you\u2019re freezing,\u201d I said as I lowered my cigarette to be held between my fingers. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWell, that\u2019s a starter for you! Here\u2019s a little background. \n\nYou, the girl who arrives at my door, is being chased/followed by a group of men. It\u2019s sort of a spin off of stranger things since I absolutely loved that show. It\u2019s a little different, though. You won\u2019t have any powers but the people who are trying to capture you are involved in the corrupted government. Things quickly escalate and I take on the job of protecting you. We begin running together. We\u2019re constantly on the move. Eventually, we will get rid of the men, but only more danger is to come. \n\nThere will be drama, romance, tension, fights, all the good stuff. Out characters will soon fall into an odd romance despite the age difference. It will NOT be revolves around sex. Yes, it can come into play, but it will not be the main focus.\n\nPM me if you\u2019re interested!! Oh, and I only roleplay in 1st person and through kik. Bye!",

            "selftext": "Hello howdy! It's me, Millie! I've been dead and sick and away from the world because I keep getting sick differently and well, I have a lot of health issues! But I'm doing pretty good right now so here I am!\n\nI am looking for some partners for some quicker paced stories! I am really only looking for Discord partners, as I always have my phone with me and can use it even when my arms are giving me problems! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Some things I would really like to do right now are Sherlock, X-men, and Marauders stories!!\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Rules**\n\n\u2764 Partners must be 18+, I'm 21 so no minors! Sorry!\n\n\u2764 Must be able to reply at least a few times each week. I don't need you to tell me your schedule or when you're going somewhere, but just need you to be able to commit to the movement of the story.\n\n\u2764 Must be literate! I don't need every reply to have multiple paragraphs (not that I don't love it) but I do expect correct grammar and at least a few sentences.\n\n\u2764 Must be nice! We don't have to be friends, but I am chatty soo...\n\n\u2764If we are going to be doing a Fandom story, please be upfront in telling me how complete your knowledge is of the subject. I like to be sort of detail oriented.\n\n**Guidelines**\n\n\u2764 Off the bat, I don't play straight guys in romantic situations. The only time I will play a straight guy is if the character is fully needed, or romance isn't involved. Every time I try to play one, they turn into a jerk.\n\n\u2764 Playing more than one character is fine. I will also double up if you want me to play a certain character, as long as I think I can play them.\n\n\u2764 I love romance. I just do, I'm sappy like that. This being said, I don't like stories where they just automatically are in love. This has a few exceptions, but most likely won't happen unless the story idea is really good.\n\n\u2764 I'm also interested in like family style stories, as far as non-romance goes.\n\n\u2764 I like to add real life themes into my stories. This is one, because I like drama, and two, because perfect stories in perfect worlds are no fun.\n\n\u2764 My only triggers are only triggers when portrayed incorrectly. These are mental health issues, invisible diseases, and suicide. I will call you out on these things and stop the story if they are misrepresented. This is because incorrect portrayal of these things is something I have to deal with on a daily basis. I call people out in real life too. Constantly.\n\n\u2764 Speaking of the above point, I do get sick quite often. This is just more of a heads up.\n\n\u2764 If you've read all of this, send me one of those cute ghost emojis the site has. I really love them.\n\n**Ships**\n\n(My characters will be italicized.)\n\n(Asterix by stories I'm craving.)\n\n\u2764 Star Wars\n\n* *OC* x OC \\*\n* *OC* x Poe \\*\n* *OC* x Hux\n* *OC* x Kylo\n* *OC* x Anakin\n* *Hux* x Kylo\n* *Rey* x Kylo\n* *Jyn* x Cassian \\*\n* *Finn* x Poe\n* *Padme* x Anakin\n\n\u2764 Star Trek\\*\n\n* *OC* x OC\n* *OC* x Jim\n* *OC* x Bones\n* *OC* x Scotty\n\n\u2764 Harry Potter\n\n* *OC* x OC\n* *OC* x Newt\n* *Remus* X Sirius\\*\n* *Queenie* X Jacob\n\n\u2764 Marvel\\*\\*\\*\n\n* *OC* x OC\n* *OC* x Hawkeye (Clint or Kate)\n* *Hawkeye* (Kate) x OC\n* *OC* x Doctor Strange\n* *OC* x Bucky Barnes\n* *OC* x Charles Xavier\n* *OC* x Hank McCoy\n* *Spider-Man* x Deadpool\n* *OC* x Daredevil (Comics)\n\n\u2764 DC\n\nMostly just looking for BatFam stories.\n\n*OC* x Jason Todd\n\n\u2764Others\n\n* *Roxas* x Axel (KH)\n* *OC* x Spencer Reid (Criminal Minds)\n* *OC* x John Watson (BBC) \n* *OC* x Sherlock Holmes (BBC)\n* *OC* x Mycroft Holmes (BBC)\n\n**Story Ideas**\n\n(None of my ideas are too formed, to allow us to make it our own.)\n\n\u2764General Ideas That I'm Always Into\n\n\\-Modern Day AUs\n\n\\-Non-Modern AUs\n\n\\-Anything Cute Really\n\n\\-Canon-Divergent Stories that have basis in a Canon event\n\n\u2764 Star Wars\n\n\\-Matchmaker B.B.8 \\*\n\nA story where our good pal beebee-ate accidentally acts as a matchmaker. Beebee needs a tune up so Poe leaves him in the care of a new technician on the base while he goes off on a mission. What he didn\u2019t expect was that Beebee would grow quite fond of the new technician.\n\n(Or something like this with Milicent and Hux??)\n\n\\-Resistance Ben\n\nWhat if Ben Solo never trained under Luke and instead stayed with Han and Leia? What if he joined the resistance and instead helped to capture General Hux?\n\n\\-Any story set within the Clone Wars\n\n\\-Any story where Anakin doesn't turn\n\n\u2764 Star Trek\n\n\\-New Recruit\\*\n\n(For any story involving an OC and Canon relationship) A story where a new recruit gets assigned to the Enterprise. A chance in counter with an upper Officer turns to love.\n\n\\-Something revolving someone getting stuck in the Sick Bay\n\n\\-Something revolving around Shore Leave.\n\n\u2764Harry Potter\n\n\\-Something set in the 20's\\*\n\n(This could involve Fantastic Beasts Characters or not)\n\n\\-Newly Graduated Wizards\n\n\\-A wizard and a Muggle falling in love\\*\n\n\u2764Marvel\n\n\\-Mutants\\*\n\nHonestly I am just craving something X-Men related. I think this is a great opportunity to use OCs.\n\n\u2764DC\n\n\\-I don't have anything too specific here. I just would love to do something with the BatFam and all the Robins.\n\n\u2764Other Various Stories\n\n\\-I'm also looking for stories for Criminal Minds and Sherlock, though I don't have anything set in mind.\n\n**Other Ideas**\n\n\u2764I love to build stories with my partner. I am very open to suggestions, and love when we come up with everything together.\n\n\u2764 Slow Build Romance. I love to build a relationship and watch it go through things, especially when there\u2019s drama!! (I love cheesy things like k-drama and fluffy fan fiction oops)\n\n\u2764 I like both fantasy and modern settings, as well as historical things when the story is right.\n\nSome Stories I Would Love\n\n\u2764 Something set in the 30's, 60's, 80's or 90's\n\n\u2764 Something where I got to play a medically complex character. I have a lot of medical knowledge and love medical things, so I always love playing this type of character.\n\n\u2764 Something where they are meeting again. This could be due to time, distance, memory loss, a whole bunch of things!",

            "selftext": "As you can maybe tell by the title, I, Sephun, have been charged with advertising an incredibly small DCU RP, which basically is focused on the 'rise' or 'fall' of your character into the villain or hero that they will become. For example, Bruce Wayne may be a taken character, but he isn't Batman just yet. The player needs to roleplay them becoming Batman. Or take them in a completely different direction.   \n\n\nThis makes the RP pretty dynamic, as eventually, you will see your character's decisions reverberate around the RP, potentially affecting the other characters... Of course, since nobody has roleplayed yet on this server, it is impossible to predict what will happen. Which is why, I and my colleagues need more players, in order to bring this relatively grandiose idea to life -  after all, we can't build a new continuity (which is kinda what we're doing here), without all of the 'players' building it up too.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few taken characters already: Bruce Wayne, John Doe and Diana Prince. Most of you DC fans probably recognize these names... But if you don't recognize a few of them, it should probably become clear as the RP goes along. If this idea works, at least, which I honestly hope it will.  \n\n\nDiscord Invite: [https://discord.gg/9YS2RGm](https://discord.gg/9YS2RGm)  \n",

            "selftext": "Timothy Hunter awoke with a jolt. Sweat poured down the young mage\u2019s face as he attempted to catch his breath. He could feel a rather sharp pain in his head, yet another migraine. His immense magical power combined with his lack of control often led to them. He needed a tutor, a proper one that didn\u2019t walk around in a bloody trench coat with a pack of silk cuts always on him. He pushed his blanket to the side before rising out of his bed. He took a swig of water before noticing the time on his clock. \u201cCrap.\"\n\n'emoc ereh yhtomiT.\u2019 He felt a voice resonate in his head, but he didn\u2019t quite know what it meant. It wasn't even English, and sounded more like gibberish. \u2018Bloody magic,\u2019 He thought to himself before hearing the voice again. \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m used to talking backwards. I\u2019m having a show in London, and I sent you tickets. Meet me after the show and we\u2019ll talk about your apprenticeship. Eyb!\u2019 He could vaguely remember that voice, like he had heard it on TV or something. \u201cBetter check the mail.\u201d\n\nTimothy walked down the steps and past his alcoholic father, who was watching reruns of some stupid game show. He gently opened the door, trying to not alert his dad. He wasn\u2019t abusive, but he was overly cautious of losing his son. The teen made his way to the nearby box before observing it carefully. There was always the possibility that it was a trap; maybe some evil magician wanted to kill him. Still, Timothy was curious, almost too much so for his own good. He slowly opened the mailbox to reveal one ticket. He pulled the ticket out and examined it closely. It read, -One premium backstage ticket to Zatanna Zatara\u2019s magic show. Yojne!- The boy\u2019s eyes widened as one little word exited his mouth. \u201cWow.\u201d\n\nSo, I\u2019m wanting to do an interesting roleplay with young Tim Hunter learning from one of the most powerful magic users in the DC Universe. Tim isn\u2019t too well known, but he was basically DC\u2019s Harry Potter before Harry Potter even existed. I\u2019m wanting the roleplay to also be expansive, and feature several other mystical characters. I\u2019ll probably also play Constantine, Deadman, Swamp Thing, and Etrigan when needed. If you could roleplay any other mages, that\u2019d be great, but I\u2019m fine with you just playing Zatanna. I\u2019m also wanting to explore a bunch of adult themes because Vertigo comics can be screwed up. I imagine the tone of the roleplay will shift often. Anywho, if you\u2019re interested, then please drop me a message!",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

Nothing against you, just not comfortable and such. \nI\u2019m alright with NSFW scenes, as long as they don\u2019t take over the whole plot. I\u2019d like romantic feelings to be fostered between our two characters as time goes on, don\u2019t force it. \nI\u2019m usually available. Of course I\u2019m normal so I have school and other things that I have to deal with. For the most part though I\u2019ll reply right away because I love to roleplay and I\u2019m rather passionate about writing. \n\nAs for genres I\u2019m open to a lot, but I do enjoy some more then others, the following list details those. From my favorite to least.\n\n\u2022 Historical (one of my personal favorites. I\u2019m a total history buff)\n\n\u2022 War\n\n\u2022 slice of life\n\n\u2022 Horror (This is darker)\n\n\u2022 sci-fi (space exploration and such)\n\n Thank you for reading!

            "selftext": "Good evening, everyone!\n\nSo, why am I not seeking RP partners in game?\n\nI may be on Louisoix, but I actually do not want to RP there. In fact, I just don't like RPing in the game because right now, I cannot afford a whole lot of playtime and prefer to actually play the game when I can instead of RP. Rather, I would like to find a proper literate RPer who would RP on discord with me.\n\nAbout me:\n\nI'm 18, female and my time zone is UTC +1 and I have years of RP experience under my belt.\n\nIn game, I play a female Keeper of the Moon. Shimi Haru is her name, although I'll change that to the acronym Simhi Haur as soon as I can afford it.\n\nAbout my interests:\n\nMainly, we will just RP daily life or the occasional meeting and adventure together, depending on what your character is like. We could become travel companions and more - I don't mind whether it's friendship and romance. It just seems to me that Keepers rarely settle, which is why I suggest this passing travelers setting, but feel free to convince me otherwise.\n\nIn addition, I'd like to expand on the lore of these feline folks. The pre-established dynamics create some interesting conflicts we could explore throughout our RP. I mean, basically, we have the independent Keeper females vs the alpha Seeker males. Or the Keeper lady's man and the loyal dutiful Seeker female. Either way, as of now, I'd prefer to play a Keeper female and am searching for my mate. Will we become best friends? Will it be romantic? Or are we destined to be fiends? Let's find out!\n\nAlso: If I can find enough people, I'd actually like to open a server instead of only RPing in the DMs.\n\nAbout whom I'm going to keep:\n\nPlease be experienced in actual literate RP. I'm looking for decent grammar and orthography - however, I'm not going to rip off your head for every single mistake either.\n\nAbout being +18...well, I don't mind either, because I don't necessarily need anything that would require such a rating. If that is of interest to you, please ensure yourself that your age passes the threshold.\n\nI also do not absolutely require you to be a Miqo'te as well. Any race will do, although same kind will be preferred.\n\nFinally - please contact me if this applies to you and the topic interests you - we can discuss further details on discord.\n\nLooking forward to future campfires and nights spent beneath the moon and stars,\n\nShimi Haru",

Our main goal is to find more members that are willing to contribute both in character and in chats. We offer the ability to create your own quests under the condition that they stick to lore, we are also planning various server-wide events and major adventures for members interested in participating. The setting is medieval fantasy in a place called Esnium, a large city-state on an isthmus that connects the northern and southern parts of the continent of Inoctsam. The city itself is governed by a number of guilds, them being the wealthy Merchant's guild, the Church of Vestau (which also supervises the guards), the University of Magic that unites artificers, casters and scholars, and the Druids, who don't really participate but have a seat nonetheless. Representatives of these guilds will occasionally gather from time to time in order to discuss the most important matters. Despite there being only four major guilds, there are numerous smaller ones, the most notable ones being the Vipers, the collective of thieves, outlaws, and other criminals, and the Mercenaries' Guild.\n\nOur server offers lots of clarity on how the admin team works and enables users to contribute to the lore as well, under the \"Writer\" role which we are happy to give once requested. As a community we are aiming to create active group of users that are eager to contribute.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/B6XS3uP",

            "selftext": "I was dating this girl in college and was invited to visit her family over the summer. I drove the 5 hours to her hometown, expecting a boring couple days in small town Vermont. What I found was nothing but. She had a older sister who lived nearby with her husband and kids. Her mom had a pool so everyone would crash there on hot days. Well, apparently her sister and my girlfriend didn\u2019t know the meaning of modesty because they had no problem stripping naked and changing in front of me, while I watched. The weird part was my girlfriend expected me to drop my draws and change in front of them as if it was the usual. I did but was semi erect when doing so. I think they both approved as her sister told my girlfriend to \u201ctake care of it.\u201d We fucked on her childhood bed as her sister did her make up in the adjoining bathroom, door partially open.

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'm looking for new roleplaying partners for something ideally based within a Star Wars setting. To give you a little bit of context:\n\nI am a third-person, paragraph-style roleplayer although I am not a stickler for post length - substance is important to me. Most of my posts will probably be about a paragraph, more if there's a lot to respond to, or if I'm setting a scene or something to that effect. I am a very rusty writer, so some patience would be appreciated, and perhaps even some advice if it comes down to it?\n\nAs for what I'm looking for in a partner, I would appreciate decent activity and for them to be of age. Grammar is important as long as it's tolerable - I'm not tough on it as long as a decent attempt is made. I am definitely looking to chat on the side and hopefully make friends. I would like the atmosphere to be laid back and fun, rather than cold, overly serious and disinterested.\n\nI am looking to exchange discords and use the same platform to write. I generally prefer more rapid-fire posting, but I understand scheduling and just being plain busy or not feeling like it.\n\nIn terms of the nitty gritty details of the roleplay: I am more interested in Legends than nu-canon, but I can work with a healthy mix. I am primarily looking for things set in the era of the Galactic Empire, generally a couple years prior to/after and during the Galactic Civil War / Original Trilogy - that general era. I would like us to both to obviously have a say in the roleplay and plan its direction. Bring on the Rebels and independent types! I should also specify that I am looking for original characters here - perhaps a brief, brief appearance by a canon for some flavor.\n\nPlease try to keep balanced characters in mind. I am a little hesitant to include force sensitive characters, but if you have it well thought out and intend to do it justice I'm fully aboard. I am open to and encourage romance as long as the characters are compatible (I do MxF) and it occurs naturally.\n\nThemes in the roleplay can vary depending on what we want to include, definitely a topic for discussion.\n\nWith that said, thanks for reading! Let me know if you're interested!",

You can call me Fleur; I\u2019m 30 and have been roleplaying for 15 years. I play FxM, and looking for any partner than can play M, though on rare occasions I will play FxF. It depends on the other person.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a literate partner, not necessarily someone who can write an essay. I don\u2019t mind one-paragraph responses, as long as the quality of the response is there. I\u2019m someone who typically matches my partner in terms of replies, but anything smaller than a paragraph won\u2019t hold my attention, sorry. That being said, I need someone who knows their spelling and grammar. Third person is preferred, at least once daily is preferred.\n\nI work an 8-5 job M-F, and so my only options for daily responses would be over email, Google Docs, or reddit pm. Otherwise I am on discord at night when I get home. There will be some NSFW themes, obviously not the focus, so please be 25+. I\u2019m no longer offering to RP with anyone younger than that, sorry. NSFW details can be discussed privately.\n\nI don\u2019t do fandoms. I\u2019m looking to find a partner who I can build a world with. I wasn\u2019t kidding about being long-term! The three main ones I\u2019m looking for are fantasy/medieval, space opera, or post-apocalyptic. If you have any specific ideas, I\u2019d love to hear about them. I\u2019m up for anything exciting, dark, or overall fun to write.\n\nIf you answered to this post before, message me again so I know that you're still available! I don't want to message a bunch of people who are no longer able to RP, so this will be easier. ",

That'd be odd if magic wasn't commonplace in the world. The same can be said with all the...racial diversity. Elves and dragons in the high class, watching everyone below them suffer. The usual, looking back at history. \n\nOf course, the police force is wrapped around their fingers, the augmented officers dealing with problems that the upper class finds unsightly, or bad for themselves. One of such problems, being Ga1ahad, and his troupe of information brokers. Nothing much is really known about the infamous group, the few that have been captured keeping their mouth shuts about their boss. Though, a few did snap under pressure. The man in charge never shows himself, not wanting to get caught so easily, but most important, has never seemed to have any boundaries when it came to selling information. Everyone had a price, in his eyes. Even the people sitting on top of the world.\n\nIt was just a matter of time before he got the dirt on them he needed.\n&gt;\nHiya! This is my latest brainchild. This starter/peek into this world is really sloppy, you'll have to forgive me. But anyway, onto the juicy details! Yes, the title is exactly what you think it is. I've tossed high fantasy, and a dark Cyberpunk world together. *bonus points if anything related to the \"world\" of DnD is included*. Anything goes, so long as it's within the realm of reason. The same goes with the direction of the story, in fact. \n&gt;\nAs for me, you can expect daily replies around 1-3 paragraphs each, with multiple replies a day if I'm not busy. Romance will be a *secondary* part of this, so, by all means, if that's your thing, let me know! I think that's all from me for right now, shoot me a PM if you're interested or have any questions, I'll be sure to get back to you as quickly as I can.",

            "selftext": "Hi there~! The name is Sam, and I'm looking for a literate partner to write some stuff with! I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nI'm looking for two things very particularly today, and they vary in tone and themes! The first is something involving an arranged, or in someway, a sudden marriage between almost two strangers. I would prefer for this to be female/female, so anyone looking to play a male character will have to settle for my other idea. In this sudden marriage, I would like to play a woman with a violent past and reputation, or atleast the other woman to know just how cruel/terrible she was a few years back. Though, I'd want to the story to revolve around the two falling in love regardless of her past; Mostly because she's trying her hardest to live a normal and secure life for the woman, bonus points if the woman already has a kid from another marriage.\n\nFor the second idea, it involves something akin to The Walking Dead. Zombies or not, it would revolve around a community of people trying to survive the Apocalypse together, and what lengths they will go to. I will be playing a younger character in this, a woman who would have been plunged into whatever disaster on her first day as a Deputy for the Sheriff's in her home town. I'm more then okay with exploring themes of the transition from a normal group just surviving, to maybe even the villains of someone else's story? Killing those that stand in their way or even threaten their groups stability, etc. Mainly, I'd wanna focus on the rebuilding aspect. Farming, building, etc. Town drama and what not!\n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. It comes with the territory! Sex, Alcohol, Murder. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well. So, if you're going to play a male character just keep in mind I wouldn't want a romance arc, but am okay with sex.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

Every room comes supplied with a man or men. Each room offers a different service. I\u2019ll list out a few and if you have another suggestion for a room type, I\u2019m all ears. The rooms go from vanilla to dark. Also, most of you responding wanting a even darker room. \n\n______________\n\nRoom 1, The Stimulant:  The stimulant is for women that want to be pleased. Women who often find themselves giving their all to a man for him to roll over and go to bed after he is satisfied leaving you craving more. Our experienced masseuse has an array of toys and moves to completely stimulate your desires. \n\nRoom 2, The Costume Party:  The costume party is available for our guests who enjoy cos play and sex in costumes or outfits. Maybe your kinks also include clothed sex. \n\nRoom 3, Hands, Feet and Mouth:  Hands feet and mouth is available for some of our more sensual guests. This room accommodates each of these aforementioned acts either in singularity or all together in spectacular detail.\n\nRoom 4, The Dominatrix:  The dominatrix is a package made special for all of our bad ass bitches. They women can use and abuse men, deny their ability to cum and make them their pets. \n\nRoom 5, BDSM:  this one is pretty straight forward. Want to be tied up? Forced orgasms? Whipping? Candle wax? Clamps? Pain? Maybe even blood? Book room 5. \n\nRoom 6, The Used:  The used is for women that want to be used like fuck toys or a human flesh light. Either by a man or men. They will be able to use you as they please. Package additions include bounding devices, toys, and selection in # of men. \n\nRooms 7, The Whore:  The whore is for our guests who have deeply rooted daddy issues or just like to be fucked like the little whores they are. Our hostel includes abuse, slapping, spanking and other hardcore adult fantasy related themes. \n\nRoom 8, No:  Simply put, no is for our guests traveling on the darker side.  This room is for our non con and rape fetish lovers. They are unsuspecting ladies traveling alone looking for a place of refuge. What they instead find is a room full of two way mirrors and hidden doors. You didn\u2019t request this room nor do you expect it. \n\nIf the post is up, I\u2019m still booking rooms. Please put the Room# or combination Room# in the title. For instance, if you want rooms 2,5&amp;7 make you title include Room 257.  I have very few limits but also really enjoy vanilla role plays. Message me to discuss. ",

I'm used to an OcxCANON doubling format, but would be just as happy with OCxOC and doing away with the doubling. The former is mostly to balance out the experience, as I feel a little selfish otherwise. It's not a requirement by any means.\n\nMy inspiration fluctuates, but for easy reference, I'll list a few genres/fandoms I'm always up for.\n\n* Shows/Movies (Star Wars, Marvel/MCU, DC, Supernatural, etc.)\n\n* Video games (Bioshock, The Witcher, Assassin's Creed)\n\n* Anything having to do with witches/the darker side of the paranormal, aliens, monsters.\n\n I'm active daily unless life gets in the way. I'd like things between us to be friendly and not completely sterile. I don't force small talk, but a chat every now and then is welcome. \n\nI use discord and/or gmail.

            "selftext": " \n\nHi there, This is a group dedicated to creating a fun and welcoming environment for all roleplayers. I want this roleplay to offer plenty of opportunities to its players to help create and shape the world around them for the sake of creating a fun and interesting story. Below, you'll find a bit of lore to help situate you so you can get a general feel of how things go down on this server:*\" In a small and quaint town basically forgotten (or at least overshadowed by all the other ones) deep in the heart of Utah, everyone seems to know each other's name and its so safe that some people can even sleep without having to so much as lock their door. However, this town is known for something else amongst its residents, as is the rest of the world at this point that sets it apart from our own: mythological creatures. You see, in this world, creatures big and small truly do exist and finally decided to make themselves known to the humans. However, there is one small catch: they aren't exactly liked by humans. Humans have always been top of the food-chain, they've always been able to adapt and overcome any challenges that they've faced as a species. Now that these \"mythos\" as they often refer to them as have come into their lives, they see them as simply another issue that is meant to be adapted to and overcome.*\n\n*The mythos tried to be nice to the humans, they wanted to basically be like neighbors with them. However, humans were fearful of them. Things soon escalated and now it's a bit cultural split between mythos and humans. The mythos are now essentially treated like second-class citizens if they so much as step foot into a human town or city. Some, are even captured as slaves and forced to serve under the oppressive rule of humanity. Things have even gotten to the point where anti-mythos departments have been establish for the sake of \"protecting the people from the threat of the unknown\" as they so claim.*\n\n*Of course, there are a few unspoken rules that applies to humans. For example, the dense forest that surrounds the forest is to be left alone. Any human that so enters it could potentially face certain death.*\n\n*Now, here we are. Be you mytho or human, you still have a life to live. Whether you try and create peace between the two opposing groups or instead prefer to keep old values intact and destroy all who oppose you is a choice all your own.\"*\n\nIf this is appealing to you in the slightest, please feel free to drop by and say hello! Hope to see you soon! Remember, this RP changes along with whatever decisions the characters of this RP make. I only jump in if things begin to get out of hand. Even right now, we're at the near finish of an event ran by one of our very own. This would be the perfect opportunity to come and create a character during this moment of down time between events and get to know the server a bit better.\n\nLike I said, I want this to be an environment where everyone can pitch about whatever ideas they like, so long as it fits within the general lore and rules.\n\nOtherwise, everything is up to you guys.The link to the server: [right here](https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw)",

To put it simply, I'm looking for a roleplay partner. \n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n- **Quality replies.** I generally don't mind how long/short your replies are. However, constant one liners can quickly make a roleplay boring. As a minimum, all I ask is a paragraph. \n\n- **Other.** As a general rule, I usually like my partner to play an older/taller character than mine. The differences don't have to be insane, but there typically has to be at least some. OOC is appreciated as well! I will try to warn you if I'll be gone for a couple of days, I ask the same of you if possible. \n\n**Roles I would like you to play:**\n\n*Here's a list of roles I'm interested in my partners playing.*\n\n- Soldier.\n- Cop.\n- Security guard.\n- Serial Killer.\n- A classmate who bullies MC.\n- A classmate or person who hates MC.\n- Guardian Angel.\n- Guardian Demon. \n- Alcoholic Pilot.\n- Android. \n- Steampunker from another dimension.\n- Famous YouTuber (OC preferred).\n- Slime/Monster girl. \n\n*Note: Want to play something that isn't mentioned here? Go ahead and ask!*\n\n**Fandom stuff:**\n\n*Here's a list of Fandoms I would be interested in my partner playing cannon characters from.*\n\nRWBY, Overwatch, Neir, Borderlands, DDLC.\n\nIf you're interested, please leave a comment or shoot me a pm!

            "selftext": "This is meant to be mostly non-sexual and story based. \nI had this idea for somewhat dark romance between a monster (or other supernatural being) hunter and their target. I honestly prefer to play the non-human but I can play the hunter as well. There's a few ways this prompt can go.  One is the typical idea of a monster in hiding being tracked down by a hunter, but the other involves a school with a dynamic sort of like in the anime Vampire Knight. If you haven't seen it, there is a day class of humans and a night class of vampires. The difference would come in the fact that the night class in this case would be of supernatural beings. The hunter registers in the class and uses this to watch over the monsters, reporting back to a family of hunters back home. The issue arises when they develop a fondness for the other character, who wouldn't know about the Hunter's status unless told. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask when you pm me. I look forward to roleplaying with you:)  Suggestions both for this prompt or others welcome as long as they hold some similarity. ",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit!\n\nI've been a long time lurker but recently decided to create an account to get back involved with the writing community and to get back into Roleplay. I have been itching to find a new writing partner or two who are interested in creating epic sprawling adventures with detailed, evolving characters. I have been writing a long time, and am looking for someone else with similar experience and motivation.\n\nI should introduce myself! My name is Bradley. I am a 30 year old male from Canada. I'm gay, have a long term partner, and have two fur babies; a cat and dog. I hate the cold, but love the fall leading up to it, and enjoy listening to podcasts and audiobooks when I'm doing everything else. I've got a strange life, and an even stranger schedule, but it allows for plenty of free time for writing among my other hobbies. I am on Discord and Reddit very frequently except for the mornings, where I am either sleeping or working.\n\nIn my introduction I mentioned I was looking for experience. I have been writing nearly every day since I was 10 years old and roleplaying almost just as long, starting in MUDs on Telnet and moving into the days of AIM and MSN Chatrooms, ICQ etc. I studied classical poetry and helped edit and publish a multi-national anthology in the early 2000s. I also write fiction, though have never been published, and have countless plots and characters constantly shifting around in my mind. I type fast, and can pump out the Discord character limit in just a few minutes, which is the typical length of my post (2000 characters). I am looking for someone else who is equally literate and has a love for writing outside of roleplay.\n\nOne last thing. I request that anyone considering contacting me to be 21+. This is for both maturity and experiences sake. 18+ is the hard limit, as my roleplays can sometimes have dark themes (not necessarily adult, but would be rated R in a film). I am not adverse to including adult content in my roleplays, but it would need to be discussed first.\n\nNow enough with the disclaimers, it's time for the fun stuff!\n\nGenres: Fantasy, Historical Fiction, Noir, Science Fiction, Cyberpunk, Occult. (I am open to other genres, but these are the ones I have the most experience in.\n\nCharacters: I write any gender, sexual orientation, race, or creed; and you can too.\n\nFrequency: I am online every day, and will at least touch base with you once a day. I intend to make at least one post in any roleplay we are working on a day as well, but sometimes life can get in the way. If this happens, I will be sure to inform you ahead of time.\n\nFandom: This is a strict No. I do not mind borrowing ideas from established IPs, but I do not play existing characters or in any established canonical universe. I am specifically looking for someone who enjoys coming up with their own ideas, settings, plots and characters.\n\nLength: I frequently write up to the Discord character limit (2000 characters). My average post is just short of this. I am looking for someone who is not only able to keep up with this post length, but enjoys doing so.\n\nExtras: Despite the very formal sounding post, I am a very chatty and friendly person. I have a lot of interests and hobbies, and am hoping to find someone else who is social and outgoing. I am looking for a writing partner more than a one time roleplayer, and hope that we can have fun together, talk about our interests, and create a lot of adventure.\n\nIf all of this sounds appealing to you please send me a message! I have a few plots already in mind that we can start fleshing out, so don't be shy if you don't have any immediate ideas. And if you are unsure of anything or have a question, do not hesitate to ask.",

            "selftext": "Good evening, everyone!\n\nSo, why am I not seeking RP partners in game?\n\nI may be on Louisoix, but I actually do not want to RP there. In fact, I just don't like RPing in the game because right now, I cannot afford a whole lot of playtime and prefer to actually play the game when I can instead of RP. Rather, I would like to find a proper literate RPer who would RP on discord with me.\n\nAbout me:\n\nI'm 18, female and my time zone is UTC +1 and I have years of RP experience under my belt.\n\nIn game, I play a female Keeper of the Moon. Shimi Haru is her name, although I'll change that to the acronym Simhi Haur as soon as I can afford it.\n\nAbout my interests:\n\nMainly, we will just RP daily life or the occasional meeting and adventure together, depending on what your character is like. We could become travel companions and more - I don't mind whether it's friendship and romance. It just seems to me that Keepers rarely settle, which is why I suggest this passing travelers setting, but feel free to convince me otherwise.\n\nIn addition, I'd like to expand on the lore of these feline folks. The pre-established dynamics create some interesting conflicts we could explore throughout our RP. I mean, basically, we have the independent Keeper females vs the alpha Seeker males. Or the Keeper lady's man and the loyal dutiful Seeker female. Either way, as of now, I'd prefer to play a Keeper female and am searching for my mate. Will we become best friends? Will it be romantic? Or are we destined to be fiends? Let's find out!\n\nAlso: If I can find enough people, I'd actually like to open a server instead of only RPing in the DMs.\n\nAbout whom I'm going to keep:\n\nPlease be experienced in actual literate RP. I'm looking for decent grammar and orthography - however, I'm not going to rip off your head for every single mistake either.\n\nAbout being +18...well, I don't mind either, because I don't necessarily need anything that would require such a rating. If that is of interest to you, please ensure yourself that your age passes the threshold.\n\nI also do not absolutely require you to be a Miqo'te as well. Any race will do, although same kind will be preferred.\n\nFinally - please contact me if this applies to you and the topic interests you - we can discuss further details on discord.\n\nLooking forward to future campfires and nights spent beneath the moon and stars,\n\nShimi Haru",

            "selftext": "Hello all~ I usually go by Sky online, and I'm a 22 year old female. I've been craving a chance to use my male One Piece character in a rp. I plan on this rp having strictly original characters though, no canon characters. I don't mind using some of the islands and creatures from the canon universe although I plan on us creating some of our own islands and creatures as well.\n\nPlease realize that as you can see in the title this will require plenty of worldbuilding. BOTH of us will contribute to this. It's no fun if only one person is doing all the work. I love seeing my partner's creativity and what kinda stuff they come up with. This goes for our crew as well. I'd like for the crew to have a max of 8-10 characters, preferably 8 or 10 so we can both create and even number of characters. Of course we'll also be creating the Yonko, Shichibukai, Supernovas, Marines, etc. All devil fruits will be up for grabs of course but I stress that no more than half of our crew have devil fruit powers. \n\nI'm only interested in M/M at the moment. I'm all for slow burn romance. Let our characters build up trust, struggle through tough times together, laugh together, and all that good stuff. Let them for a close connection first. That goes for the entire crew as well. \n\nI wanted to keep this as short as possible so I'll go on and list some important things here:\n\n\n\u20222-3 paragraphs minimum. I understand sometimes we can't write as much as we're able to spit out at other times. I most likely won't bother you about it unless I consistently feel like you're not putting in as much effort as I am.\n\n\u2022Please have good grammar. Be detailed too~ Don't shy away from describing bloody battle scenes and injuries! \n\n\u2022Don't be afraid to message me with suggestions. I love a partner that participates heavily in worldbuilding and is always brimming with ideas. I want both of us to be excited about this rp!\n\nI can rp through here or through email. Preferably email after we discuss the plot and things. I also have a character sheet for my guy ready to go that can be sent upon request. I'm only looking for 2 really good partners max for this and I am somewhat picky so please know that I'm not trying to be a jerk if I say that I've already found partners for this. With all that said, I hope to hear from you soon!",

And I'm on the search for a roleplay partner..\n\nI write in third person, past tense, novel style as this looks most pleasing to me! I would prefer if you had the same writing style, but I\u2019ll work with whatever! I write on Discord mainly but could write on Skype as well.\n\nI'm currently looking for a Game of Thrones or historical roleplay at the moment. So please have seen GoT, or have read the books and played the game!!\n\nI tend to include a lot of drama, angst and not so nice characters in my roleplay, just to add some spice to it and make it a lot more interesting! I do include smut, but there has to be plot as well.\nThough saying that I do think smut does add some extra elements to a roleplay, but I don't want it in absolutely every scene.\n\nI tend to get quite inspired when roleplay, so if we end up roleplaying together, expect a lot of drawings, playlists and Pinterest boards :) \n\nI'm sorry for rambling on so long, hopefully you've gotten a good enough idea about me and how I like to write! I would love to hear from you so please send me a PM if you're interested!\n\nValar Morghulis &lt;3\n",

I am open to discord or google docs as far as platforms go. For themes in the RP, I enjoy a really fair mixture of drama, romance, action and comedy. I'm open to discussing NSFW themes, but please be 18+ for this. I won't otherwise. I'd consider myself of moderately advanced literacy (we all make mistakes, that's okay!) and prefer my partner be somewhere in that range, too. I won't hold you to a post length requirement, but I ask that your posts do move the story along. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a little about what I'm looking for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Horror.\\* I mean, really good horror. It can have other elements too, to avoid the crash and burn that comes with just ONE theme in a story, obviously! But I love the gore, the violence, the drama, the NSFW stuff. I'd really just like some of all of that from a good, dedicated partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a story idea or two up my sleeve, but I'd love to discuss yours in PM's as well! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, I hope to hear from you! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Something romantic but nonsexual, something cuddly and happy and snuggly. I know it's not for everyone but I'm just looking for someone who'd want to give it a shot. I roleplay third person paragraph style and I can play either a man or a woman. I prefer to work over PM or Discord but I'm openminded. If you'd like we can discuss plots and scenarios over PM :) And if you'd like to try a fandom we can discuss it! I'm open to trying a fandom, perhaps Overwatch! Or My Hero Academia since I just got into that! I know they\u2019re real life people but maybe something with the Rooster Teeth personalities, I\u2019m open :) if you have a fandom you wanna suggest please do! Also I would like a partner is 18+. Just personal preference! Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "**About me:** I am 29, write in close third person, past tense, usually 3-5 paragraphs at a time.  (Posts get shorter during dialogue.) I like to use Google Docs for the actual writing just because of Discord's low character limit, but it's not a requirement.  I am often available from Noon-4pm and 10pm-2am EST. I like to post multiple times a day.\n\n**What I'm looking for:** I'd like to try a custom medieval setting with fantasy elements.  (An original setting, not Tolkien with races renamed.)  A few sci-fi elements mixed in are okay, too.  I\u2019d prefer a world that\u2019s already built, either your own setting or mine, just because it\u2019s easier to jump in.  That said, I\u2019d be willing to do some worldbuilding with my partner if that\u2019s not possible.  [I have a setting I am working on...](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p2iEN4RKfEcoYtolhiSbNa0lXT63g9GuWysIhek7QjY/edit) Obviously very rough still, but if it interests you I can try to complete it with your input.  I would be interested in playing in your setting too, though, especially if it\u2019s already finished.  Also, I might be open to doing ASOIAF, Rimworld, or Morrowind with the right person.\n\nI love historical realism, violence, action, combat, grey/complex moral issues, highly emotional drama and dark themes. \n\n**Relationships:** I enjoy romance if it develops organically and happens alongside a plot, but I'm not interested in slice-of-life romance.  I prefer romance when I play against a male character, but that\u2019s not a requirement.  Whether I'm interested in describing sex in detail or doing a fade to black depends on the situation, and I am of course fine writing with partners who don't want to do any sex or romance.\n\n**Characters:** I strongly prefer nonhuman characters - monsters, beastfolk, talking animals, aliens, androids, etc. (But I don\u2019t mind playing against human chars.) \n\nI create a new character for every RP so I can tailor them to the plot and to my partner's character, and although I prefer my partner do the same it\u2019s certainly not a requirement.  I am really flexible on the types of characters I play, so if you have a preference let me know!  I like characters that are ugly, weak, or imperfect.  I love basing a character on a trope or archetype and then subverting that trope, and my characters tend to have serious personality flaws.  I play both males and females, and have no preference for what you play as.\n \n**If interested please send me a writing sample** and a bit about yourself (availability, what you're looking for, all that good stuff.) [Here are some writing samples from me, taken from previous RPs.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-7ss87TsTNI38S-1wjyGRflvhud2jHGVuyAFugaUOV8/edit)\n",

            "selftext": "*Prompt*\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHistory books will tell you of Commander Shepard and how he gave his life to kill the Reapers over 250 years ago. How the council species came together for a joint effort and won an impossible to win war. What those books won\u2019t tell you is that was simply the first phase.\n\nThe first 100 years were spent rebuilding. Cities rose from the ashes they were left in. The Mass Relays were restored to their former function. The Citadel even reconstructed with a new design to house the council and culture of the universe. It truly was a time of peace.\n\nYet turmoil returned. The bonds of war faded between the council races and their differences began to shine through once more. Gorilla warfare was not uncommon to break out between military personal of the species. It was always credited to extremists, but every council member knew the truth.\n\nThis is when Project Renascitur was created. It was a secret joint venture between Salarians and Humans. The escalating conflict between the council races threatened the total collapse of society, resulting in a difficult decision. 193 years after Commander Shepard destroyed synthetic life across the galaxy, the first synthetic was created.\n\nUnseen complications arose with Project Renascitur and it was eventually shut down. The surviving members of the team were scattered among other small projects or disappeared entirely. The assets from the project were never found.\n\nNow 250 years after the destruction of the Reapers, a threat looms in the shadows. Long forgotten by many, and long feared by others. The council held itself together despite the difficulties. The spectre program was dissolved entirely due to distrust of rivaling species.\n\nElite training was still given to the top soldiers, but clearance levels now varied based on orders from the council. After rumors of a synthetic attack on a distant, several small teams were sent to investigate by the council. The Salarian\u2019s and Human\u2019s sent a joint task force, with a secondary objective of hiding any trails of involvement.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI may have got a little long winded there! But anyways, that is the basic premise. A new group of synthetics has formed and our little rag tag group will be a major driving force on the war effort to defeat them!\n\nI have a character in mind for myself (the ships pilot). That is the only position that is taken. The rest are all open for you to choose from before we make the rest of the secondary crew! Doctor, scientist, soldier, commander, etc. Though personally I prefer playing with somebody else who will get in the action as I don\u2019t plan on spending all my time on the ship. As for what race, you may also select any that you like! The crew was created by humans and Salarians, but they definitely could have outsourced to bring in some other help as well!\n\nI typically like longer responses as they are more creative and make me excited to read. I haven\u2019t roleplayed in a while but I am excited to get back to it! It\u2019s been a while since I have played Mass Effect 1-3 + Andromeda so I\u2019m sure there will be some discrepancies, but I will do my best to keep those to a minimum.\n\nWe will be creating this story together. It won\u2019t be me telling a story and you replying alongside that. Roleplaying needs to be give and take in order for both people to enjoy it. You wouldn\u2019t be on this forum if you weren\u2019t creative. I prefer roleplaying over pm for 1x1, (or if we take the group route) through our own forum that I would set up.\n\nIf anyone has interest in this either send me a pm or leave a comment here! I am very open to either 1x1 or group, just need to get a census on what would work best for it! I look forward to hearing from you!",

That being said, smut and NSFW topics will be brought up from time to time. Please be over 18, guys. And please don\u2019t try to change the story into a porno.

            "selftext": "Welcome to Ararat, a fantasy setting where the discovery of an ancient civilization's technology spurred on a golden age, though not one without consequence. Warriors, mages and mercenaries of all races, backgrounds and skills set out from city of Lumance to fight everything from bandits, to vampires, to ancient war-machines created for some unknown purpose, to take part in wars, and to deal with threats to the world's precarious peace or even the continued existence of the races of Ararat.\n\nHowever, just because some fight for those reasons, does not mean everybody does. Systematic corruption is rampant within the nations of the world, and peace is only a mask to hide what goes on behind the scenes between the powers of the world, between their spies and diplomats and assassins. Those in the know always have to wonder whether the next threat to their lives is going to come from within or from without. \n\n\n---\n\n\nThe Silver Road is a Discord-based roleplay server set in Ararat, a predominantly fantasy world, with some minor elements of other genres. Some parts of the setting will be familiar to those who have experience with other fantasy settings, but others are entirely unique! We have a custom, d20-based combat system, with plenty of options to allow you to build the character you want. Whether you want to be a classic Elven Mage, a Magnesse Paladin, a Saracen swordmaster, a walking magical disaster as an Asheor, an undisputed master of the magical or martial arts as a Pale One, or something completely different.  \nOf course, you don't have to be a combat-focused character! A merchant lord, a blacksmith, a playwright and more are all options, and those options are only limited by what you want to play. You can even have multiple characters without an issue. \n\nFor the most part, we're set in Lumance, the capital of the Magnesse empire, though every so often we have quests and storylines that take us to other areas, such as the snow-covered Munso Valley. There's plenty of lore to get into on the site, covering cultures, races, and even the origins of some of the less mundane creatures of Ararat.\n\nRight now, the group is small, but we have plenty of creativity and are looking to build a group who really enjoy roleplaying in the world we've created. It's a good time to join, if you want to join a group that finds the out-of-character interactions as important as in-character.\n\nOur site is [here](https://thesilverroad.jcink.net/index.php), for you to get stuck into and read over. When you've read over stuff, decided you need help, or want to meet the userbase and join in, our Discord is [here](https://discord.gg/CqfH4dy). Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you in The Silver Road.",

I hope to find a few partners who want something long term and that mesh with what I am looking for. Simplicity is the name of the game so I will try and keep everything as concise as possible. If you want more information than what is provided below, send me a PM and I can link you to my web\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\n\\- Ace\n\n\\- Female\n\n\\- Twenty-Eight years old\n\n\\- CST / GMT-5 Time Zone\n\n\\- Cooking Enthusiast\n\n**LENGTH** \n\n\\- 500+ words per post, with longer being preferred\n\n\\- Less than 500 is not something I am interested in\n\n\\- Dialogue heavy scenes may be less\n\n**STYLE**\n\n\\- Third person past tense\n\n**PAIRINGS**\n\n\\- MxF or FxF\n\n**PLOT IDEAS**\n\n\\- Near future where supernatural creatures (vampires, werewolves, demons, fairies, etc.) are commonplace. Societal tensions leading to increased conflict between the races, possible war at hand\n\n\\- Elves, orcs, goblins? Indeed! Thinking of a coauthored fantasy world where there is large scale conflict along with micro level tension between characters\n\n\\- Space! Think colonies, terraforming, xenomorph horror, androids, mind uploading, intergalactic travel\n\n\\- Inception based. For this plot I would only want to take concepts based on the film not characters or story lines. Would be awesome to watch the movie together on Rabbit for inspiration!\n\n\\- Alternate Universe with historical events (Germany conquered Europe, Cold War became hot, 9/11 never happened, etc.)\n\n\\- Angels and Demons? No, not the book but themes of spiritual battles, human corruption, salvation, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample story I am craving\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lady of the Gridiron** \n\n\\[\\*\\] This plot centers around a woman who plays college football at the highest level. She has been playing since middle school and has unmatched athleticism and skill. I imagine her playing at a big time program and being extremely successful\n\n\\[\\*\\] There would be plenty of drama surrounding a woman playing football and all the nuances that come with it\n\n\\[\\*\\] I am not certain this story would have a \u201chappy ending\u201d. Meaning that as she explores whether or not she likes men or women she may date one or the other for a time then realize she actually likes the other way more\n\n\\[\\*\\] I likely will double as her brother who will be the offensive coordinator for the team who was once going to be great but suffered a neck injury which left him paralyzed from the waist down",

Do you enjoy creative writing, character development and thrilling plots? Or are you perhaps looking to meet new friends that value your creativity and welcome your ideas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere a City 12, we aim to provide an open and welcoming roleplaying community, where player freedom and creative expression is valued above all else. We are a community without hierarchy or bias, that value all of our members equally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSet within the Half Life 2 universe, City 12 offers a unique roleplaying platform that caters to all. With the help of our community, we hope to create a living, breathing Discord server like no other, in which character development and experience is placed at the forefront of everything that we do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhether you are an experienced Half Life 2 Roleplayer, or are new to the genre, you will find inside a series of helpful guides to help immerse you in this dynamic world that we hope you will soon become a part of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What can I roleplay?**\n\nWithin reason, pretty much anything you like. City 12 is a mature roleplaying community, set within the bleak alternative world of Half Life 2. A unique dystopia, HL2 is a world in which humanity suffers beneath a heartless and unknowable alien regime, popularly known as the Combine. Oppressive and cruel, the remnants of humanity have been herded into the last remaining cities on earth. Stripped of their former names, and of all historic significance, these places are soulless and dreary places of hard labour and austerity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Citizens**\n\nDressed in plain uniforms of cheap denim, the remnants of humanity lead an existence rife with danger. Life is cheap and individuality repressed, ever under the watchful gaze of the Combine, citizens have to face a daily routine of hard labour and empty stomachs. Yet despite the untold hardship, mankind endures, and although this is a world in which simple human affection can be seen as an act of defiance, relationships still bloom in secret.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Civil Protection**\n\nThe path that leads to ordinary men and women joining Civil Protection is often long and intimately complex, none the less when they don that sinister mask, they become merely another unit in the Combine\u2019s hated arsenal of repression. With near total impunity, units of Civil Protection can often be found praying on the helpless citizenry of City 12. Like playground bullies with guns, any sense of morality or justice soon fades from any would be recruit. With improved rations and power over their peers, the life of a Civil Protection unit is measurably preferable to that of your average citizen, you only have to sacrifice your humanity first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Civil Workers Union**\n\nMembers of the Civil Workers Union are the cogs that keep the machine turning. Managers, administrators and landlords, these individuals help to keep the various factories, offices and housing blocks of City 12 running. Although considered of higher status than the average citizen, members of the CWU are no less at the mercy of Civil Protection. Yet to combat this risk, and often to hide their self-serving corruption, CWU members are often amongst the most enthusiastic of informers, happy to sell out their fellow man to save their own skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Criminal elements**\n\nAs ordered and repressive as City 12 society may be, the streets are no less rife with crime. From petty theft to serious organised crime, many nefarious individuals peddle their dark trade throughout the lesser patrolled areas of City 12. From gangs to serial killers, one would well advised to obey the curfew and avoid the seedier parts of town.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Resistance**\n\nNot all residents of City 12 are content to lay down and accept Combine rule. Many a brave soul has attempted to take a stand against the oppressive regime, yet few survive for long. To become an Anti-citizen is to accept that your death is inevitable, for as stalwart and just as your cause may be, the infinite tendrils of the Universal Union will slowly but surely wrap around your throat, one day Civil Protection will find you. Yet despite the seemingly helpless situation, hope still exists for the brave few that take up the mantle of resistance. Expect no help, expect no glory, expect no mercy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Aliens**\n\nA decade before the Combine invasion, following the Black Mesa incident in the early 2000s, mankind was faced with the stark truth that mankind is not alone. From the simple yet terrifying headcrab, to the sentient Vortigaunts, City 12 is home to many creatures that are not of this world.\n\nAlthough we would ask that you to respect the source material, player freedom is at the very heart of City 12.

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, Pokemon and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind). (Admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am mainly looking for as a partner. And hopefully one who has no limits, like me.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me!\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have to urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)",

            "selftext": "With everyone\u2019s favourite manga on a break next week, it\u2019s just impossible to get your weekly dose of the One Piece world\u2026 Or is it?\n\n#StrawHatRPG: An Open World Roleplay Community\n\nWelcome to StrawHatRPG, the **oldest ongoing One Piece Roleplay Subreddit**. We are an alternate universe set in the rules of the One Piece World but without any of the canon characters, entirely new locations and a few familiar ones. \n\nWe\u2019ve recently concluded the first iteration of our Roleplay that came to an end with a dramatic takedown of one of the four mighty Yonko themselves after a breath-taking adventure that spanned almost three years in total! On their journeys players have explored various islands (including but not limited to Sky Islands, Fishmen Island, Marineford, Impel Down, Sabaody Archipelago and others that will remind you of One Piece). We\u2019ve also visited completely **original settings** complete with their own quirks and filled with **unique NPCs** for players to interact with and even engage in thrilling battles against. Various players stood tall above the crowd, gaining infamy and titles of **Supernovae** and even **Shichibukai**. During our three year long run, we have had over **200+ different player characters**, all of them unique in their own way due to the degree of customisation allowed by our systems. [Here\u2019s a peek at some of the more infamous players among our ranks, with bounties ranging as high as 1 Billion Beli!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EPOKs2s8hIkZ5CuujJvDru_ol640W2gT)\n\n***\n\nNow we look to begin anew, 20 Years after the death of an Emperor of the Sea. A spark ignites a blazing flame in the hearts of the next era of Pirates. Come join us on a brand new adventure and immerse yourself in the stunning world of One Piece!\n\nOur goal here at the sub is to be a story-driven, pseudo-linear RPG. Similar to the One Piece Manga, we continually journey forward from island to island. The island is completely open-world, meaning you can go where you like. This means you can explore, investigate, rabble-rouse, pick fights, get drunk, lay on the beach, train, or anything else you can think of! There will be events that players can participate in, or simply do their own thing, making up their own mini-story. Besides this, each island will also have a main story, open to all of the players. \n\nWe encourage **creativity and individualism**, and will try and help facilitate that as much as we can (while keeping in mind the themes, and tone of One Piece, and the sub). Players have various different options to customise their characters such as **Custom Devil fruits**, Abilities like **Diable Jambe or Asura** that are unique to their character etc. Players can also choose to **play as any race** from the world of One Piece or they can even combine races to get the best of both worlds!\n\nIf all of these seem daunting, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve simplified the rules into easily digestible docs so that anyone can easily get started. Between our experienced mod team and **super friendly and helpful community**, you won\u2019t have any trouble finding all the help you need. We\u2019ve also taken into account all the feedback we\u2019ve received and constructed **Brand New and Improved Systems** \n\n***\n\nOur new Roleplay will kick off on the 15th of November, but no need to wait until then to get started. Players who make their characters before the 13th of November stand a chance to win the Devil of none other than the Great God Enel-Sama. That\u2019s right,you can get your hands the one and only **Goro Goro no Mi!** Besides that we will also be giving away **Double Stats** on our very first stat event, so even if you don\u2019t get your favourite lightning fruit, you don\u2019t need to go away empty handed.\n \nCome on over to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/qc4hRv7) to talk with other players, get advice from the mods, talk about the sub, or just talk! Everyone is friendly and loves to talk about any subject imaginable! It's a great place to just connect to other One Piece fans, if nothing else!\n \nWell what are you waiting for?

            "selftext": "Before we begin, please note that this RP could contain adult themes like extreme violence, sex, substance abuse, alcohol, and strong language. If you\u2019re not able to play and enjoy any of these themes, then we\u2019re not compatible.  I\u2019m looking for someone LITERATE, DETAILED, and ACTIVE!\n\n\nI was 9. The clock had just struck a quarter past midnight. The sound of the fall winds outside was all the evidence I needed that mother Autumn was in full effect. The shutter of the only window in my room rattled against the house, but I got used to the sound relatively quickly when I crawled underneath my deep red duvet with my game boy. My parents were asleep in the room across from mine, but the sound was all the way down on Pok\u00e9mon Ruby just incase my parents got up to use the bathroom. I\u2019m glad I made that decision because I wouldn\u2019t have heard that faint sound downstairs. I lowered my gameboy, wondering if it was apart of my imagination. Another scratching like noise. No, it definitely wasn\u2019t apart of my imagination. I would\u2019ve heard my parents door if it opened, so it wasn\u2019t them either. At first, fear bubbled up in my chest, but curiosity overtook me soon after. My small feet touched my carpeted floor, carrying me to my door after I left my running gameboy on my pillow. \n\nI creeped downstairs, my hands on the wooden bannister of the stairs to prevent me from accidental noises. The living room was dark, street lamps outside casting ominous shadows across the room. I crept past the living room quickly, my feet finally touching the cold linoleum floors of the kitchen. The refrigerator was open and there were food items sprawled all over the floor. \u201cH.. hello?..\u201d I whispered, tentatively walking past the marble countered island.\n\nI\u2019d like this to be a longterm HumanXNonHuman romantic role play with other themes like drama and a bit of action as well. Please note that romance usually means sex as well, so if you\u2019re not prepared to play and enjoy those scenes, it wouldn\u2019t work. In this RP, you\u2019d be playing as a non human girl. You\u2019re able to freely customize her as you\u2019d like, but the mainstays are that her parents were killed because of their unnatural appearance, and she fled from the scene. Ever since then, she\u2019s been alone, cold, hungry, and tired. We\u2019ll start with the fateful encounter above, then skim through different points in their life developing the bond between them until we reach young adulthood. From there, I feel like we\u2019ll be flowing relatively well and hit a stride, branching out wherever we see fit! If you\u2019ve read all of this and accept it, say \u2018Tsukuyomi\u2019 in your initial message.\n",
