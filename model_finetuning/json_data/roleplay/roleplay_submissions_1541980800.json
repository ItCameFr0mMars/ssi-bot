            "selftext": "[I AM AN ADULT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER ADULT TO DO A FICTIONAL RP WITH]\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone to do a roleplay. Some are based off of some fandoms. For those I normally prefer to be an oc, but on some occasions I can be canon. I only play females. I prefer you play canon males.\n\nFor non fandom rps, we create our own characters (fully unique most of the time). \n\nThe RP must be semi-advanced literate and use decent spelling, grammar and be adequately detailed and lengthy. Please know the difference between \u201cYou\u2019re\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d and \u201ctoo,to,two\u201d, etc. Also I prefer third person. \n\nERP/DRP/SMUT (18+) will likely be part of the RP. Romance will likely be as well. \n\nSome of the fandoms I\u2019m craving to RP right now are:\n**VIDEO GAMES**\nFallout (4 specifically)\n\t\u2043\tlooking for a Danse or Maxson, although deacon, MacCready, Valentine or Hancock can be options. \nRDR2/RDR\n\t\u2043\tA lot of options for you for this one, Jack, John or Arthur mostly, maybe Dutch, Javier, Lenny (R.I.P.) and a few others \nFar Cry 5\n\t\u2043\tany of the seed family males tbh, I love me some sadistic cult bois \nAssassins Creed \n\t\u2043\tmost male protagonists, except for origins since I haven\u2019t played it.\n\n**TV**\nStranger Things \n\t\u2043\tSteve or Billy \nGame of Thrones \n\t\u2043\ta huge amount of variety for this one as well. Can go from books as well.\nVikings \n\t\u2043\tAny of ragnars sons, Ragnar, Rollo, Halfdan, Harald, Alfred, possibly others.\n\n**MOVIES**\nStar Wars \n\t\u2043\tLots of variety for this one \nHarry Potter \n\t\u2043\tmore oc ideas for this \n\n**COMICS**\nI do RP based off of both the DCEU, and the marvel movies (both fox &amp; Disney). I don\u2019t really watch enough of the television shows to RP them. \nALTHOUGH I prefer doing COMIC based RP, which is the comic versions of the characters. I also include most imprints of both DC and Marvel.\nI play a large list of female Canons, but I prefer to be an oc most likely. I\u2019ve got an even larger list of males you may play, so almost any I\u2019ll accept. \n\n*!!!NON FANDOM!!! RPs I\u2019d like to do* \n\nHistorical (settings mostly)\n\t\u2043\tI love history based RP, it can be anywhere from caveman days to the 70s-90s. \n\t\u2043\tSome of my faves are: medieval, ww2, Viking era, Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt, 1980s, Wild West/frontier, 1920s, other modern history as well as older eras.\nFantasy \nMedieval \nFuturistic/Sci-Fi \nApocalyptic\nDystopian \nFictional War Setting\nSupernatural/Paranormal \nAlternate Realities\nPretty much anything tbh. \n\n\nI use Discord and this app. \n\nAny groups you think I may be interested in? Feel free to tell me! ",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm looking for a literate partner to do a Soul Eater RP with, but I assume you figured that out before even clicking the button. I'll elaborate by stating that I'm looking for a scenario that happens after the Anime (not the manga, I haven't read it and uh...well it's awfully long, isn't it!). It'll take place in a scenario I've developed involving a cult wishing to return the earth to its primordial state (which is the story in the broadest terms.) It'll have us playing as OC students from the first year onward, and an especially talented and special pair at that! I would be glad to explain a little more if you message me!\n\nI'm looking for literate partners, as previously stated. I type anywhere from 1-2 paragraphs most of the time, and try to keep scenes moving and the RP interesting. I'm simply asking for an understanding of the basics of writing and a general sense of grammar. I also expect a partner who can post at least once per day!  \n\n\nAs an added part of this ad, I'm also gonna freely admit to being the best at leading scenes or controlling the world, and I'm hoping for somebody more capable of doing that!  I am usually hard-pressed to come up with small events and story beats without help, and would also love some advice on how to do that if anyone is interested!  I already have a basic character idea or two down.  I'm looking forward to talking to you!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello reddit! I\u2019m Travis. I\u2019m a twenty one year old role player with about  six years of experience. I am based in the east coast so my time zone is  EST. Since I work from home my schedule is usually all day if that  matters at all. I do prefer to use discord when role playing just  because I\u2019m almost always near my PC. When it comes to post length I  don\u2019t really have a set limit it\u2019s very much a you get what you put into  it sort of thing. When it comes to point of view I can write in any  style it usually comes down to partner preference. This is as is open to  role players of all experience levels whether you are a novice or a  veteran.\n\nThe genres I tend to write most  are fantasy, post apocalyptic, and Vigilante stuff. That being said I am  open to other options if you had an idea or certain plot in mind to  try. When it comes to fandoms I prefer to do OC X OC and just tell a  story that takes place in that world or universe. MxF is my preferred pairing as it is what I have the most experience writing.\n\nThe  things I look for in a partner is someone who is committed and active at least once daily to the role play. If life gets in the way just let me know so I don\u2019t think you just ghosted since that happens way too often. I want someone who is confident and flexible just in case they aren\u2019t feeling the story or want to switch to something else they won\u2019t be afraid to speak up. I\u2019m a sucker for romance so I do want my partners to be +18 because most romances tend to become physical and I try not to shy away from that. Another important thing to note is if you do want to do a romance don\u2019t expect them to be in love right away as I like a good slow burn romance.\n\nIf this sounded interesting to you or if you had any questions please message me here. I can also provide writing samples upon request.\n\nThank you all for your time! Good luck in your search! Have a great day!",

In addition, this server is primarily active during the day for US time zones, so please keep that in mind when considering joining.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*One day long ago in Quig Quig, China, a luminescent baby was born with a unique power. Then, as time passed, the similar phenomena happened all over the world, and soon the majority of the population had obtained superhuman powers\u2014known as \u201cQuirks\u201d. Due to that, people were able to pursue heroism as a profession. However, with the changing pace of the world, it was no surprise when tensions began to rise. People with quirks became the norm and the quirkless were left to watch them rise to the occasion whenever trouble was afoot. While most quirkless individuals tended not to mind the heroes and even appreciated their valiance, a growing number of quirkless people felt that they had been completely forgotten by society.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n*These quirkless individuals decided to take matters into their own hands, a select few even going so far as to bring about the production of \u201cartificial\u201d quirks. Artificial quirks are quirks that are given to a quirkless individual through a procedure specific to its type. Slight mutation quirks were distributed through surgical procedures, emitter quirks were given through implantation of various devices in the body, and transformation quirks had yet to be mastered. The scientific field unveiled artificial quirks to the public and the world began to change yet again. With the influx of artificial quirks, competition to get into hero schools skyrocketed to an all time high while several pro-heroes experienced a shift in their ranking. On account of all of this, there is typically a great deal of tension between those with artificial and natal quirks\u2026 Society had begun to change and as fate would have it, artificial quirks eventually fell into the wrong hands.* *Today, there is a large ring of villains attempting to bring about change to the world once more. By forcing their hand, they believe that they can usher in a new breed of heroes and villains\u2014Heroes and villains that are practically hand crafted. Your story begins in Las Vegas, Nevada, a cesspool for crime and a hot spot for heroes to be. With Lady Luck Academy nearby and a plethora of budding heroes, paths are bound to cross and adventures are sure to be had. The only question is; Who will you be?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you've made it this far and you're interested, congratulations!

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I\u2019ve had this idea to make a Cowboy Bebop inspired roleplay for a while and I\u2019m looking for a small group of people (4-5 maximum) who would be interested in writing it out with me.\n\nThe year is 2078, humanity has inhabited the many moons and planets of the solar system. Over the years, crime rates have risen due to the wide spread of people across the system, with the Interplanetary Police setting up a means to lower the increasing threat of crime. A legal bounty hunting system has been put into play, where enrolled bounty hunters (\u201cCowboys\u201d) are able to hunt criminals as well as stolen possessions and deliver them to the police in return for payment. Durante Dunkerque, a slick \u201cgentleman\u201d thief with a taste for the expensive is one of these \u201cCowboys\u201d and he needs a crew to work with. \n\nYour characters will play the members of this leaderless bounty hunting crew. Your character is up to you. They could be: the pilot, the muscle, the brains, a mix or whatever else you can think of. The details are up to you as long as they fit in with the setting. Just in case it isn\u2019t clear, my own character will be Durante and the crew will travel together on a ship (the name of the ship hasn\u2019t been decided on yet).\n\nI feel like the setting should be semi-original, not based in the Bebop universe, but heavily based on it. \n\nAs for the story, I have an idea. It will be told in \u201cepisodes\u201d of sorts. Each episode will function similarly to the anime, with every one being its own little story that can contribute to a main story arc. The episodes can be based off of any ideas we come up with. Every member of the group can take turns of being a soft GM for each episode. At the moment, I have no solid main story arc in place.\n\nOne important thing I would like to mention is that I understand that real life things are important. If you have to take a heap of time writing out responses because of work or education, that\u2019s fine with me, just please show the same respect to me and the rest of the group.\n\nAs for writing styles, please have decent grammar. I won\u2019t deny that I\u2019m a pretty slow writer, but I was thinking that we could all write in a paragraph to multi-paragraph style. I also prefer to write in third person.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please DM me. I obviously haven\u2019t shared every piece of information here, so you can ask me any questions you\u2019d like to later and we can exchange discord names. I look forward to roleplaying with you all.\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello there!! I\u2019m looking for long-term partner for a Vikings themed RP. I\u2019ve recently watched The Last Kingdom, and the Vikings again..and I feel inspire to do a role play prompt based around that genre.   I have done many viking themed prompts before, and I have spent years gathering an understanding of Viking culture and normalities, and I would prefer if my partner could have some basic knowledge on the Viking life as well.\n\nAs for the prompt, I\u2019d like it if we can discuss this together so that we both get a plot that we can enjoy, instead of having someone become bored because it\u2019s not their style. I would like this role play to have a romantic prompt, but obviously not without the angst and hardships.  \n\nI consider myself a rather literate role player with years of experience, which is why I expect my partner to be the same. I write in third person, past tense only. I can\u2019t stand people who write in first person, although that\u2019s my personal taste. \n\nI\u2019m a female looking for a male partner, that has an original character to give to the prompt. I\u2019ve always preferred my partners character to play a \u201cAlpha male\u201d role. I feel like everyone enjoys the role play more when the characters are historically accurate, from clothing to personalities, and roles. For example, a Viking male may be more rough, dominate, and distant towards others. If you are not comfortable with that, then your character doesn\u2019t have to have that personality. \n\nIf you want a Viking themed RP, please message me and we can exchange contact information(for discord) and then discuss the plot we want to take and other small details.. Also please be working on your character description when you message me, so we can focus more on the prompt.",

I play a male character in his 40s who is married and she was going to play a young adult (legal age) babysitter and they\u2019re about to begin a scandalous affair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be over 21 and ok with smut but also some really intense role play and possibly building a whole world.

God creates the ocean,god creates a single island,god creates fish,those that are carnivorous in order to keep people on the island,and those that are harmless,for the people to eat. God then creates land animals for people to hunt,he then litters the island with plants,blessing the people with more food. God creates a man and a woman,gifting them both with the knowledge of half what he knows,to see if mankind will commit good or evil with the boundless knowledge the two are given,to see what they can accomplish.\n\nThe Man and Woman survive,and reproduce,giving birth to twins,which eventually re-produce,and so on and so forth. With the intelligence of possibly combined from the Man\u2019s half and the Woman\u2019s half,the people were able to invent and create an organized society for civilized living,as to why the settlement of Halflamb exists.\n\nEveryone,even the Elders,seem to have forgotten what their ancestors know,and now know nothing of what is outside of the walls of the settlement and rely on the totem pole\u2019s information. Clothing is modern,there is no electronic technology of any sort,the main source of light is candles and lanterns.\n\nKeeping track of time,on their year of 100,012,month 6,Day 3,a sick mother gave birth to a revolting hideously deformed child,who was determined by the Elders,\u201dOffspring of satan\u201d,and the child was thrown into the wilderness. Two years later,another sick mother gives birth to a mutated child with three arms and one eye. \u201cOffspring of satan\u201d,the elders called the child,but this time,it was a baby girl. She was thrown out into the wilderness to fend for herself. Deformed children kept entering the world from their mother\u2019s womb,and the Elder\u2019s continued to banish them. Legends say most of the monstrous children grew up and reproduced,creating their own society far,far away.\n\nThe outside island is barely explored,and people have only explored a mile wide of the island. Society changes as it grows,but what will happen to you as a member of this isolated society?\n\n(Narration and role choosing will do the rest,technology does not exist,clothing is modern but nothing else,nearly everyone in Halflamb smokes cigarettes)\n\nHALFLAMB LAWS\n\n1. 1. Murder of innocent,normal townsfolk will result in execution.\n2. 2. Conspiracy against the town will result in execution.\n3. 3. Providing false evidence of important town matters will result in execution.\n4. 4. Blasphemous behaviour or following another religion other than christianity will result in torture and execution.\n5. 5. Disturbing the town peace will result in Exile or execution.\n6. 6. Witchcraft will result in execution.\n7. 7. Disrespecting the Elders will result in execution.\n8. 8. Not providing for the town will result in exile.\n9. 9. Not complying with authority figures or mutiny will result in exile or execution.\n10. 10. Speaking another language or doing something out of the ordinary,exile or execution.\n\nRoles...\n\nRUNNER (Common)\n\nFaction: \\[God\u2019s Children\\]\n\nIn the settlement of Halflamb,resources such as materials,water and food,even with the farm,began to get severely scarce with 2000 people in the town. The Elders created a new department,called \u2018The Runners\u2019,who were the healthiest people in Halflamb that would be sent out into the wilderness to fetch a list of supplies written by the Elders. \u2018The Runners\u2019 Were sent out into 4 groups of 3 to head out north,east,south and west,and were given backpacks containing a matchbook,3 candles,a lantern,a pack of cigarettes,2 water bottles,3 sandwiches,a map copied from the totem pole,a survival guide,a knife,a rope,medical alcohol,bandages,stitches,a small cardboard case of nine .357 handgun bullets,a loaded .357 handgun holding a clip of nine,a small cardboard case of seven .475 rifle bullets,a loaded .475 rifle holding a clip of 7,and a wooden rosary as a blessing. \n\n\\-\n\nDETECTIVE (Common)\n\nFaction: \\[God\u2019s Children\\]\n\nIn the settlement of Halflamb,laws were eventually broken,so there had to be a department of people to put a stop to it. The Detectives work for the Sheriff,and their duty is to keep peace,law and order in the town of Halflamb by investigating any cases of law breakings and  executing or arresting any unlawful townsfolk. Equipped with a loaded .500 revolver holding a cylinder of 6 bullets,a matchbook and a pack of cigarettes.\n\nSHERIFF (Rare,only 1)\n\nFaction: \\[God\u2019s Children\\]\n\nThe Sheriff is in charge of the town. The Sheriff\u2019s duty is to keep everything in town under control and civilized,and make sure everyone is abiding by the law.

The sheriff commands the Detectives and works for the Elders. Equipped with a loaded .500 revolver holding a cylinder of 6 bullets,a matchbook and a pack of cigarettes.\n\n\\-\n\nDIPLOMAT (Common)\n\nFaction: \\[God\u2019s Children\\]\n\nThe Diplomat works with the Elders and assists in shaping the town\u2019s laws,and approaching matters strategically such as outsider attacks,dealing with unlawful townsfolk and etc. There can be a group of Diplomats to debate against each other in what they believe is the correct to solve a problem,which will then be determined by the Elders,or there can be a single Diplomat which works with the Elders to shape and try to steer the two Elders\u2019 approach to things.\n\nREVOLUTIONARY (Common)\n\nFaction: \\[Vincent\u2019s Conspiracy/The Silenced/Satan\u2019s Disciples\\]\n\nA man who believed that there was more beyond the island,beyond the ocean,preached of this in town and was hung for what he believed in,which was against the town\u2019s religion. This caused some townsfolk to become devastated,and formed a secret group thats intention is to take over the town by converting normal townsfolk into the group and eventually,waging war against the Elders and their followers to create a better more understanding and free society.\n\nSTUDENT (Common)\n\nFaction: \\[God\u2019s Children\\]\n\nThe young must learn about the world they live in,and the religion they are taught to believe in. The Student can question this life their given,or they can go along with it and step in line and live like everyone else.\n\n\\-\n\nSEEKER MALE (Common)\n\nFaction: \\[God\u2019s Children\\]\n\nA male Seeker is someone who is secretly trying to find a way to become the male Elder,and will jump at the opportunity to become one and take the place of the current male Elder. If there are other male Seekers,they will most likely compete for the position of Elder.\n\nSEEKER FEMALE (Common)\n\nFaction: \\[God\u2019s Children\\]\n\nA female Seeker is someone who is secretly trying to find a way to become the female Elder,and will jump at the opportunity to become one and take the place of the current female Elder.

I'm going to be linking my gateway at the end for more information and I urge you to look at my previous posts to see more about me and get a feel of what I'm looking for.\n\nI'm currently looking for a male, or someone to play a male, to scratch a certain itch I've been having. I want to shake things up and instead of doing a slice of life roleplay, I'd love to do a supernatural one! Ideally, I'd love a partner thats knowledgeable about werewolves and how their whole mindset is when it comes to mates, with whom I could do a werewolf roleplay! But if you don't know much about that, that's totally fine! We can totally do something else like a vampire plot, angels/demons, or really whatever else you'd like to do!\n\nI exclusively use Discord as my medium and would need my partner to use it too. I'd also really be your best friend if you could play an alpha male personality. (Dominating, aggressive, possessive, hard headed, stubborn, etc.)\n\nIf you've read through this whole this, congrats! Let me know that you've earned brownie points!\n\n(PS here's my gateway! I implore you to read it along with my other previous posts!

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Checkmate! My friends and I have been enjoying our RP that we have based off the Parahumans Universe. A place where superheroes, supervillains and everything in between is integrated into our world in a unique and realistic way! The setting is based off of the works Worm and Ward by Wildbow, but it is by no means necessary for you to have read those works. (Most of the server actually has not read them, but still enjoys the setting thoroughly!) We are a relatively small community focused on character building, literate storytelling and creativity as opposed to having nothing but high-flying, explosion filled superhero fights 24/7, though those action scenes aren't uncommon either!  \n\n\nYou're invited to join in on the fun here at Bay Area Parahumans!

I always let my partner know if I will have delays and an estimated time of return.\n\n* I am wanting to do a FUN apocalypse. It will have serious elements for the story, unlike most this one will play out differently where we are enjoying ourselves when we can. There will be NSFW content, nothing too graphic for violence, just some shooting, looting and sexual content. Surviving and thriving in a world with the New World order.\n\n* Secret societies, government agencies provide the agenda. You just happen to know an insider, even thought you didn't know that. \n\n* You only have to play one character. Starting off in the here and now. Today! 2018. The adventure will begin! I will play several female characters, one male character that will be a buddy, brother or Dad to your character, nothing sexual with him! He will be the insider, military and secret society connections that will be very valuable to survive what is about to happen. I will also play bad guys and random npc types to keep the story fun and exciting.\n\n* You need only be a normal guy, I am not picky! To me, it is more about someone that loves a good story, wild fun and joking around. As long as you are an adult over 18, American....You can play as mid teens up to 50. Can be chubby, balding...Doesn't matter. Just a normal guy! If you say you are special forces or something, can you please be able to fake it? Not having the swagger you say you have is depressing. If you want to be a Gamer type with no real life experience, no problem! The others in this story are there for you!\n\n* I typo at times, my auto correct does crazy things. I also read typonese well, if you make a mistake you can trust that I get what you meant by the context. I am not a formal writer, I love to role play. the characters I play are not all the same personality with a different picture and backstory. They are all going to be different. They will like and do different things.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nIf you play daily, like action, adventure, fun and romance...Want a story with several characters that doesn't require waiting on people that never seem to have time to play...I am your girl! I reply pretty fast and play hard all day when the story is good. If things seem to start a little slow, just know that I am learning what you like and respond to and the story will just get better and better as well as the steamy parts.\n\nI will customize my characters to fit yours, will need a character description and age, any limits you might have in your first reply. After that we can talk a little and get going! I can be on later today than usual, until around 10pm central US time. We can work out some details and even get things rolling!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

            "selftext": "Hi, i\u2019m an advanced roleplayer, and i usually like to do supernatural roleplays.\n\nI dont mind spelling errors, so long as you try not to make it a habit, and write as much as i do back. I dont go for one or two liners, this is a roleplay, a story we\u2019re doing together, and one person cant do it all. \n\nI dont mind if you\u2019re a guy or a girl, so long as you can roleplay well.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014//\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014punk\nIt was winter in our small town, the perfect time for me to move in, taking up residence in an old abandoned house, sealing up the basement. I, like many vampires, migrated with the weather, finding the best place to stay and hunting for a few months, moving on. \n\nI was Vincent, 106, give or take a year, turned when i was only 19. I had short black hair, a small goatee, blue eyes, and pale skin. I was charismatic and charming, but i did have a temper if i was pushed too far. I wore a worn pair of jeans, torn from years of use, a black leather jacket, red shirt, a pair of fingerless gloves, and boots. I blended in well with a normal punk kid, an easy disguise.\n\nI stalked out on night, looking for a straggler to hunt down and feed from, walking down the street as normal. Putting up his hood, he lit a cigarette, any passerby would just think of him as another rebellious teen. The snow didnt affect him in the slightest.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-//\u2014\u2014\u2014Feral (wild)\nIts a cold night in the dead of winter, early in the 1800s. Your family home was large, deep in the woods neighboring a nearby city. \n\nI was on the run, caught out by a vampire hunter, feeding off of a deer i had brought down, and was being chased through the woods. I managed to avoid him, coming to the clearing surrounding your home. With no other option, i scaled the wall, climbing onto your balcony and pressing against the door. I caught the scent of a human inside, and turned my head, staring inside. \n\nI was tall, with dark brown hair kept long, just past my ears, with a small goateeon my chin, dark red eyes, and pale, almost translucent skin. My clothing matched the era, but was tattered and worn. I had lost any sense of language, only growling like an animal, my humanity seemed long gone. \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014//\u2014\u2014-aristocrat\nLost in the night from your tiny village, you wander through the forest, unbeknownst to the beast watching you. As you wander, you encounter a large castle in the distance, aged and falling apart. The cold winds blasted you, the snow chilled you, but still you felt fear.\n\nHe watched you, from the darkness, from the trees and the bushes, the branches and the sky. Swooping down from the dark, and elegant man stood before you, wrapped in a long aristocratic cloak, his clothing matching something beyond your era, but his face...was as pale as the snow. His eyes red, and his teeth sharp.\n\nHe stepped closer, and in doing so, illuminated the rest of him. His hair was well kept, long, wavy, and black, tied behind his head, and a small goatee on his chin, as well.\nHis hands seemed like claws, the nails blackened and sharp, to match his teeth. As you looked at his teeth, you caught his eyes, and in an instant you were lost.\n\n\u2014\u2014-Newly turned\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAfter going missing for nearly a week, you worried for Vincent\u2019s safety. He had always been a close, and protective boyfriend, which made you feel calm. Without him around, things became harder and your fear didnt help. He left to go to a bar for a few drinks, but he never returned after a few hours, and when days past, you planned to call the police.\n\nVincent was tall, with thick black curly hair, bright blue eyes, a small goatee, and a cute smirk that he often used to drive you crazy. He was naturally thin, though he did like to workout, giving himself some muscle tone. He usually wore his black leather jacket and jeans, with a white t-shirt underneath, and boots.\n\nLate one night, almost 10 on the dot, you heard a loud banging on the door. Vincent leaned his head against it, tired and weakened. He felt like the life had been drained from him. Groaning, he held his stomach tightly, the pain was immense. He had no idea what had happened or where he was, all he knew was that he woke up in a stranger\u2019s apartment, and he had to get back home. He only hoped he hadn\u2019t made a big mistake.\n\n\u2014\u2014-starved\u2014\u2014-\nKnown for his good looks, Vincent was popular among the nurses, using his charm and charisma to get quite a few girlfriends before his accident. At the age of 18, he stood tall at 6\u20190, with long curly brown hair, and a small goatee on his chin. His eyes were piercing blue, coupled with his smirk, won anyone over. But he hid a dark and violent side, overprotective, a fighter, picking fights with any man, even his fellow soldiers.\n\nAfter being shot on the sidelines of the Civil War, Vincent was bitten by a nurse, forced to ingest blood, and become a creature of the night, a Vampire. She begged him to stay with her, let her teach him, but he shunned her teachings. She turned him against his will, making him a cruel, hungry monster.\n\nAfter murdering several soldiers, both on his side and against, he was captured by a group of vampires, taking the rogue and chaining him up, draining him dry, and starving him to the point he couldn\u2019t even move, blink, even breathe.\n\nThey sealed him up in an old cavern far off the warfield, kept safe from prying eyes. In the future, maybe he\u2019d have been savable, able to become a good person. But for now, he had to be restrained.\n\nChained up against a wall, he slept, in wait for someone, something, to come free him, give him a chance to feed. To anyone who found him, he\u2019d just be a corpse, someone who lost their life, but he was alive, he could still sense it all.\n\nYears later, Civil War museums began to let out tours of the battlefields, as many passed by the cave, warned of the danger of wild animals inside, but soon enough, someone foolish enough to go inside would wake him up, and he\u2019d be free to have some \u201cfun\u201d again.\n\n\u2014\u2014-demon\u2014\u2014-\nWord spoke of demonic hauntings at the old abandoned house, deep within the woods. World spread that they did devil worship in there many years ago, attempting to communicate with the devil himself, only to end up slaughtered by something. That was nearly 50 years ago.\n\nTimes changed, and often, calls were recieved to go and investigate, finding nothing but ruined furniture and creepy drawings. Though they investigated throughly, they could never enter the basement, kept bolt locked tightly, behind a rusted metal door. Many had gone missing trying to investigate that house for paranormal activity, so it was cautioned off.\n\nNew to the area, you figured it might have been superstition, but you were curious. Walking up to it, it was imposing. Broken windows, peeling paint, but something...something urged you forward. Like a finger waived you forward, you could hear the whispers. Stepping onto the porch, the air blew towards you, a sweet scent filled the air, from deep inside the house.\n\n\nMy kik is flameman123456",

            "selftext": "Hi, would anyone be interested in creating a Discord-based group fantasy RP  with me? I'm not entirely sure of what it could be. \nI was thinking something along the lines of werewolf vs vampire, or some kind of factions-based group roleplay. I think that has a lot of potential, but I haven't seen it done well or in a way that I would prefer. Though, I don't think I could do that kind of planning myself. If you're interested in starting one with me, please message me! If multiple promising people PM me, then let's all plan it together. I think it could be fun. \nBy group, I mean a whole server (so, potentially a hundred or more people) or perhaps it could just be a small scale thing where it's the people who message me and maybe some other people we invite \u2014 let's figure that out together. \nI'd also like it to have some fantasy themes, and have it be literate. \nIf you're interested, message me.

If you\u2019re not able to play and enjoy any of these themes, then we\u2019re not compatible, sorry.\n\nThe Court of Cataclysm. A name that would mean nothing to the general public, but a name that would freeze a political powerhouse or the CEO of a large company in their boots. We are an organization of 12 very highly trained agents dedicated to assassination, espionage, sabotage, security, among other services. Each agent has been assigned another as a permanent partner, usually going on missions in pairs. Also, each agent uses a code name, following the theme of mythical beasts from different folklore and legends. In addition to the codename, each agent has a mask they use with anything regarding to the Court such as missions, usually corresponding with said codename.\n\nEach pair of agents has a handler who assigns their missions, gets their weapons, vehicles and clothes, and is essentially the pair\u2019s \u2018Man in the chair\u2019 or \u2018eyes in the sky.\u2019  As you may have guessed, or characters are a pair in this RP, and have been for the last couple of years. An agent\u2019s relationship with another is supposed to be strictly business, but not ours. Over the years, we bonded, and know a lot about each other, including our real names. Under the guise of close friends however, there is something bubbling underneath.. a certain love developing upon each bit of contact with each other, although we never act upon it as it is strictly forbidden by The Court to fraternize with other agents.\n\nThis (obviously) Longterm RP will have us going on missions, developing our relationship, and everything you might think an action/romance roleplay would have. I find it important to describe what characters are wearing, doing, or using including our own, so don\u2019t skip the details! You may use a reference to a character or what they\u2019re wearing, because that\u2019s probably what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019ll have a character template written up soon, so I\u2019ll send you that as well. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, PM me. I have Discord and kik, but I\u2019m willing to move over to another mobile platform besides email.\n\nI hope to see your message!\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": " \n\nI'm looking for people that want to rp some fandoms and don't mind playing the female, and also don't mind nsfw themes(So be over 18!). The rp doesn't have to revolve purely around nsfw themes... but I don't mind if it does! I prefer it sometimes actually; I love pure nsfw rps as much as I love ones involving both plot and nsfw stuff.\n\nOCxCanon is my main thing; CanonXCanon is alright.... but I just find OCxOC boring in a fandom setting.... not much of a fandom rp then if you ask me.\n\nI'd like things to be literate/semi-literate, no script play! Length doesn't bother me, so long as your replies aren't always just a single sentence it is perfectly fine. But I also don't want to write a full novel for a singular reply.... 1-3 paragraphs is my limit, sorry. Third person please! I can respond daily, I don't expect you to do the same.... but if it's been awhile and I ask 'Are you still interested?' just a simple 'Yes, I'm just busy' would suffice, please don't leave me in the dark or ghost me. If you read this, put your favorite color in the message you send. You don't know how many people I start an rp with who just completely disappear or ignore me after day one.\n\nHere are the list of my fandoms:\n\nPokemon (For this, I'd honestly rather do a journey based rp... preferably with nsfw themes. Think of a journey similar to the anime only with less filler and more action and nsfw themes!)\n\nNaruto\n\nSaints Row\n\nTotal Drama (Looking for somebody to play Lindsay)\n\nMarvel and DC\n\nHarry Potter\n\nSonic (Comics, Cartoon, Games... whatever, just not the IDW run as I haven't read that yet)\n\nScooby Doo (Honestly if you can rp as Daphne for me.... I'd do whatever after that)\n\nFallout\n\nMass Effect\n\nFar Cry\n\nGrand Theft Auto\n\nRed Dead Redemption\n\nBen 10\n\nStar Wars\n\nFeel free to hit me up with any ideas you may have for any of the above\n\nLimits/personal restrictions: The one thing I'll flat out refuse to do is MxM, I'm sorry but I don't swing that way. I have nothing personal against it, just not into it. I hope you can respect how I feel about that\n\nI mostly rp over on Discord, I don't kik sorry. Roleplaying here isn't out of the question though, I'd just rather do it on Discord. If you don't have a Discord I'm perfectly okay with that, I'm willing to try an rp on Reddit. Message me for the information if you're interested\n\nLooking forward to hearing from some of you!",

            "selftext": "Hey, I'm Harley, and I guess I'm just looking for a bit of comradery. A little bit of assurance. This is long, but the final episode of this came about an hour ago, and I'm pretty sick over it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've loved writing for as long as I can remember. I think I was in elementary school when I started writing with other people. I was young, and this was in the early 2000's. My first profoundly negative experience came when I used Neopets (cut me some slack, I was like 10). I was contacted by someone writing on Neopets, but he wanted to use a translator so we could write about stuff the website would block. I didn't see the obvious red flag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote with a pedophile. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember him pushing me to say words I didn't want to in the writing. I remember going to the bookstore and reading the chronicles of Narnia and crying because I was overwhelmed and thought I was losing a part of myself. I kind of did. I stopped writing for a long time. I grew up. I took my lumps, but when I graduated college my mental health was pretty bad and I thought about taking up a creative hobby to help me heal a bit. I found this subreddit a year ago and I met several partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost were the kind of bulk responses. Younger teens wanting to write about anime, something I wasn't interested in, so we didn't really connect. Then I met Albert. He was a firecracker from the start, and we had a pretty intense connection. I liked writing with him, but he immediately started demanding more of my attention than I had to give. He was having troubles with his wife. He wanted the ooc chat more than anything else, he wanted me to always be available to talk. I have a boyfriend of 5 years. I was upfront about it. He said he wanted to stop talking. I was heartbroken. He came back in three hours and asked why I hadn't responded to the story after he had made a lengthy goodbye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would continue for another month until I stopped responding. He was controlling, manipulative, and cruel. He told me I wasn't worth anything but entertainment, that's all I was, and I get that writing partners are different, but I always thought of them as friends... I blocked him about a week ago when he slid back into my dm's after 9 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had another partner I had met about 2 months ago. To make a long story short, he had found one of my older ads for a writing partner and he really enjoyed my work. He complimented me, went off on how good I was and asked if we could write together. I was thrilled to have something else to fill the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings were awesome. I work in a lab. Some days I have time to write a lot when I'm running samples, some days I can't even breath at work and I come home so exhausted that I can't even think to do anything but make dinner and talk with my boyfriend for a bit before going to sleep. I guess these latter days really really annoyed him, and tonight he went off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe called me all kinds of names, said I wasn't worth anything, I wasn't empathetic etc. He tried to video call me 4 times on discord and said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"\" I am..  \nactually  beautiful...  \non cam  \neven if you''d   not like to    see\"\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said I would never experience love, bragged about breaking up his prior partners 3-year relationship, told me to kill myself, and he just got more deranged as the conversation went on. He said he was going to make me into the partner he had lost, and then said I wasn't ever going to be her because I wasn't beautiful enough. I think he was drinking heavily because everything was spelled wrong with weird spacing... but we had 6 stories that we worked on for 2 months, and honestly, I'm upset. And all of this, all of it, was because he posted an idea for a starbound story, I saw it was really long so I didn't read it yesterday because I was out all night and exhausted, and then I slept all day and him, my boyfriend, my other friend and I played killingfloor. He spewed all this over a day of not responding, but still talking. Him demanding to know where I had been and why I didn't respond....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's insane. It makes me not want to write anymore, and it's something I love... but I can't. I put so much work into this universe I built and then I try to bring people into it and their characters become a part of it and then they just pull some psycho crap like this and I can't do it. I know every community has people who they would rather get rid of, but I'm trying to hold onto my love, my passion... and I just... I don't know if I can do it anymore. It was so much work for someone to flip out over my not responding for a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this normal? Am I unlucky? I try to respond when I can, and it's not a few words. My last response was over 4k words and it wasn't some low-quality filler... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr- Op is losing her love of the hobby because of controlling abuse and people who try to take advantage of everything. Thanks for reading the long vent-fest... have a great night...",

I love both. I\u2019m open to both. I just prefer to play the more petite character. I\u2019ll write females or males. \n\nIf this is important, I\u2019m a nineteen year old, female. But I prefer to not play myself at all. \n\nBoth N//SFW is okay. I don\u2019t mind it.

I'm looking for a partner to play any canon character from DC, Marvel, Image, Valiant, IDW, or Dark Horse. I am capable of roleplaying the following characters: Invincible, Tempest, Red Robin, Timothy Hunter, Robin, Ninjak, Hawk, Marko, Spider-Man, Shazam, Batman Beyond, Red Hood, Mister Miracle, Kyle Rayner, Ted Kord, Zachary Zatara, Jaime Reyes, and a few others. The characters listed offer a broad range for genres and scenarios. \n\nNow let's go onto the boring rules part of the post. I ask that my partner be very literate and able to write quite a bit. I absolutely love having a bunch of details. I also ask that you be open to any NSFW themes. I do enjoy not having limits to the roleplay experience since it allows me to fully involve myself in my character's role. I hope I don't sound too demanding!\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message. I look forward to exploring some comic book worlds!",

            "selftext": "Howdy there. Archipelago is a roleplaying hub server that features three different worlds that have three different genres. The No-Name Archipelago is the unique setting for the server, and is a multiversal hub world, meaning that anything (so long as it isn't stupidly OP or a joke character) is plausible and negotiable, no matter the genre. Otix is the Fantasy world with it's own digital map, where the technology goes as far as WW1 in very rare cases, but the magic ceiling is infinitesimally higher. We have a modern setting, Truth, that is similar to an alt-earth scenario. And finally, the most recent addition, the Chrysoberyl Nebula, a cosmic body that holds four distinct planets, and has plenty of room for player made planets.\n\nIf you enjoy having tons of options for variety, and plenty of room to carve out your own story, you're going to love this place. Our staff operates on a council-like democracy, and we tend to defer to player votes when it comes to large server changes. We are also offering mentoring sessions for people who want to improve their roleplaying and/or English, and that does mean we are quite open to newcomers to the roleplaying community.\n\nWe do have NSFW content but that's not the primary focus, and that kind of RP is kept far away from standard RP. We also have an OOC NSFW chat for whatever purpose. Just a fair warning.\n\nCome on by and take a peek. ~ Bojangles\n\nhttps://discord.gg/K7JUyPn",

We welcome new players.\n\nBasic Info: I've made a roleplaying server based on Vampire: The Masquerade lore, where you'll be able to play any sect or any clan you wish. Try our platform out, it is a bit different from pen and paper, but I'm sure you'll like it.\n\nSomething about the Chronicle: The year is 2018. The Camarilla had Chicago under its wing for a long time, but after 2010, many Sabbat and Anarchs started appearing in the city. Once 2018 came, all the sects were equally numbered. What will happen next? A war? Perhaps.. but who knows... we'll let the PLAYERS decide the future of everything.\n\nJoin us:Here is our discord link, we hope you get to enjoy our platform and roleplay :)[https://discordapp.com/invite/dXFWc48](https://discordapp.com/invite/dXFWc48)",

She is by far my favorite hero to RP as and love to bust out the google translate to add some Spanish when playing her! :P\n\nNow, I do love me some romance in my RPs and I'd love to involve some in ours! Please keep in mind though that I'd prefer story over smut. I'm not to picky on what character you'd like to play but some of my favortie ones I like to play against are Widow(Super fav), Tracer, Genji, Moria, Reaper and D.VA . Again, I would love to RP with any Overwatch hero if you think you can play them well!\n\nWe can go two directions with the RP. We could do something in-universe and have it be filled with action, drama, and intrigue! We could also do a slice-of-life focused RP and have the it be more focused on the relationship our characters foster.\n\nNow I'd prefer a partner who is *detailed* with their responses. Nothing is worse then having an RP be super bare bones when it comes to descriptions and poor thought out ideas. I post around 1-3 paragraphs per response and that sorta range is something I'm looking for! I also only RP on Reddit and write in third-person. Please add your favorite color in your PM title so I know you read this.",

            "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi! I'm looking for a long-term dedicated partner in a romantic plot. I'd also like a partner who likes headcanons and talking ooc, since I believe communication between partners is important. I have discord, I would like my partner does too.\n\n1. Good spelling and grammar is a must. Third person, quality over quantity but I like to write long paras along with short paras. Email, discord, google docs or ever Tumblr/Insanejournal RP.  \n\n2. I do write mature themes but I'm happy to keep it PG-13 if you're not comfortable with it, fade to black works as well. I only ask my partner to be 18+ since I'm 21+ and I wouldn't feel comfortable.  \n\n3. I don't have triggers, but there are a few things I'm not comfortable with, so as long as we discuss them before doing anything, we're fine.  \n\n4. I can be as active as I can, but rl comes first. I normally try to reply at least twice every day, some days even more.  \n\n5. I\u2019m open to all the ideas and suggestions for the plot, I love talking and deciding what to do together.  \n\n6. I love fluff just as much as I love angst, so a nice combination of both would be great.  \n\n7. I get super excited about my plots, so I always end up making moodboards, manips, gifsets, graphics, and even playlists.\n\nI really want a fake!celeb (original characters only) ship \u2013 She\u2019s a popular actress (I'd play her) from some movie saga/book based TV show, and he\u2019s a very popular k-pop idol/kdrama actor (you'd play him), and meet in a vacation or on set and they just click?? and they start dating in secret, traveling across the world to see each other. Something super cute and sweet, a bicultural couple that learns about each other and their country and customs and they\u2019re just very happy, literal soulmates that managed to meet. I\u2019d love it to be long-term, like them dating then even getting married, dealing with fame and things, and being just in love.\n\nFor faceclaim/playby, I would give you all the cookies in the world if you use Ahn Jae Hyun, Song Joong Ki or Kyuhyun (Super Junior) against me. As for her, I\u2019m all open for suggestions, but I do have a few ideas.\n\n**If interested, feel free to message me via PM!**\n\n*\\*I'm looking for active partners, please don't message me if you're not in for a long-term.*",

But I'm doing pretty good right now so here I am!\n\nI am looking for some partners for some quicker paced stories! I am really only looking for Discord partners, as I always have my phone with me and can use it even when my arms are giving me problems! \n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*Some things I would really like to do right now are Sherlock, X-men, and Marauders stories!!\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Rules**\n\n\u2764 Partners must be 18+, I'm 21 so no minors! Sorry!\n\n\u2764 Must be able to reply at least a few times each week. I don't need you to tell me your schedule or when you're going somewhere, but just need you to be able to commit to the movement of the story.\n\n\u2764 Must be literate! I don't need every reply to have multiple paragraphs (not that I don't love it) but I do expect correct grammar and at least a few sentences.\n\n\u2764 Must be nice! We don't have to be friends, but I am chatty soo...\n\n\u2764If we are going to be doing a Fandom story, please be upfront in telling me how complete your knowledge is of the subject. I like to be sort of detail oriented.\n\n**Guidelines**\n\n\u2764 Off the bat, I don't play straight guys in romantic situations. The only time I will play a straight guy is if the character is fully needed, or romance isn't involved. Every time I try to play one, they turn into a jerk.\n\n\u2764 Playing more than one character is fine. I will also double up if you want me to play a certain character, as long as I think I can play them.\n\n\u2764 I love romance. I just do, I'm sappy like that. This being said, I don't like stories where they just automatically are in love. This has a few exceptions, but most likely won't happen unless the story idea is really good.\n\n\u2764 I'm also interested in like family style stories, as far as non-romance goes.\n\n\u2764 I like to add real life themes into my stories. This is one, because I like drama, and two, because perfect stories in perfect worlds are no fun.\n\n\u2764 My only triggers are only triggers when portrayed incorrectly. These are mental health issues, invisible diseases, and suicide. I will call you out on these things and stop the story if they are misrepresented. This is because incorrect portrayal of these things is something I have to deal with on a daily basis. I call people out in real life too. Constantly.\n\n\u2764 Speaking of the above point, I do get sick quite often. This is just more of a heads up.\n\n\u2764 If you've read all of this, send me one of those cute ghost emojis the site has. I really love them.\n\n**Ships**\n\n(My characters will be italicized.)\n\n(Asterix by stories I'm craving.)\n\n\u2764 Star Wars\n\n* *OC* x OC \n* *OC* x Poe \n* *OC* x Hux\n* *OC* x Kylo\n* *OC* x Anakin\n* *Hux* x Kylo\n* *Rey* x Kylo\n* *Jyn* x Cassian \n* *Finn* x Poe\n* *Padme* x Anakin\n\n\u2764 Star Trek\\*\n\n* *OC* x OC\n* *OC* x Jim\n* *OC* x Bones\n* *OC* x Scotty\n\n\u2764 Harry Potter\n\n* *OC* x OC\n* *OC* x Newt\n* *Remus X Sirius*\n* *Queenie* X Jacob\n\n\u2764 Marvel\\*\\*\\*\n\n* *OC* x OC\n* *OC* x Hawkeye (Clint or Kate)\n* *Hawkeye* (Kate) x OC\n* *OC* x Doctor Strange\n* *OC* x Bucky Barnes\n* *OC* x Charles Xavier\n* *OC* x Hank McCoy\n* *Spider-Man* x Deadpool\n* *OC* x Daredevil (Comics)\n\n\u2764 DC\n\nMostly just looking for BatFam stories.\n\n*OC* x Jason Todd (or any of the batboys really)\n\n\u2764Others\n\n* *Roxas* x Axel (KH)\n* *OC* x Spencer Reid (Criminal Minds)\n* *OC* x John Watson (BBC) \n* *OC* x Sherlock Holmes (BBC)\n* *OC* x Mycroft Holmes (BBC)\n\n**Story Ideas**\n\n(None of my ideas are too formed, to allow us to make it our own.)\n\n\u2764General Ideas That I'm Always Into\n\n\\-Modern Day AUs\n\n\\-Non-Modern AUs\n\n\\-Anything Cute Really\n\n\\-Canon-Divergent Stories that have basis in a Canon event\n\n\u2764 Star Wars\n\n\\-Matchmaker B.B.8 \\*\n\nA story where our good pal beebee-ate accidentally acts as a matchmaker.

            "selftext": "**tldr** m/f pairings, 400ish+ word posts (perhaps less in faster paced scenes with more reaction-based dialogue), over email or discord. I'm Lore, a 20-something female, &amp; here are the guilty pleasure plots that I'm craving.  I'm ALWAYS up for something different, so don't hesitate to reach out if you're not feeling any of these!  Contact via PM for my email or discord.\n\n**medieval (fantasy or no) arranged marriage**\nTwo kingdoms have been at war for so long they've forgotten what started the fighting in the first place.  It's been campaign after campaign, king after king, each with different strategies, different parameters, and different consequences.  Some generations are worse than others.  Some years the fighting is left to the civilians or the politicians or the economies instead of the soldiers, but the war never stops and the hate has never died away.  Each side sees the other as inferior, tells their children wicked stories to instill fear into their hearts, and those children grow to hate the soldiers that slay their fathers, brothers, cousins, and friends.  Half of the cultural identity of each kingdom revolves around hating the other.  In a rare generation of tentative peace, two royal families do their best to reconcile.  They're not friends, but every year one family will visit the other for a month or so &amp; try their best to hammer out an amicable treaty.  While the parents talk politics, the children play and develop fierce friendships.  During one such visit, something happens that makes the tension boil over.  The tentative peace shatters and both kingdoms plunge back into war.  The prince of one family grows up to be a great warrior, a hunter and a general who dedicates his life to hunting down the opposite royal family.  He almost succeeds, too.  Just before he is about to deliver the finishing blow to his former childhood friend, something happens that ruins his attempt, either hesitation on his part or some outside force.  Instead of killing her, the prince is grievously wounded and taken prisoner.  If the princess's kingdom were to simply execute him for his crimes, the war would continue indefinitely.  So instead, they give him a year to atone for his crimes in whatever way the princess's family sees fit.  If at the end of the year he has proven himself dedicated to peace, he will be married into the very family he tried to murder and the kingdoms will finally put the war behind him.  If he cannot, he will be summarily executed.  Two childhood friends who grew to hate and fear one another are forced to cooperate for the sake of the war that has taken so much from both of them.\n\n**dystopia (bloodborne/witcher)**\nEvery child who turns 13 is taken to the healing church for testing.  If their blood demonstrates healing properties, then they are adopted by the church for training as a blood saint.  No one is exactly sure what the training consists of, but behind the towering cathedral walls the children grow as vessels for a blood that can heal nearly all ailments.  A few drops are more intoxicating than any wine.  A daily habit can quickly turn into an addiction.  An addiction can result in...unusual transformations.  Men who cannot reconcile their cravings with rational thought turn into beasts: werewolves and monsters and vampires with a singular fixation.  Because their blood is so coveted, saints are praised and envied wherever they go.  They are also in considerable danger from the beasts -- moreso than the common populace.\nFor this reason, children are also tested to be hunters.  Those who show unusual strength and speed are sent away to private training schools to hone their skills.  They are trained and plied with saint blood until they become something just beyond human, something with the abilities necessary to defend the saints and hunt the beasts.  Most of these children graduate these schools and become mercenaries, traveling the world and hunting down any monsters that might be plaguing a town.  A select few return to the church &amp; undergo the trials to become a guardian.  Guardians and saints are paired together for most of their waking lives, developing a bond similar to that of a familiar and its master as they travel the world doing whatever task the church requires of them.  Before vessels can become saints and before hunters can become guardians, however, they must first pass the church trials together.  They must demonstrate that they have the ability to work as a team and survive, even when the darkness of the world is crumbling around them and church politics tests the limits of their morality.\n\n**horizon zero dawn**\n(before the events of the game.)  The machine plague has just begun.  Some sort of virus has been taking over formerly docile machines and driving them mad.  What few packs there are have been cutting swaths of havoc and destruction across the land.  One girl's village is absolutely decimated by such an attack, and she receives permission to travel beyond her tribe's sacred lands and search for a solution.  She seeks out a man previously banished from the tribe to help her navigate the foreign territories, but he has no interest in the machines.  He cares about people.  He cares how the Carja have begun their blood raids, stealing innocent people from border towns and taking them far away to either die or work.  In order to convince him to help her, the girl lies and promises that the elders of their village have promised to forget his banishment if he assists her.  This is enticing enough to get him to agree...at least until the Carja approach him in secret.  A girl from the sacred lands could buy him a life of luxury if he is willing to lure her toward the right people.",

One mine and one yours. Though if you\u2019d prefer to do more than one character that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just going to do one. Now I\u2019d like that we switch on being the person who controls the npc\u2019s and the world every \u201cquest\u201d or two. They can be anything from two space cops to scavengers to bounty hunters. Let\u2019s figure that out together!\n\nSecond I\u2019d love to have action packed adventures but also to have those quiet moments in between. I\u2019d love to rp what goes on in the long stretches between each planet. Maybe to get to know each other\u2019s characters better. A more casual rp between the action rp. Plus during that time we can plan the next adventure while still keeping a casual rp going.\n\nFinally, I\u2019m fine with any platform. I prefer just to rp on reddit but I\u2019m easily swayed to other mediums. Welp I think that\u2019s it thanks for reading hope we can be rp pals! ",

I\u2019m open to playing here on Reddit, on kik, possibly through email and if you have a preferred method please suggest it!\n\nI have a few prompts and multiple characters ready to play or to suggest.

Along with role-playing I enjoy getting to know the roleplayers, and what he/she really like and making a role-play around both of our common interests. Even if we don't share them I am willing to try new things. The strange you think it sounds the more likely I am to try it \n\nI perfer role-playing with other males , but females are very much welcome. My replies very from three lines, to multi-para. And the topics I usually cover go from fantasy to hard core Smut, and just fluff stuff\n\nIf at all interested in my very vague post you can PM me your Kik, or discord. leave it in the comments or hit me up at Vash37 for kik\n\nHope to speak to you all soon, goodbye!",

            "selftext": "\"Mr. Captain! Move away from the man.\" Shouted Lagertha. \"No no no no! It's Ok!\" Shouted the man as he waved his hands getting in between her and the boy. \"He's a kid. It's OK! Calm down!\" He was not going to let her harm the poor boy just for kicking his leg. \"We are NOT going to hurt kids!\" He glared into her eyes when she refused to listen. Telling her to stand down. \"We're here to make peace. Not start another war.\" He tried to seem in control but deep down, he was fearful of her strength.\n\n\"Run along! Go on!\" He turned to the kid once Lagertha seemed to have calmed down. The boy in his golden kandora stumbled and nearly fell in his attempt to get away quickly. \"Jeez! Who the hell thought sending an Amazons warrior on a peace mission was a good idea.\" He mumbled in frustration as she refused to listen to reason. \"She's here to protect you captain.\" His vice captain spoke as he moved closer to him. \"I'm glad they sent her.\" He continued but was shut down by Captain's glare. \"Just follow my lead and don't do anything rash. Millions of lives could be saved if we succeed here.\" Captain Stark continued his stride as he looked up at the single skyscraper standing at the end of their several kilometers long path. A path that would take them through the most infamous black market of the galaxy.\n\n \n\n\\~ The End\n\nI require you to be detailed and literate in your responses.

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

I want it to mainly be story based with maybe some blooming romance and smut. \n\nI'm hoping for long term play here so please be fairly detailed and active. I'm not going to ask for multiple paragraphs unless you want to but please no one liners. \n\nWe can discuss world, characters, plot line, and other things in your pm to me or in the chat of Reddit. \n\nThank you very much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nAlso I will also be interested in doing a fantasy wether elder scrolls or our own world.",

Along with role-playing I enjoy getting to know the roleplayers, and what he/she really like and making a role-play around both of our common interests. Even if we don't share them I am willing to try new things. The strange you think it sounds the more likely I am to try it \n\nI perfer role-playing with other males , but females are very much welcome. My replies very from three lines, to multi-para. And the topics I usually cover go from fantasy to hard core Smut, and just fluff stuff\n\nIf at all interested in my very vague post you can PM me your Kik, or discord. \n\nHope to speak to you all soon, goodbye!",

            "selftext": "Good evening, everyone!\n\nSo, why am I not seeking RP partners in game?\n\nI may be on Louisoix, but I actually do not want to RP there. In fact, I just don't like RPing in the game because right now, I cannot afford a whole lot of playtime and prefer to actually play the game when I can instead of RP. Rather, I would like to find a proper literate RPer who would RP on discord with me.\n\nAbout me:\n\nI'm 18, female and my time zone is UTC +1 and I have years of RP experience under my belt.\n\nIn game, I play a female Keeper of the Moon. Shimi Haru is her name, although I'll change that to the acronym Simhi Haur as soon as I can afford it.\n\nAbout my interests:\n\nMainly, we will just RP daily life or the occasional meeting and adventure together, depending on what your character is like. We could become travel companions and more - I don't mind whether it's friendship and romance. It just seems to me that Keepers rarely settle, which is why I suggest this passing travelers setting, but feel free to convince me otherwise.\n\nIn addition, I'd like to expand on the lore of these feline folks. The pre-established dynamics create some interesting conflicts we could explore throughout our RP. I mean, basically, we have the independent Keeper females vs the alpha Seeker males. Or the Keeper lady's man and the loyal dutiful Seeker female. Either way, as of now, I'd prefer to play a Keeper female and am searching for my mate. Will we become best friends? Will it be romantic? Or are we destined to be fiends? Let's find out!\n\nAlso: If I can find enough people, I'd actually like to open a server instead of only RPing in the DMs.\n\nAbout whom I'm going to keep:\n\nPlease be experienced in actual literate RP. I'm looking for decent grammar and orthography - however, I'm not going to rip off your head for every single mistake either.\n\nAbout being +18...well, I don't mind either, because I don't necessarily need anything that would require such a rating. If that is of interest to you, please ensure yourself that your age passes the threshold.\n\nI also do not absolutely require you to be a Miqo'te as well. Any race will do, although same kind will be preferred.\n\nFinally - please contact me if this applies to you and the topic interests you - we can discuss further details on discord.\n\nLooking forward to future campfires and nights spent beneath the moon and stars,\n\nShimi Haru\n\nPS: The \"F4M\" tag found in older versions of this does NOT apply. That was a mistake created by habit.",

            "selftext": "Ive spent plenty of time trying to figure out how to post this.. I typed so much information, stupidly, and an error wouldn't let me post. I apologize for how abrupt and short this post may be, however I am a little traumatized at not being able to post all that I typed before. Now, I'll cut right into the important things. Im on the West Coast, USA, PST, for timing purposes. I prefer and enjoy 1st person roleplaying methods, while being able to do 3rd person, it is hard for me to engage into the rp with 3rd person. Message length can vary, multiple paragraphs to move a scene/rp along. For rapid back and forth character interaction, I am fine with a few sentences to keep things focused and engaging.   \n\n\nThe idea of the rp is that Your character is a rising digital musician. The genres can vary, however a few necessities are needed, such as electronic music ranging around house, deep or future house, Synthwave, dubstep, things around there for a larger popularity, however genres like Lo-Fi Hip Hop, Industrial, Chill Trap, R&amp;B, and more can be included. We make characters, which are artists. I can admit I am leaning toward mine being a bit of a vocalist/singer, and having some knowledge in producing her own instrumentals. I fantasize that my partners character is a bit more famous than my own, having expertise in genres of his own. He reaches out to her to collaborate on music, which takes over by popularity. Through their rise to stardom and fame, the two characters form a partnership, then a friendship, then crushes, which lead to love. The music they make together brings them to a decent level of fame, and financial comfort. The lifestyle they live is a fantasy. Packing festivals full of fans who love their music, jamming on stage together, oozing their energy out to the crowd. Long sessions at the studio, experimenting with sounds, trying to figure out how to make *this* synth blend perfectly, and when it does, the effort was well worth it, forcing some rather enthusiastic head bobbing and silly punch-dancing. Calm days at home, feet soaking in the pool with a guitar in your arms, fooling around. Or out at a party, plenty of energy, plenty of faces to be recognized from music, all having a good time.   \n\n\nAnyway, characters will be thought up between us, and fleshed out through bios. Our character's music can be albums and songs from real artists that we want to have as our character's, just renamed here and there to fit their bio. Much more to be discussed on Discord, so please, I hope to see you in my mailbox. Id love to find someone to do this with.",

            "selftext": "Hi all!  I'm a long-time RPer, but this is my first time messing around on reddit looking for it.  The 18+ above isn't specifically about SexyTimes -- I'm not against it if it's appropriate to the RP, but I'm just older and it's more weird to RP with someone who's a fair spell younger than me.  No offense to the young, enjoy it^(ya bastards)!\n\nI've been RPing on and off for over 20 years with various levels of success, starting off on MU\\*s of yesteryear.  I'm personally happy with either completely OC stories or based in existing universes -- but I'm not really a fan of treading on Canon characters.  Extremely rare cameos are fine, but I'm here for the story, not for a crush on a character.  (Nothing against those who like canon characters -- it's just not my thing.)  To that end, I'm -really- not picky about the starting point -- want a sword and sorcery fantasy?  Sci-Fi?  Modern day?  Slice of life?  Sure!  Set a bit of a stage, I'm in.  Wanna mix elements of a bunch of genres?  Great!  I love blending.  Romance?  That's fine, so long as the characters click -- I'm not gonna force it if the characters aren't working in that direction.  I don't mind planning ahead some -- but I like following the organic feel of characters and story, and forcing things... well, feels forced.\n\nI'm not looking for any Mary Sues, but I do understand that when playing around, we can be playing the equivalent of farm folk or Big Damn Heroes depending on setting, and I'll adjust accordingly.  The biggest thing for me is communication!  I like talking with my RP partners about what's up, what our expectations are, how we're feeling about characters / story / direction, and even just life in general.  I like being friends with my RP partners, though I tend to come out the gate a bit shy.  I'm definitely an introvert and posting this is -- well, unusual for me.\n\nPlease be literate, please be open with communication.  I'm not asking for updates on your life every day, but if something's bothering you about the story or a character or you have a question, feel free to just talk.  I'm a people too, and I'm usually on Google Hangouts, though less responsive when I'm at work.  For length -- it can be very variable depending on what the situation / setting is, but again, I'll likely just adjust as appropriate, though I generally get told I'm on the long side, and I prefer those who can help build a scene / story together rather than make me drag it out of them.",

I\u2019m also very new to rp having only been doing it for a month or so but I\u2019ve done a decent amount of it already with a lot of variation so I shouldn\u2019t be a terrible partner.\n\nI\u2019m a sucker for romance and would love to get into a plot focused romance story with someone. I honestly have no proper plot ideas and am more looking for a partner with which to develop some ideas. \n\nIf your at all interested I\u2019d really appreciate a DM!\n\nThank you!",

Don't message me offering up Ronon or Sheppard, or any other non-Wraith, canon or OC. While I'm open to other Wraith aside from Todd, including OCs, I'm going to be prioritizing him over any others.**\n\n\n* My character will be human, though that's probably a big ol' *duh*. Her inclusion will turn things into a bit of an AU situation, but I promise it's not too far-fetched/out of line of SG:A's general feel.\n\n* As the title suggests, I'm currently looking for *Todd* the most and would absolutely adore it if someone could write for him against my OC. I *am* open to other canon Wraith, such as *Steve*, *Erik*, *Rhys*, *Edgar* (oh look, Christopher Heyerdahl again!), *Shawn* (the food-obsessed one from season two, fifth episode; *would actually really like to write against this one*), and *Eddie*, and most of the other named ones I haven't listed proper, within reason (there are some that're just great big *no's*, like Michael). And even *OCs*, particularly ones that are *based* (at least as far as appearance is concerned) on canon Wraith.\n\n* Yes, **long-term** too. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy one-shot wonders. But, if you\u2019re no longer feeling the RP, I can understand the desire to stop. I can also understand life getting in the way of replying. Just tell me if you\u2019d like to stop, or if you might not be able to reply. Definitely try to give me a heads up if you won't be able to reply soonish.\n\n* I only RP over **Discord**, **Telegram**, and *very hesitantly* Skype. You might be able to convince me to use something else, but I can just about guarantee I\u2019m not gonna use email, and I'm *very tentatively* open to using notes/PMs.\n\n* I do expect **NSFW/Mature/18+/21+** themes. Plot and character development over *one particular gritty subject*, obviously, but it's still expected and not something I'm willing to gut. If you're not of age, then *please* do not contact me.\n\n* I don\u2019t have many limits, and the ones I do have are rather commonplace ones that I feel most people share. Keep in mind that while I don\u2019t have very many limits, I am still rather *plain*. I\u2019m willing to incorporate certain *things*, as I have a few of my own that I enjoy, and I\u2019m willing to listen to what you might like as well, within reason. Grittier details will (hopefully) be discussed after contact details are given, or in PM. \n\n* I RP *third person*, past tense, and am capable of cranking out 12-14 paragraphs. Sometimes *more*, sometimes *less*, but no fewer than 2-3 paragraphs. I *don\u2019t* expect you to match me, but please don\u2019t throw one-liners at me. I need something to work with, and it's super discouraging to crank out 6+ paragraphs and get practically nothing in return.\n\n* I love details, and I love fluff, but what I really adore is stuff I can genuinely reply to. Give me things that convey emotion and I\u2019ll love you to bits!\n\n* I can double or do a split RP of your choosing, if either would 'sweeten the pot\u2019. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Keep in mind that I'm a little rusty when it comes to writing for *two* main characters, but I will most certainly try.\n\nI\u2019m online more often than not, at all hours of the day, so catching me shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue. Such is the life of an insomniac.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi there, This is a group dedicated to creating a fun and welcoming environment for all roleplayers. I want this roleplay to offer plenty of opportunities to its players to help create and shape the world around them for the sake of creating a fun and interesting story. Below, you'll find a bit of lore to help situate you so you can get a general feel of how things go down on this server:*\" In a small and quaint town basically forgotten (or at least overshadowed by all the other ones) deep in the heart of Utah, everyone seems to know each other's name and its so safe that some people can even sleep without having to so much as lock their door. However, this town is known for something else amongst its residents, as is the rest of the world at this point that sets it apart from our own: mythological creatures. You see, in this world, creatures big and small truly do exist and finally decided to make themselves known to the humans. However, there is one small catch: they aren't exactly liked by humans. Humans have always been top of the food-chain, they've always been able to adapt and overcome any challenges that they've faced as a species. Now that these \"mythos\" as they often refer to them as have come into their lives, they see them as simply another issue that is meant to be adapted to and overcome.*\n\n*The mythos tried to be nice to the humans, they wanted to basically be like neighbors with them. However, humans were fearful of them. Things soon escalated and now it's a bit cultural split between mythos and humans. The mythos are now essentially treated like second-class citizens if they so much as step foot into a human town or city. Some, are even captured as slaves and forced to serve under the oppressive rule of humanity. Things have even gotten to the point where anti-mythos departments have been establish for the sake of \"protecting the people from the threat of the unknown\" as they so claim.*\n\n*Of course, there are a few unspoken rules that applies to humans. For example, the dense forest that surrounds the forest is to be left alone. Any human that so enters it could potentially face certain death.*\n\n*Now, here we are. Be you mytho or human, you still have a life to live. Whether you try and create peace between the two opposing groups or instead prefer to keep old values intact and destroy all who oppose you is a choice all your own.\"*\n\nIf this is appealing to you in the slightest, please feel free to drop by and say hello! Hope to see you soon! Remember, this RP changes along with whatever decisions the characters of this RP make. I only jump in if things begin to get out of hand. Even right now, we're at the near finish of an event ran by one of our very own. This would be the perfect opportunity to come and create a character during this moment of down time between events and get to know the server a bit better.\n\nLike I said, I want this to be an environment where everyone can pitch about whatever ideas they like, so long as it fits within the general lore and rules.\n\nOtherwise, everything is up to you guys.The link to the server: [right here](https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw)",

            "selftext": "Hello roleplay subreddit! I've advertised on here a few times and am usually searching for specific plots, either strictly OC or canon based, but right now I decided to try something different that relates to neither and instead post a simple fandom list for you to choose from since it seems like people have some luck with this method.\n\nIf a show/series/fandom appears on this list, it means I can play multiple characters within it and enjoy the canon content enough to do longterm plots. OC roleplays based on the canon are also acceptable. :)\n\nThe fandoms I'm going to name have one thing in common and that is that they are all animated so no live-action content will be included. I am going to separate the list into two categories: anime and non-anime. Other than that there are no special requirements, just stuff I'm currently into and would have fun roleplaying. :D\n\nHere, take a look:\n\nAnime:  \nSailor Moon  \nCutie Honey  \nCardcaptor Sakura  \nPrecure  \nPanty and Stocking  \nPPG Z  \nSoul Eater  \nMadoka Magica  \nMegaman\n\nNon-Anime:Steven Universe  \nOK KO: Let's Be Heroes!  \nMLP:FiM\nVanilla PPG  \nOverwatch  \nBatman: The Animated Series\n\nYou'll probably notice some similarities here like I definitely enjoy magic girl content and dig the action vibe but also pick shows that aren't super grim, leading to somewhat purposefully cute and campy taste. Female casts are a huge bonus. I am confident I could work out an RP based on anything named here and if you are interested but would like to know more about characters I can play, please feel free to message!\n\nMy only requirements for all of these is literate writing, at least multiple sentences worth per reply, and would prefer to play as female characters. Pairings are to be expected, hence the FxF title but romance is not a requirement. I have just as much fun pairing characters up platonically as I do the other way around, if I find them to be a nice pair for the roleplay, that is all that matters to me.\n\nIf anything comes to mind, send me a PM and we can discuss further details. Would prefer to RP on another application like Discord. Hope to hear from some! Thanks for reading! :)",
