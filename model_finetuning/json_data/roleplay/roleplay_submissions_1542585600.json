            "selftext": "Hey! So a little about me, I've been doing roleplay for almost 20 years, and I've seen it go through a lot of stuff! I prefer third person past tense, and working with someone to create a something really based off of what happens with our characters, I'd rather let their decisions lead where we go then a plot that we've decided and have to force in. I really don't like it when someone godplays and creates situations where my character has to do something. Also while I'm totally cool with there being things about a character that aren't shared, please lets build the plot together so that you aren't DM of the whole thing.\n\nI like playing romances, and like playing them realistically, with characters that aren't perfect, make mistakes and that sometimes those mistakes have long term ramifications within the line, and have to make the relationship work.\n\nI'm open to playing doubles as well! I've always done it and really enjoy playing two characters, while I rarely use female cannon characters by and large I'm open to playing a lot of male cannon characters!! I don't care about your actual gender as long as you're happy playing a male character for at least my character! I normally play M/F or M/M. If you want to play a OFC I'd ask that do doubles! \n\nThe Cannon I'm most comfortable with is Harry Potter, and would love to either play OFCxCannon or completely play new characters in the universe! I would also be open to doing something from Percy Jackson, again the universe rather then the particular characters\n\nIn terms of original worlds I do like slice of life and historical fiction! I'm a bit of a history nerd so if we choose to do a historical line I like having some sort of knowledge about it and being able to play within the rules of that era. I've also wanted to do some sort of historical circus based story as well so if you're interested in that let me know!!  \n\nI prefer Discord!\n\nPM me to talk more! I like to get a good idea of characters and then start with the roleplay!",

You could play the part of a crew member on the show or something else that interests you as long as it belongs in the same world and would be interacting with him on a daily basis. \n\nThis would be a romance of sorts but it won\u2019t start out that way. Our characters could be anywhere from indifferent to each other to friendly at first before a connection is made and they become more. Do they try to fight it because they work together? Do they give in but try to keep it a secret from their co-workers? Will they remain completely professional? Who knows?\n\nThe crew would spend many hours a day together brainstorming for new ideas for the show, writing jokes, eating lunch together, and just generally trying to not kill each other on a daily basis. Basically like any work environment but slightly more interesting. \n\nI do prefer 3rd person and past tense on Discord and at least some detail in the posts. Put some effort into each post instead of just a few lines that don\u2019t really take us anywhere. I\u2019m pretty good at writing humorous characters. I like drama as well as romance, just to stir things up and keep things from getting stale. \n\nI would like to hear your ideas on this as well, if you have any. Any input will be considered. So\u2026does this interest you? Send me a pm and we can go from there. If you want, go ahead and include your Discord name and I\u2019ll add you so we can talk there instead just to move things along a bit faster.",

            "selftext": "**Rookshaven** is one of the longest running, lore-intensive group storylines on Discord right now.\n\nBased in 2018 northern Scotland, Rookshaven Academy and University is a school for mages, though the storyline only allows for university students and professors to be applied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A bit about our lore:**\n\nThe mage community has always held their royal families above the rest. Though they aren't considered kings or queens of their mage classes anymore, the royal families are believed to be the first blood lines to develop their particular kind of magics. As such, royalty have always been the law-makers for mages worldwide. In the late 1800s, a rebel sect of mages rose up to attack the royals and all of their complicit, loyal subjects - resulting in a Mage Civil War.\n\nMany mages and their royal families were killed off, while the beast mage class disappeared entirely. From that war, the High Council was formed. A collection of the remaining royal houses, electing one member of their family to represent them in the governing of the mage community.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the original eight royal families, only five are alive in present day. Additionally, two new mage classes have been discovered. Without a way to track the new class's lineage, Mythics and Necromancers have been left without a representative in the Council. As a result, many laws passed since their discovery have been created seemingly for the purpose of keeping Necromancers and Mythics at a disadvantage. While the newest class, Mythics, are sigil bound at a young age to feel an automatic pull toward royal families, they often grow up to be employed as maids or servants for the royals.\n\nSince 2016, another uprising of rebels has been seen. Between then and 2018 (present day), many royals and loyalists alike have lost their lives in terrorist attacks by these Rebels. In the last year of the group story on Discord, students have been attacked both on and off campus, leading many to believe there are Rebels among the ranks of Rookshaven, despite the school being run by the Council.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n\\- Monthly events in which your character can earn points to put into their dice, making them stronger.\n\n\\- Lots of lore.\n\n\\- Outlined mage classes, as well as factions to push their own agendas (Royals, Loyalists, Rebels, Sympathizers).\n\n\\- Friendly players willing to work with new players to create backstories and social networks.\n\n\\- A secondary server only viewable to applied and approved players where you can post playlists, aesthetic images, social media posts, journal entries, as well as having 1-2 private channels specific to your character for housing and training.\n\n\\- Active Admins willing to help new players any way we can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What we expect:**\n\n\\- literacy\n\n\\- a 3 paragraph minimum per post (there are exceptions to this, but the majority of players should strive for this)\n\n\\- realistic characters that fit the server lore\n\n\\- activity every 2 weeks, or communication with the Admins if you need to take time away\n\n\\- read the FAQ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Classes Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Water\n\n\\- Darkness\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n\\- Earth\n\n\\- Mythic\n\n\\- Necromancy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Locked Classes:**\n\n\\- Beast (planned to be unlocked in early 2019)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Royal Families Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Dark\n\n\\- Spirit  \n\n\n[Link to Rookshaven on Discord](https://discord.gg/5YSn4Qw)",

            "selftext": "Hey! First off let me get right to it, my name is Sinn (pen name, it just stuck). I have been writing almost all of my life and roleplaying for around fifteen years now. I have extensive experience in the general online roleplay community which has led to me knowing exactly what I'm looking for in a partner. If you feel that we'll mesh together well please message me, tell me a bit about yourself, fandoms you're interested in writing, or ideas. I am well over eighteen and would prefer my partner to be as well.\n\nWriting style: I'm solely a third person writer, past tense. My writing style is simple but descriptive. I mostly focus on the emotion that's involved in everything, what my character is doing, how they feel. Character development over time as well as plot progress is highly encouraged and mostly expected. \n\nLength: Quality over quantity, I'm usually literate, three paragraphs minimum. But if you like smaller posts that's fine, just give me enough to work with, please. Don't do dialogue only. Unless your character is standing completely still and speaking in a mono tone, there's no reason for it. How are they speaking, how are they feeling? Are they using hand gestures, are they frowning as they speak, etc.\n\nPlatforms: Discord and google docs, occasionally I can be convinced to use only email, but rarely.\n\nFandoms: Marvel (mcu and to a lesser extent 616), DC (Mostly pre new 52, some rebirth, Dccu is also accepted to a lesser extent), Westworld, Beyond two souls, Detroit, American Gods, Stranger things, The walking dead (would need some convincing. I'm not up to date on the last two seasons). Star wars, Sense8, A song of ice and fire, Breaking bad, Avatar the last Airbender, Legend of Korra, the 100.\n\nShipping: I primarily write m/m and f/f, very rarely I will dabble in m/f but that would take a lot of convincing on your end. I love ships that aren't fandom standard, that have unexpected dynamics that require thought and consideration. I like writing relationships that aren't perfect, I love a lot of angst and some fluff to even it out a bit. I'm absolutely not interested in slice of life types of things. I'm even fine with dc/marvel cross overs. Oc's are accepted on a case by case basis, but usually not. In a lot of cases it seems original characters are blatant self inserts and I have absolutely no interest in any of that. If you have an original character you'd like to write with me, message me telling me a bit about them.\n\nCharacters I want to write and or have experience writing. \n\nA song of ice and fire:\nJon Snow, Rob, Lyanna, Arya\n\nAmerican gods: \nShadow, Laura, Mad Sweeney\n\nMarvel and dc:\nFrank Castle, Billy Russo, Jessica Jones, Matthew Murdock, Claire Temple, Jason Todd, Damian Wayne, Diana Prince, Harley Quinn\n\nStranger things:\nEleven, Jonathon Byers, Joyce Byers\n\nBreaking bad:\nJesse Pinkman\n\nThe walking dead:\nCarl Grimes, Rick Grimes, Michonne, Glenn, Shane.\n\n\u00a0Star wars:\n\u00a0Kylo Ren, Rey, Finn, Obi-Wan, Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor,\u00a0 Han Solo, Luke Skywalker\n\nLegend of Korra/Avatar the last Airbender:\nKorra, Asami, Sokka, Zuko, Katara, Toph\n\nWestworld\n\nDelores, Maeve, Logan, William (maybe), Hector\n\nOriginal concepts (sorta)\n\nI also love period roleplays, I'm a huge sucker for WWII things. We can easily make original characters for that. I'd also like to explore the silo series by Hugh Howey. Or anything Stephen King related, I'd be a sap for something based in the Stand world. \n\nI also love organized crime based things and tropes. A cop and a criminal falling for each other (gasp, maybe even while undercover). For these types of scenarios I don't mind placing a canon character into an alternative universe. Or we could create original characters as long as they aren't blatant self inserts. \n\n\nIf you see anything that caught your attention feel free to message me. I look forward to hearing from any potential writing partners.\n\n\n\n",

If not, then read on if you'd like a crash course in this crazy and fun tabletop RPG world.\n\nIn roughly the year 2077, a swarm of meteorites stormed the Earth and caused total chaos and ruin. Tens of thousands of years of human civilization were laid to waste in just a few days, leaving little else on the Earth but ruin and wasteland. \n\nThese asteroids also carried a terrible virus called the Primer, which turns infected humans into Psychonaughts and infected plants into Psychovores. Psychovores are plants that have grown strange and alien, like something out of a horror movie, they've been transmuted into foul twisted killers. Psychonaights are humans who have been corrupted and mutated by the Primer. They've been given tremendous powers of various kinds at the cost of their very humanity, and now exist as something akin to magic zombies. \n\nBut humanity is remarkably persistant, and found a way to survive. Now, in the year 2567, several Cults of humanity have formed from the ashes of the Bygone world. There are the strange technology loving Chroniclers, who's goal it is to reactivate the Stream (something akin to the internet) and lift humanity out of this dark age of barbarism. There are the clever Scrappers, who dig and search through the ruins of the Bygone age for precious and lost artifacts and Technology. The savage Clans roam the wasteland, barbaric savages who have embraced the world's return to a primitive time. There is the organized Spitalian, who are a nation of militarized doctors hell bent on eradicating the Primer and curing the land and people of this terrible plague. There are several other cults besides, but I won't list them all here for fear of making this post 300 pages long XD.\n\nIf any of this has piqued your interest, then fantastic! I'd love to talk more and answer any questions I can about the world or the other cults or anything. If you'd like to talk about anything, feel free to hit me up in DMs and we can go from there.\n\nHope to see you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello! Here I am again, though this time i'm getting a bit more specific. My names Chandra, lovely to meet you all. I'm female but would love to play a male character against another male character. Any sort of genre works. I love a good slice of life, or medieval fantasy, or adventure. What have you i'm game as long as it's two male characters and we can toss a little romance in there along the way. The romance doesn't have to be the center of the roleplay, though it certainly can if that is what you're looking for, but I do love a good story too! Just some things to get out of the way first.   \n\n\n\\- Be 18+. I like to have adult themes whether that be NSFW, violence, or what have you. I'm 24 so won't roleplay with anyone younger then 18!  \n\\- Be able to write a good paragraph at least, please. No one liners unless absolutely necessary.   \n\\- Third person, past tense  \n\\- Discord, though I may be convinced to do email.   \n\n\nThat's pretty much it I think. I'd love it if when you messaged me you tell me a bit about yourself and any ideas you might have brewing! I won't answer PMs that just say you're interested or I saw your ad. Give me a little substance to make it interesting!! =) Hope to hear from some of you!!",

            "selftext": "Hey all! My name is Mikki, I\u2019m a 23-year-old from Indiana (EST) and I\u2019m looking for a few new RP partners to tangle with as the holidays approach. I\u2019ll have a lot of free time, and would love to get some stories going! \n\nTo give some background on myself, I\u2019ve been writing for going on 12 years now (started way back with neopets!) and consider myself a literate writer. I usually post anywhere from 3-10 paragraphs per response, usually once-twice a day, and thrive on detail and character development. If you\u2019re looking for one-liners then I am not a good choice, sorry! The more detail you give me, the more I\u2019ll give you. I\u2019m fairly decent at mirroring, though, so if you tend to give 2-4 paragraphs then I\u2019ll happily stick around the same length. If it gets too much let me know, but I\u2019ll be honest, longer posts are my happy place.\n\nI post in third person past tense and expect my partners to do the same. Sorry, I really cannot stand first person! Discord only as well, since it keeps all of my rps in one place! MxF or FxF pairings, maybe MxM if you can convince me.\n\nPrompts:\n\n**The Dragon\u2019s Bride**\n\n&gt; The village of Cavaugh\u2019s Pass have been sending sacrificial virgins to the Dragon\u2019s Lair for as long as the village has existed, centuries upon centuries, but every year for the past hundred years the virgin returns from the mountain to the village, swearing that no beast ever emerged from the cavern to claim its prize. This year a brilliant, fiery red-head is sent to be the sacrifice, but this year she doesn\u2019t return. Instead, a dragon finally claims its prize.\n\n**The Kelpie**\n\n&gt; Stories have long spoken of a beautiful girl who is occasionally seen along the river edges, bathing in the sparkling water at sunrise and sunset as she sings a soft lament of lost love and broken hearts. Those who speak of the girl speak of pleasure beyond words and unspeakable bliss, but for every one who experiences heaven in the girl\u2019s arms, there is one who goes out to the river at sunset and is never seen again. One day, though, a knight hears of the tales of the girl, and ventures out to see for himself whether or not the stories are true\u2026\n\n**Paradise\u2019s Own**\n\n&gt; The beautiful creature was seen hovering out of sight of the expedition for weeks before she was finally captured, a dazzling bird with feathers of pure, brilliant ivory. Her song is of the purest beauty, and good luck follows her wherever she goes, making her worth more than any price could be named. Every night she sheds her delicate form and becomes human, skin pale as snow and hair like spun silver, and she is capable of granting one wish to one who can win her favor. The longer she is a prisoner, though, the dimmer she fades, and soon her light will fade entirely.\n\nAs you can see, I love the idea of taking mythological creatures and incorporating them into rp, so if this is something that interests you and you have some sort of idea you want to try then just let me know! I look forward to hearing from you!\n",

New school, new people but something is not right. You can't put your finger on it but something bothers you about this small town in the middle of nowhere. It's not the abysmal bad mobile internet or the fact that this town has still a place to rent VHS's ... It's something else. Something about this place does not feel right, a soft unease somewhere in the back of your head.\n\n\n\nGoal: Well that is mostly up to you. I provide the world and the rest is pretty much up to you. Find out what is wrong\n\n\n\nSmut and violence: both possible, both likely. But nested in the story and world!\n\n\n\nYour character: Must be 18 plus and human, rest is up to you.\n\n\n\nOther stuff: I would appreciate it if you could play first person. There is no paragraph minimum or limit. I play here or on Kik.\n\n\n\nGreetings :)",

            "selftext": "Good Morning /r/Roleplaying. \n\nFirst, I would like to apologize for the incoming prompt for its vagueness as it is still very much just an ember that has yet to mature into a flame. \n\nI have been re-reading (for about the hundredth time) my way through the Dresden Files books by Jim Butcher and it has given me a thirst for a roleplay scenario in the Dresden Files Universe. What I am looking for is a partner who is as enthralled by the books as I am. I prefer Female partners, especially where romance may be involved, but I'm not rigidly opposed to writing with males as well, minus the romance angle. \n\nMy preliminary thoughts on the roleplay is playing as an original character, probably as a practitioner just coming into his abilities. And that is pretty much as far as I have gotten with my idea, insofar. My character's age, social standing, abilities, and location are still very much swallowed up in a tempest of indecision, but if anyone is interested in spit balling some ideas to see what sticks, I am ready and waiting to brainstorm.

I fill out the cyoa which is the hard part personally all you have to do is play the character I make but I won't force you I'll ask if there's anything I need to avoid or want to include a lot.\n\nAnd of course if needed I can play mutiple characters and am pretty open to a lot please if interested contact me soon! \n\nOh a little basic info may be I live in the UK I'm 21 (in march) and my hobbies include playing games and watching anime oh but sometimes I watch clouds \ud83d\ude04 but I have trouble expressing myself and can get a little nervous at times so sorry if that annoys you ",

            "selftext": "Humanity is...odd. They never stop pushing. Never lay down and die. When the swarm stormed their home world, seeking to raze it like any others, the human race persevered. They took the technology from the hive race, and weaponized it. By the stars, they managed to turn gravity into a weapon, making small holes in space, to tear through any and all hostile ships that'd come close.\n\nEven as the swarm killed more and more of them off, they stubbornly resisted. They learned how to manipulate hyperspace technology, just by tearing what they could out of destroyed swarm ships. Even as their planet burned, they preserved.\n\nEven after countless years of a seemingly endless war, after countless holes in space, they kept fighting. They learned how to manipulate the swarm.\n\nThey learned how to make them kill themselves.\n\nHumanity, in a last ditch effort, built a giant relay, mimicking the distress call of a swarm queen. That call, drove ship after ship to their deaths, until the race had, essentially, killed itself.\n\nBefore this inevitable extinction, however, humanity built one last ship. One last way off their ruined planet. The force of that ship ripping through hyperspace was what ended up cracking their homeworld, leaving it empty, and barren.\n\nOnce word spread about the heroic race, countless civilizations offered them new homes. Moons, asteroid belts, entire planets, for humanity to start anew on.\n\nBut each and every time, they declined. Instead, they asked for ships to ferry their race across the cosmos. They wandered, for years, after years. Of course, anywhere they ended up with a intelligent race, they were welcome.\n\nThey offered technology and goods, in exchange for information. Always information. Maps. Star charts, scans of solar systems. Even rumors.\n\nMost would ask what they searched so desperately for, instead of finding a place to settle. The leaders would simply answer \"what remains of home. Our Ark.\"\n&gt;\nHelllllo, everyone! This is my current pride and joy, my blurb that I hope will become a spacefaring epic. But, before I go into that, you should know something about me. I'm a 20 something male, with plenty of writing experience. I enjoy a bit of romance in my stories, but it's not exactly required. Action and mystery are welcome, as well. NSFW themes are just fine with me, in mild doses. As for my writing style, I write in third person, past tense, with about 1-3 paragraphs per response. \n&gt;\nWith all of that out of the way, I hope you enjoyed my prompt! Please, by all means, shoot me a message, and we can discuss any questions you have! But please, introduce yourself! I dislike having to find a way to reply to \"hey I was interested in your prompt\" messages. Anywho, I think that's all from me. Hope to see those messages!",

I've just finished the game after obsessing over it for the past few months and I'm dying for another DBH role play. I'm willing to play any character from the game or an original character. I don't mind if you play an original character or not, but I definitely would love someone to play Connor for me. If you double (play more than one main character), that's a plus. If you're willing to also play side characters, that's also great. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love playing multiple side characters and a few main characters/pairings. I care more about quality than quantity. I enjoy a good response that can get my writing juices flowing and challenge me as a role player. I want someone who pushes me to be a better role player, and I hope I do the same for you. I enjoy partners who love ooc chatting, plotting, brainstorming, and just goofing off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI prefer Discord for role playing over any other medium, but I can also role play over gDocs and email. \n\nI don't mind playing males or females, or any sexuality. We can discuss more of limitations and such when we get to another medium. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can role play any timeline. During the android civil war/march, prior to it, post-Detroit. And any location. United States or Canada. We can continue the story of Kara, Luther, and Alice, or Marcus and North, or Connor and Hank. Honestly, I'm pretty much down for anything within reason. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharacters that I can play are: \n\nKara\n\nLuther\n\nJosh\n\nMarcus\n\nSimon\n\nJerry\n\nDaniel\n\nChloe\n\nAlice\n\nRalph\n\nGavin\n\nElijah Kamski\n\nAdam\n\nTracis\n\nOC Female Android\n\nOC Male Android\n\nOC Female Human\n\nOC Male Human \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you can think of any other characters you'd like me to play, I'm all ears. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessage me for my information.\n\nThank you!",

I usually like playing a female, but I don\u2019t mind if you play male or female! Also, I like NSFW elements added in. \n\n&gt;**I am not looking to write a novel.** If you expect me to write multiple paragraphs, I can\u2019t. I just don\u2019t have the patience or the time. Sorry! I will *never* give you a single sentence, though!\n\n&gt;**If we use a fandom, I don\u2019t like to play Canon characters.** As my main character, at least. If you want to work them into the story, sure thing! Just as long as you know that my main character will be an OC. Your character can be either, it\u2019s whatever you\u2019re comfortable with! The fandom I\u2019m into right now is **Naruto**. \n\nI can\u2019t think of any other major points right now, so let me suggest a couple ideas (mainly just pairings) if you\u2019d like to do something in modern times!\n\n-Student/Teacher\n\n-Celebrity (of some kind)/..Something(Fan? Fellow Celeb? I\u2019m unsure. We can work it out together! But keep in mind, I don\u2019t use real people, these would be OCs)\n\n-Old Acquaintances\n\n-Omegaverse, perhaps?\n\nThey\u2019re very rudimentary just because I\u2019d love to come up with a plot *with* you!

(Or the Ranger-General of Silvermoon, if you would prefer!) I haven't played WoW in a fair few years, so my knowledge of the recent lore is a bit hazy. Most of my memories come from about the Wotlk expansion and prior, as well as Warcraft 3.\n\nAnywho! Tyrande and Sylvanas was something of a spontaneous idea that I had yesterday. They're two of my more beloved characters, and I would not be opposed to figuring something out between them.\n\nI'm quite happy to play undead Sylvanas, or High Elf Sylvanas, depending on your preferences. I would prefer to play her, as I have more experience in such. However, I am amenable.\n\nPerhaps something along the lines of diplomacy-turned romance, where correspondence between Darnassia and Silvermoon has turned personal. Maybe Tyrande has permission from Malfurion to seek fulfilment from another, given his long tenures sleeping in the emerald dream.\n\nAt any rate, I would be eternally happy to figure something out with a prospective partner! The sour Sylvanas and the traditional, long-established Tyrande. Perhaps they have correspondence, and they have much enjoyed meetings once in a blue moon!\n\nI'm happy to discuss any particulars or details with you!\n\nHave a good day!",

At least 18 (I'm 20 and just feel uncomfortable roleplaying with minors, regardless of content)\n2. Literate (just proper sentence structure is all I ask for)\n3. Able to use Discord or Google Docs\n4. Not bigoted in any way (the majority of characters/relationships I like to portray are LGBT)\n\nI used to use Tumblr for roleplaying but it's gotten to be a bit of a chore there, so I'd prefer Discord or Google Docs. Now that we're past the rules, let's get on to the fun stuff! I have a ton of different fandoms I'd like to write in, but mostly I'm looking for other OCs or canons to play with my vampire OCs. They're both girls, developed to the gods, and deal with dark and religious themes. Expect some gore with them. If you're interested in that, PM me and we can talk a little more about them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOtherwise, here's my fandoms with preferred characters:\n\n* Sailor Moon: Haruka Tenou or Seiya\n* Yakuza: Majima Goro or Kazuma Kiryu\n* Revolutionary Girl Utena: Utena Tenjou or Juri Hasegawa\n* Death Note: Light Yagami\n* Tomie (self explanatory)\n* Durarara!!: Kanra or Izaya\n\nAll listed RPs would have a large degree of drama and romance to them, which is kind of my forte, but I am super open to anything that isn't pure smut. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I\u2019ve recently watched The Last Kingdom, and the Vikings again..and I feel inspire to do a role play prompt based around that genre.   I have done many viking themed prompts before, and I have spent years gathering an understanding of Viking culture and normalities, and I would prefer if my partner could have some basic knowledge on the Viking life as well.\n\nAs for the prompt, I\u2019d like it if we can discuss this together so that we both get a plot that we can enjoy, instead of having someone become bored because it\u2019s not their style. I would like this role play to have a romantic prompt, but obviously not without the angst and hardships.  \n\nI consider myself a rather literate role player with years of experience, which is why I expect my partner to be the same. I write in third person, past tense only. I can\u2019t stand people who write in first person, although that\u2019s my personal taste. \n\nI\u2019m a male looking for a female partner, that has an original character to give to the prompt. I\u2019ve always preferred my character to play a \u201cAlpha male\u201d role. I feel like everyone enjoys the role play more when the characters are historically accurate, from clothing to personalities, and roles. For example, a Viking male may be more rough, dominate, and distant towards others.\n\nIf you want a Viking themed RP, please message me and we can exchange contact information(for discord) and then discuss the plot we want to take and other small details.. Also please be working on your character description when you message me, so we can focus more on the prompt.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello r/roleplay! I am looking for a new roleplay partner that is active (a few posts a day when possible, I'm understanding when life gets in the way, just warn me!), literate, fun, creative, and up for writing some angst/drama/romance/twists and turns/intense emotions/and more! \n\nMy ideal roleplay involves a lot of surprising plot twists, dynamic characters, romantic tension, angst angst goodness gracious all the angst, and also just frivolity and fun! What genres do I like? I tend to gravitate toward slice of life type deals, but where life is anything but typical: a wanna-be serial killer stalking his first victim, a person with some manner of super powers works in an office space and meets a new co-worker only to discover they also have super powers, people who find themselves trapped in a video game, a paranormal investigative team who fakes their findings suddenly find themselves in a real haunted house and shits about to go down, and on and on. \n\nIf any of those scenarios sounds fun to you or you want to come up with something together, let's do it! I have to say I'm not real big on many fandoms, if any... I prefer original plots and characters just because I don't really keep up with any fandoms.\n\nPM/Chat me your Discord info and we can talk more on there to see if we have writing chemistry and can make some word magic together!",

JUST DM ME :)\\**\n\nI am 32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job during the week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is to roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters (IRL gender doesn't matter).\n\nPlease be prepared for picture usage. I've done writing descriptions for a while, but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC (especially Arrowverse/MCU), Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon Age, etc. Anything else unlisted is better to bring them my way and see if I know them. If any above appeal, feel free to come my way.\n\nSome literacy at a minimum makes me happy, third person only, past tense. I am also VERY reasonable with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I am very nice, I promise, and I want to get niceties out of people in turn. Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a chance! Treat people the way you want to be treated, right?\n\nI do work during the day, so posting will be sporadic, but I am good at night and on weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day or more.\n\nI am usually on from sometime in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours. I hope to talk to all of you soon! :)\n\n***Current Desire: I am really interested in the \"intersex opposite a female\" perspective. Modern is a big medium I could see following through. I have ideas involving that most festive time of the year where romance is the least one can expect to find among many other things. Please message me for this or any other idea open!***",

The war forced citizens to run from their homes, where they fled underground and discovered a brand new world.\n\nThe RP has a large focus on character development over faction / race development, and doesn't include any \"race wars\", so sorry if that's what you were looking for. I like to keep the RP unique and interesting, and the lore in TKoA is quite deep if you choose to look into it.  \n\n\n### Beta?\n\nYes. The RP is currently in a \"Beta\" stage. This \"Beta stage\" exists to help test out some of the new systems that are set in place before I begin the main events. Those who join into the Beta and roleplay will be given a unique role for participation, credit on the homepage, and a spot in the \"Special thanks\" of the tie-in video game, which is still in development.\n\n### \n\n### Joining requirements?\n\n* Users who join must have a basic understanding of the English Language.\n* Users who join to spectate the RP must specify they are a spectator upon joining.\n* Users who join must follow the set RP rules and the set OOC rules. \n* Users who join must be partially active, unless they have a reason for being inactive. (*1-2 posts per day is fine.*)\n* Users who join cannot be on the banlist for the previous RP, \"The Lands of Asteria\". (*Send me a PM with your discord tag to check if you are on the banlist, if you are unsure. Also note that banned users can appeal on the website.*)  \n\n\n### What will the main plot be?\n\nNote that following the main plot is completely optional. The main plot consists of the king, searching for a group of skilled and talented fighters to help resolve an ongoing conflict between his men and a cult known as \"The Radiance\". He plans on sending said \"group of heroes\" to the underground abyss, in order to try and resolve their issues with a figure known as \"The Scarlet Preacher\".  Subject to change depending on the results of the Beta.\n\nThere is also a hidden \"side-plot\" that will influence the outcome of the main plot greatly. However, it requires a bit of digging into the lore and details to uncover.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

As a citizen of the Republic, a user can do a great variety of things, assuming their status within the Roman society permits it. Users may amass great wealth, gain prestigious government positions, and even be elected consul - or dictator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour fate and the fate of Rome are intertwined. As you grow, so will Rome, but take the wrong choice and the Republic may crumble. Will you enrich yourself at the people's expense? At Rome's Expense? Will you sacrifice an opportunity so that Rome may prosper? These are only a few of the difficult choices you and everyone else will have to make within Rome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Overview: \n\n**Roman Republic RP** is a roleplay discord set in the ancient Roman Republic, focused around the politics and government of the era. Users create characters who fall under the Plebeian and Patrician social classes of the era, and then can run for a variety of offices in the Republic, such as Senator, Tribune of the Plebeians, and Aedile, which all serve a unique and important role in the Roman government. Characters will also be able to lead armies and conquer for the glory of Rome. Events created by the staff team will create issues for the Roman government to solve, which will come in a variety of different forms, from grain shortages, to disease outbreaks, to even invasion by a foreign power. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'm a romance writer at heart, but don't expect anything to happen immediately. There is no such thing as love at first sight! \n\nI have a few ideas, but there are words that are flagged and rather than try to figure out why my posts keep getting taken down, I say message me! I use discord and kik, and would love to talk to you all. I do f/f, m/m, and f/m but I don't ever write out m/m smut. \n\nLook forward to hearing from you! ",

            "selftext": "The city called Rane seems perfectly normal to anyone passing by\u2014a wonderful royal family containing of a beautiful queen and her children, and loyal subjects all throughout. Those who live in this under-water city, though, know about the whispers of those cast off returning\u2014a city underground, all planning the demise of that same royal family. After all, both the king and one of their children had seemingly \u2018disappeared\u2019\u2014no one knows where they went, or who they went off with. Most people don\u2019t believe these whispers\u2014and yet, they grow stronger every day. Deep underground, below the city, a series of underwater tunnels lay. Ones filled with mermaids and mermen, all swimming past each other, their clothes tattered and messy. These people, with no other name except the Rebels, have one goal and one alone: to take down the people who cast them out. The corrupt family behind it all... the royal family.\n\nHello! I wanted my first roleplay group on discord to be more family-friendly than my usual\u2014more will be added as time goes on, of course! Most chats are closed until you\u2019re an approved character. I\u2019m just using this to fuel my mermaid obsession, lmao. Planning has been going on for quite a while, but I decided to keep the explanation shorter as to not bore you with my rambling. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/fZDJ2sf",

            "selftext": "### [F4M] Slice of Life Romance Roleplay [Discord] READ ENTIRE DESCRIPTION BEFORE MESSAGING [Repost] [Still-Looking]\n\nHello! I am looking for a male partner (Or a female who is willing to play a male) that would be interested in a long term Discord RP!\n\n\n#A bit about it\n\n- I tend to prefer Slice of Life Romances and usually stick to that, but I am open to trying other genres if the plot interests me.\n- I don\u2019t have any issues with NSFW, but it will not be the main focus of any roleplay I do, only scenes here and there when appropriate to add to the plot.\n- As for plots, I am doing so many RP\u2019s that I have run out of fresh ideas. I would love to hear any ideas you have! Don\u2019t be shy to speak your mind.\n- I usually roleplay in modern time, but I am willing to go as back as the 1920\u2019s.\n- I don\u2019t do any fandoms, sorry\n\n#Partner Terms and Conditions\n\n- Please don\u2019t contact me if you aren\u2019t literate! That means using descriptive detail, inner as well as outer monologues, and a decent vocabulary. I generally write from 2-4 Paragraphs per response, especially in the beginning to set up the scene. Sorry if this sounds harsh, I guess I\u2019m pretty picky\ud83d\ude05\n- I understand a plot can only last so long before it starts to get uninteresting. Because of this, I would love if my partner would be open do doing more plots once the plot we did is overused. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is be able to come up with fresh plots, characters and back stories. Don\u2019t recycle the same things for different roleplays.\n- When roleplaying in Discord, I make servers for each roleplay! Be open to using those as that is what I am most comfortable with.\n- I do go to school full time, so please understand when there are delays between responses! I will do the same for you.\n- Though it\u2019s not mandatory, I prefer counterparts that can be classified as an \u201cAlpha male\u201d. Yunno the type, aggressive, possessive, jealous, dominating, confident etc..\n-Oh, I almost forgot! I prefer third person, but I don\u2019t mind doing first person.\n\n#Message Requirements\n\n- Hell, I\u2019m not a monster. Though absolutely not a requirement, I\u2019d love a humanly \u201cHello!\u201d when you shoot me a message.\n- I\u2019d like if you send me a sample text of your writing, just to get a feel of how you write.\n- Also, I\u2019d prefer if you not send me your Discord until I respond, just so you don\u2019t feel your information is out there if I can\u2019t or don\u2019t respond.\n-If you\u2019ve made it down here, congrats! As a password for me answer your message, add the word \u2018Pineapples\u2019 to it!\n\n\nI\u2019m very friendly and open! Please shoot me a message if interested!\n               -Apple Valentina\n",

Plot is cool and all but.... sometimes I just like doing nsfw stuff more? I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm looking for people who'd be okay with doing a more smut heavy Pokemon rp, rather than a plot rp that just abruptly ends the moment action starts.... so naturally you must be at least 18. All characters are also 18.\n\nAnd I wish I didn't have to say this.... but I'm looking for people who are into this long term. I've had issues where people just up and disappear before the rp even starts, not even a \"I don't think we're compatible\" or \"I lost interest, so sorry!\". Please don't ghost.... I'm really tired of that. If you lose interest, tell me.\n\nAnyways onto the rp; I don't think this needs to be said but I'm looking for HumanXHuman romance, not HumanXPokemon. xD\n\nAnd for the 'plot', I was thinking about doing an amalgram of Hoenn and Alola. The Hoenn-Alola Islands; With Pokemon and girls from both available for use as my trainer OC travels the region. Any further details can be discussed via message. Basically a harem?\n\nAnd I don't have much in the way of limits; Only thing I won't touch is MaleXMale, feel free to ask about anything else!\n\nAnd I am in the mood for crossovers... if you want to sweeten the deal by offering up some of these gals then I'd be most appreciative! They aren't necessary though!\n\nNaruto: Tsunade, Ino\n\nMarvel: Black Cat\n\nDC: Starfire, Blackfire, Harley Quinn\n\nMass Effect: Ashley, Miranda\n\nScooby Doo: Daphne Blake\n\nTotal Drama: Lindsay\n\nSonic: Sally, Amy, Bunnie, Fiona\n\nYugioh: Alexis/Asuka\n\nFallout: Piper\n\nHarry Potter: Hermione, Fleur\n\nBen 10: Gwen Tennyson, Charmcaster\n\nAdventure Time: Princess Bubblegum\n\nAny further questions, feel free to drop me a message.

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI have been thinking for a while now about doing a walking dead rp or vampire diaries. I am 19 looking for players 19+ please no one younger then 19. I am submissive and am not willing to change that at all. I love a guy who can take control, in the bedroom. \n\nWalking Dead\n\nThat being said my idea is for a long term rp and I would like it to end up being romantic. I seriously love Daryl Dixon from the walking dead and would love to do a rp with someone willing to play as him. What I would really like to do   being long term and all and building on the romance of the story is after you either convince me to return to hilltop with you or Alexandria whichever one you decide. We spend a lot of time working together, I go out with you on supply runs and what not. Neither one of us acting on the feelings we have started to developed. Both of us refusing to admit how we feel, until one day we get separated and I get captured by the saviors and taken back to Negen. (If you are willing to do this rp I would ask you to play Negen of course Negen is controlling all the time) Once you Daryl find out what happened you realize how you really feel and have to safe me. I would really like to play this out\n\nWhat I was thinking to start it off for how we meet was maybe your out looking for supplies and come across what you think is an empty house. When you go inside you find signs that someone has been staying there just not sure if they still are. As you enter one of the bedrooms exploring you freeze as you hear someone cock a gun.\n\nVampire Diaries \n\nI don't really have a scene set for this one. I am looking for fun and adventure between  Elena and Damon. I would like before she is turned maybe Klaus kidnaps her again and Damon rescues her and takes her somewhere to try and keep her safe. And she starts falling for him. We can work out the details on kik.\n\nIf interested message me for kik. ",

They just disappear without a word and leave me hanging, if you lose interest please just tell me. Tired of being ghosted without explanation.\n\nAnyways, moving on....\n\nI'm looking for people who play females, I can double if that's your thing. It's fandom roleplay that I'm interested in doing, and I'm seeking people who'd like to use nsfw themes. Now it doesn't have to be purely nsfw, I do love plot. Just know that I don't want tons and tons of plot before getting to the good stuff.\n\nOCXCanon is my thing; I don't mind CanonXCanon, but OCxOC is just boring in a fandom environment.\n\nAnd my only limits are MxM\n\nI'm not seeking much length wise, just don't script play and we'll be fine.\n\nHere are my fandoms and some characters I'd like to play against:\n\nPokemon (For this, I'd honestly rather do a journey based rp... preferably with nsfw themes. Think of a journey similar to the anime/manga only with less filler and more action and nsfw themes! I'm also crossover friendly with this one, if you're okay with it we can bring in characters from other fandoms)\n\nNaruto (Tsunade, Ino)\n\nSaints Row (Shaundi, Viola)\n\nTotal Drama (Lindsay)\n\nMarvel and DC (Ghost Spider, Black Cat, Starfire, Blackfire)\n\nHarry Potter (Hermione)\n\nSonic\n\nScooby Doo (Honestly if you can rp as Daphne for me.... I'd do whatever after that)\n\nFallout (Piper)\n\nMass Effect (Miranda, Ashley)\n\nFar Cry\n\nGrand Theft Auto\n\nRed Dead Redemption (Karen)\n\nBen 10\n\nStar Wars\n\nThat's about it...

            "selftext": "Greetings and stuff ain't my thing so I'll just be to the point.  I've been RPing for 11 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. ~~When I say consistently available I MEAN consistently available.  I've been approached and then immediately ghosted for a  week+ after the first day by **several people** for no good reasons and it's getting REALLY annoying now.~~  It'd also be great if you didn't ghost me before even getting my Discord added, that's even worse.  I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\nRecently I have noticed a lot of people approaching me and either not knowing what I'm looking for in a story/setting or in a character as a whole and leaving cause they weren't getting what THEY were looking for upon being the ones to approach ME.  So at the bottom there's going to be a random little code word of sorts I expect to see in one's opening message that tells me they read this whole thing and actually understand what I am looking for/okay with.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a **Female** character.  Or if the person in question wants to be a DM/GM of a story in one of the settings I'm fine with, a focus being on female characters. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within a few tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters.  I also only do FemaleXFemale romances too. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.\n\n**Age Preference:** I'd prefer my partner, the actual person behind the screen is 18 or older.  That generally covers my actual concerns on the topic.\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** There's a number of fandoms I'm interested in and while with some I'm fine with both of us playing an OC or my partner playing a canon character, there are some fandoms I prefer to only play if the partner plans to play as a canon.  So as far as ones I'm fine with someone playing either one in it'd be: Pokemon, My Hero Academia, Dragonball Z, Splatoon or HunterxHunter.  Kingdom Hearts and Little Witch Academia  is an option but I'm a bit picky if it's an OC and otherwise would prefer my partner playing a canon for it.  As far as fandoms I prefer my partner at least playing a canon for it'd be: Legend of Zelda, Skullgirls, and Shantae.  But if anything the thing I'm looking for the absolute most is My Hero Academia right now.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.  As for availability on my end I live in the CST time zone and am usually awake and available between like 6 PM or so up to like 9 AM.  So if I can net people that are around for most of that time, that'd be good.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Academia  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",

This post is going to be quick because I'm heading to bed (which also means I won't reply for 6-9 hours) , but I'm currently looking for a new RP partner or two to get something going with. My preferred pairings are FxM and FxF, but I'm also open to MxF if I like the plot enough! \n\nI'm saying that, I have a few plots currently up my sleeve in the romance/angst/slice of life and romance/fantasy genres but I'm always open to new ideas so feel free to ask about mine or tell me about your own in the message. \n\nIn terms of specifics, I am looking for at least one paragraph as a standard, perhaps a little less for conversational sections, third person, and someone who is just genuinely willing to stick around. I meet so many people who are super keen, start, and then lull back to only replying when I message them asking if everything is okay before eventually stopping altogether. I'm not asking for constant replies, but I normally aim for at least 2-3 posts a day. If you're a busy, just let me know, I won't get mad at you for having a life and we can pick up when you have some free time to spare.\n\nI'll also add this here. I'm not looking for NSFW based roleplay, and while I'm well aware the characters will eventually get down and dirty in roleplay, I would rather fade to black and discuss the interaction as I currently am unable to rp out such themes due to living situations. This will likely change in a few months though! \n\nI think that's all... Oh! I also prefer discord but I'm open to other RP options too. Send me a message and we can talk more!

I\u2019m not picky and I\u2019m always willing to try something new. \n\nI only roleplay as original characters, unless we\u2019re both a fan of something then we could also do a canon rp. I don\u2019t mind using a universe or setting from a TV show or movie, however.\n\nI primarily play female characters, but I will happily use side characters of any gender. Maybe I\u2019ll try using a male character if I have a good idea for one. \n\nI\u2019m not an amazing writer by any means so please don\u2019t message me if you\u2019re looking for high end quality. I try my best.\n\nSome genres I like are romance, fantasy, horror, slice of like and more recently, medieval, historical and western.\n\nWorldbuilding comes hand in hand with roleplay for me so please be willing to flesh out some ideas and small details for flavour. Enthusiasm helps!! \n\nLast of all I\u2019d like for us to be able to chat OOC. It\u2019s much easier to rp with someone you\u2019re friends with. \n\n",

So the global space exploration organization sends two of best astronauts from each nation into space. Their goal is to either find the a way to replenish our resources or find a new hospitable planet. \n\nEvery nation gets one ship with each of their astronauts in it. They have enough resources on board to survive ten years of space exploration. They both have to wear the regulation space suits at all times. These skin tight suits mold to the body. It\u2019s as if your naked body is coated with a light liquid metal coating. These suits also have different functions besides clothing. For example in space, the suits create an face covering oxygen mask. The adventures they could go on are endless. Exploring Alien planets, seeing different cultures and alien races, to space battles, to anything we can think of. \n\nI like the idea of two people (strangers) being trapped together in ship basically naked the whole time. They could start hating eachother and slowly fall in love. Or they could hit it off immediately. I would love to build up their romance as they story goes. I\u2019m fine with Nsfw/sex as long it\u2019s natural in the plot. I can play male but typically prefer female characters. I\u2019m okay with your character being any gender your comfortable with. \n\nI love creating worlds and characters with people. Let me know if you like this idea or have another you like better! \n\nI would like to use discord and set up a server.  Let me know ASAP! ",

            "selftext": "In a far off, third world country, a dictator rules his nation with an iron fist. Some call him a cruel megalomaniacal tyrant while others praise him as nothing short of a god. To the people of this tiny country, there is just about no middle ground. People here either love him or loathe him. Join the resistance or the army. Crush the rebels or overthrow the government. \n\nThis all takes places on an isolated and impoverished island archipelago known as the Edernal Isles, located somewhere in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, ruled since 1988 by the iron fisted former defense minister, General Xi Zapata, who elected himself President, crowned himself King, and proclaimed himself God. \n\nUnsurprisingly, his boundless narcissism has not gone entirely unchecked. The nation's socialist party MPs and a handful of serious members and like-minded supporters fled into the jungle in the aftermath of Xi's coup and the new President's subsequent \"temporary\" (as in, since January of 1989) shutdown of the parliament. Though at first solely die-hard left-wing revolutionaries back when Zapata was still seen as somewhat reasonable, membership has extended to anyone grieved by the ruler or his government, though the leadership to this day still remains dominated by communist ideologues.\n\nThis subreddit has been mostly dead for a while, aside from myself and one other player, but I am trying to breathe new life into it. I believe the setting is uncommonly explored and fascinating. Anyone who has played Just Cause, Far Cry, or Tropico will understand the general idea of the roleplay. There is no map as of yet, but there are several named cities so far and maybe someone with talent could eventually help with that. The Lore can be found at the bottom of the page, a Character Creation Thread at the top, and everything in between will fill you in on recent happenings on the Isles. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n\n\nWe hope to see you soon at /r/Dictablanda RP!\n",

But I am trying to write a comic and I would like to RP my characters from it in order to get out of the creative slump that I'm in right now!\n\nNow, you may be wondering why I would like to do snail mail in lieu of anything else besides email. This is because I've done so with my then boyfriend in high school. We both wrote in notebooks and gave it to each other and it's something that I would like to do a lot. Of course, none of my information will be placed here, but if you are serious in doing so, please let me know! More info on the characters and story plot will be given if you are interested!\n\nI would like to have someone however who is literate and knows how to use their grammar properly. Also I would like someone who is 18+, since it is something sensitive that people don't normally like giving out.\n\nThank you for your consideration!",

However, it doesn\u2019t matter much to me whether you\u2019re actually M or F outside of writing.  I am 29 years old and married to the love of my life, so anything we write RP wise will be just that.  I am not looking for anything other than perhaps a new friend and writing partner.\n\nThat being said, I am taking a break from constantly writing as the male and itching to try my hand as the female role for a Western revenge type storyline; one that\u2019s preferably set between 1865 - 1895.  The \u201cwild west\u201d era.  And, yes, one that has love involved.  Sexual tension and the like.  All that good stuff.\n\nI am not a prude when it comes to NSFW topics.  Blood, gore, sex, nudity, language, etc.  I am open to it all, but will respect whatever you\u2019re not.\n\nI prefer to write via Google Docs and in 3rd person.  Length of posts depend highly on what is happening.  Starters, scene settings and dialogue all come in different word counts.  Sometimes it isn\u2019t necessary to have 500 paragraphs just to say the character opened a door.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, feel free to shoot me a message.  I *am* looking for something long term, hopefully with someone who enjoys plotting and brainstorming and who also uses Discord for means of quick communication between posts.  I\u2019m pretty chatty, so please don\u2019t be shy.  Oh, and it doesn\u2019t hurt to be the type to proof read posts before posting.  You know, checking spelling and grammar and the likes.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi there and thanks for taking the time to look at this ad!\n\nFirst of all, a little about me. I am an experienced (15+ years across various mediums), roleplayer. I enjoy writing and creating, with worldbuilding, character building and storytelling being me true passions. I\u2019m looking for a partner with the same sorts of interests to build a story, some characters and the world in which they live. I can play by Discord or Email, with no real preference for which. I typically try to post several times a week.\n\nI write in the third person, and I usually will do three decently sized paragraphs per post. I look for quality in a post; it doesn\u2019t have to be the best thing ever, but it does have to show some effort. That\u2019s all. I do ask that my partner be eighteen (18) or older. I am okay with NSFW elements in a story, but I don\u2019t want them to be the focus. I\u2019m not interested in a smut-based RP at all. Likewise, I am not interested in extreme violence or gore.\n\nI'm only interested in playing opposite male characters. My own characters are female, although I'm interested in trying to play a Trans-Female character as well.\n\nAlso note that I only reply to messages sent by DM. Replies posted here will not be followed up on. It's a way to test if you're paying attention, among other things\n\nAnd now for some story prompts. These are just a few off the top of my head, but I\u2019m open to other ideas. I am principally looking for RP in Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic, Cyberpunk and Low-Fantasy settings.\n\n* *Arena* (Fantasy/Sci-Fi) - Our characters are prisoners who have been forced to fight for their lives in an arena. Despite their circumstances, rather than killing each other, they plot to escape and overthrow their cruel masters. This one is flexible; it could as easily be Low Fantasy as anything else.\n\n* *Reunited Survivors* (Post-Apocalyptic) - Once our characters were friends. Now, years later, after some great cataclysm, they have been reunited, surprised to find a familiar face in a changed world. However, they have both been changed by this new world\n\n* *Resistance* (Sci-Fi/Post Apocalyptic) - The world was invaded and conquered by an unknown alien force. Now they rule the world, supported by their human lackeys who police their subjugated people. However, there are those who are willing to stand against them. This could go all the way from urban guerrilla groups to armed uprising on a devastated world.\n\n* *Cyborg* (Sci-Fi) - Either or both of our characters are cyborgs, heavily augmented with artificial limbs and other modifications. Maybe they were maimed and offered \"upgrades\" as replacements, or maybe they chose to do this to themselves. Regardless, they are a part of an elite, augmented military force dealing with other extraordinary threats.\n\n* *Colonial Expeditionary Force* (Sci-Fi) - Our characters are soldiers in the military force of some interstellar power. Our role is to step in where needed, to protect the people from various threats, like pirates, raiders, insurgents, terrorists and the like. Depending on how you feel, they could be a legitimate force for good, or the heavy-handed hammer of a totalitarian regime.\n",

I\u2019ve been wanting to do some slightly more casual, slice of life and romantic RPs with someone preferably looking to play a female. (Though I have nothing against that person being male IRL.) I have a small list of fandoms I\u2019d like to do a RP such as this with - And I\u2019ll list them down below. I\u2019ll put them in order top to bottom of those I\u2019m more interested in. \n\nDragon Maid. \nRe:Zero\nUndertale/Deltarune.\nSteven Universe.\nWatamote. \nKill La Kill.\nAdventure Time.\nOverwatch. \n\nI know a lot of games and very little more anime, so if there\u2019s something else you\u2019d like to do, just tell me. I hope that we can discuss something together, and hopefully find something we both enjoy. I\u2019d like to do this Over Discord preferably, I thank you for reading! PM if interested!",

They were said to grant any power, wish, and desire, if the user so wished. Throughout history one of the weapons were wielded by many brave heroes, the other wielded by heinous villains. Legends of these two powerful weapons lived on for centuries, though they disappeared long ago. Though being dismissed as a simple children\u2019s story for decades, the tales resurfaced one day. One of the legendary weapons was supposed to be wielded by a warrior called Fawdaa. He wanders the world, slaughtering all of the inhabitants of wherever he travels. Thus terror and awe of him spread, causing many to seek after him and his weapon, in search of power. Legend says that he currently resides in a large trading hub called Ammit... \n\nThe city is a pivotal spot for naval and land trade on the 17th century Silk Road in India. The areas around the hub are quite clean and lawful, although the other parts of the city can get quite shady. The slums specifically have an underground organization, with all sorts of unsavory things happening. And to further complicate matters a select few factions are forming, all hungry for power over the city.\n\n\n[Hi all! This is a relatively brand new server that is happy to open its doors.

Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

This is new and I would prefer to use discord or google docs to roleplay. I'm a full time nurse who still has alot of free time to roleplay. My number one annoyance is bugging me for replies. It's annoying and doesn't make me want to reply faster.\n\nSome other things:\n\nI play females or double. I do love playing multiple characters, but if we're doing single mains, I want to be a female. I love dark and mature themes and yes that includes NSFW. (18+) Romance is amazing and most of my rps will have it. I write in the 3rd person, past tense only. Paragraph format.\n\nMy favorite genre to rp is modern supernatural/fantasy. I love witches, gifted humans, vampires, werewolves, demons, etc. I have a ton of plots I can share with you but I'm also down to create something new. I'm also down for slice of life if the plot is right.\n\nI'm into a few fandoms. Mostly OC x Canon. I will double for most of these. Feel free to ask, but as of right now, I'm mostly into: CW Flash (looking for Jay/Hunter/Zoom); Labyrinth (looking for Jareth); The 100 (maybe all ocs? If not I'd be looking for Bellamy); Vampire Diaries (looking for Klaus); and possible Sailor Moon (looking for Prince Diamond).\n\nHope to hear from you! Message me for my Discord name.",

            "selftext": "Hi! My name is Brianna, I'm eighteen and I am looking for a long-term RP partner! I'm new to Reddit, but the Roleplaying community here looks incredibly active which makes me pretty happy considering I really wanna jump full force back into the RPing scene! I've been RPing for about two and a half years now and I primarily respond to my partners with a paragraph or two as I don't like to go on too long before having a response.\n\nI would prefer to do Oc x Oc platonic or romantic, most of my characters are female as I do prefer the more soft side of the relationship in sex scenes and not in them! Depending on which canon character you want to play I could give it a go sometimes! For example, I've always kind of wanted to do an RP where my main character somehow falls in the pathway of Michael Myers as silly as it sounds. But again, I would prefer Ocs! I typically like to do a bunch of different Rps, not just one that can range from canon, such as my base story, or my partners base story though I would prefer to start with that. I would love to do Sci-Fi aus, Aus like maybe a coffee shop owner, though I prefer more adventurous RPs like Mafia stuff, pirates, to me the more tense and dramatic a RP can get the more I'm interested, especially if my partner's character is a bit intense! My canon story is a more mythic and magic one, with my characters all being non-human, such as Satyrs, elves, Vampires, Harpies, Demons and that sort of thing. I am not opposed to sex scenes and actually really enjoy them, but I would like to have a real story rather than just a week-long doing it fest XD\n\nI enjoy all sorts of shipping,  \\[MxM\\] \\[FxM\\] and \\[FxF\\] primarily though I do prefer to play the more feminine role, my male characters though aren't simple soft boys though, I wanted to avoid that because I didn't just want to tailor them to me, I wanted them to be fun and dynamic! I would like it if your characters were a permanent thing, not made for each individual RP as I like to go back and do new things with the same or even new ships with those charas!\n\nI have Skype and Discord though I'm a bit more active on discord as I have more people I know there. I did just download Discord though, as everyone seems to use it! So if I make a mistake, or mess up a little it won't be quite so embarrassing! I'm also hoping to find a good friend while rping, so if you'd be up for that I'd love to meet you! :D",
