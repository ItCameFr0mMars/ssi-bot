            "selftext": " Hello all!\n\nAs of late, I have been working on a roleplaying server for Discord. Out of convenience for those on this subreddit I will attempt to keep this post brief and to the point, we are a small, yet growing community that is looking to invite people willing to roleplay in a literate/semi-lit format. However, this does not mean that we are not welcome of all levels of writing - so long as you're willing to take on board our requests and have a love for the universe.\n\nThe basic premise for the server is that your character sails from the continent of Tamriel to an island off the coast of High Rock; a land lost to a mysterious miasma. Upon arrival, your written character will become a member of an organisation dedicated to ensuring the safety of its inhabitants through the completion of contracts - which will mostly entail the slaying of various monsters that are rampant throughout the land. We've even begun with our first official story event being announced.\n\nUpon joining the server, we ask that you complete our character sheet and apply it. Upon doing so, you'll be ready to start your adventures in the city of Settler's Stone. If this interests you, we would greatly appreciate you taking the time to join us via this link: [https://discord.gg/nzzuqVY](https://discord.gg/nzzuqVY)\n\nThank you,  \nVile.",

The year is 2015. In the small town of Eastville, Virginia. A population of 240, our female character lives at home with her family while she's still in college. Though she is loved by all of her family and the friends that she has, she's always felt as if she did not belong. Often, when not working on school work, she finds herself wishing that she was a part of the world of Tolkien. She's always felt that it was a place that she was meant to be. Of course, she knows that it's all fantasy. She continues to go about her life as usual.\n\nOne night, her parents go out to celebrate on Christmas Eve, leaving their daughter to her own devices that evening. The party they went to was a blast but they phoned home telling their daughter that it would be late before they returned home. The following morning, the daughter got up only to find that her parents never returned home. Worried, she starts calling around trying to find out why they never made it. It was just as she was beginning to truly panic that there was a knock on her door.\n\nShe opened it to find a pair of the local police. They informed her that her parents had been in a terrible car accident the night before, due to the terrible storm. They'd not made it. Stricken with grief, the young woman was soon forced to move in with her Grandparents. She took all of her things with her, making sure that she even had her books and movies that always seemed to take her mind off of the real world. She started pulling away from her remaining family and friends, trying to deal with her parents' sudden death.\n\nAfter four months had passed, the young woman can no longer take the pain. She finds herself sitting at her windowsill, looking out into the sky. A shooting star suddenly shoots across the sky. She wishes with all of her heart to be taken somewhere where she could start her life over, without the reminders that she faced every day. Little did she know, she was going to get her wish.\n\n**Where Our Story Will Begin::**\n\nThe female character wakes up in a strangely familiar land. She's still clothed as she was before she was brought there. She begins wandering around, trying to figure out where she is. She soon realizes that she's somehow in Middle Earth yet has no idea how it happened..until she recalls the shooting star. She's lost in a dangerous world having no idea what time she's been thrown into. A male Elf comes across her and offers to help. They are thrown together as the war for the Ring slowly begins to creep closer. Can the Mortal woman find a way home? Or does she even want to? Love will bloom between her and the Elf but is there a way for them to be together?\n\n2)Thousands of years ago, Dragons ruled the world of Varnaya. They were revered as the ultimate race of the world. They ruled with compassion over the lesser races of the world..loving all that lived under them. With the Dragons ruling the world, the Elves and Humans got along quite well..one could even say that they were friends. The world of Varnaya was a beautiful and lush world. One that had never seen any amount of war or famine under the Dragons rule. The world had been a happy place. This all ended the moment the Dragons were struck with The Sickness. The disease that ravaged the ruling race turned all those that were struck to change. They no longer cared about the world or those that they protected. They only cared about themselves..their wealth. They became merely beasts that ravaged the world.\n\nAfter the Dragons turned, the Humans and Elves have begun to hate one another. They are always constantly arguing. The only thing that they've been able to agree upon is that the Dragons must be taken care of. Legions of Men and Elves ventured forth, hunting down the beasts. At first, the two races merely lost many lives. They had no idea how to kill the monsters. After many long years and so many lives lost, a way was found. One by one, the Dragons were hunted down and killed, their corpses left rotting upon the ground where they fell.\n\nOnce the threat of the Dragons was gone, the Humans and Elves continued fighting with one another. Each race saw the other at fault for everything. There was no fixing their ties. As the years passed, the fighting seemed to be never ending however, there was whispers of a shadow growing in the North high upon the mountain of Kahluna. At the highest point, the city of Ialeos is located. It is here that a new threat is growing in power. The Dragon Ethron had awoken from his deep slumber. He began gathering all remaining Dragons to him, those that had survived the Hunting. He is no king though rules as one. His name is becoming more widly known. There are none now that do not know *of* him. He seeks to rid the world of the other races for the slaughter they have done to his kind. Ialeos is unreachable by Humans or Elves. They have no way of getting to the False King on their own.\n\n**Races:**\n\nHumans} They are generally the shortest of all of the races, standing up to only **5'7**. Their eye color is usually of darker shades and their hair is darker as well. The Humans are generally non-magical creatures however, there are a select few that can do magic. Wizards they are called and they are very rare. There only only five known currently. The Humans live under the influence of their ancient gods. Humans tend to fight with Elves as they do not trust them. They've been enemies for as long as their history books go back. The hatred runs so deep that no one really remembers the real reason for the fighting. Perhaps one day they will set aside their differences and get along. Humans live to be 75-80 years old.\n\nElves} They are taller than Humans, standing up to **6'5**. Their eye color is usually of lighter shades as is their long hair. Elves are one of the two true magical creatures that reside in Varnaya. They are very in tune with all things that are nature. They serve under the influence of two gods. Loint the god of earth and Risnda the goddess of life. The Elves are a kind race unless provoked. They hate only the Humans. Their libraries are said to contain the reasons for the great hatred between the two races though this has never been truly proven. The Elves live in far off forests that they've built their cities in. Elves are Immortal and can only die when in battle and mortally injured.\n\nDragons} They are the oldest of the three races and are magical. They have the ability to shift into a elf like shape. Though they can blend in with the Elves it is still noticeable that they are different. Their ears are still pointed, but they have small pointed canines that are visible when they speak. Their eyes usually change from their natural color to one more normal for a Elf. Their hair color usually is rather dark in this form. Dragons revere no gods, only their ancient Ancestors. Dragons are fierce beasts who once ruled over the world. They lived in the ancient stone city Ialeos, a city built many long ages ago by the first Dragon King. Here, the Dragons live under the rule of the royal family of Ardurwen. Dragons come in many different shapes, sizes and colors, but the one thing that they have in common is that the males all breathe fire and the females all breathe ice. Their true eye color tends to usually be a red, emerald green, gold, or silver. Dragons are Immortal and can only die if mortally wounded.\n\n**(There are, as always, some genetic oddities among the three races. Hair colors may be off, as well as heights. Eye color however must remain true to race.)**\n\n**Where We Will Begin:**\n\nThe Dragons have been *gone* for many long years. The world is slowly falling into chaos. Now, the threat of the Dragons is coming back. The Humans and Elves must learn to set aside their differences in order to save their world. The Elven King calls forth three of the most seasoned adventurers to set fort to hunt down a Dragon that still lives in the Lower Lands. They must hunt him down and persuade him to join their cause so that they can reach Ialeos and defeat Ethron, restoring the balance of the world.\n\nWhat I'm Looking For:\n\nSomeone willing to double. I'll be playing the **Dragon** male and a **Human** female. I am looking for someone willing to play the female love interest for my male and the male love interest for my female. Your characters may be either **Human**or **Elf**.\n\n3) The world of Irisu is vast and beautiful. The creatures are all lovely in their own ways and tend to stay away from civilization. The capitol of the world is Silanos. The city was built in the middle of the Karhana Mountain range. By doing this, the ruling family thought that no enemy could reach them. They welcomed only their closest and most highly regarded acquaintances to live in the city. There are also many other smaller cities littered about the world that are not nearly as beautiful as Silanos. The King of Silanos is in charge of protecting the entire world. As of now, the only enemy is the slowly rising empire of Nuhardos. The ruler of Nuhardos seeks to become the king of Irisu though the current King sees him as no threat. It hasn't taken long for things to slowly become worse and worse. A war is quickly approaching.\n\nAs the days slowly tick by, the King begins becoming more paranoid by the minutes. He's begun locking himself in his study, refusing to see anyone save for his advisers. His own daughter hasn't seen him in months. The King fears for his life, assuming that the other ruler means to have him murdered by the Assassins. How wrong he was. Instead of killing the King, they have sent the Guild Master of the Assassins after his daughter. His orders: To kill the young woman. What would happen if the man instead kidnaps her? Would the Princess be able to break through all of the Assassin's defenses that he's surrounded himself with? Could they eventually love each other? More as the Story progresses.\n\nRace:Humans only\n\nWhat I'm looking for: Someone to play the princess\n\nAND if you made it this far... kudos to you! XD This ended up much longer than I expected!

            "selftext": "Greetings and stuff ain't my thing so I'll just be to the point.  I've been RPing for 11 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. ~~When I say consistently available I MEAN consistently available.  I've been approached and then immediately ghosted for a  week+ after the first day by **several people** for no good reasons and it's getting REALLY annoying now.~~  It'd also be great if you didn't ghost me before even getting my Discord added, that's even worse.  I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\nRecently I have noticed a lot of people approaching me and either not knowing what I'm looking for in a story/setting or in a character as a whole and leaving cause they weren't getting what THEY were looking for upon being the ones to approach ME.  So at the bottom there's going to be a random little code word of sorts I expect to see in one's opening message that tells me they read this whole thing and actually understand what I am looking for/okay with.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a **Female** character.  Or if the person in question wants to be a DM/GM of a story in one of the settings I'm fine with, a focus being on female characters. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within a few tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters.  I also only do FemaleXFemale romances too. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.  Basically if aiming for a romance I'd prefer the partner character being the one making advances and such.\n\n**Age Preference:** I'd prefer my partner, the actual person behind the screen is 18 or older.  That generally covers my actual concerns on the topic.\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** There's a number of fandoms I'm interested in and while with some I'm fine with both of us playing an OC or my partner playing a canon character, there are some fandoms I prefer to only play if the partner plans to play as a canon.  So as far as ones I'm fine with someone playing either one in it'd be: Pokemon, My Hero Academia, Dragonball Z, Splatoon or HunterxHunter.  Kingdom Hearts and Little Witch Academia  is an option but I'm a bit picky if it's an OC and otherwise would prefer my partner playing a canon for it.  As far as fandoms I prefer my partner at least playing a canon for it'd be: Legend of Zelda, Skullgirls, and Shantae.  But if anything the thing I'm looking for the absolute most is My Hero Academia right now.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.  As for availability on my end I live in the CST time zone and am usually awake and available between like 6 PM or so up to like 9 AM.  So if I can net people that are around for most of that time, that'd be good.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Dichotomy  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",

We end up picking it up and bringing it to one of the characters homes, who has a VHS tape player in his attic, joking around about what could be on it the entire way there.\n\nWhen we actually get around to listen to the tape, it shows a black screen with the words \u201cCaution: what you do cannot be reversed.\u201d It stays like that for a long time; and my character is about to call it quits before it switches, grainy footage of a man plays, he has a large book in front of him and looks rather stressed. Moments later he starts reading from the book, giving another warning and then going on to chant. At the end the tape cuts to the words \u201cArcadia\u201d, all of it was pretty unsettling, but the tape was just taken out and tossed into a storage box, when the characters return to their individual homes and go to sleep, they wake up in a large snowy Forrest, with no trace of anybody they know, their prior lives and only slightly resemble their past appearance. \n\nThey later find out they\u2019re located in a small town named \u201cArcadia\u201d, and an entirely different world.",

I'm mostly looking for a fandom roleplay right now, over original, so, yeah. First off, the shit I'm interested in doing: I'm mostly looking for either Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid or WataMote (I've watched the Anime for both, and have read the manga.)\n\nThere are a few other things I'm up for roleplaying, but none are really coming to mind.  I guess just ask about something, and I'll say if I know what the fuck you're talking about, and if I'm up for it, or if I just don't.\n\nI'm looking for something more on the relaxed side, probably focused on a slowly developing relationship between characters, so keep that in mind.\n\nI prefer playing female characters (Which there is no shortage of in my two picks.), but am okay with playing male characters, if it's needed. (OCs are cool with me, as long as they aren't too much into Mary Sue territory, and all that shit.)\n\nI'm 'literate', my posts consisting of decent grammar and punctuation, as well as averaging one to two paragraphs in length, and sticking to the third person. I'd heavily prefer a partner of this same style. However, smaller replies are okay, so long as they aren't one-liners. Those piss me off to no end.\n\nI prefer Discord for my roleplays, but can settle for other places.\n\nYeah.",

            "selftext": " Hello all! I've posted this before and if our RP didn't work out or I forgot to PM you back, you can PM me again.\n\nHello all!\n\nI am looking for someone to play out a VERY specific dynamic with me. If you'd like to double up and do something that you are super passionate about, I'd be totally game--or maybe this has been the very thing you've been searching for and we are fated WHAT LUCK.\n\nOkay a few things about me:\n\n* I'm over 20\n* I live in America\n* I'm a professional writer (ask me about it after we get to know each other and you will never, ever, ever hear the end of it sorry in advance)\n* Weekdays are busy, weekends are a vast expanse of time that I yearn to fill.\n* I love realistic romance above ALL ELSE. I would like to play the female in one M/F relationship and am happy to do another male/female for you in return as long as we come up with something cool and engaging. I actually super love playing guys, but I get burnt out only playing them.\n* I enjoy writing real life. So I love things that are hilariously funny, and things that are infuriating and frustrating, and things that are sad. I really, really love people. Like, a lot. I love writing about them. My favorite stuff to write is poignant stuff because I think sadness and longing and heartbreak and fear and the good that can come from those things is so extraordinarily beautiful.\n* I write third person/paragraph style, though my preference is rapid fire posts where we only post as much as we need to. I am quality over quantity every time--in fact, I LOVE surprises and not knowing and doing a lot with a little. The best writers I've ever written with have been able to devastate me with five word posts.\n* I am MORE than literate, but I write \"slow burn\" because I think good stories take time\n* My favorite settings are historical, sci-fi, fantasy (I looooove playing princesses, fight me), and slice-of-life.\n* I RP by email\n\nOkay, what I am searching for is the \"tough\" male (your character) and the girl who \"changes\" him (mine). I love the idea of characters who are incredibly idealistic--yours thinks that mine is his savior, mine thinks that she IS his savior. But of course, we all know that things are much more complicated than that. This relationship will NOT be healthy and will probably crash and burn in the most spectacular of ways (I can't wait). Ideally, I'll run this plot alongside something that complicates it--it won't just be two people who bumped into each other at the grocery store, but I'm not opposed to that idea either. I am SUPER ready to write out some complex, screwed up characters who possibly actually make each other's lives worse! I am seeking someone who wants to write this out as realistically as possible, but also with great beauty.\n\nI know that this next section will turn some of you away from me, but I want to be as open and upfront as I possibly can be. Here is what I am not looking for:\n\n* Partners who completely disregard me, my character, and my story. It's like I'm not there at all. If you'd like to write a novel, I wish you the best of luck, but I want to write together. This is the most common reason I lose interest in roleplay.\n* People who are mean and unpleasant or creepy and trying to hit on me. We are RPING. It is FICTION. Dude you don't even know what I look like I could literally be Cthulhu think of all the tentacles you'd have to deal with\n* Unapologetic godmodders. Everyone says that they don't godmod, and then people do. Do not put words in my mouth\n* People who are unwilling to try anything without plotting it to death first. Come ON where's your sense of adventure? Let's find things out together!! I also don't have much interest in spending long periods of time planning out dynamics. I like to strike when the iron is hot and get going.\n* I'm just gonna reiterate that point above--I really, really don't want to spend long periods of time planning. I lose 100% of my interest immediately. I write on the fly. I'm not a planner. I often don't even proofread my posts.\n* People who really aren't all that interested in romance and don't really have a passion for it\n* \"Flat\" writers. This is kind of hard to describe. It's writers who aren't particularly inventive or skilled. Oftentimes, their posts read more like textbooks than novels. I am looking for a writer who is LIVELY and VIVID and FUN. I am looking for characters to play against who are engaging and UNAPOLOGETICALLY FLAWED and interesting.\n* Somebody who doesn't really want to talk OOC. It's not that I'll be blowing you up every day with all my drama and woes, but I really like people who are fun to talk to online.\n* Somebody who only wants to write the hero. I find perfect characters to be so dull it makes me want to pull my teeth out. My favorite characters I've ever written against were actually so frustratingly flawed and broken that sometimes I actually CRIED over them. These are the characters I try (don't always succeed) in writing.\n\nAlso I have to tell you that if I don't think we are jiving, I will probably try to be honest about it. Prepare yourself and don't get mean if I say so. I will be nice and it's not that you're a bad writer, it's just that I don't want to use up our time with something I'm not that into. It's a rare butterfly when two writers are equally invested in something, but darn it, I'm gonna chase that monarch to the ends of the earth\n\nPlease don't be intimidated by this. I've been rping for a very long time (seventeen years) and have spent most of that time writing stuff I'm not all that interested interspersed with a few plots that made me laugh, cry, ache, and RUN to my computer every time my partner posted. I want more of that--and I'm sure you do too. So if you're interested, message me and let's see what we can figure out. The best way to get my attention is by coming with an idea, a post sample, and a little about yourself. The BEST BEST BEST way to get my attention is to be funny af in your intro to me, either be like \"this is what I want\" or \"what do you want,\" and then we just do it while we're both amped.\n\nWow okay this is a lot lol. Well, thanks for reading, whoever you are.\n\nPlease message me if you are interested!",

The world is an AU where MagiTech (Magical Technology) has advanced humanity to the point where society is an essential Utopia for those of the higher class. For those of the lower and middle classes, however, MagiTech has forced them out of their jobs as everything is automated, from check outs at stores all the way up to doctors.\n\n\tThe main character or characters are lower or middle class people who have found some experimental MagiTech weapons that were loat several years ago in a convoy raid during a long since ended war. These weapons have an advanced AI, to the point of essentially being human in mind even if not in body.\n\nSoon after this discovery, the Aristocracy realize that they are starting to run out of resources. As such they send troops to start taking from those seemingly below them.\n\nThe story follows the main character or characters in their journey to start a rebellion and stop the Aristocracy.\n\nPM me on Discord ic you're interested, we'll be writing in Google Docs, but I find Discord make communication easier. My tag is the same as it is here.\n",

I'd also like a partner who likes headcanons and talking ooc, since I believe communication between partners is important. I have discord, I would like my partner does too.\n\n1. Good spelling and grammar is a must. Third person, quality over quantity but I like to write long paras along with short paras.\n2. I do write mature themes but I'm happy to keep it PG-13 if you're not comfortable with it, fade to black works as well. I only ask my partner to be 18+ since I'm 21+ and I wouldn't feel comfortable.\n3. I don't have triggers, but there are a few things I'm not comfortable with, so as long as we discuss them before doing anything, we're fine.\n4. I can be as active as I can, but rl comes first. I normally try to reply at least twice every day, some days even more.\n5. I\u2019m open to all the ideas and suggestions for the plot, I love talking and deciding what to do together.\n6. I love fluff just as much as I love angst, so a nice combination of both would be great.\n7. I get super excited about my plots, so I always end up making manips, gifsets, graphics, and even playlists.\n\nI really want a celeb ship \u2013 She\u2019s a popular actress (I'd play her) from some movie saga/book based TV show, and he\u2019s a very popular k-pop idol/kdrama actor (you'd play him), and meet in a vacation, a party or on set and they just click?? and they start dating in secret, traveling across the world to see each other. Something super cute and sweet, a bicultural couple that learns about each other and their country and customs and they\u2019re just very happy, literal soulmates that managed to meet. I\u2019d love it to be long-term, like them dating then even getting married, dealing with fame and things, and being just in love.\n\nI would give you all the cookies in the world if you use Ahn Jae Hyun or Kyuhyun (Super Junior) against me. As for her, I\u2019m all open for suggestions, but I do have a few ideas.\n\n**If interested, feel free to message me via PM!**\n\n*\\*I'm looking for active partners, please don't message me if you're not in for a long-term.*",

It can be sort of a sequel to the original movie, and I'm fine with including OCs in the rp as well as the original characters, but we can of course discuss that more.  \n\nIt will of course be adventure-based, drama, comedy and perhaps have some romance in it. (other genres can be discussed)   Along with the main characters, we can also have side characters but if we do romance, I'd prefer the main character romance to be MxM, once again we can compromise on that. \n\n I can write from 5 sentences to 5 paragraphs but depending on your reply length, I will match it. Just please be literate and have good grammar. Also, please be willing to roleplay mature themes or at least hint at suggestive things.  Please DM me if you're interested, we can  also discuss other roleplay platforms if you do not wish to roleplay on here.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCONTACT:  \n\nDiscord - Vampy#2495  \n\nWattpad - ThiccandPink ",

Some of them are more fleshed out than others, I guess just ask about them. Some of their back stories aren't the best, for the most part I'm not gonna change them. I'm mainly looking to play against female characters, cuz I don't have good experiences against male characters. Put some effort into your first message, tell me about the character or your idea for whatever you're messaging me for, leave your Discord and we'll go from there. Also, it's fine if you change your mind,you but do not just block me out of nowhere and act like I didn't exist. I think that about covers everything, so I've got characters for:\n\nSteven Universe\n\nStar Wars\n\nDC\n\n*Marvel*\n\n*MegaMan*\n\n*Naruto*\n\nDragonball\n\n*Avatar*\n\nDevil May Cry\n\n\nRWBY\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\nDead Rising\n\n*Archer*\n\nWitcher\n\n*Zelda*\n\n*Resident Evil*\n\nI might be forgetting a few others, but there's the most part.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m looking for a partner to play in a high-fantasy open world sandbox, where the character, a regular person from Earth (or anywhere not \u2018here,\u2019 really), one day wakes up to find themselves in a completely different universe. I\u2019d love to see the character adapt and grow within their new environment as they interact with the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo write a little about me first, I\u2019m a 20-year-old female with about 5 years of experience in roleplay. I write in both first and third, but heavily prefer third over first, especially when using a multitude of characters. I don\u2019t really have a particular preference on the type of character I play, and I\u2019ll play accordingly if you have a preference of some sort. Also, I love anime way more than American shows, so if you throw TV show references\u2026chances are, I won\u2019t get it\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for this particular RP, while I have been developing the setting for a while myself, I\u2019m open to discussing more with you and sharing ideas! The setting I have does contain a wide variety of themes, with darker themes as well as common ones within it, so please let me know if there\u2019s anything that may make you uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m fine with playing out NSFW scenes, but forcing one unnaturally is a big no for me. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with such, we can always fade to black and move on, no big deal!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough everyone knows that we make mistakes and typos then and there, I do ask that you have at least a decent understanding of English and general grammar, write in third person, and\u2026reply once a while? I\u2019ve recently had a lot of free time on my hands, so I\u2019d prefer if my partner could reply frequently, but of course that\u2019s a preference and not a requirement! Once a few days, or once every few hours, anything goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mostly roleplay on discord, and occasionally email. I heavily prefer discord as it provides an easier way of out-of-character communication, and I love talking; I\u2019m the kind of person that\u2019d go on and on about characters and settings and situations and\u2026see how much I rambled on in this post alone? Maybe I should stop\u2026hue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, shoot me a PM with your discord! I hope to talk to you soon. Have a good day\\~",

You\u2019d probably say that it\u2019s crazy, right?\n\nSince times has changed, Gods and legendary beings have ascended into a higher existence. They\u2019ve learned that living amongst mortals only bred conflict and catastrophe. It wasn\u2019t too long later that they realized that having none to worship them was unacceptable, so as civilization went on, deities of different cultures chose mortals to be their patron footholds on earth. The humans they chose were gifted power and knowledge above their wildest dreams in exchange for the job to keep up their influence in the modern world.\n\nFast forward to the creation of \u2018The Pantheon\u2019. It started out as a small group of wealthy families that made it their goal to breed patrons for the deities, but eventually evolved into a much larger conglomerate of wealthy families to serve the same purpose. Once a year, these families come together to a large uncharted  island near Japan to hold a tournament of combat to fight for sponsors and find out who is the strongest patron walking.\n\n\u2014            \u2014            \u2014         \u2014           \u2014       \u2014        \u2014\n\nHey! This is going to be a mostly drama and action oriented RP with a strong romantic subplot between our characters. (If you\u2019re not interested in the full experience of romance, then this is not for you.) As far as the storyline of this RP, I\u2019ve kept it kind of ambiguous besides the tournament as I\u2019d like us both to run and weave it together. I cannot stress it enough when I say please come with your own ideas for the story and history. I just find it so much more fun when we can both world build. I love detail, so I expect no less than a full paragraph a reply. It can most certainly be more if need be. Your character is fully in your control. I don\u2019t have any preference for how they should be, so It\u2019s all up to you whether they\u2019re from a wealthy family, or a random, regular girl who was chosen, etc.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please contact me on Reddit and we can move to another platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Basically my character will have to choose between a set of guys. This can be M x F or M x M with me playing F in M x F or sub M in M x M.\n\nA few ideas:\n\nNew Band Member Choosing a Suitor\n\nI also have fandoms and I am open to any ideas you may have!\n\n\u2b50\u2b50 Here are my rules:\n\n1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.\n\n2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.\n\n3. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.\n\n4. Please nothing inappropriate in resoect to this subreddit's rules. This should be plot and romance based. \n\n5. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else.\n\n6. Be okay playing multiple characters with a minimum of 3.\n\nI am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. \n\nIf interested, PM me! \n\nHope to rp soon!\n\n*If you read this far, comment 'Controller' somewhere in your opening message* \ud83c\udfae",

He hadn't joined out of any real expectation of adventure - it was just this, or the tin mines. \n\nHe then spent two years enforcing the Emperor's will, with the Emperor's muskets, on guileless, innocent, islander fisherfolk who didn't know a musket from a mizzenmast, and started to wonder if he wouldn't rather be in the mines.\n\nNow, Cadet Mahler and the rest of the crew of the *Ulrike* have fetched up in the remote Amara Atoll, with orders to set up the newest Palatine trading and fueling station; peaceably if possible, exterminating every islander one at a time if not. And no matter how pleasant and pliable the islanders are, the wicked Captain Graf is determined to find a reason to spill blood. He has done, everywhere else the *Ulrike* has sailed.\n\nCadet Mahler, distressed and disturbed by his comrades' attitudes, lamenting his choices in life, sneaks off on his own, into the woods. If only for a while, he must get away from them. They have been there only two days, and already Mahler fears something terrible will happen soon. But the islanders are incredibly calm, implacable. Why? What could they have up their sleeves?\n\nMahler, sweating in his uniform, cutlass dragging at his side, follows a stream uphill; and coming over a crest, finds that it ends in a still, sparkling blue pool.\n\n[PM if you have an idea for what happens next!]\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I\u2019ve had a craving to do a roleplay set in the Harry Potter universe for a while and I was wondering if anyone here would like to join me in writing one.\n\nFor the story, I don\u2019t exactly have anything planned. My character is written to be a Hogwarts student, but I\u2019d be happy to adjust him if you have a different setting in mind. Maybe we could play our characters out from First Years to Seventh Years? Maybe there\u2019s a new threat in the Magical World that our characters get somehow involved with? Maybe you\u2019d like to try an Alternate Universe story? I\u2019m open to any ideas or suggestions you can think of.\n\nConsidering characters, you\u2019re cool to play whoever. Whether that\u2019s an OC or a canon character, I don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t have any terms and conditions for OCs either. Just keep in mind that if you would like to have a romance in the story with my main character, I would prefer that you play as a female. My character will most likely be a male OC student.  \n\nOne important thing I would like to mention is that I understand that real life things are important. I won\u2019t deny that I\u2019m a bit of a slow writer myself, so if you have to take a heap of time writing out responses because of work, education or other obligations, that\u2019s fine. Please just show the same respect to me. \n\nAs for writing styles, please have decent grammar and general writing skills. You don\u2019t have to write an entire novel for each response if you don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t expect that and I can\u2019t exactly do that myself. A good paragraph is enough for me, though I\u2019d have no problem at all if you\u2019d like to write more than that, I would even encourage it. I usually write 2-3 (most of the time 2) decent paragraphs, but I\u2019m trying work on improving that stat. I also write in third person.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please DM me so we can exchange Discord usernames. I\u2019d be happy to go into more detail and you can ask me any questions you\u2019d like to. I look forward to roleplaying with you!",

Please keep in mind that I am a college student, and have classes every week day until around 3pm. My connection isn't reliable in class, so bare with me if it takes a while to send a request, or to answer you once we start talking if it's before I get home.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, as you have read above, I am looking for something detailed and long term! When I say detailed, I don't mean a handful of sentences. I mean, detailed. Haha. At least one LARGE paragraph, or hopefully many of them. I want something where it is obvious how much effort is going into the plot and relations, not just something for back and forth to keep you busy for a while. I love effort, and really seeing that my partner is enjoying the roleplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does lead into my next point, romance! I love all sorts of romances! The cute, cuddly kind. The sort where they are always at each other's throats but make up in the end. The forbidden love sort of thing but not like Romeo and Juliet. Haha Now, this also includes sexuality and roles! I can play male or female characters. I can play the one in charge, or passive. Gay, or straight. (Although I have very very little experience in lesbian. As in, one roleplay, and it was omegaverse.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have sort of been hoping to do an omegaverse roleplay, because it's been a while since I've had a good one where my partner didn't go missing. Of course, this isn't all I'm open to though! There are a bunch of roleplays that I do, it's just a matter of asking, and keep in mind that I will ask you the same thing! I don't make roleplays on my own. I always come up with plots together. You should also know, I'm not that big on fantasy based roleplays. Minimal, if any fantasy. I really only have experience with werewolves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, feel free to PM me about any ideas or pairings you enjoy! If not, you will be questioned about it over Discord. Haha. I beg that you leave your Discord tag in the PM so I will be able to send you a friend request right away if I'm interested. I really don't check Reddit enough to hold a conversation here. Haha. It's been happening more often where people don't leave their tags, and it takes a lot longer for us to start talking, because I have to wait for you to respond back with your tag, which I already asked for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny further questions or comments, leave them in the PM and I will respond either here, or on Discord. Depending on if you're still the little rascal that doesn't leave their tag so I can't send a request right away. Haha. I will talk to you then!",

I\u2019ve watched, played and read a fair amount of things, so I think I have good to great knowledge on a fair amount of universes. I\u2019m interested in a lot of themes such as drama and action so don\u2019t be afraid to pile it all on.\n\nI\u2019m pretty active, so I\u2019d like it if you were too. I understand that some things pop up, but communication is key at that point. As for details and length, I need a fair amount. 1-4 line replies just get boring extremely quick to me, so if you can\u2019t put effort into your replies then I\u2019m not for you. I\u2019m looking for at least 1 long paragraph to 2 minimum. It can be more if you need for a particular response.\n\nWhen you message me, I\u2019d like you to tell me what fandoms you were interested in playing so we can choose one we have in common,",

We are a turn-based roleplay with tabletop elements, who have been around for over two and a half years. But let\u2019s get on with Tale of Hope and War.\n\n**What is tales?** Tale of Hope &amp; War is a roleplay set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world, where only a few cities have survived and mobilized the cities themselves. The world is riddled with corruption from the gods, who have tried to invade the corporeal plane to obtain artifacts left behind by the elder gods, objects of immense power. Sadly these artifacts are also what keeps the world alive. So in order to survive mankind and other species have to become strong, strong enough to fend off the avatars of gods and perhaps the very gods themselves. For a god stepping into the corporeal plane is the cause of cataclysm.\n\nWe offer a unique system that consists of traits, skill-tree, items and guilds with unique abilities. Easy to do character creation and a helpful, friendly staff willing to aid anyone concerns they may have.\n\nIf you think this is something that you may be interested in, feel free to join and looks around. We are always happy to accept new players. Now, gather around as we tell you a Tale of Hope and War.\n\n[https://discord.gg/ZRYktSf](https://discord.gg/ZRYktSf)",

I am open to MxF and FxF pairings.\n\nSmut may be an option later, however this needs to happen after an actual romance has occurred. \n\nHere are some following scenarios I have thought of:\n\n1. (OCxOC) (FxF) This roleplay will be a classic romance, with the two characters meeting and being put into the same team. \n\n2. (OCxOC) (MxF or FxF) My OC hates faunus more than anything, however he/she is put into a team with a Faunus. This pairing causes arguments between the two, however a love/hate relationship occurs and they end up falling in love.\n\n3) (CanonxCanon) (FxF) This is just a normal canon pairing, this can be between almost any female character. Pairings that come to my mind include BlakexWeiss, and RubyxWeiss. I am strictly only open to FxF pairings for this one.\n\nThat\u2019s it really, I\u2019m open to other ideas so if you have one then drop a PM. Anyways, bye for now.",

But over time the Justice League expanded into hundreds of long time heroes and fresh new faces who want to protect the world.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s been oddly quiet...\n\nThere\u2019s been a strange overall decline in major attacks across the world and no sign of a coordinated plot by some mastermind. \n\nOne day, Wonder Woman receives an invitation to meet the leaders of Gorilla City, an isolated and hidden advances civilization. As the representative of the Amazons, she plans to go on a diplomatic mission.\n\nOf course, while she politely says she doesn\u2019t require any support, she is obliged to take a few couple Leaguers along in case things go awry. Besides, maybe they can learn a thing or two about Amazonian diplomacy.\n\nUnbeknownst to her and the Justice League, strings are being pulled from the shadows that threaten to radically transform world that we know.\n\n_______\n\nHey there.\n\nHope the blurb was a tad interesting. Me and my friend (her nickname being Zetsumei-San) want to start a 3+ sized group roleplay of the Justice League. We both grew up on the shows, esp. Justice League Unlimited, and she and I planned out a long term action adventure story that we\u2019d love to play out with others.\n\nWe haven\u2019t exactly set in stone who we\u2019d want to play though she already picked Wonder Woman and I probably will play the main villain, maybe occasionally a supporting character to help move the story along.\n\nWe highly welcome people playing existing characters OR OCs. Totally up to you. We want to give your characters character arcs too so you\u2019ll have some sort of agency and growth. We\u2019ll try to find a way to merge it into the plot.\n\nFor some actions/decisions, either me or Zetsumei will roll a dice to see if you\u2019re successful or not. We didn\u2019t want to go the whole stats route because (I personally suck at numbers XD ) we want the story to flow and such.\n\nAs for what platform, we would prefer if we could group rp this on Google Docs since it\u2019s easy to edit and collab on. But we\u2019ll see which platform people prefer to use.\n\nUntil then, PM me if you\u2019re interested. You can detail your character/superhero and preferred platform of choice. \n\nLooking forward, peeps.\n\n\n\n\n",

Please keep in mind that I am a college student, and have classes every week day until around 3pm. My connection isn't reliable in class, so bare with me if it takes a while to send a request, or to answer you once we start talking if it's before I get home.)\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, as you have read above, I am looking for something detailed and long term! When I say detailed, I don't mean a handful of sentences. I mean, detailed. Haha. At least one LARGE paragraph, or hopefully many of them. I want something where it is obvious how much effort is going into the plot and relations, not just something for back and forth to keep you busy for a while. I love effort, and really seeing that my partner is enjoying the roleplay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does lead into my next point, romance! I love all sorts of romances! The cute, cuddly kind. The sort where they are always at each other's throats but make up in the end. The forbidden love sort of thing but not like Romeo and Juliet. Haha Now, this also includes sexuality and roles! I can play male or female characters. I can play the one in charge, or passive. Gay, or straight. (Although I have very very little experience in lesbian. As in, one roleplay, and it was omegaverse.)\n\n\n\n\n\nI have sort of been hoping to do an omegaverse roleplay, because it's been a while since I've had a good one where my partner didn't go missing. Of course, this isn't all I'm open to though! There are a bunch of roleplays that I do, it's just a matter of asking, and keep in mind that I will ask you the same thing! I don't make roleplays on my own. I always come up with plots together. You should also know, I'm not that big on fantasy based roleplays. Minimal, if any fantasy. I really only have experience with werewolves.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, feel free to PM me about any ideas or pairings you enjoy! If not, you will be questioned about it over Discord. Haha. I beg that you leave your Discord tag in the PM so I will be able to send you a friend request right away if I'm interested. I really don't check Reddit enough to hold a conversation here. Haha. It's been happening more often where people don't leave their tags, and it takes a lot longer for us to start talking, because I have to wait for you to respond back with your tag, which I already asked for.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny further questions or comments, leave them in the PM and I will respond either here, or on Discord. Depending on if you're still the little rascal that doesn't leave their tag so I can't send a request right away. Haha. I will talk to you then!",

The characters listed offer a broad range for genres and scenarios. \n\nNow let's go onto the boring rules part of the post. I ask that my partner be very literate and able to write quite a bit. I absolutely love having a bunch of details. I also ask that you be open to any NSFW themes. I do enjoy not having limits to the roleplay experience since it allows me to fully involve myself in my character's role. I hope I don't sound too demanding!\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message.

I've been thinking a little bit about a fantasy world lately, and as I'm slightly inspired by my recent delve into the classic Final Fantasy games I thought about doing it in a very over-the-top fashion, without a focus knights in shining armor and dragons, although they can still be present in some sort of fashion in the setting of course. What I'm trying to get at is that I simply want something quite whimsical, although maybe we can also explore the grittiness of a world filled with magic and monsters.\n\nI already have a couple of ideas for the setting, but I'd appreciate any help you can offer when it comes to worldbuilding as I'm a bit of a beginner into making detailed universes on my own. And when it comes to the story I'm somewhat lost, and would also like a bit of help on that front.\n\nAll I'm looking for is someone literate, polite and fairly active, at least in the evening since that's when I'll probably be the least busy. Just please, please do not use text lingo or emojis, I enjoy humor and banter but we're adults.",

The dichotomy between rich and poor, influential and weak, powerful and powerless, is much more pronounced than in the real world. Decadence, cynicism and corruption are common. Humans are unwitting victims or pawns of vast secret organizations of supernatural creatures. Vampires, werewolves and wraiths\u2014among others\u2014struggle with internal factionalism and against other species in secret wars of intrigue for control of reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is State of Darkness: Washington?**\n\n\\- State of Darkness: Washington, also known as SoD:W, is a text-based discord server that uses the Classic World of Darkness lore to begin with. It consists of six 'races' or 'beings' \u2014 Mortals, Vampires, Werewolves, Mages, Demons, and Hunters \u2014 that can be played by anyone with an accepted application.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What are these races?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mortals** \\- Normal people that may or may not be gifted by superhuman abilities. These abilities may or may not surpass those of the supernatural. Those who are gifted and chosen are called to the fight against all supernaturals in however way they do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Vampires** \\- Children of the First Murderer, Caine. They are classified into either 13 clans or numerous bloodlines. Their supernatural abilities are determined by their clan or bloodline. Fire and sunlight is their main weakness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Werewolves** \\- Warriors of Gaia, the Earth and related Realms in both a physical and spiritual sense, against the servants of the Wyrm, the antagonist creatures of the werewolves, these werewolves may shift into 5 forms: Homid (human), Glabro (human with bestial features), Crinos (terrifying hybrid of human and wolf with superior strength), Hispo (prehistoric dire wolf), and Lupus (indistinguishable from a normal wolf). They are also gifted with supernatural gifts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mages** \\- Manipulators of Creation, the power of the mages are determined by their Arete rating. They are capable of learning 9 spheres or powers: Correspondence (the element of connection between different things), Entropy (the principle of chance, fate and mortality), Forces (the understanding of elemental energies), Life (the mysteries of life and death), Matter (the principles behind supposedly \u201cinanimate\u201d objects), Mind (the potentials of consciousness), Prime (the understanding of the Primal Energy within all things), Spirit (the comprehension of otherworldly forces and inhabitants), and Time (strange workings of chronological forces and perceptions).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Demons** \\- The demons are angels who have fell due to their act of rebellion against God for their love to humanity, their most precious creation.

            "selftext": "So, there's a little \"taster\" after this, if you'd like to check out my writing and if we'd fit together. It's relatively long, so... you know. Be safe.\n\nAnyway, I had a shit day at school (and by a school, I mean uni, so we're clear at what age group I am), like ridiculously and the last few weeks weren't great either. And I need something to unwind. And well, some sweet roleplay would be nice. I don't mean necessarily romance or something like that. And of course, drama and action are needed from time to time just to push the plot forward. But other than that I just want something chill and sweet and pleasant.\n\nI don't mind short term stuff, and it's possible from my point of view. It's just I don't know, would prefer something longer, possibly slowly paced. I do have a lot of things on my mind. But if you'd like something short, just for that emergency good feeling, hey, feel free to hit me up anyway.\n\nI don't mind any genre. I do have a soft craving for fantasy or sci-fi and have some plot ideas set aside for basically anything. Some of them, I'd like to try. Some of them, I tried already and loved them and would love to do them again.\n\nThe sex can be as detailed as you want it to be. I usually write it pretty descriptive, but hey, if you'd prefer we'd \"fade to black,\" I've got no quarrel with that. Also, it can be as kinky as you'd like. Wholesomeness and kinkiness are not disjunctive terms. I'll yell if I don't like something.\n\nAbout me: I'm a 2X guy from Europe, so English is not my first language. Sorry for any typos or just weird grammar, do yell at me. I'm willing to play any pairing, and I don't mind playing women if you're into that.\n\n**Kinks:** Light bondage, biting, scratching, being cared for &amp; caring for\n\n**Turnoffs:** Bestiality, way too many bodily fluids, unnecessary drama\n\n***\nWe look each other nervously in the eyes. This nervousness isn't born out of unwillingness or inexperience. God knows we both had our fair share of adventures with other people. And we both genuinely want this. It's not a pure alcoholic lust, though to be fair, alcohol does play a role in pushing us toward honesty in our emotions. \n\nNo, this nervousness is just due to the unusual nature of the situation we find ourselves in. We were steadfast friends for a good part of the last few years. Sometimes arguing to blood, sure. Shit, we spent an entire three months ignoring each other because of minor argument. But in the end, these arguments probably made our relationship stronger. We were steadfast through and through. Whenever you felt like the world was too much, you knew I would understand, and the same worked the other way. There never was any romantic feeling between us. We both, without the need to say it, just agreed that it would be best to keep it friendly. \n\nWhich is why this is so weird. You, sitting next to me. Me, tracing my fingertips gently across your jawline while looking into your eyes. I lust after you and judging by your heavy breathing, I seem to be inducing some very similar feelings in you. My desire to own you, your desire to own me. The need to own and be owned is suddenly way, way stronger than ever before, with anyone else.\n\n\"Perhaps... I should go and-\" I start talking and maybe that pushes you over the edge. Your warm, soft lips, suddenly on mine. I can't help but moan into the kiss and helplessly scratch your back before slowly accepting that I won't sleep much this night.\n\n\nThe whole things are simultaneously over too quickly and take seemingly forever. My back aches from your nails digging just everywhere. I'm pretty sure they split the skin somewhere also, not that I mind. We talked a few times about our ideal sex. And while we often joke about how we'd fit together, with the whole \"the kinkier the better\" deal, while not going too crazy, that was it \u2014 a jest.\n\nEven then the sex is... unbelievably good. We fit like two cogwheels, specially made for each other. Dominant and submissive, we just kinda naturally switch between them over the course of our intercourse (I do love my puns), before our *la petite mort* comes for us and at least my world shatters to million pieces.\n\nI'm getting together slowly and your gentle rubbing of my back does help. I smile weakly. \"Well... that was fun.\" And as I look into your eyes, something changes. After all... neither one of us is one for one night stands. \"Should I make the coffee?\"",

            "selftext": " I've been pretty much just copy pasting this into any rp subreddit I find in hopes that somebody will message me lol\n\nRather      than reposting my old RP prompts, I'm going to combine them into  one     post instead and maybe even add some new ones as I repost this  every   few   days.\n\nAlso I just started a  new   group chat on kik for people like me who like Combat/Military  themed   roleplays, I'm thinking of making it either one big roleplay  group or a   sort of hub where people can meet other people to partner  with and  their  own roleplays in PMs, message me if you're interested!\n\n**Prompt #1: Battle of Stalingrad Roleplay**\n\nI        thought of doing a RP that takes place  during the battle of        Stalingrad.  My character being the only survivor  of my unit find        myself face to face with German soldier who is also in  the same        predicament.  The question is what now?  I was thinking maybe  my        character tries to kill your character, but is unable to due to her   gun       being jammed/out of ammo, and perhaps your character do the  same.   I       already have a character made up that would definitely  fit the   role   and    since she herself is already Russian it makes it  better.    If by   any    chance you know of a better way to stay the  roleplay   please let   me  know.    I'm fine with smut but honestly I'm  looking   for an RP  with a   decent   story and plenty of action, also  due to the   fact I've  been   getting kinda   burnt out of strictly  smut RPs.\n\n**Prompt #2: Post World War II Roleplay**\n\nHiroshima,         1945.  America has just dropped  bombs on both Nagasaki and       Hiroshima.   A  few months pass and whilst  searching the rubble your       squad finds a   underground research lab under  the ruins of the    Genbaku    Dome.  There  you  find many weapon and vehicle  prototypes    and    blueprints but most   importantly, a girl.  She is no  normal    girl.     They seemed to have fused   the DNA of a cat with a human,  to    make some    kind of super soldier.   All  of the scientists are   either   dead or    have fled and the only  instructions  are some books   left  behind.      Naturally she is sent back  to the states  for   testing and  study.\n\nWhen      she   arrives,  the  doctors discuss something about dissecting her,        figuring out how  she  came to be, obviously that would kill and you        wouldn't want  that.  but  what do you do? convince them to let her    live     and  discover her own  abilities?  Or perhaps take her away  and   try to      escape!  Also if you don't want a setting in Japan it  can   always  take    place in Germany too (It'd kinda make more sense  too   seeing the     character I wanna use for this RP IS German)\n\n**Prompt #3: Horror World War I or II Roleplay**\n\nI    saw a trailer for a movie a while back, it  took place  during world    war one where a bunch of soldiers find these  horrible  monstrosities    that were once normal men and I have to fight  them off  (Trench 11 I    believe it was called) think of like Call of Duty  Zombies  meets John    Carpenters \"The Thing\", it could either take place  during  world war    one or two and I think it would make for a very  interesting  story.\n\n**Prompt #4: Half Life Roleplay**\n\nChanging      gears from all the war themed RPs, Half Life is possibly one of my      favorite video games, ever, but I've never really thought of doing a   RP    about it.  There are some rules to this RP however, you can't be   any  of   the characters from the first \"Trilogy\" (that means no   Freeman,   Shepard  or even Barney) I'd rather make up our own   characters than use   existing  ones, besides the first two don't even   talk in the game so   it'd be  pretty odd if only one of us spoke.  You   can be part of any of   the  \"factions\" in the first game (HECU,   Scientists/Security Guards,   Xen,  Race X) the plot can range from just   simply trying to escape the    facility to something more complex.\n\n**\\*NEW\\* Prompt #5: Valkyria Chronicles Roleplay**\n\nI   just got back into the VC series recently after discovering a new game    had come out.  Although I haven't had a chance to play the new game  I'm   fairly familiar with the first game (I watched the anime before   playing  the game and recently have gotten back into playing the first   game.)  I've already met someone who is into VC and likes to roleplay   which is  what made me want to make this post.  As far as plot goes it   could go a  number of different ways.  maybe I and your character could   be part of  Squad 7 from the first game.  Maybe we could do a complete   one eighty  and see the battlefield through the eyes of the Imperials.    Or maybe I  could create my very own faction separate from the ones in   the game.  If  the last choice is more your thing, I'm currently  working  on that.  I  have a number of different characters I can use  for this  rp, each having  their own unique traits and personalities.   Of course I  could just  always play one of the story characters too.\n\n**\\*NEW\\* Girls und Panzer Roleplay**\n\nRecently  decided to watch GuP again, I haven't seen the anime in about four  years since I've seen it so if you are interested I might be a little  rusty, I've also gained interest in this due to my recent interest in  War Thunder again.  The plot can follow show and feature the characters  from the show, or could feature it's own separate plot with your own  characters.\n\nThat's       all I have so  far, I'll probably be reposting this in day or two   and     hopefully  have new ideas on the board.  I kinda had something in    mind    about  Soviet Invasion taking place in the 1980's, kinda like   Red  Dawn     but from the Russian perspective and also not based on the    shitty   remake   either.\n\nIf you are interested hit me up at **sgtsnazzy1.**  As I stated before I'm not really looking for smut, a little is fine but I want some good solid action.\n\nI am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+",

            "selftext": "Hello! Lately I've had a few different ideas/settings rattling around that I just can't seem to drop, and hopefully one/some of them resonate with you. First things first, though, I'd like to work out something medium-long term, with a fair bit of worldbuilding and such going on. You'll see that I have some deep interests in exploration. I generally like some buildup, but tend to work with my partner.  I've listed this as NSFW - while we don't need to get into the smutty side of things, I'm interested in testing those waters.  I haven't done much writing of that type at all and I would like to try it out some time.  I can't stress enough, however, that it does not need to be a central plot point - or one at all.\n\nOn that note, especially if we're doing something with perhaps an overarching story or with a fair bit of worldbuilding, I very much want to encourage OOC communication - I feel it makes everything much easier, and more interesting for us both. To better facilitate that, if we really kick things off here on reddit I'm open to moving to easier mediums such as Google Docs, Discord, or something along those lines.\n\nOn the actual nitty-gritty storytelling side of things, I tend to write several detailed paragraphs involving my character's actions, and possible NPC actions/reactions. Length obviously varies, however. I'm partial to shorter responses when we're both around and longer if there'll be a bit of a lag time. I'm comfortable with some minor maneuvering done to my character by my partner, but that's obviously something that comes up as we get on each other's wavelengths. I prefer writing in third person, and include my character's thoughts as well as actions to give context/story.\n\nI know that most people who are looking for what I am tend to have samples of their writing, but you'll have to trust me on that front! This is already long enough as it is, and I haven't even talked about my prompts. If you're interested in any of them, feel free to toss me a message and we can work out a quick spiel to test the waters. Anyways, on to the show:\n\n1 - The Stars. As you might've guessed, this one revolves around a science fiction setting with heavy themes of exploration and discovery. As to what we discover, that could be up for debate. Actual aliens that can talk to us? Lush planets? Nothing but new corners of our ship?\n\n2 - The Sea. Essentially the first prompt, but a fantasy take on the Age of Discovery. More air, more seawater.\n\n3 - The Snow. Neat naming trend I've got going on, right? This one's inspired by Frostpunk - essentially the world has been plunged into a disastrous ice age, brought about by some sort of steampunk-y apocalypse. The survivors from our city have banded together to head to a massive generator near the pole, formerly used for arctic expeditions, which produces enough heat for us to begin to rebuild.\n\n4 - The Miscellaneous. Yeah I ruined the trend, but I think it's important to say that, most of all, I just want to get writing with an interesting, compatible partner. By now I think you've got a bit of an idea of my more prominent interests and writing style, so if you're interested in starting something up, but aren't a fan of my proposed settings, send me a message anyway! Just because I plopped down three jumping-off points doesn't mean that those are the only places where diving's permitted. And besides, who's ever paid attention to 'no diving' signs anyway?\n",

            "selftext": "**Hey my fellow RPers!**\n\nI am looking for roleplayers who would be interested in a long term RP. When it comes to experience I am fine with someone who has been roleplaying for only a day all the same with someone who has been roleplaying for over 10 years. When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Historical Realism\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

            "selftext": "So Mrs. Goodwitch. I see you have something to show me by those documents you have?\" Ozpin said as he was leaning in his chair at his desk as Glynda stood before him with a cream file cradled in her arms. She slid it onto his desk in front of him and he opened the file and his eyes looked over it for a few moments. \"What's the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"Sir, the incidents involving the white fang around the academy have spiked in recent years. Even leading to the full shootout near the school not that long ago. I'm getting concerned for the students safety.\" She said as she started spreading the contents of the file about the desk to point out key issues of the attacks and specific events. She last pointed to the one where Miss. Rose was at, the dust store robbery.\n\n\"Glynda. The students will have to learn sooner or later. And if they don't well. That's their burden to bear. And even then, they will learn, and eventually overcome.\" He said calmly as he picked up his mug.\n\n\"But what if they launch a full scale attack? They've been getting some pretty high tech weaponry as of late. They got a new funder. The students couldn't defend themselves from Atlassian tech.\" She said with a bit of a worried tone that was dripping into her normal voice.\n\nOzpin paused for a moment and stopped raising his mug to his lips. \"Then we fight. We'll call in who we can. We have a few hunters posted here. They can probably get his team here at the least. Team EMBR hopefully. They might know whats happening up there. Even then, its a school full of ambitious kids with a fighting spirit.\" He said looking to a few pictures of teams past. Finally landing on the picture of team STRQ. Seeing the two decedents that landed in the academy in the picture as well. \"They'll be fine. We best look into this funder though. It's not Salem, too high profile. So who could it be.....\"\n\nSo, as for details, this is an RP that is accepting both Cannon and OC characters. We'll be following a modified story-line from cannon and we'll be starting off at Volume 1. This RP is ran and managed by three people, myself and two others, and we come up with ideas but feel more than welcome to shoot your own ideas at us. We don't have any cannon characters at the moment so if you want to play one feel welcome. I should also mention that we primarily operate in EST for events. So please be prepared to adjust RP times if you live outside EST. Sorry to those who live on the other side of the world.\n\nHere's the group link, we hope to see you soon: [https://discord.gg/yS56Z7n](https://discord.gg/yS56Z7n)",

The roleplay is on discord, as it will eventually involve multiple kingdoms and countries as it did before. It currently only has a handful of people, but we are looking to expand. If you are interested, you can join through this link: https://discord.gg/UHn5zqQ\nThis is a literate roleplay, and what I mean by literate is that you don't sound like an infant when you post. I don't care how many lines your post has so long as it gets the indicated point across. As the title suggests, it's a medieval fantasy roleplay, and plenty of logic is explained in the server. I am also willing to answer any questions you might have after you read up on what i've already written down. If you join the server to read on the logic and lore only to decide the rp isn't for you, no harm no foul. You are not prevented from leaving. Thank you all for your time.",

Instead of wallowing I figured it couldn't hurt to give this subreddit a try (even though in general reddit is very intimidating for me) \n\nI'm not looking for anything specific really.  I find fun in creating plots/universes/characters with a partner so it fits whatever the mood is for both parties. Whether it is fantasy or horror, or whatever else. Though - I do lean HARD towards fantastical plots rather than realistic things. \n\nI like to think I'm generally chill, but I do get enthusiastic about things. I love talking OOC with my RP partners and do genuinely wish to get along outside if the RP. It makes for better and more fun storytelling.\n\nI only have a few catches though.  \n\nThe first being is that I require my RP partners to be 18+. This isn't for the sake of anything NSFW (which can be discussed as we go along)  but for the fact that I am 23. I just don't feel comfortable RPing with anyone who isn't also an adult. Sorry!\n\nSecond - I don't expect novel-length, frequently, and constantly grammatically correct posts. I have a life and 40-hour work week outside of Discord. I get it. (Also demanding perfect grammar and spelling all the time has always rubbed me the wrong way. We're having fun - not writing a book.)   But I would like a paragraph or two at minimum. Maybe a couple days a week if that's what your life allows. \n\nThe last is that I just want respect on both sides in and out of roleplay. This should be the easiest and most \"duh\" stipulation I have. \n\nPM if interested! Any questions you have I'll answer too. Thanks!",

I\u2019m happy to do the same so we can make battle sequences more interesting.\n\nPlease message me your discord name and a quick character description including which region you\u2019d like this RP to take place in (anywhere but Johto)\n\nNo canon characters for your main and no fake regions/Pok\u00e9mon. \n\nRealistically, my team would be around level 50 so fully evolved and well trained.

JUST DM ME :)\\**\n\nI  am  32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job  during  the week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is  to  roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI   play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as   intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters   (IRL gender doesn't matter).\n\nPlease be   prepared for picture usage. I've done writing descriptions for a while,   but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would   prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real   pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some   animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some   fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC   (especially Arrowverse/MCU), Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon   Age, etc. Anything else unlisted is better to bring them my way and see   if I know them. If any above appeal, feel free to come my way.\n\nSome   literacy at a minimum makes me happy, third person only, past tense. I   am also VERY reasonable with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I  am  very nice, I promise, and I want to get niceties out of people in  turn.  Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a  chance!  Treat people the way you want to be treated, right?\n\nI   do work during the day, so posting will be sporadic, but I am good at   night and on weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for   people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day   or more.\n\nI am usually on from sometime   in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play   sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours. I   hope to talk to all of you soon! :)\n\n***Current   Desire: I am really interested in the \"intersex opposite a female\"   perspective. Modern is a big medium I could see following through. I   have ideas involving that most festive time of the year where romance is   the least one can expect to find among many other things. There's also  supernatural angles such as \"a goddess walks the Earth to find a  worshipper,\" or a ghost gives the friendliest haunt to her new tenant,  or a witch finds odd romance in the style of Bewitched or Practical  Magic or Simply Irresistible. Please  message me for this or any other  ideas above in the post!***",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am fresh to reddit but not to the role-playing world. I have been doing this from almost four and a half years. You can surely label me as a descriptive, detailed and creative roleplayer. Being a 21+ male, I usually play male characters opposite a female and would continue this for now. I can think of doing a female character opposite another female though. So if you are down for the latter, it's alright.\n\nI am looking for people who would be able to play female characters, can write one to two paragraphs per reply and even more if required. I have done alot of romance and love-hate relationships. Also, I stick to slice of life plots with drama and twists included. We can do medivial or present time settings whereas I will avoid future based stories. Fantasy can be present but alot of it doesn't attract me. If you have any plot(s) which fall into the criteria, I will be very happy to discuss it. No need to be sad if you don't have any plot. I have written five of them and they all can be converted into long term roleplays. We can surely brainstorm for something completely new. I am open to other ideas as well, shoot me a message and hope for the positive. :)\n\nI have no problem in including sexuality in my stories. We can discuss it further personally.\n\nPlease do contact me if you are someone who adore role-playing. I can adjust and fulfill your demands. You just need to write with quality as a female character. Contact me on via reddit and we will have a discussion which can lead us to any other platform. Also, try to write some basic information about you or your role-playing style in the opening message. It doesn't need to be very lengthy but first impression really matters and you know that. I am super friendly. Short term roleplay requests are also welcome but I will be only doing one or two of them.\n\nI am looking forward to meet and plan about our roleplay with you. Please feel free to ask questions if you have any. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "*I typically get an overflow of responses when I post these, so please read all the way through and make sure that you think we would mesh pretty well! Thanks!*\n\nHi! I'm a 21+ dude living in the USA (West Coast, in particular). I've taken an extended break from writing lately due to how busy I've been but I've **really** been missing it. So, I'll tell you a bit about myself and what I'm looking for, and I would appreciate it if you did the same!\n\nFor starters, I'm currently only working part-time. I'm working at a gym in sales for the time being, however I'm also currently studying to become a personal trainer, so I'll likely be doing that within the coming months! With that in mind, that means that I also typically train a lot at my gym. If you can't add those three things up, I spend an *absurd* amount of time at the gym. Too much, actually. But, on the bright side, I always have my laptop with me! \n\nAs a writer (and roleplayer), I can't stand waiting days for replies. You'll get no less than five responses from me in a day, although you can easily pull at least twenty out of me if my day isn't too compact! I don't ask that you reply at the same frequency, but if you're more of a 'once or twice a day' kind of person, we probably won't go well together! I write in the third person (obviously) and I'll typically respond with one-hundred to eight-hundred words, depending on the situation. That's a vague number, I know, but it's situational! I swear!\n\nMoving on from that, I am a DM. Don't know what that means? It's an old term taken from Dungeons &amp; Dragons meaning 'Dungeon Master'. Essentially, it means that I'd be in total control of the universe around your character. It allows you to fulfill more of a protagonist role in the RP and focus entirely on reacting to decisions and trying to achieve something, rather than trying to build a cooperative story. It's a lot like having your own private table-top RPG or text-based video game. It's fun! I can explain it to you more in-detail, and I can easily make changes to my system so that it's more adaptable for you!\n\nNow, genres and settings. I'm very open-minded here but I have a few ideas I've been dying to try out forever. I do prefer to use OC's, and I'd love to do an original/modern-day setting for once, but I'll list some of the ideas I have below (not in any particular order).\n\n* Star Wars (The Old Republic, Clone Wars)\n* Half-Life (Please, god, I'll love you forever)\n* World of Warcraft\n* Dishonored\n* XCOM\n\nAnd some original ideas!\n\n* Modern day Police/Crime Drama\n* Fantasy Young Adult Academy (Like Harry Potter, but less family friendly!)\n* Semi-Historical Vampire/Supernatural\n* Semi-Futuristic World War 3 (Maybe with robots!)\n* Wild West Story (I've been playing a lot of Red Dead Redemption.)\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, feel free to send me a message!

Usually I\u2019m the one scrolling through all of these posts, so it\u2019s weird to be on the other end of this. \nAnyways, if you\u2019ve clicked on this, it\u2019s hopefully because you\u2019re interested in a slice of life roleplay, so let\u2019s talk about that. \nI\u2019m not looking for fantasy, or science fiction, or anything of the sort. I\u2019m definitely, 100% looking for a slice of life (probably romance) roleplay. That doesn\u2019t mean that it has to be boring! Because I would actually prefer it not to be boring, believe it or not (wow sarcasm I\u2019m so funny I know). I love a good plot, with character development etc, etc. \n\nI\u2019d prefer the responses to be at least one meaty paragraph, if not more. I\u2019m not down for a one-liner response. We\u2019re creating a story here!\n\nLastly, my (very loose, simple) criteria for a good roleplay partner:\n1. No older than... let\u2019s say... 22? Yeah. \n2. Some experience would be nice, but as long as you\u2019re confident in your abilities I think we\u2019ll be good. \n3. Chill out. Don\u2019t be uptight. We\u2019re having fun, doing something we enjoy! As you can probably tell, I\u2019m not here trying to take anything too seriously. \nBeyond that, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much more to say. \nSend me a message if you\u2019re interested!\n\nSage x\n",

I go to school full time and work on the weekends, so my plate is quite full. However, I'm looking for someone who will be able to fire off several replies over the course of a day, so I have something to look forward to throughout the mornings, afternoons and evenings!\n\nI only ask a few things of you -\n\n\\- you are 18+\n\n\\- you're comfortable with playing the male character to my female character\n\n\\- you write in third person only\n\n\\- you will either roleplay over PMs or email\n\n\\- you are in it long term. If you're no longer interested, please just let me know.\n\n\\- your writing is considered above average or advanced. I'm well-written and I hope you are too.\n\n\\- you are able to write out sexual or violent details (and hey, if you want pure smut/NSFW roleplay, I'm cool with that too.)\n\n\\- you're comfortable with romantic elements to our roleplay. In fact, I prefer it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm open to just about anything modern. Please give me a suggestion if you're craving something in particular but a slice of life with a fun twist on it or anything that will provide anger, angst, and tension is even better. Fandoms can get a little tricky but I'm a huge Game of Thrones fan! Let me know what you'd like! Send me a PM with a little snippet about you and what you'd like to roleplay.

            "selftext": " Hey there, I'm looking for a partner interested in some fandom roleplaying. I got a lot of fandoms, so much in fact that it'd probably take forever to list every single one. If you don't see something, please don't feel afraid to ask! I will respond regardless, letting you know so you're not left in the dark about it.\n\nLength has never really been a problem for me, I can match to yours. Two sentences to a paragraph is perfectly fine, I think several paragraphs is a bit too much for me though. I respect the people who can properly manage that, but for me I end up struggling after ten posts and get a bit of writer's block.\n\nAs far as fandoms go, ask me what I'd like to do or feel free to suggest your own ideas. And yes, I can double!\n\nNow as for what I am looking for... CanonxOC or CanonxCanon. It depends on the fandom. And I'm looking for people that like to do nsfw themes. And people who like to do plot. If you can manage both, that's perfect!\n\nAnd one final thing; I'm not asking you to post every day, but I do want it to be consistent. If you're going to be busy for a few days or a week, please tell me. When most people disappear for a week, it looks like they ghosted. It's real hard to distinguish between the two so I ask for a little communication. I'll do the same, I can usually reply daily but stuff happens\n\nAnd now for the fandoms. I am willing to do crossovers, yes.\n\nPokemon - The big one, I got plenty of ideas for one! I tend to favor the latter generations more than the first two though so fair warning. I've been a fan of Pokemon since I was really young so I know a lot about it, been roleplaying it for about 12 years as well. A Pokemon rp was my first experience with roleplaying actually!\n\nNaruto\n\nMarvel and DC - I actually like both.... I do have a crossover idea I've been meaning to do at some point.\n\nSaints Row\n\nMass Effect\n\nScooby Doo\n\nTotal Drama\n\nSonic the Hedgehog\n\nMario\n\nYugioh\n\nFallout\n\nRed Dead Redemption - This is one I really want to do as well\n\nHarry Potter\n\nStar Wars\n\nBen 10\n\nAdventure Time\n\nAlright, now as for where the roleplay will take place. I'd prefer Discord but I can manage other methods. I think that's everything, so if you're interested please feel free to message me!",

This server is called The Roleplay Lounge and has a bunch of features that I think you and I would enjoy. \n\nIn the Roleplay Lounge, you can talk about topics related to Roleplaying or not. There are channels dedicated to **Roleplay Discussion** which allow you to talk about topics related to your fictional characters, plot ideas, give each other hints on how to write your posts and look for RPers to RP with. Additionally, we have Roleplay Servers connected to this one which our members can use. We can provide two types of Role-play servers:  \n**Open-World** \\- which are your usual Discord Servers where the lore discusses how the world of which the server is based in works and looks like and allows the RPer to make their own story within that world  \n*and*  \n**One-offs** \\- which are stories with a set storyline/goal/plot, a member cap and a possible RP skill requirement. \n\nJust by filling in a single application, our members can create and hosts servers in The Roleplay Lounge providing the server with new Role-play servers and allowing you to share and create your ideas with others without the hassle of advertising and setting up the server, at least when it comes to making that lore for a Discord Server. :P  \n\n\nWe also provide other extra features:\n\n1. **Topic Discussion** \\- where people can make channels based on other things, other than RPing. It doesn't really need to be a \"topic\" so the possibilities are seemingly endless, as long as the channel has something for the members to do or talk about.\n2. [**Rabb.it**](https://Rabb.it) **Cinema** \\- [Rabb.it](https://Rabb.it) is a brilliant website where people can browse the internet and watch movies and videos with others. We just made a feature in our server by making a category allowing members to share their room links.\n3. **Gaming Channel** \\- An extra category allowing Roleplayers to play the games they love with other Roleplayers.\n4. **StoryBoards** \\- Where people can write and share pieces of writing to other members  \nAnd *much more..!*  \n\n\nThe Roleplay Lounge is a new community server and I'd appreciate if you'd join, no matter what type of Role-player you are. We are looking for Staff members also who will be dedicated enough to help us build this server from the ground up.

Im not perfect in the way i write nor do i expect you to be.\n\n\nSo that being said i\u2019ll lay out a basic plot idea that we can of course adjust and change based on whatever we can come up with. \n\n\nI\u2019ll be playing a inspector/detective after a recent promotion. After a rough time with the loss of my wife and child i shy\u2019d away. Changing from a positive happier person into a much more cynical frustrated man. Thats where we\u2019d meet your character. A fresh faced straight out of police academy girl who is full of life and joyus. \n\n\nOver time a romance would build between the two even if they argue and fight in the beginning eventually they will build to care and fall for each other. All of this is of course up for discussion so dont be afraid to message with changes. Contact me if you\u2019re interested\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm looking for people interested in some fandom roleplaying. I got a lot, so much in fact that it'd probably take forever to list every single one. If you don't see something, please don't feel afraid to ask! I will respond regardless, letting you know so you're not left in the dark about it.\n\nLength has never really been a problem for me, I can match to yours. Two sentences to a paragraph is perfectly fine, I think several paragraphs is a bit too much for me though. I respect the people who can properly manage that, but for me I end up struggling after ten posts and get a bit of writer's block.\n\nAs far as fandoms go, ask me what I'd like to do or feel free to suggest your own ideas. And yes, I can double!\n\nNow as for what I am looking for... CanonxOC or CanonxCanon. It depends on the fandom. And I'm looking for people that like to do nsfw themes. And people who like to do plot. If you can manage both, that's perfect!\n\nAnd one final thing; I'm not asking you to post every day, but I do want it to be consistent. If you're going to be busy for a few days or a week, please tell me. When most people disappear for a week, it looks like they ghosted. It's real hard to distinguish between the two so I ask for a little communication. I'll do the same, I can usually reply daily but stuff happens\n\nAnd now for the fandoms. I am willing to do crossovers, yes.\n\nPokemon - The big one, I got plenty of ideas for one! I tend to favor the latter generations more than the first two though so fair warning. I've been a fan of Pokemon since I was really young so I know a lot about it, been roleplaying it for about 12 years as well. A Pokemon forum was where I first started roleplaying\n\nNaruto\n\nMarvel and DC - I actually like both.... I do have a crossover idea I've been meaning to do at some point.\n\nSaints Row\n\nMass Effect\n\nScooby Doo\n\nTotal Drama\n\nSonic the Hedgehog\n\nMario\n\nYugioh\n\nFallout\n\nRed Dead Redemption - This is one I really want to do as well\n\nHarry Potter\n\nStar Wars\n\nBen 10\n\nAdventure Time\n\nAlright, now as for where the roleplay will take place. I'd prefer Discord but I can handle other methods if you prefer different. I think that's everything, so if you're interested please feel free to message me!",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Beth, I am 18 and in search of a partner! I have been roleplaying for a few years now.  \n\n\nI write in first POV, and average 2-5 paragraphs (generally around three). Although for starters, I tend to write quite a lot to set the scene. I\u2019m looking for someone who will be able to consistently write as much as me. One of my least favourite things is when I write 3 paragraphs, and I get one in reply. I love detail. \n\n\nI also tend to play characters who are more uh...morally compromised. I like to play action, crime, some romance.  I have OC roles, in crime, sci-fi (mutants, think X-men), post-apocalyptic. \n\n\nI\u2019m pretty strict on grammar and spelling, but everyone makes mistakes sometimes! I also do not like or engage in asterisk rp. It isn\u2019t my personal style. I will provide a sample of my own rping style if you would like, as I usually ask for one from you as well. \n\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who can reply at least once a day. Ideally someone who has at least six months experience. I would like someone within ten years of my own age, if that is ok. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to drone on.\nMessage me if this sounds interesting! Looking forward to hearing from you.\n",

            "selftext": "A storm in winter was not uncommon--As the humid air of the mainland met with the more frigid drifts of the sea, one could often anticipates bouts of rampant snow, and the low, ominous rumble of thunder in the middle of the night. \n\nWe knew of the bright flashes in the midst of the evening, where the gray canopy above was illuminated by the furious bolts making passage. Even the cacophonous booms of such brilliant light had no longer frightened us. We were confident we had come to know our place, in this little cove so near the sea. \n\nThe night was as any other, when a storm arose within the darkness and lightning flashed amid the newly fallen snows. The lumps of swiftly forming droves merely a participant, a new witness, for what was to come. The thunder rumble, but in cadence--footfalls upon the horizon, timed in sequence--their syncopation hidden beneath the booming of the skies above. Their torches obfuscated in the clamor of tumultuous skies. \n\nIf it were not for the winter, more might have burned--If it were not for the darkness, we might have seen sooner. Our oppressors arrived readied, with blades sharpened and hearts hardened--thoughtless of who might come seeking from their homesteads when the ruckus began to arise. Some were swift, their bare feet gnawed upon by the crunch of frigid ground beneath them as they sprinted out into the night.  Others were not so swift, their wails adjoined the gales of wind, the ringing of steel within the night, the snaps of the night as new towering columns of brilliant light were formed. \n\nThose that lived were offered little options--to fight valiantly and die frigid and alone--or to yield and be bound, to march among the dead with the usurpers that rose against us. Peace was vanquished swiftly, and turmoil swiftly thereafter--now, there is only the cold, and this storm that still goes on above.\n\nWe march in droves, driven to single lines and set upon at all sides by our armored captors. Those that ran are merely oblong forms shuffled beneath the freshly fallen white now. At times, their moans penetrate the stagnant air, only to be hushed by an arrow whistling through the night. \n\nFeet are bloodied and fingers go black in time, those of age wilt swiftly, the children are swift to go after. Their grand assortment of captives fades rapidly as those enfeebled or injured fall to the wayside and only the able bodied remain. The snow ceases, but not the thunder--even now, their feet fall in time with it, speeding briefly as it churns within the night, only to soften with care as the silence returns. Even nature has come to accord with those that would see us enslaved.\n\nThere is only the hope for morning now, when warmth might once against greet us--and we might see the face of those who have defied tranquility beneath the cover of a storm.\n\n\n____ _____\n\n____\n____\n\nHi there! \n\nI'm currently looking for a writer to help me continue to craft the little snippet above. The general premise is that a peaceful coastal city was ramsacked by invaders during the night. We have a multitude of options with which to move forward. \n\nWill we play a pair of the captured? Seeking to escape from their captors and fighting against the elements along the way? Perhaps we are set upon both sides, with one of us serving with the invading army and our fight becomes with empathy as we find ourselves presented with the faces of those wronged? Maybe some whisper of starting an uprising, making a stand with nearby allies when war finds us. I would adore collaborating with my partner to determine what they might enjoy in storytelling, what pairings might garner their interest, and what events they might envision transpiring as the story goes on.\n\nI am in the CST timezone, I make frequent replies. I would consider myself friendly and welcoming OOC and collaborating and worldbuilding are some of my favorite things outside of character development and design.\n\nI am LGBQTIA friendly but most frequently play Male identifying characters on my part.\n\nI would prefer to write through Reddit PMs or Emails. \n\nI often post between 300 and 2000 words, given circumstance and events transpiring in character. I do not mind shorter and more focused posts for the purpose of continuing the pace in writing.\n\n\n\n",

We can change things around or keep it the same! \n\nZeus, the king of the gods, had decided that the gods and goddesses did not have much of an appreciation for mankind. He told them they had all become selfish with their godhood, and that they had no respect for the mortals.\n\nSo, every god in the pantheon was turned into mortals. Their ages all became similar - being around the high school/college age. \n\nAnd Artemis was no exception. \n\nEach god and goddess was no longer immortal, but they did keep some of their powers. Poseidon could swim really well, and could hold his breath for much longer than others. Aphrodite could \u201cpersuade\u201d people more easily. Artemis was excellent in archery, and she could talk to animals. \n\nSide notes:\nThis will be a romance based plot. My character will be an art student who loves nature just as much as Artemis herself. Eventually, the two fall in love. \n\nWe could keep this rp completely clean, or add some nsfw to it. \n\nWe could add a bigger storyline to it! For example, someone takes advantage of the fact the gods are now human, and tries to kill off nature. Artemis, even as a human, tasked herself with trying to stop it. My character wanted to assist. \n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, shoot me a message! I prefer to rp on discord or on Kik. Hope to see you soon! ",
