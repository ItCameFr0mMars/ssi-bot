I do have a busy life but I will frequently reply and I will not ghost. That is my biggest pet peeve if your not happy or wish not to role play any more just be upfront.\n\nSo most of my themes are mature so someone over 18 please. Other than that I am not picky about my partner, just someone who likes to get into their character and build a awesome roleplay.\n\nSome of my Story Line Ideas but please if you have your own throw them out there:\n\nScenario One: I am the host of a conspiracy theory podcast, there isn't anything my character does not believe in. He is a serious pain in local law enforcement's butt. Your character is a cop who takes her job seriously, and has no time for my characters bs. Until some weird stuff starts happening, maybe your boss requires my assistance, maybe your character decides to ask me.\n\nScenario Two: Your an archaeologist out on a dig wherever in the world and my character is your assigned security escort. Some hinky %$%$ goes down and they have to survive together\n\nScenerio three: Old west theme, your the sheriffs daughter im an outlaw..\n\nIf none of those scenarios don't float your boat....\n\nLets be bikers, pirates, vikings, etc. I like dark flawed characters, horror, suspense, historical romance. I am not into fantasy or science fiction.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

I\u2019m a security analyst for my profession, and I love gaming, crafts, caring for animals, and technology.\n\nI\u2019m very casual and adaptive, so I like all sorts of styles and lengths of replies! I would additionally really love an OOC chat, I want to make a friend!\n\n**Availability:** \nDaily (except for extreme circumstances/emergencies, of course! but I\u2019m flexible to YOUR schedule)\n\n**Length:** \nAny - though I usually range from 1-2 short paragraphs. I like several RPs, so setting up multiple channels for different stories is also something I like doing. I like one-offs (short) and long term RPs.\n\n**Theme:** \nAny - I can do horror, smut, one offs, plot heavy, angst, etc.\n\n**Fandoms:** \nYou can view a list of pairings by fandoms here: https://mothsjournal.tumblr.com/seeking\n\nThose that know me already don\u2019t need this, but I am extremely flexible. If you see a fandom or character you like but not the pairing, or even don\u2019t see a fandom here, please just ask! I\u2019m forgetful and this list really isn\u2019t at all exhaustive.\n\n**Characters:**\nI have several OCs. Some, but not all, are listed here: https://mothsjournal.tumblr.com/chars\n\n**Ships:** \nMxM (some MxF acceptable!)\n\n**Limits:** \nNo suicide/self harm; no kpop/jpop or other bandoms; no real people beyond what is listed!\n\n**Rules:** \n18+ ONLY; preferred 20 - 28 - even for SFW RPs, just because I don't like chatting with much younger people that I don't know IRL.\n\n**Contact:** \nPlease PM me here on reddit for my details!",

In this roleplay there isn\u2019t a good side just a bad side and a worse side...which path with you choose? https://discord.gg/YeEZc6k",

            "selftext": "Hey all! Today I am looking to try a Scott Pilgrim plot based on the comic! Basically it's Wallace Wells x my OC. There would be other characters from the series too of course, and we could discuss dividing it equally.\n\nI ask that you have a decent knowledge of the characters. I realize it may have been awhile since people have read it, so not expecting perfection. Just a bit of refreshing would be great (I'm currently brushing up on it myself).\n\n\u2b50\u2b50 Here are my rules:\n\n1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.\n\n2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.\n\n3. I ONLY PLAY SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!\n\n4. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.\n\n5. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else.\n\nI am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. I am also fine making a separate chat to talk! I love meet new friends!\n\nIf interested, feel free to either shoot me a PM!\n\nHope to rp soon!\n\n*If you read this far, comment 'Drink' somewhere in your opening message*\ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf78",

It will be rather lighthearted and comedic, I don't want the characters to die or get seriously harmed. I'm really into storytelling so I may not ask for your input very often (unless the person I RP with wants to). I'm looking for anybody, but I imagine this kind of light-hearted  better resonates with female characters, but like I've said, everybody is welcomed.\nSo, if you are interested, please send me a PM where I'll be able to share more details about this RP and post my Discord tag.",

            "selftext": "My name is Valentine. I'm male and 20 and I quite enjoy playing around with anime ideas I like. Particularly at the moment Naruto is my main interest yet I have some more I quite enjoy if asked, including but not limited to Medaka Box, Hunter X Hunter, Bleach, Dragon Ball, My Hero Acadamia, Gantz, and Overlord, with ideas in mind for most. I will share three ideas from three anime, the most popular to draw in the most people.\n\nI'll start with Naruto. This will either be set post the Chunin exams in part one or in our own seperate timeline at our discretion, where or characters have been hand picked by our village's Kage for a secret mission and are teamed up. While I personally prefer the Cloud and Sand villages to be the subject of this one, we can freely choose between any.\n\nThe second is My Hero Acadamia. It will be similar to some of the more recent events in the anime where you'll get your temporary hero licence and I will play as your mentor and model hero who will oversee your hero work.\n\nThe third and final idea is my personal favorite of my Dragon Ball ideas. An alternate version of the events of the Goku Black arc being one where Zamasu was sent back in time when he wished to have Goku's body. Altering the timeline from the beginning of the original Dragon Ball, Goku is replaced by Goku Black as a child, altering the timeline from the beginning. Depending on where we start, we could have this go a multitude of ways, depending on how long we thing Goku Black would remain evil before becoming good.\n\nThe possibilities with this idea abound and I would love a creative and intelligent partner to complete any of these ideas.\n\nPlease message me privately to discuss ideas. Thank you very much for reading and I look forward for the responses I may receive. My ideas for the other animes are mostly unformed and would appreciate input. If you would kindly name your favorite anime character in your first message, I would appreciate it.\nI have a kik and a discord with no preference between either.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I'm BloodyRainbaws, also known as Smiley on Discord. Weeks ago I created a Discord server by the name **Our World**. I've been working on this server for a while and opened it about two weeks ago, but I've been struggling to get any members -there are only eight of us- into the server. So I decided to post an add here. Here's the summary of the story:  \n\n\n In the beginning, there was light and dark that created the Goddess of Light, Aaterre, and the God of Darkness, Esia. They were like small butterflies, one being a glowing light and another being as black as the night. They fell in love the moment they've met and knew that they were destined for each other. Eons later, the God of Life and the Goddess of Death were born. Their names were Ia and Uus.\n\nIa and Uus were bored of the void they were living in, so they created planets, suns and other things. The void eventually became pitch black and was called space. Then, they created Meleera, the planet we live on. From the empty planet, other gods and goddesses were created with the help of Ia and Uus. After that, the first being was created...\n\nIts name was Ana and it was a six-armed and three-legged majestic beast that brought peace and happiness. Ia gave the beast immortality, but that angered Uus. So she gave her blood a virus that would wipe out all life once it dripped onto the dirt floor of Meleera. They placed Ana under the guard of gods and goddesses on top of the mountain Asen.\n\nHumans and other beings were created. They created clans, then kingdoms and one of them created an empire. The Emperor William Aksen heard about the beast Ana and decided to get it. He climbed the mountain and avoided the gods and their guards. In the end, he got Ana.\n\nBack at his palace, he killed Ana and without dripping its blood on the floor he poured the blood into a jar. He then cooked Ana's flesh and ground its bones and ate them both. At the sunrise, he threatened all kingdoms with ultimate doom, since he had Ana's blood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd there you go! The story's shortened version might be a bit long, but it's shorter when compared to the original version. The original version is one page long -I edited it a bit so it could fit onto one page- and I'm quite proud of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe server also has some number of bots for moderation, ads and fun. The moderation both moderate the place against raids. The ad bots are for bumping this server of Disboard and other sites, as well as the Discord Server List server. And lastly, fun bots are for fun! We have JobsBot, CoinMaster, Nelly and OwO as fun bots.  \n\n\nWe also have some more additions to the lore of **Our World**, added every week or more. You can get information about various cults, tales and even people! You can also add your own tale, cult or a deeper character description. At the moment -the date I posted this post- I only have The Overlord Tale available at the #more-lore category. But that's not the one and only post that will be there!  \n\n\nSo, that's all I can think about. I hope that if you join, you'll have fun! Here's the invite:  \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/NvCczu4](https://discord.gg/NvCczu4)",

            "selftext": "Good (whatever time of day it is for you)! As the title of this ad notes, I'm looking to RP some lines within the Pok\u00e9mon game/anime-verse, and I'm seeking to keep the anime's lighthearted and cheery mood. Over-the-top adventure, copious humor and comedy, witty/snarky banter, meaningful conflict (no constant bleakness or perpetual angst), quiet moments of character growth, good battles, romance (I'm cool with smut, but I wouldn't want it to be the proverbial endgame), our characters genuinely having fun and enjoy each other's company, that sort of thing. (And in full disclosure, I do have a present preference for canon x OC lines. I know I'm trash.)\n\n***All partners must be 21+ years old, and all characters must be written/played as 21 years old if they aren't already older. Also, I'm only looking to roleplay over E-mail.***\n\n[This RoleplayGateway post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/9auwtv/vyces_roleplay_gateway_profile/) has all my OOC info, so I won't repost it here. (You're welcome for that. :P) Instead, let me note what I'm **not** looking to involve in any such lines...\n\n\u2620 *Mere glancing familiarity with the setting.* I'm asking partners to have fairly up-to-date knowledge on the games/anime (at least Gen 4 or 5) so we aren't significantly restricted regarding location or what Pok\u00e9mon we involve in a line.\n\n\u2620 *Making Pok\u00e9mon \"darker and edgier\".* I'm fine with a Pok\u00e9mon Origins-type tone sometimes. Something with a dark or self-serious bleak tone fitting Pok\u00e9mon Apok\u00e9lypse, however? That's not really my cup of tea.\n\n\u2620 *Fixating on game mechanics (mechanics of levels, stats, movesets, IVs, etc).*\n\n\u2620 *Enforcing the games' \"Four Moves of Doom\" limit.* Considering the anime doesn't and the games only do so for the sake of memory, why should we? :P Let's just have it so a Pok\u00e9mon can use--and learn--any of their given moves (which could be part of a plot in itself).\n\n\u2620 *Dry or one-sentence battle descriptions.* I'm certainly not demanding every single nuance receive a paragraph, but I **am** requesting partners be willing to describe moves and battles much like the anime. Just writing/reading *\"(Name of Pok\u00e9mon) used (name of attack)!\"* all the time gets boring, you know?\n\nI have a few general and open-ended ideas here to set the stage, but I'm certainly open to hearing yours...\n\n\u25d3 **The typical Pok\u00e9mon journey** is always a classic fave, our characters just traveling and having highspirited adventures fitting the series in general. (In this case, I'd prefer an *in media res* approach where both our characters are already fairly seasoned and experienced, bringing up their greenhorn days if needed.) Perhaps our characters have been traveling a long time together, or have just started doing so.\n\n\u25d3 **Perhaps one of our characters are a member of Team \\[fill-in-the-blank\\] while the other's a trainer they're tailing for whatever reason**, but they end up battling on a regular basis and ultimately falling for each other? (Think a similar version of the dynamic Ash has with the TR trio, only with some romance added to the mix.)\n\n\u25d3 **One--or both--of our characters are Gym Leaders, Frontier Brains, Elite Four members, Team Rocket members, Top Coordinators and the like.** Maybe exploring the day-to-day deal behind being one of the greats, from training their chosen creatures to dealing with some cocky greenhorns wanting to challenge \u2018em.\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters initially meet battling over a Pok\u00e9mon.** Perhaps they each have a fair case for capture, forcing a temporary team-up if the target's exceptionally clever. Or maybe they join forces to deal with a third party trying to Pok\u00e9-block them?\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters are part of an elite academy for Pok\u00e9mon trainers.** Think Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s answer to Hogwarts or something like that.\n\nNow, I'd love to find a partner willing to play Misty, Jessie, Bianca, Fantina, Georgia, Burgundy, Delia Ketchum, or Iris from the Pokemon anime.\n\nBut there are some non-Pok\u00e9mon canon ladies I'd love to see transplanted into the setting: Mai Shiranui (*King of Fighters*); Peach, Daisy (*Mario*); Korra, Kuvira (*Legend of Korra*); Suki, Ty Lee, Azula (*Avatar*); Mai Valentine, Ishizu Ishtar (*Yugioh*).\n\nSo if interested in this, please feel free to send me a PM!",

Do not take me, yet. My Gods, I want to live,\u201d as if she had not done a lick of wrong in her whole life. As if she were innocent despite all of her crimes. What a sad disgrace, that she plead for a life that she hadn\u2019t earned. \n\n- \n\nI would prefer decent knowledge on these universes, just because I don\u2019t like having to explain everything\u2014I am open to other shows, just let me know what it is. \n\nWe can play Original Characters OR Canon characters. I love both. I\u2019m open to both. I just prefer to play the more petite character. I\u2019ll write females or males. \n\nWrite with me if: you\u2019re okay with lgbtq, emotion-drive plots, some religious themes, alternate universes, you live to throw out new ideas, consistently and want to be friends. I will talk about our storyline all day long. \n\nDo NOT write with me if: you\u2019re homophobic, you can\u2019t do emotions (I don\u2019t want to write with a wall), you can\u2019t have an imagination and change up the plot a little. \n\nIf this is important, I\u2019m a nineteen year old, female. But I prefer to not play myself at all. \n\nBoth N//SFW is okay. I don\u2019t mind it. As long as it\u2019s not the main plot. \n\nWe can build a whole entire world together, that\u2019s the best part about writing with literature writers! \n\nI\u2019m above the age of 18, and I will not write with anyone under the age of 18. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re truly interested in writing with me, message me what you want to see happen. What you\u2019re desires are behind a plot. \n\nI absolutely love writing with a partner that is just as happy as myself. \n\npm for user [dis\u2014cord] ",

I've made a lot of posts looking for specific, somewhat mundane plots endlessly and find that I have an issue dropping them after a week because I've moved on to a new muse.\n\nI mostly RP for the sake of playing as whatever flavor of the week waifu that I enjoy.\n\nSo! Rather than putting out constant new RP posts after another, I'd prefer to just look for someone to have a partner with the means of being able to test my favorite romantic archetypes.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\nPreferably within a reasonable time zone relative to mine. I'm in CST, so any timezone two hours ahead or behind is perfectly okay with me!\n\nLiterate, and able to match lengthy posts, while also being okay it tone it down in times that purple prose length isn't required.\n\nWilling to play as various male characters for my seemingly endless plethora of female characters.\n\nKeep in mind, RPs are very likely to drop and start out of nowhere. It's likely that dozens of RPs will drop and die almost instantly, while others may last for a long while.\n\nDetails relevant about me;\n\nI prefer to play assertive type females, and will not compromise on this.\n\nMy replies are somewhat inconsistent, so be warned! I will try my best to reply as consistently as possible.\n\nLastly, I'm very strict on the kind of male characters I like to RP with, and I'm very fickle on these aspects.\n\nIf you're willing to deal with me being fickle and sort of a pain, then I look forward to giving you the best romance plots I can possibly think of.\n\nDM me your discord if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I\u2019m currently looking for a female rp partner to go a Greek mythology based rp.\n\nI\u2019ve had an idea I\u2019ve wanted to for a long time. We can change things around or keep it the same! \n\nZeus, the king of the gods, had decided that the gods and goddesses did not have much of an appreciation for mankind. He told them they had all become selfish with their godhood, and that they had no respect for the mortals.\n\nSo, every god in the pantheon was turned into mortals. Their ages all became similar - being around the high school/college age. \n\nAnd Artemis was no exception. \n\nEach god and goddess was no longer immortal, but they did keep some of their powers. Poseidon could swim really well, and could hold his breath for much longer than others. Aphrodite could \u201cpersuade\u201d people more easily. Artemis was excellent in archery, and she could talk to animals. \n\nSide notes:\nThis will be a romance based plot. My character will be an art student who loves nature just as much as Artemis herself. Eventually, the two fall in love. \n\nWe could keep this rp completely clean, or add some nsfw to it. \n\nWe could add a bigger storyline to it! For example, someone takes advantage of the fact the gods are now human, and tries to kill off nature. Artemis, even as a human, tasked herself with trying to stop it. My character wanted to assist. \n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, shoot me a message! I prefer to rp on discord or on Kik. Hope to see you soon! ",

If Im unreachable at some time during the day, just give me a little bit.  \n\n\nI am fine with NSFW themes during roleplay but there are times I will ask we either move to something else or fade to black. Its nothing against anyone, sometimes I just dont want to do anything besides write the story.  \n\n\nI write in very few fandoms, as I prefer to write my own story. I am a Southerner at heart, so it should go without saying that anything involving the West or cowboys is on my list. Sci-Fi is a genre I enjoy, simply for the options it allows. Historical fantasy, SOL, action and drama, adventure, take your pick really. I write most genres, but there are a few I just dont enjoy. Feel free to ask me, the worst I'll say is no.  \n\n\nIm a pretty friendly guy, just PM me. I look forward to hearing from you.",

            "selftext": "Hello /r/roleplay. \n\nI've been hankering for a story set in Egypt. Reminiscent of the 1999 film The Mummy and roughly based on the Little Red Riding Hood fable, peppered with action sequences, strange and twisted romance, oppressive heat, a 1920s setting, archeological digs, and above all, an unplanned traversing from a burial site to a gateway that leads our characters back in time to Ancient Egypt. \n\nThe most interesting premise I have floating around that I have not yet successfully pulled off with a partner is simply this: my character is a scholar of some sort that gives her reason to be part of the excavation team, and unbeknownst to her and the rest of the crew, they uncover a site that was meant to magically house the essence of the Set, God of Storms, Violence, and Disorder. She accidentally releases him, and then begins their journey of Set whisking her away (or tricking her) to accompany him to Ancient Egypt.\n\nI don't intend for their relationship to be amicable, at least, not at first. For example, I imagine he might infiltrate their camp first, and then take it upon himself to force her to act as accomplice as he seeks out the portal to Ancient Egypt so he could exact revenge upon his brother, or what have you. Perhaps there is even more to my scholar than meets the eye. Set's motive will be up to my partner, but obviously, whatever his end goals are, he'll need my scholar, whether to feed his power through some ritualistic means, or help guide him to the gateway, etc.\n\nI want there to be power struggles, to be betrayals, and dark elements at play. At least, that's what I imagined for this prompt. But if you are interested, I would be happy to talk plot with you.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, all of that aside, there are just a few things I am looking for in a partner:\n\n* Be 21 and over. Older is even better.\n* Be alright with violence and other adult themes.\n* Be fairly experienced. I'm not really open to teaching someone how to RP. I'll also most likely ask for a writing sample to make sure we're compatible, but I want the basics (spelling, punctuation, grammar), and more. More than one paragraph is usually preferred; I write anywhere from 2-5 depending on pacing and scene.\n* Do not be apathetic. Help me drive the story, make your own suggestions, and surprise me with twists and turns. Writing a story is a mutual effort, after all.\n* Please communicate with me. It's alright if you lose interest, or if things come up. I expect both of us to be adults and have our own lives. But if writing with me ever becomes a chore rather than something you look forward to, please let me know. Otherwise, I have no issues with telling you it's dragging and I'd rather not prolong the inevitable.\n* Regular replies. I'm looking for a reply every one to two days. More if schedules allow. Please do not reach out to me if that is not doable. Again, if something comes up, that's fine - just keep me in the loop.\n* Play on Discord only, 3rd person.\n\nLooking forward to those orange envelopes!",

You've been friends for many years. The story will revolve around you and them developing a polyamorous relationship. I do want this to be faily wholesome. But no matter what, drama and hardships will occure, life is not without its obstacles after all. \n\nThis also will hopefully be a good learning experiance for both of us. As well as a challenge, with me juggling four distinct and interesting personalities. \n\nIt was odd that such a wildly different group of people had become such an enduring group of friends. The five of you had met in junior high and, somehow, stuck it out all these long years. Through thick and thin, problems and drama arriving from within and without, you five had proved to be inseparable. \n\nA lot of the drama came from the composition of your friends group. Four guys and a girl? That did not raise any questions or drama during your earlier years but as time went on...? Well, we all know how cruel some people can be. Highschool was paticularly bad for the last few years.\n\nUnnessacarly so, really. Outside of some drunken flirting, all of your boy's never seemed too interested in anything but the friendship you all developed. Nonetheless, rumors spread from people thats only goal was to be malicious. It always worked out in the end however, you and your friends always rising above the petty drama.\n\nSpeaking of them, would you like to meet them?\n\nCharles, standing at 5'9\" wasn't a particularly...hard working man. One could easily describe him at best as layed back and at worst lazy. His upbringing never really helped with that. His parents owned a car dealership in town which meant money was never really a problem that factored into his life. Yet, being the youngest of four siblings, he was never his parents favourite child. That was never really helped with his attitude. He was more than content to glide through life instead of clawing his way to where he wanted to be. He had long, dirty blonde hair that only fed into his laid back appearance. \n\nDavid on the otherhand was the opposite of Charles in many ways. While he was a quiet man, he possessed a naturally hard working attitude. Coming from a poor and...problem house hold, he was quick to develope a strong work ethic. Even with that he knew he probably would not have finished with the good marks without you all. He was a stocky man, standing at 5'8\" with a heavy set build. Strong arms from the various hard labor jobs he has worked over the years. He kept his dark brown hair shaved short and it was not uncommon for him to forge to shave for a day or two.\n\nAdam was probably the only one of the group that would willing be going to college. He had dreams and plans. He wanted to be a lawyer. Wanted to live in a big city and make money. Those were his dreams. It would yet to be seen if those would end up flurishing. He was the one to always worry about the group doing something dumb. Always the one to warn against doing something. He just wanted what was best for his friends. He was an overachiever that always put far too much pressure on himself. Getting in trouble was not that. Standing at a staggering 6'7\", Adam was a lanky man. His deep copper hair was kept short, not shaved but short. \n\nEric had always been a troublemaker. Always finding himself in the principals office or in detention for some stupid joke or prank or statement. He was the only part of the group that also been arrested. During his earlier days with you, he had made a very stupid mistake of deciding it would be a great idea to shoplift. Yeah, no. Someone saw him put the item in his backpack. He hadn't been at school for a few days and when he got back he grudgingly told you what had happened. He had never done something so stupid, mostly because of you all and not having learned a lesson. At 5'7\" he never really stood out. An average looking man with light blonde hair, kept at a medium length. There was normally a pleasant and laid back smile on his lips and a playful glint in his eyes. Rarely did things keep him down. \n\nx-x-x-x\n\nMy prefered method of keeping in touch would have to be Discord, however I am open to other ideas!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m Danielle - Dani for short. :) I am 18, female, and from a CST time zone. So, I found an amazing role-play partner about over a month ago, and recently, they ghosted. It was really strange, and a let-down, since they were one of the best I ever encountered! Reason why I\u2019m telling you this, is because the role-play I had with him was very, VERY descriptive, and held several, multiple long paragraphs within each reply. After a month of all those hours of typing everyday, just for it to suddenly end, I would love to role-play still, but I\u2019m looking for something a little bit shorter (still long-term, just smaller messages)! I\u2019m searching for descriptive, LITERATE people, down for a few good paragraphs when necessary, and otherwise descriptive back-and-forths. I have a list of role ideas, if you do not have any ideas of your own! :) I prefer third-person, past-tense, but like I also prefer Discord, I\u2019m willing to switch it up for my partner. :) I prefer good build-up to NSFW, unless it\u2019s reasonable to the storyline for it to be a little earlier. I do not send any pics. I work randomly throughout the week and sometimes on the weekends, but I will let you know when I won\u2019t be free, and I hope you will do the same. Otherwise, I am quite active early mornings, during the late evenings, and I am such a night owl, so can stay up for a good amount of time to get some roleplaying on. \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc If you are interested, please PM me your name, what you\u2019re looking for, Discord tag, etc. Thanks!",

I love romance and fluff and hurt and tragedy. I like happy endings and cute things. I want characters who grow together and fight and make up. I mostly play male characters. I do not play a stereotype.\n\nI prefer slice of life. If I'm comfortable with you we may do some light fantasy and stuff later but for the most part I like real people in the here and now. Down and out rockstars, grieving widowers, lonely men. Lots of stuff tbh and complex characters. \n\nPlease be over 18. I enjoy nsfw stuff. \n\nPM me and maybe we can chat?

I'm looking for a horror/mystery roleplay set in the 1920's very much inspired by the Lovecraft mythos and lore. My availability fluctuates honestly but if I'm home I'll generally respond pretty quickly and hopefully at least once per day. I write in 3rd person past tense but my length depends on what's needed. Sometimes it takes a paragraph or two to set a scene while other times short and sweet is best. When it comes to NSFW content, I plan for this RP to have violence and other adult themes. I don't often do actual smut but if it servers a story purpose I will. Anyways, just hit me up with a big ol DM and I'll get back to you ASAP. I hope to see you soon! ",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to GM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have. Firstly, a few important notes about me and what I'm looking for.\n\nI roleplay in first-person. Your choice in point-of-view doesn't matter to me at all, I'm fine with whatever you pick!\n\n**I want you to be the GM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\n\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, please shoot me a message.\n\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\n\n**KonoSuba**\n\nMy character would be a member of the Adventurer Guild in the world of KonoSuba, though he could either be a native there or end up there like Kazuma. The RP could be entirely OCs or have canon characters, though I'd prefer canon characters to be in it, whether on their own or with OCs sprinkled in (especially since I'm absolutely in love with Megumin).\n\nI do have one idea for the story that's pretty far detached from the story and structure of the show. My character would be a native to the world, or at least someone who's been there a long time. He'd be a monster hunter who runs a restaurant. He goes out and hunts monsters solely to supply meat for the restaurant. It'd be a mix of a restaurant management type of thing, as well as having a lot of monster hunting. He could also take on quests for people, in exchange for getting to hire them as employees (either working as party members or in the restaurant). There could even be sections where he travels to other places to set up more restaurants or to hunt exotic monsters.\n\nOf course, if you aren't a fan of that, we could have the more standard fare of an adventurer and his party taking on quests and exploring the world. In that case, it might be more interesting to give the entire RP a road trip vibe, instead of having it take place around a central hub.\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**Dragon Ball**\n\nIn the far-future of the main series (or in an alternate universe), the dragon balls become closely guarded to prevent anyone unworthy from making wishes. Each of the dragon balls is held by a Keeper. Every year, the Keepers set up a world-spanning event, where everyone is invited to participate. All participants gather at one place, at which point the locations of all seven Keepers is revealed to them. From then on, it's a race to not only reach the various Keepers, but to pass their tests in order to obtain their dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are taken from their Keepers, the location of a hidden shrine is revealed to everyone who has at least one of the dragon balls. The dragon balls only work when gathered together at this shrine, drawing all the holders to one spot for a final battle.\n\nI think this idea would be great in terms of character development. All characters would be working towards the goal of having their one wish granted while on a long journey, giving them plenty of time to develop. I'm thinking that before the race begins, some time can be spent showing the main characters training for it. Maybe they're training together, or maybe they're miles apart and only meet for the first time at the starting point of the race.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\n\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.\n\n**Persona**\n\nI really liked the concept behind Persona 5 (the only one I've played), where the worlds the main characters fight in are representations of people's inner darkness, so I think something similar to that would be great. I've got two ideas regarding that.\n\nMy first idea is focused on dreams. In our world, dreams are formed based on a person's memories. The more negative memories a person has, the more horrifying their dream worlds appear, and the more horrifying their personality and way of treating people is. The main characters are able to enter these dream worlds to learn more about the dreamer, and when they reach the end, they're able to implant new memories or remove old ones for the purpose of making the dreamer's mind be more at peace and turn them into a better person. I think this'd be a great way to explore the human psyche and how our memories shape who we are.\n\nMy second idea is based on technology. 'Cyberspace' is an actual world, and each person who makes use of digital technology has their own personal Cyberspace. Their Cyberspace is formed by everything they do online: the interactions they have, the things they install, the things they download, the stuff they look at and search for, and so on. It's not linked to a specific device either, but instead to any piece of technology they ever use. Thus, these Cyberspaces reveal a lot about people, particularly about the things they do in secret and want to hide from the world. Our main characters can infiltrate Cyberspaces and upload any information they find from there into the real world. But at the very end of every Cyberspace is the worst things people have done online that could destroy their career if ever leaked. Our characters would have the choice of threatening the owner of the Cyberspace, or simply leaking the information to the public and watching their life fall apart.\n\nIf you have an idea besides those though, I'm always happy to hear it!\n\n**Marvel**\n\nRecently got around to watching the MCU films and have been pretty interested in an RP related to Marvel. Doesn't necessarily have to be set in the MCU, and I'd probably actually prefer an alternate Universe so we have a bit more free-reign with what we want to do with the characters and world. I was thinking that the RP would begin with an origin story for my character, with him either facing a canonical villain or an original character. After that point, the Universe could open up and include more of the heroes from Marvel. It doesn't necessarily have to immediately go into something like the Avengers where everyone comes together to fight a big threat, but maybe the heroes could be slowly introduced one at a time into the story.\n\nI do have a few ideas as to potential powers for my character that we can discuss. But if you'd prefer, I'm also open to my character being an apprentice to a pre-existing hero and having similar abilities/equipment to them. Whatever would work best for you and the story would work best for me.\n",

This time, I'm looking to scratch some fandom itches that I've been having. I would prefer it if we both used canon characters, however, that is not set in stone, if you insist on using OC's I will oblige.\n\nWhen it comes to how much writing per response I'm looking for, I'm fairly flexible, all I ask is that it's at least one paragraph in length or greater.\n\nSo with all that out of the way, here are the fandom's that I am looking for:\n\n* Marvel.   \nI love Spider-Gwen. She is by far my favorite Marvel character, so I would love to play as her. Other characters I would love to opposite would be characters like Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Black Cat (Felicia Hardy), or White Tiger (Ava Ayala, not Hector). Here is where an OC would probably be fine.  \n\n* Rainbow Six: Siege.   \nThe Rainbow Six: Siege girls are all so perfect. You can't go wrong with choosing any of them. However, some of my favorites are IQ, Ela, and Dokkaebi. Again, I literally love every Siege girl, so it doesn't matter to me which ones are chosen.  \n\n* Star Wars.  \nThis is one where I actually wouldn't mind playing a male character, but that's only if we're doing Reylo. I've never done a Reylo RP, so I'd be willing to give it a go. However, if that's not your style, characters like Jyn Erso, Ahsoka, Aayla Secura, or Asajj Ventress would work too (maybe even Darth Talon as well).\n\nWell, I think that's pretty much it, please, don't be afraid to drop me a message, and we can exchange discord id's from there.

Basically, just well-mannered people. So long as you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. Best sort of deal, isn't it?\n\nThe main genres I do, are as follows;\n\nDieselpunk (Usually, this involves an alternate history setting, either during the WW1 or WW2 era, mostly involving military or war related premises, sometimes even with fantasy elements in them, although that isn't exclusively it).\n\nModern/Hard sci-fi (Essentially modern era, but with some more advanced or near-future technology).\n\nFandoms (There are a few fandoms I do enjoy quite a lot so, I'd be more than open in trying them out, so long as anyone is interested in them as well, although by no means am I expert in all of them):\n\nYoujo Senki\n\nFate series\n\nDBZ\n\nAnd that's about it. As additional info, I hail from Europe, and thus, if there are any people from the Americas or Asia, wherever, just as a warning, time zones will be a slight barrier to overcome, but it shouldn't be too bad.\n\nIf anyone is interested, please send me a message, and I'll hand you my discord info, or vice-versa, and hopefully we can get something started.\n\nThank you to those who've taken their time to read all of this!",

I've done writing descriptions for a while,   but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would   prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real   pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some   animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some   fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC   (especially Arrowverse/MCU), Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon   Age, etc. Anything else unlisted is better to bring them my way and see   if I know them. If any above appeal, feel free to come my way.\n\nSome   literacy at a minimum makes me happy, third person only, past tense. I   am also VERY reasonable with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I  am  very nice, I promise, and I want to get niceties out of people in  turn.  Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a  chance!  Treat people the way you want to be treated, right?\n\nI   do work during the day, so posting will be sporadic, but I am good at   night and on weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for   people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day   or more.\n\nI am usually on from sometime   in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play   sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours. I   hope to talk to all of you soon! :)\n\n***Current   Desire: I am really interested in the \"intersex opposite a female\"   perspective. Modern is a big medium I could see following through. I   have ideas involving that most festive time of the year where romance is   the least one can expect to find among many other things. There's also   supernatural angles such as \"a goddess walks the Earth to find a   worshipper,\" or a ghost gives the friendliest haunt to her new tenant,   or a witch finds odd romance in the style of Bewitched or Practical   Magic or Simply Irresistible. Please message me for this or any other   ideas above in the post!***",

Im open to other ideas as well! I was this to be very literate, like a few paragraphs written everyday and all.\n\nCurrently i\u2019m thinking:\n\n- Something like miraculous ladybug: Two superheroes who know each other in and out of secret identities, but don\u2019t realize it. They work together and there\u2019s some tension, but it\u2019s not meant to be when they\u2019re saving citizens\n\n- A cheery pop idol and a stoic movie star: This one gets a little more dark and specific, but basically my character is a pop idol who\u2019s crush is a actor who she adored, and he takes advantage of that fact to use her. I want this to be more depressing and toxic almost.\n\n- Two friends have been with each other forever, but they don\u2019t know too much about each other. Strangely enough, the two of them are serial killers, and they end up competing for bodycount. It become a game of flirting and one-uping each other\n",

I\u2019ve recently watched The Last Kingdom, and the Vikings again..and I feel inspire to do a role play prompt based around that genre.   I have done many viking themed prompts before, and I have spent years gathering an understanding of Viking culture and normalities, and I would prefer if my partner could have some basic knowledge on the Viking life as well.\n\nAs for the prompt, I\u2019d like it if we can discuss this together so that we both get a plot that we can enjoy, instead of having someone become bored because it\u2019s not their style. I would like this role play to have a romantic prompt, but obviously not without the angst and hardships.  \n\nI consider myself a rather literate role player with years of experience, which is why I expect my partner to be the same. I write in third person, past tense only. I can\u2019t stand people who write in first person, although that\u2019s my personal taste. \n\nI\u2019m a female looking for a male partner, that has an original character to give to the prompt. I\u2019ve always preferred my partners character to play a \u201cAlpha male\u201d role. I feel like everyone enjoys the role play more when the characters are historically accurate, from clothing to personalities, and roles. For example, a Viking male may be more rough, dominate, and distant towards others. If you are not comfortable with that, then your character doesn\u2019t have to have that personality.  I\u2019m fine with your character being on the nicer side. \n\nIf you want a Viking themed RP, please message me and we can exchange contact information(for discord) and then discuss the plot we want to take and other small details.. Also please be working on your character description when you message me, so we can focus more on the prompt.",

This could be a truly corrupt politician, a demon, a supervillain, etc. The list goes on forever. I'll play in any genre, in any time period, or in any OC or fandom world as long as it includes the type of plot I'm looking for (and as long as I'm playing an original character).\n\nOver the course of the RP, there will be a side plot of a slow-burning romance between my character and yours. It can be because of a sympathetic background, prolonged periods of time together, or some sort of hostage-situation induced Stockholm syndrome.\n\n I would be more than happy to include lots of action and drama, as the romance of this is meant to be a side plot. We can choose to end it tragically with a death or two, with my character's indoctrination into evilness, or with her complete refusal.\n\nHello! I'll try to make this short and sweet so that things are simple for both of us. I'm seeking a male, or anybody who plays men, to write with. Typically I write 2+ paragraphs a response, in 3rd person, and in past-tense form. My experience includes one on one writing, group roleplay, and tabletop games like DnD.\n\nThis is ridiculously open to interpretation, and will involve a melding of what we both want, so I'm really looking forward to hearing your ideas!",

Take a look through my post history on here to get an idea of the kinds of scenarios I've run in the past. I'm open to gamemaster most things as I welcome the creative challenges in trying out something unfamiliar as well as making the familiar interesting.\n\nYour character will be the protagonist of the scenario and I, as the gamemaster, will portray the world -and its inhabitants- in which that character will have their adventure.\n\nThis will be a one-on-one type of situation: this will not be a group roleplay.\n\nMy roleplaying experience comes from about 15 years of gamemastering a variety of games for my friends. I've only fairly recently dipped into the roleplaying scene on Reddit as a way to keep my creativity active between tabletop sessions.\n\nMy style of gamemastering is quite laid back and I'm always happy to incorporate ideas from my players. I always make sure to leave my players plenty of material to work with while striving to not overwhelm them, nor to leave them in a dead-end. At the end of the day I make sure to present a world that reacts to my players' actions in interesting and believable ways.\n\nAnd really, and more importantly, I make sure that everybody involved (myself included) is having a good time. Because we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't enjoy it!\n\nIf this sounds at all interesting then please don't hesitate to drop me a line. Oh, and if none of my past scenarios quite tickles your fancy then I'm sure we can figure something out.\n\nAnd until then, I hope you all have a great day!\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

A gang of of misfits, that tag the cities in their art using a special type of paint. Paint that's only visible in the dark, lighting up the city in a neon song and dance of certain colors. Thing is though these are all seals for something...dangerous. Markers for certain sites. But they weren't taken down by most police forces beside the more proper ones, rather most enjoyed as parts of the cities night lives.\n\nBut as of late more marking have started covering the city, and they're becoming more public as of late. Even coming out with their name, the Blacklight Project. And with that though police and world governments took action. They seemed a little cultish after all, and a worldwide gang usually came with a terrorist plot, with guns and the such. Even a few of them letting themselves get caught only to somehow escape without a trace later after delivering their message to the world they were sent with.\n\nBut they were never seen unless they wanted to be seen. And they were eventually seen a lot, if anything just patrolling the seals with their own markings and masks at night, each city sporting their own colors. But it was in New York where the first incident happened, a seal just cracked off of a wall in a metro and a beast poured out of it. A yeti of sorts. And when it breached ground a group of members from the blacklight project descended upon it, weapons drawn. Weapons drawn and spell books opened, in a battle of flashing neon lights, the beast was defeated, and that's when the world truly knew the purpose of the Blacklight project.\n\nSo hi! Im Sparky. I don't have a lot to say here beside send me a message if you want to as I'm always looking for people. I prefer a third person writing style and no one-liners unless it's called for. Beside that I'm mostly on here, Discord, or we can use my e-mail. Hope to see some of you.",

It is soooort if inspired by Mulan but very different. I want to add many cute moments to this plot  \n\ntakes place during medieval times where In a country a son or man from each house it requires to be in the army to fight in the war. A poor farmer doesn\u2019t have any sons. He only has his beautiful young daughter.  He is old and sick and cannot fight in the war. He begs the war general to have mercy on him but he will be killed if he can\u2019t send anyone. So he decides to send his daughter. She\u2019s young and fragile. And the war general hates women and thinks they\u2019re nothing but objects. So he\u2019s super harsh on her and makes life very difficult for her, giving her extra training and making her so difficult jobs. But as time goes by he realises he\u2019s falling in love with her. I wanted this plot to have a lot of fighting scenes and stuff. The war general is an arrogant man but it would be cute to see him slowly softening up. And also to see a young farm girl turn into a strong warrior. Maybe also a lot of passionate scenes. Like maybe they have to fight in a war so deadly that one of them almost dies. So when they realise the other is alive they share a kiss full of so many emotions. I just want it to be very interesting and cute. It can be set in either an asian country or a European one. \n\n\nBut the only thing I ask of is that I want you to be descriptive because I\u2019m very descriptive and write longer replies. First impressions means everything so Tell me what you\u2019d like to add to this plot and what you like about it. What sort of cute and passionate scenes you\u2019d like to add and also what country do you want it to be set in\n",

I posted not too long ago about a supernatural roleplay and now I\u2019m watching The Last Kingdom and it\u2019s giving me some medieval nostalgia. \n\nAs the title says I\u2019m looking to play a female and would like a partner to play the male opposite of me so we can get a little romance going. \n\nAs for plot I have a few baby ideas but I don\u2019t have anything specific. I\u2019ve watched Game of Thrones so if you want it set in that world I would be alright with that or we can make up our own! I\u2019d want action, adventure, drama, and some darker themes in this roleplay so it could get a little NSFW. I am all for adding some supernatural or fantasy themes as well. \n\nI primarily use Discord. If this interests you, shoot me a message! ",

            "selftext": "I first want to introduce myself. I am Zach and I am a casual Roleplayer. This means my post range from 2+ lines to one extended paragraph or more. I have been off and on to the scene for several years now and have been ghosted by MANY people. I'f you don't want to RP with me then tell me or don't contact me. The worst you can do is Randomly block me on Discord or fall off the face of the earth. I have ups and down so don't expect me to be around 100% of the time. I'f you feel this has happened, then check on me. Shoot a message and see if I am alright. I would do the same to you. If you want a break then tell me. Communication is key for Roleplaying friends and that's what I want. Friends! Ones that like to Roleplay and chat. Be neighborly and kind. But love Roleplay too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that you know a bit about me (if you want to know more than ask), let's talk topics, settings, and details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Fandoms, not really interested. I like some genres and shows, but I cant do Cannon. I am a freestyle artist that likes OCs. It wouldn't be hard to convince me to do a Fandom roleplay, but I typically stay away from them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Original/Cliche Ideas, much more into. I am a romance fanatic and this is why I am looking for female Roleplayers. I know the male side so I need the complement to me for a partner. If you have a favorite scenario or cliche idea, shoot it past me. I love adapting and brainstorming before an RP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Spelling and grammar, not too picky. As long as I can get the message then I don't care your i and e were backwards. Forgot the apostrophe on don't? I don't care. as long as the message was clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Smut and NSFW themes, I'm ok with. If you just want to do a fade to black thing than it's cool with me. I will warn you that I am a pervert alot of the time. I have it dialed down alot unless your comfortable with that sort of thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Plots and settings, I'm flexible. I am trying to branch out and do more with my Roleplaying so I typically like to brainstorm with my partner first. See what they like to do and add in details to make it more enjoyable to both parties. And when I say I'm flexible, I mean I can do realistic slice of life to sci-fi thriller, to mystic beginnings. Real,Sci-fi,Fantasy. I can cover them all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't work but I do like to sleep at night. I am in bed by 8, don't get to sleep till 10-11, and I wake up when I do. If you are awake before me then shoot me a message and I may get up. I sleep with my phone under my pillow. So the vibration usually wakes me up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this far and shoot me a message if anything interested you or I'm your last option. Ether way I'd love to hear from you.

            "selftext": "*\\[I will start by stating I am in fact 18+. There is very little NSFW content in here, but regardless you've been warned. This post has also been tagged NSFW, so you've been doubly warned.\\]*\n\n**Hello there!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the name states, I'm looking for a semi-literate to advanced literate roleplay partner. I would usually roleplay on Kik or Amino, but I don't use those apps as much anymore plus both have their equal share of issues (*Kik stop sending me messages hours/days late dammit!*). Anyway, that being said, Discord is really my only other option right now. I'm not active 24/7, I do have somewhat of a life. But I'll try to be active as much as possible.\n\nThere are some other ground rules for when I roleplay...\n\n* **I** ***DO NOT*** **do smut roleplays. I will do a naughty scene if the situation comes up, however, I do not do roleplays where sex is the only 'plot'. There's gotta be an actual story, there's got to be character development and drama and all that good stuff.**\n* **That being said, I do pretty much every genre of roleplay; romance, drama, adventure/action, horror, mystery, etc, etc. However, with horror roleplays I can get pretty... Dark. Most things do not bother me whatsoever. So, seriously, bring on the deranged and twisted! Of course, that being said, if you aren't comfortable with something then of course I'm not going to force you to do it. We can always do something else.**\n* **On the topic of romance, I usually do Boy x Boy relationships. It's just what I've always done. However, I'm willing to try other things if you're not comfortable with that type of relationship. Just keep an open mind and be respectful, is all I really ask. I am 100% an LGBTQ+ supporter uwu**\n* **I don't really do group roleplays. Mainly because they usually get pretty hectic and overwhelming. And partly because I'm just not a big fan of group roleplays. So, please, I prefer 1 x 1 roleplays. Maybe 1 x 1 x 1 roleplays. But that's as far as I'll go!**\n* **As stated in the title, I do fandom roleplays! I know a few fandoms, thought most not completely. As in, I'll start an anime, game, or even series and not finish them yet. I have over fifteen animes I've started and never went back to, yikes. Anyway, I don't just do fandoms. I do original roleplay plots as well! Not all of my plots are s u p e r creative but I try.**\n* **Speaking of fandom roleplays, I don't usually use canon characters. I try with some characters if I think I might be good at using them but if I don't think there's anyone I can use, I will use an OC. And y'know, if you wanna do that as well, that's entirely fine!**\n* **I know I brought up activeness earlier. But I wanna brush up on it a little more. I am not always the fastest responder, please understand that I am not always available 24/7. I do have somewhat of a life. And I won't judge if you respond late, either. It's fine, it happens. Of course, if you know you're going to be gone for a week or something, please do let me know. A roleplay is just a silly roleplay. It can always be started up again at a later date. Your well-being is more important. Please understand that if you need time away for whatever reason, I will understand.**\n\nI know that's a lot! But it's all really simple rules, really. Please, try to follow them and respect them.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nMoving on... I want to talk about the real reason for this post. Roleplay partners on Discord for an Undertale roleplay! I know what you're thinking... \"About goddamn time!\"Sorry it took me so long to get to the point! But I felt it was important to list the rules (and if you have any questions, you can always ask). Now, I don't have a complete plot in mind for this roleplay, I have some basic ideas. If you haven't seen/played Undertale and don't want any spoilers then... Why are you here?\n\nAnyway, I know very few AU's to Undertale. I know Flowerfell, Underfell, Underswap and I know a little bit about Overtale as well. I've heard about others but don't know much about them. I have a few ideas for a few of these AU's (including the original Undertale universe). I was going to list them here but I'm not sure everyone would want to read so much more. Apologies for making this as long as it is.\n\nSo, instead, message me if you're interested. Message me stating what AU you want to do, what ideas you may have, what you are and are not comfortable with. And please, again, be at least semi-literate. I might ask you to send an example of how you roleplay, just to make sure. I've had people say they were literate roleplayers and yet use absolutely no punctuation, have pretty awful grammar or roleplay using asterisks or dashes. You can message me here or on Discord, I'll leave my tag below. When you message me, I will discuss my ideas and such with you.\n\nDoes that all sound good? Yeah? Great! I really look forward to roleplaying with you. (:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrotatochip#2523",

            "selftext": "\n\n Long ago in a forgotten land, there were two Kingdoms that quite often lived at odds with one another. Malduria, the land of Men to the North with their lush plains, grassy fields and fertile crop fields. To the South was the Elven Kingdoms living just along the coastal lines with beautiful beaches. Grand cities full of art, sea ports wondrous architecture. For centuries Man and Elf had been at war, refusing to capitulate or make peace for reasons of politics, land rights or for their own pride. At last, in the year 1352 after one of the most brutal armed conflicts taking place right on the border; the Mad King of Malduria had suddenly passed away in his sleep. The apparent Heir in a sudden decision proposing a cease fire to the King of the Elves, who begrudgingly agreed after much tiring blood shed on both sides. After months of shaky diplomacy and land redistribution there was some sliver of what could be considered peace. With that, came the under the table agreements of allowing merchants and diplomats across borders and even...common travelers to even reside within their lands. More and more Elves beginning to settle within the lands of Malduria, much to the displeasure of the peasantry and common folk. With the war still fresh on many citizens and veterans minds, it is uncertain what this new step will take and how the two groups will begin to react to one another. Many moving into Marlia, the booming Trade City of the North.  \n\n\n This is going to be more of a story driven roleplay, preferably one of us playing as a Human and the other as an Elf. Looking for a detailed, literate and dedicated partner that can have romance, potential action, controversial themes and more.\n\nI want to start it off slow with it mainly building up the world around us and the relation between our two species but we can work it further from there. Feel free to PM me if you\u2019re interested!",

            "selftext": "In the year 2947 the Pioneer space craft finally reached its goal. After over a hundred years the colossal ship finally came into range of the anomaly. By now all of the original occupants had past on. The new generation of researches stood in their place. Men and women that were born and will die on this ship. The only people to know earth only through stories their parents had told them. As the lumbering ship drifted closer to the worm hole all two thousand occupants could feel a shift within them. \n\nThe people of earth had been watching the ship the entire time. As it got futher and futher away it became more and more delayed. They saw the ship as it was seventeen minutes ago. In an instant it disappeared from the telescope view. Little did they know seventeen minutes ago the once great ship had crashed back into earth. How it moved they entire distance in an instant is unknown, how it hit the opposite side of the planet, and how all of the crew had survived were mysteries. In the coming weeks those that had touched the anomaly began to notice something strange. Earth, an alien planet to them. They perceived it differently to those that lived on the planet. Most believe that radiation unlocked some kind of change in those that were on the Pioneer. As well as a small minority from the population of earth. \n\nOver time their powers developed, people with the ability to control water and ice, produce flames and fly all manner of powers appeared. The wreckage of the Pioneer and the desert around it was declared as sovereign land for all those with special powers. Though such declarations rarely go unchallenged, talks of war have lingered for decades as the new country has developed far beyond its neighbours. Now in the year 3009, the next generation of new humans are being accepted from across the planet, and entered into the university.\n\n(I wanted to do something specific and I am not sure how well it comes across in this starter. Essentially it will start with us as new students in the university, learning more about our specific powers and developing them. Then it can go more into the mysteires of what happened at the wormhole or into the politics of Pioneer. Or it could even stay as a slice of life which includes sci-fi and super human elements. If you are interested send me a message and ask and questions you may have. Then feel free to make a character and choose any power you like. I will get back to anyone that replies but it may take a moment.)",

A I'm 21 B Female C two years of experience with roleplay and my Name is whatever the hell you want it to be! \n\nSo I am looking for a my hero academia roleplay and I do have a few demands which likely seem unfair but I am willing to play canon characters but would also like to use my own since I put effort into them if that's okay \n\nBut I would prefer it be a serious roleplay that follows the plot of the anime if that's alright I can't honestly think of much else to say honestly we can discuss the rest in pm? But I am open to any gender so don't worry about that.\n\nBut i would prefer if you were detailed at roleplay and don't make yourself out as super op that's happened to me a few times and it annoys me a lot but I'm actually too kind to say anything most times \ud83d\ude05 and whenever I do they tend to leave quite often so yeah sorry \n\nAnd I'll send all information about ocs in pm and would prefer to use discord if you want to jump straight onto it just comment your username or if there's a group I can try but I'm honestly not a people person but I promise I'll try my best. Also my PM's don't work a lot for Reddit so sorry if I miss your message or something (which is why I like discord) also if you want anything risky (you know what I mean) that's okay I have lots of experience with that just please tell me \n\nAnd I guess I could do other fandoms if persuaded? I do jump in moods such as fairy tail or Tokyo ghoul hell at one point it was devil may cry ",

I want to RP some fluffy stuff because I feel like it helps put me in a better mood when I'm feeling down, and so much of Rp is about angst and drama and tragedy. So, I am down for playing males in mxm rps only, otherwise I'd like to play a female. I'd like it to be slice of life scenarios if possible and though I have lots of OCs, I would also be willing to do some Attack on Titan pairings as well. \n\nI am semi-literate, and I enjoy good spelling and an interest for convo outside of the rp. I only RP on Kik now, I left discord for personal reasons but please message me if you're interested in doing some fluffy romance stuff! Thanks! ",

Over the past few years, people have reported a strange creature appearing in the woods at night. the ranger never expected for the creature to be real. \nDuring a walk through in the night, he finds the creature! It\u2019s wounded and can speak English. It\u2019s strangely human for a beast that lives in the woods. The park ranger takes the beast in and soon discovers that he has to protect him. After living with the beast they begin to work into ways of how the beast can walk around in disguise as a human, and eventually become friends, then begin to date!

I love lots of different themes based upon the existence of super powers/magic, and am very open to other suggestions that can incorporate this as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ask that the roleplay partner be 18+. I don't plan on anything suggestive happening, as this is not a smut roleplay, but if two characters happen to get in a relationship, or there is blood/character death, I want to make sure I'm talking to someone old enough for the topics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anything here trips your trigger, send me a PM on here and we can discuss further.

WOW.\n\nLets get this clear - I am all for building a relationship with the people I am playing with. But I am not tied to a computer- I work, I have responsibilities, and I do not expect major aggro from people I have been speaking to due to situations out of my control. I would never purposely ghost someone, and I would never vanish purposely, but trust me if I do, there is a reason.\n\n**RANT OVER**\n\nAm 22 F UK from Cambridgeshire. I have a lot of interests, I have a lot of passions, and if you wish to discover some then I am all for it.

JUST DM ME :)*\\*\n\nI am 32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job during the week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is to roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters (IRL gender doesn't matter).\n\nPlease be prepared for picture usage. I've done writing descriptions for a while, but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC (especially Arrowverse/MCU), Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon Age, etc. Anything else unlisted is better to bring them my way and see if I know them. If any above appeal, feel free to come my way.\n\nSome literacy at a minimum makes me happy, third person only, past tense. I am also VERY reasonable with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I am very nice, I promise, and I want to get niceties out of people in turn. Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a chance! Treat people the way you want to be treated, right?\n\nI do work during the day, so posting will be sporadic, but I am good at night and on weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day or more.\n\nI am usually on from sometime in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours. I hope to talk to all of you soon! :)\n\n***Current Desire: I am really interested in the \"intersex opposite a female\" perspective. Modern is a big medium I could see following through. I have ideas involving that most festive time of the year where romance is the least one can expect to find among many other things. There's also supernatural angles such as \"a goddess walks the Earth to find a worshipper,\" or a ghost gives the friendliest haunt to her new tenant, or a witch finds odd romance in the style of Bewitched or Practical Magic or Simply Irresistible. Please message me for this or any other ideas above in the post!***",

Over 600,000 people died, and in all honesty, some people think there were more.  Was it justified?  Not really.  Was it epic?  Sort of.  I think what happened most of all was that it left a stain on American history.  People fought each other for what they believed in.  It wasn't all great, in fact, in was quite awful, but we can't forget about that.\n\nCarry Me Back puts you as either a soldier, civilian, or slave in the American Civil War.

            "selftext": " Hello there you can call me Shadow, I'm older than 20 but younger than 25. I'd like to say that I'm *not* solely looking for smut despite the rating(Though I won't say no to it), I do want to do some plot! I'm looking for a partner that likes doing both preferably. And all characters are at least 18-21, in this universe you *must* be 18 to get a trainer's license.\n\nOther things to be addressed, I prefer OCxCanon. Along with MxF\n\nI can match my posts to my partners, length doesn't bother me. You want a paragraph per post? Alright. You only want to do two sentences? Fine by me.\n\nI much prefer the newer generations over the first two, both lore and Pokemon wise but I could be convinced on starting a Kanto/Johto one, depending on the plot. I'm also down for doing plots other than just a journey, so if you have some ideas of your own please don't feel afraid to ask!\n\nI'd also like to put it out there that I've played all the games(Except Conquest), read the manga up to XY, and seen almost every episode of the anime. So really anything is on the table as far as characters go!\n\nThe plot would really rely on the region; But the plot I really I want to do is a bit similar to the anime and manga, where we follow the adventures of a pair of trainers as they travel through the region, fight the villains, catch Pokemon, develop romance, and battle gyms, slice of life, etc.\n\nHere are some plots that I would like to do:\n\nDelta Emerald - You know the Ruby/Sapphire remakes? I'd like to do a roleplay based on them but with elements from Emerald. Both Aqua and Magma teams being villains, Rayquaza playing a key part, the Battle Frontier making an appearance, and other stuff.\n\nUnova - Basically how the anime should have handled Unova. New main character, traveling companions, Team Plasma actually having a role in the plot. The same applies to my Alola idea.\n\nKalos - A few months ago I came up with this idea but lost it. Basically it is set a few years after the events of the XY games, Team Flare is defeated and Calem is the champion. But one day Calem goes missing and a new version of Team Flare appears who are on the hunt for Zygarde, dragging the new hero into the mess as they adventure through the region.\n\nHoenn-Alola: Basically a combination of the Hoenn and Alola regions. With a whole new plot and story!\n\nDon't like these ideas? Don't fret, I'm open to suggestions! I am also willing to engage in crossovers, assuming I know what the fandom is that you're asking about. You can message me for a list of my other fandoms if you want.\n\nI do have other ideas, just ask me and I'll send you a list. The ones I listed just happen to be my favorites, and what I'd prefer to do.\n\nI don't really have a preferred platform, message me what you prefer and we'll just go with that. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I just ask that you inbox me, sometimes messenger doesn't tell you that you've received a new message. Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short and sweet but I promise you that I am literate and detailed when it comes to roleplaying. I am also kind of picky and require proper grammar but I understand occasional mistakes. Everyone does them every once in a while. I'm looking for someone who shares my love for creating realistic, detailed stories and my hate for plot holes and blunt characters with no real depth. I love plotting almost as much as I love writing and for that reason even if we used email for roleplaying I ask of you to ooc chat with me in either discord or skype. Plotting is easier that way. \n\nI have many genres that I enjoy including but probably not limited to: fantasy, horror, crime and drama. Darker themes, a bit of angst and dark humor are usually a part of my writing and I hope that you're someone who is okay with that. Obviously I will respect whatever limits you may have. Romance is needed but there has to be a bigger plot to it than just two characters instantly falling in love. Slowburn romances are my jam. Give me difficult characters to interact with, give me douchebags, don't be the kind of person who doesn't want their characters to make mistakes. I love all that. This doesn't mean that I don't enjoy happiness and fluffy moments just the same. It's all about the balance. I usually write males against other males and I need this included but can double. Oh, and if you only write \"the one taking the d\" we are not a match.\n\nWhat I truly crave for right now is a rp set in the world of One Piece. We could do canon characters or create our own, both is equally fine with me. I just need that delicious tear-jerking drama and mind-blowing adventures with rookie pirates aiming at the very top. If you haven't watched One Piece then original pirates are fine too but know that I want some weird, supernatural elements! \n\n...if you're still reading, I might be into something else too! So if everything but the pirates sounded like fun then shoot me with a pm and let's see what we can come up with! Just be 20+",

I'm a massive Mortal Kombat fan, but I've never had the chance to have a roleplay set in the universe. I was thinking that we could roleplay during the timeskip to MKX. I think that would give us the most freedom to roleplay and without breaking the lore too much.\n\nI'm fine with you roleplaying any character, but I would prefer to stay away from any OCs. I'm capable of roleplaying the following characters: Sub Zero (Kuai Liang), Smoke, Kenshi, Takeda, Erron Black, Kano, Rain, Taven, Bo Rai Cho, and Kung Lao. I'm open to trying other characters though! I ask that you be fine with adult themes (this is Mortal Kombat after all.) Besides that, I ask that you be open to doubling and be advanced literate. I absolutely love having all those details. Anywho, if you're interested in exploring the MK universe, please send me a message. I look forward to roleplaying with you all!",

An Noir-Style play, reaching from history-like scenarios like crime, corruption, mafia etc to more fantasy-style scenarios like a detective agency for supernatural cases, for example. Or something from an Lovecraft Universe, I'm open there to suggestions and have a ton of ideas. Also I would like to play in a World of Darkness (pref. Vampire, at least I'll tend to play one since its the only thing I'm having experience with so far) or Fallout, post-apocalyptic. From Institute to Raiders to Minuteman, or something in New Vegas. However, I would like a slightly darker touch then the game itself has. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm willing to play females, males or whatever there might be and I'm not really bothered what my partner plays, altough if theres a romantic touch I would at least prefer a character-setting of a Female and Male. My main language is german, usually I post fairly large posts 700-2000 words in that language, but with a two-week-rhytm. I dont know how english will play out, but im guessing its not that short either (apart from dialogue). My current prefrence would be kind of an instant-messeging like rp over discord, with sessions. So we'll meet at time X and just post aways until we have something more improtant to do. Of course its also possible to just make posts whenever we like, but I tend to have a larger time-per-post on this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope someone made sence of my rubbish and is intrested, I would like to play over Discord or Email, but im open to other ways. For contact details, just send me a pm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers ",

            "selftext": "Hello there\\~ Call me Sun Fox. I'm looking for one partner/friend for a long-term roleplay.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n  \n\\- +18 F partners (who are willing to play both male and female characters)  \n\n\n\\- MxF romance  \n\n\n\\- A long-term story written in Google Docs, third-person/past-tense  \n\n\n\\- Friendly OOC chat over Discord  \n\n\n\\- Extensive plotting  \n\n\n\\- Interesting, flawed characters  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I can offer you:**  \n\n\n\\- Friendship!  \n\n\n\\- A minimum of three or four (decent-sized) paragraphs per reply  \n\n\n\\- At least one reply every other day  \n\n\n\\- Characters who are sometimes hilarious  \n\n\n\\- Sample writing upon request  \n\n\n\\- Pictures of my pets  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Settings/Characters of Interest:**  \n\n\nThis is probably a bit of a long shot, but I'd really like to find a partner for a Phantom of the Opera roleplay. I have some experience playing Erik (my version is generally based off of the musical rather than the book), but find that I have been playing male characters quite a bit lately. I'd like to find someone who is either willing to play Erik opposite my OC, or who is willing to double. I have some ideas for how the doubling would work, but please feel free to bring your own ideas!  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interested?**  \n\n\n PM me with--  \n\n\n\\- a blurb about yourself  \n\n\n\\- any ideas you might have for this story  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NOTE:** If you have roleplayed with me before and I ghosted you, I'd like to formally apologize now. I was dealing with personal things earlier this year and didn't have it in me to prioritize my writing partners. I was dumb and didn't let most of you know about it, but I will do better this time!   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Erik Sample:**  \n\n\nThe production of Ernani was still in its early stages, but Erik could already see that it would likely be a complete disaster. The casting was dismal at best, given that the Populaire had lost its one best hope for greatness in Christine Daae--now long gone from Paris, if Erik had to guess. His beloved pupil had been gifted both by God and himself with the splendid voice that surely would have carried her far had she not chosen to forsake fame for fortune (and love, he grudgingly amended). His gifts of music had touched her soul, but not her heart, it seemed. With her rushed departure, he had once more been plunged back into the dark loneliness that settled in the belly of the Opera House. He had watched the place burn and had been certain of his own demise--but the universe had different designs for him.  \n\n\nAt this moment he sat concealed within the blessed darkness of Box Five for the sole purpose of witnessing the depths to which the accursed managers would sink to help fund the rebuilding of the Opera House. In one hand he clutched his mask, and in the other a drink. He had never been particularly keen on alcohol, but found he could not eat with Christine's absence weighing so heavily upon his heart. Even the news of the Populaire's imminent rebirth could not raise him from the depths of his despair and that was months ago. Still he suffered, unable to create beauty as he once had done, unable to groom the members of the Opera, to guide them as the good shepherd he once believed himself to be. His muse had left him for another, better man, and he was entirely crushed by the fact. He frequently found himself wondering if she was happy wherever she was, and if she ever thought of him.  \n\n\nErik was not a small man. Tall and broad in the shoulders, he barely fit comfortably in the plush seats of his box. He wore a black wig to conceal his thin, wispy white hair, but he might have been very handsome were it not for the matter of his shocking deformity. The entire right side of his face was horribly disfigured and seemed to resemble a skull. His skin was pale almost to the point of translucency, giving him still more the appearance of a ghost or dead man. His eyes, however, were golden and glittering like twin flames. If one could bring herself to look past his decided ugliness, one would find that his eyes held a tremendous amount of intelligence. They were eyes that had seen all manner of horrors, but also beauty in its purest form.  \n\n\nHe gazed down at the stage where the players were gathered and reviewing their scenes, and could only roll his eyes. Why had he left the comfort and seclusion of his home by the lake for this nonsense? What had he hoped to gain except to infuriate himself with the inadequacy of the Opera's remaining singers and dancers? He had neither the strength nor the desire to correct them, but the imperfections still bothered him greatly. He downed the last of his drink and stifled a cough as the bitter taste ran down the back of his throat and into his empty, waiting stomach.  \n\n\nAllegedly the new patron was to make an appearance today. Perhaps he had thought to catch a glimpse of the Populaire's \"new hope.\"",

            "selftext": "Hiya! I hope everyone had a great day. I'm searching for some more partners to do some writing with! This time, I'm looking to scratch some fandom itches that I've been having. I would prefer it if we both used canon characters, however, that is not set in stone, if you insist on using OC's, I will oblige.\n\nWhen it comes to how much writing per response I'm looking for, I'm fairly flexible, all I ask is that it's at least one paragraph in length or greater.\n\nSo with all that out of the way, here are the fandom's that I am looking for:\n\n* Marvel.  \nI love Spider-Gwen. She is by far my favorite Marvel character, so I would love to play as her. Characters I would love to opposite would be characters like \\*\\*Captain Marvel\\*\\*, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Black Cat (Felicia Hardy), or White Tiger (Ava Ayala, not Hector). Here is where an OC would probably be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Rainbow Six: Siege.  \nThe Rainbow Six: Siege girls are all so perfect. You can't go wrong with choosing any of them. However, some of my favorites are IQ, Ela, and Dokkaebi. Again, I literally love every Siege girl, so it doesn't matter to me which ones are chosen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Star Wars.  \nThis is one where I actually wouldn't mind playing a male character, but that's only if we're doing Reylo. I've never done a Reylo RP, so I'd be willing to give it a go. However, if that's not your style, characters like Jyn Erso, Ahsoka, Aayla Secura, or Asajj Ventress would work too (maybe even Darth Talon as well).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I think that's pretty much it, please, don't be afraid to drop me a message, and we can exchange discord handles from there.

            "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short and sweet but I promise you that I am literate and detailed when it comes to roleplaying. I am also kind of picky and require proper grammar but I understand occasional mistakes. Everyone does them every once in a while. I'm looking for someone who shares my love for creating realistic, detailed stories and my hate for plot holes and blunt characters with no real depth. I love plotting almost as much as I love writing and for that reason even if we used email for roleplaying I ask of you to ooc chat with me in either discord or skype. Plotting is easier that way. \n\nI have many genres that I enjoy including but probably not limited to: fantasy, horror, crime and drama. Darker themes, a bit of angst and dark humor are usually a part of my writing and I hope that you're someone who is okay with that. Obviously I will respect whatever limits you may have. Romance is needed but there has to be a bigger plot to it than just two characters instantly falling in love. Slowburn romances are my jam. Give me difficult characters to interact with, give me douchebags, don't be the kind of person who doesn't want their characters to make mistakes. I love all that. This doesn't mean that I don't enjoy happiness and fluffy moments just the same. It's all about the balance. I usually write males against other males and I need this included but can double. Oh, and if you only write \"the one taking the d\" we are not a match.\n\nWhat I truly crave for right now is a rp set in the world of One Piece. We could do canon characters or create our own, both is equally fine with me. I just need that delicious tear-jerking drama and mind-blowing adventures with rookie pirates aiming at the very top. If you haven't watched One Piece then original pirates are fine too but know that I want some weird, supernatural elements! \n\n...if you're still reading, I might be into something else too! So if everything but the pirates sounded like fun then shoot me with a pm and let's see what we can come up with! Just be over 21!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi there, This is a group dedicated to creating a fun and welcoming environment for all roleplayers. I want this roleplay to offer plenty of opportunities to its players to help create and shape the world around them for the sake of creating a fun and interesting story. Below, you'll find a bit of lore to help situate you so you can get a general feel of how things go down on this server:*\" In a small and quaint town basically forgotten (or at least overshadowed by all the other ones) deep in the heart of Utah, everyone seems to know each other's name and its so safe that some people can even sleep without having to so much as lock their door. However, this town is known for something else amongst its residents, as is the rest of the world at this point that sets it apart from our own: mythological creatures. You see, in this world, creatures big and small truly do exist and finally decided to make themselves known to the humans. However, there is one small catch: they aren't exactly liked by humans. Humans have always been top of the food-chain, they've always been able to adapt and overcome any challenges that they've faced as a species. Now that these \"mythos\" as they often refer to them as have come into their lives, they see them as simply another issue that is meant to be adapted to and overcome.*\n\n*The mythos tried to be nice to the humans, they wanted to basically be like neighbors with them. However, humans were fearful of them. Things soon escalated and now it's a bit cultural split between mythos and humans. The mythos are now essentially treated like second-class citizens if they so much as step foot into a human town or city. Some, are even captured as slaves and forced to serve under the oppressive rule of humanity. Things have even gotten to the point where anti-mythos departments have been establish for the sake of \"protecting the people from the threat of the unknown\" as they so claim.*\n\n*Of course, there are a few unspoken rules that applies to humans. For example, the dense forest that surrounds the forest is to be left alone. Any human that so enters it could potentially face certain death.*\n\n*Now, here we are. Be you mytho or human, you still have a life to live. Whether you try and create peace between the two opposing groups or instead prefer to keep old values intact and destroy all who oppose you is a choice all your own.\"*\n\nIf this is appealing to you in the slightest, please feel free to drop by and say hello! Hope to see you soon! Remember, this RP changes along with whatever decisions the characters of this RP make. I only jump in if things begin to get out of hand. Even right now, we're at the near finish of an event ran by one of our very own. This would be the perfect opportunity to come and create a character during this moment of down time between events and get to know the server a bit better. Currently, we have a big, bloody arena for mythos slaves to fight it out in that's finally getting some use. Don't be shy to make a fighter!\n\nLike I said, I want this to be an environment where everyone can pitch about whatever ideas they like, so long as it fits within the general lore and rules.\n\nOtherwise, everything is up to you guys.The link to the server: [right here](https://discord.gg/XZur9Jw)",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. The latter is a big craving at the moment. I wonder why.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here",

This also means I\u2019m not a huge fan of using canon characters unless it helps the structure or story line.\nIn my RPs I like to have violence, angst, and romance. NSFW is not something I particularly enjoy but I would have to discuss it with my partner\n\nHere\u2019s some things Im wanting to RP:\n\nNon-fandom:\nCrime\nMilitant/military squads\nAncient japan \nSchool/slice of life (where things turn serious/violent. Sort of like 19days)\nRomance\nLow fantasy/modern day fantasy\nCrime/gang vs police\nEveryday life with a twist (based in an office, cafe, band, etc)\n\nFandom:\nHalo\nRvB\nAttack on Titan\nBlack butler universe\n\nPlease message me or comment if you\u2019re interested!\n",

I'm happy for us to make our own story with OC, a fandom story with Canon or OC characters or even a combination of multiple fandoms.\n\n\nThe fandoms I'm into are: Fallout, Elder Scrolls, RWBY, Game of Thrones (ASOIF too), Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online, Star Wars, Warhammer 40k, Lord of the Rings and Marvel/DC.\n\nFor our own plotline settings: Sci-Fi, Fantasy (Urban, High whatever you want), Post-Apocalypse, Steampunk, Cyberpunk and even grimdark. These are what I'm best at but willing to try others.\n\n\nRomance/smut I can do as well but I have to say I can do MxF as I am straight. Sorry, but it does make me uncomfortable to try and roleplay as a homosexual. But I'm still happy to roleplay with you no matter your preferance as long it isn't our characters who are paired.\n\nHope to hear from those interested, and if you read this far, put the subject of your message as Begbie.",

I've been working on this idea for a few days now and I feel like I've finally worked it out enough to try it out with all you lovely people.* \n\n*First, a bit about me - I'm an 18 year old female from Canada usually available in the later hours, but I usually can get the occasional replies in the daytime. I have a busy life most of the time, so I if you're looking for someone who can give rapid quick replies, I'm sadly not your girl ):*\n\n*I prefer to roleplay in third person, but if you prefer to write in first person, that's a-okay with me. My only strong preference is that you rolepay in full sentences.* \n\n*I can play any gender and don't mind which you play.* \n\n*This roleplay doesn't have to be romantic, but if it is, I'm fine with any pairing - M/M, F/F or M/F!*\n\n*Plot will be my number one priority, but the occasional smut scene is allowed, if our characters have developed enough and it makes sense  for the plot!*\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To give some needed background to my plot, I'll give a quick summary;** \n\n**So, in the world that my plot takes place in, it's quite similar to the modern world. In fact, everything is the same except super-humans are much more common. About 10% of the population are born a mutant - more commonly known as 'mutes'. There is a great division between mutes and the average human. Neither trusts the other leading to Mutes not being able to obtain good jobs and live in city slums, many turning to crime and aggression, especially against the humans.** \n\n**My character is a perception-illusionist mutant who isn't exactly what you would call a 'good person'. Her power allows her to alter what people see, making her natural at deception. Though she can make people see things that aren't there to a degree, she usually uses these powers to change her appearance and increase her clients in her less than reputable career as a street-walker.**\n\n**Your character would be a cop who seeks mine out for whatever reason you prefer! Maybe she was a witness to a crime, maybe you're seeking out her powers to use in a case, whatever you want, I'd love to hear your ideas!**  \n**I leave your character pretty open, because I want to give you control over it as much as I can! You could have your character like or dislike mutants for whatever reason, you could even make him a secret mutant as well! Really whatever you want to do, I'll probably be down!**\n\n**I want things to eventually develop into our characters partnering up and become cliche buddy-cops and stuff, because I'm a sucker for cute stuff mixed with angst.** \n\n**I probably left out a lot of things, so if you have any questions, just message me! I already have a starter written, but I'd prefer to go over characters first!** \n\n**Sorry this was a bit of a ramble, but if you're interested, shoot me a message!\n\n**Thanks!**\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

So what am I looking for exactly you may wonder? \n\nI\u2019m currently looking for only female x female pairings. This is non negotiable.\n\nI am definitely looking for quality over quantity type of writing. If you can express everything in a detailed and nice manner in a paragraph then that works for me. That being said if you write several paragraphs I will do my best to match that and expect you to do the same. I understand that some scenes require less than others might and we can totally just play it by ear.\n\nI definitely prefer to play long term over short term roleplays. I prefer to get really into my characters and the world we create. \n\nThat being said I like to use a Discord server for roleplaying because I like the separate tabs for different information to keep everything nice and organized as things get bigger.\n\nI post every day, once a day at minimum unless I warn you otherwise in advance. Usually I can generate more replies then that especially if it\u2019s an action scene or something but always at least once. I prefer you to be able to do the same.\n\nLastly, I am a huge fan of OOC chatting. I\u2019m here to make some friends to build a world and story with. So I\u2019ll ramble to you about life, characters, ideas, posts I see that remind me of our story, anything like that. If that\u2019s not your thing please just tell me ahead of time so I don\u2019t talk your ear off. \n\nOn to the actual story! I am looking to play in one of the following ideas or genres in order of interest:\n\n* A Love Simon based roleplay. Meaning they meet online and have to get to know each other without actually knowing anything about the other until they finally meet in person.\n* A modern slice of life roleplay. Whether this be that they both end up working in the same place, one is the frequent customer at the other\u2019s place of work, or they meet on a dating app. Anything is cool for this one! \n* Fandoms: Harry Potter, Drag Queens, Percy Jackson, Teen Wolf\n* Always willing to hear your ideas as well!\n\nIf any of this catches your idea please just shoot me a message and we can get going! Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Greetings and stuff ain't my thing so I'll just be to the point.  I've been RPing for 11 years and I'm here for over the top/shounen-esque adventure stories, whether it be fandom or original. ~~When I say consistently available I MEAN consistently available.  I've been approached and then immediately ghosted for a  week+ after the first day by **several people** for no good reasons and it's getting REALLY annoying now.~~  It'd also be great if you didn't ghost me before even getting my Discord added, that's even worse.  I post consistently often, typically many times a day, and prefer someone able to at least vaguely do this as well. As for the stuff I'm looking for, I prefer things that have action along the lines of stuff you'd see in things like Kill la Kill, My Hero Academia and so on basically. All while being very character driven with interaction and stuff rather than ego stroking with constant action/fight scenes.\n\nRecently I have noticed a lot of people approaching me and either not knowing what I'm looking for in a story/setting or in a character as a whole and leaving cause they weren't getting what THEY were looking for upon being the ones to approach ME.  So at the bottom there's going to be a random little code word of sorts I expect to see in one's opening message that tells me they read this whole thing and actually understand what I am looking for/okay with.\n\n**Character Preference?:** I indeed have a few preferences, I prefer to work with female characters. OOC gender don't matter as long as they're playing a **Female** character.  Or if the person in question wants to be a DM/GM of a story in one of the settings I'm fine with, a focus being on female characters. I have had ZERO good experiences with male characters as they tend to always fall within a few tropes I just can't stand. I also play by this myself and only play female characters.  I also only do FemaleXFemale romances too. I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.  Basically if aiming for a romance I'd prefer the partner character being the one making advances and such.\n\n**Age Preference:** I'd prefer my partner, the actual person behind the screen is 18 or older.  That generally covers my actual concerns on the topic.\n\n**Fandoms I'm looking for/fine with:** There's a number of fandoms I'm interested in and while with some I'm fine with both of us playing an OC or my partner playing a canon character, there are some fandoms I prefer to only play if the partner plans to play as a canon.  So as far as ones I'm fine with someone playing either one in it'd be: Pokemon, My Hero Academia, Dragonball Z, Splatoon, HunterxHunter or even some Maplestory 2 based stuff if one is into that.  Kingdom Hearts and Little Witch Academia is an option but I'm a bit picky if it's an OC and otherwise would prefer my partner playing a canon for it.  As far as fandoms I prefer my partner at least playing a canon for it'd be: Legend of Zelda, Skullgirls, and Shantae.  But if anything the thing I'm looking for the absolute most is My Hero Academia right now.\n\n**Misc. Things:** So a few things to just throw in to sum this up to keep it brief. As far as \"Original\" things are concerned if you don't have a concrete setting of your own we'd likely be using mine. Which would mean needing to make a native for said setting since it only has the races I've made on it. I ONLY write in 3rd person, past tense, paragraph style. I expect people who approach me to do the same. Literacy is a must and so is being able to put out longer posts. While I don't expect constant novels or anything I don't want to see any one lining either unless the situation becomes back and forth chatter within the scene. There's also a few things that are red flags/definite Nos for me but I will stick with the main 3 for now. I WILL NOT do low fantasy/realism things, especially not post-apoc/military themes. I also don't like photo-realistic characters/references/faceclaims and have an anime bias for that. I REFUSE, no matter what, to work with furries, at all. As for the 3rd thing; I prefer partners to have more of a thick skin. I'm not interested in the easily offended/easily upset or people on some kind of hair trigger temper.  As for availability on my end I live in the CST time zone and am usually awake and available between like 6 PM or so up to like 9 AM.  So if I can net people that are around for most of that time, that'd be good.\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done. ~~I'm not great at ads ok~~  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Vaal  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",

            "selftext": " Hello there! You can call me Shadow, I'm older than 20 but younger than 25. I'm looking for somebody who'd be interested in a Pokemon journey style roleplay, which I guess you could translate as seeking a long term partner? I much prefer the newer generations over the first two, both lore and Pokemon wise but I could be convinced on starting a Kanto/Johto one, depending on the plot. I'm also down for doing plots other than just a journey, so if you have some ideas of your own please don't feel afraid to ask!\n\nI can match my posts to my partners, length doesn't bother me. You want a paragraph per post? Alright. You only want to do two sentences? Fine by me!\n\nI'd also like to put it out there that I've played all the games(Except Conquest), read the manga up to XY, and seen almost every episode of the anime. So really anything is on the table as far as characters go!\n\nThe plot would really rely on the region; But the plot I really I want to do is a bit similar to the anime and manga, where we follow the adventures of a pair of trainers as they travel through the region, fight the villains, catch Pokemon, develop romance, and battle gyms.\n\nHere are some plots that I would like to do:\n\nDelta Emerald - You know the Ruby/Sapphire remakes? I'd like to do a roleplay based on them but with elements from Emerald. Both Aqua and Magma teams being villains, Rayquaza playing a key part, the Battle Frontier making an appearance, and other stuff.\n\nUnova - Basically how the anime should have handled Unova. New main character, traveling companions, Team Plasma actually having a role in the plot. The same applies to my Alola idea.\n\nKalos - A few months ago I came up with this idea but lost it. Basically it is set a few years after the events of the XY games, Team Flare is defeated and Calem is the champion. But one day Calem goes missing and a new version of Team Flare appears who are on the hunt for Zygarde, dragging the new hero into the mess as they adventure through the region.\n\nHoenn-Alola: Basically a combination of the Hoenn and Alola regions. With a whole new plot and story!\n\nDon't like these ideas? Don't fret, I'm open to suggestions!\n\nNow here are some drawbacks that I feel will scare people off, I want there to be nsfw themes. How much of it depends on you, message me your stance on it. And lastly, I prefer CanonxOC. CanonXCanon is alright and completely doable, I just find OCxOC a bit boring. I'd also like to add that I can double!\n\nI don't really have a preferred platform, message me what you prefer and we'll just go with that. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I just ask that you inbox me, sometimes messenger doesn't tell you that you've received a new message. Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "I am a twenty-seven year-old potato named Mel. I'm in the process of moving in with my significant other and currently am a waffle waitress.\n\nDue to heavy personal issues over the last couple of years, I've been having a hard time coming back to roleplay. Sometimes the writer's block hits and I struggle to reply for days. If you stress on time for replies and don't want to talk often OOC then I'm not the roleplayer for you. If you do have patience for me then thank you very much and I hope not to disappoint in quality for the stories we build together.\n\nI have been roleplaying and writing for 15+ years on various forums.\nWith my desktop currently out of order until after the new year and working overnight shifts, I am strictly roleplaying on discord.\n\n\u00bb THE BASICS\nNo Godmodding, of course. I will warn you the first few times you do it but if it becomes a problem then I will drop our threads and unfollow.\n\n18+ ONLY\nI like writing more mature themes so this is easiest for me.\n\n\u00bb OOC COMMUNICATION\nI LOVE making friends with my rp partners so please do not be afraid to come bug me in PMs. I really enjoy building on characters and storylines OOC. I'm also a very visual roleplayer so I enjoy sending pictures, videos, and music that pertains to our stories.\n\n\u00bb WRITING/FORMAT\nI try to reply at least once a day and I will be vocal with all partners if I can't make my minimum.\n\nWith that, I will never bother you about replying. Sometimes I really enjoy a thread so I might message once or maybe even twice in the span of a week or so and ask about your reply. That\u2019s it though. I know it can be difficult getting the muse to reply so I will not constantly pester you.\n\nMy starters tend to get decently long especially when we\u2019ve plotted out our thread but don\u2019t feel like you have to match my length. I generally try to match my partner but I'm not a novella writer. I can range from at least one paragraph to three or four depending on the story.\n\nQUALITY &gt; QUANTITY\n\n\u00bb RELATIONSHIPS/SHIPPING\nDo you want to ship the thing? There\u2019s a 99.99999% I also want to ship the thing. Feel free to always come to me for ship stuff.\n\nI am a shipping whore but I will never force a ship on you. However, I do have rather flirty muses. Please do not take their flirting as I immediately want to ship them.\n\n\u00bb TRIGGERS/LIMITS\nI really don\u2019t have any triggers so I\u2019m definitely open to a good number of different rps.\n\n\u00bb CHARACTERS &amp; FANDOMS\nI have many OCs that I can use but i also play a handful of canon characters from certain fandoms. [With my desktop down, I currently only have my OCs set up on pinterest and their notes on my dropbox.]\n\nRight now my fandoms are;\nMarvel Cinematic Universe ( Ironman, Black Widow, Winter Soldier, and Scarlet Witch )\nMass Effect ( canon and crack!Shepard )\nMiraculous Ladybug ( I rotate Marinette and Adrian )\nSailor Moon ( Sailor Venus )\nPreacher ( TV show ) ( Cassidy canon and fem!switch and Tulip )\nThe Walking Dead ( Carol Peletier and Merle Dixon )\n\nI think that's it for now but I'm sure I'll think of more.\nAny questions? Please ask.",

I am also open to RPing this on Reddit chat, email, or downloading the chat client of my partner's choice for this.\n\nI have a character I would like to play as a love interest for Elliot Alderson. We can stay close to the canon story, or steer away from it all completely. I would strongly prefer it to be long-term, but we can end it eventually if my partner would like.\n\nI require literacy but won't bust your face over a typo.
