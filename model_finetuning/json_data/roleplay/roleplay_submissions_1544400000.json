If you're looking for a fun, long term, in depth and exciting RP then this is for you! I use Discord, and would like to chat there and throw around some ideas and chat!\n\nI tend to post pretty long replies, or try to match my partner in terms of length, I do enjoy detail and I would like more than one or two lines of text as a reply to my giant wall of text. I do work, and my schedule is super weird, but I usually can get a couple posts in during a day. So if you're okay with waiting and just general chat in between posts then I think we'll be good friends!\n\n\nI have a basic premise set up and ready to go, some lore and character information established. So bring your imagination, best OC's and let's see what we can do!\n\nFeel free to message me here, and then we can add each other on Discord! I hope to hear from all of you!",

We don\u2019t need to write novels back and forth as long as the post quality is good. \n\nNow for this post I\u2019d like to keep an open mind with genre. I\u2019m up for anything. Fantasy, supernatural, fandom (I thoroughly enjoy Game of Thrones, Marvel, or DC here), slice of life. Throw it my way. My only request is that we explore a darker theme. Trauma, violence, psychological, horror, whatever. I want to try my hand at some NSFW stuff. I would also like romance to be part of it as well because what brings people together more than psychology damage. \n\nSo if this interests, shoot me a message. However I probably won\u2019t reply if your message just basically says hi. Tell me a bit about yourself and what you\u2019re looking for in a partner and in the roleplay. Hope to hear from you! ",

I do have a basic plot in mind, however, due to past experience I've found that RPs like this tend to do better when they have more than two people. This is where I could use some help. To get this idea off the ground I would like to have a minimum of 3+ people (7 people max, excluding myself) who can meet the requirements listed below. If you can meet the requirements and this is something you may be interested in please let me know!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!\n\nPS - If you have any questions let me know!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Requirements** \n\n* Must be able to write at least 2 detailed paragraphs per post\n* Must post at least 2x a day/ If you know that you will be gone, you must let the other members know ahead of time! If disappear for 3 days without a word you will be asked to leave.\n*  No ghosting please!\n* Be a team player! I cannot stress this enough! This means chatting with the other members, contributing to the plot, and overall being a fun person to talk to!\n* Be able to play males and females! \n* Since I am located in the USA I do ask that other members have compatible time zones. It wouldn't be much fun if half of us are sleeping while the others are awake.\n* Create characters who actually want to interact with others! No one likes their character to do all the work. \n* Must have a general understanding of the Fate universe",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'm searching for somebody who'd be interested in doing some long term Pokemon related roleplaying. Primarily an roleplay based off the anime, and what I mean by that is a fun adventure through one of the seven regions with a group of characters, fighting the villain team of said region, catching and battling with Pokemon, and general slice of life stuff.\n\nI can match my posts to my partners, length doesn't bother me. Example- You want a paragraph per post? Alright with me.\n\nI'd also like to put it out there that I've played all the games(Except Conquest), read the manga up to XY, and seen almost every episode of the anime. So really anything is on the table as far as characters or plot go!\n\nHere are some plots that I would like to do, we are not limited to them though. If you have ideas of your own you are very much free to suggest them:\n\nDelta Emerald - You know the Ruby/Sapphire remakes? I'd like to do a roleplay based on them but with elements from Emerald. Both Aqua and Magma teams being villains, Rayquaza playing a key part, the Battle Frontier making an appearance, and other stuff.\n\nUnova - Basically how the anime should have handled Unova. New main character, traveling companions, Team Plasma actually having a role in the plot. The same applies to my Alola idea.\n\nKalos - A few months ago I came up with this idea but lost it. Basically it is set a few years after the events of the XY games, Team Flare is defeated and Calem is the champion. But one day Calem goes missing and a new version of Team Flare appears who are on the hunt for Zygarde, dragging the new hero into the mess as they adventure through the region.\n\nHoenn-Alola: Basically a combination of the Hoenn and Alola regions. With a whole new plot and story!\n\nLimits? I don't have any. I just ask that you don't try to force OCs together, it's easier to pair OCs with canon characters from my experience.\n\nI don't really have a preferred platform, message me what you prefer and we'll just go with that. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!",

All I ask is that you\u2019re at least semi-literate. \n\n-I do fandoms, but really only video games (DBH, Far Cry 5, Mafia franchise, Fallout 3/4/New Vegas)\n\n-I use ocs when I roleplay and will provide you with a faceclaim and backstory for them. I only have female ocs but I\u2019m working on male ones. \n\n-I also roleplay plots that aren\u2019t connected to games. I prefer slice of life, angst, romance, and smut.\n\n-I don\u2019t care for your age but if you plan on doing smut, please be over 18.\n\nThat\u2019s really it, when can discuss more when you hopefully message me!

I have a few ideas as to how this could go, but I'd also love to hear any ideas you have!\n\nThis could take place before, during, or after the movie. I was thinking that maybe my character would be Moana's fiancee in an arranged marriage. She could either like my character and be fine with the engagement, dislike my character but slowly fall in love with him, or dislike my character but pretend to love him so she doesn't disappoint her dad or because he's the best option.\n\nPlease ask for a reference for my OC in your first message, so I know you read the whole post. We can discuss everything over PM, and then move over to Kik.",

            "selftext": "Hey! I have been looking to make a more meaningful role-play lately. By that I mean something we would both like to stick to and have a long-time arrangement doing. Personally I am 18 so, I am open to getting into the nitty gritty things that role players on here enjoy. Below are a few ideas and promts that I can currently think of at the top of my head (I\u2019ll be open to do one of yours of course.)\n\nArmy/Medic based role-play\n- This role-play would not really focus on action and more on relationship building. It would focus on two childhood friends, one of them a military officer and one of them a military medic/nurse the officer would be injured and the nurse/officer would have the role of taking care and helping the officer heal the mental and physical scars they have obtained.\n\nUniversity\n- This role play would focus on two freshmen university students, but I would like some kind of twist on it to make it more interesting. This could be some more elaborate plots like powers or mystery. Maybe a crime happens on campus and our two students have to bring themselves together to solve it. \n\nFive feet apart\n- Maryland Lung Hospital is a specialist hospital dealing mainly with cystic fibrosis. The ward features patients of all ages and walks of life dealing with the same illness. Our characters could be either patients or maybe a doctor or nurse whom gets close to one of the patients. \n\nMy promts are loose and are very basic at the moment but I would love to have some creative influence! Please dm me if anything interests you or if you would like to throw a few ideas at me. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I'll elaborate by stating that I'm looking for a scenario that happens after the Anime (not the manga, I haven't read it and uh...well it's awfully long, isn't it!). It'll take place in a scenario I've developed involving a cult wishing to return the earth to its primordial state (which is the story in the broadest terms.) It'll have us playing as OC students from the first year onward, and an especially talented and special pair at that! I would be glad to explain a little more if you message me!\n\nI'm looking for literate partners, as previously stated. I type anywhere from 1-2 paragraphs most of the time, and try to keep scenes moving and the RP interesting. I'm simply asking for an understanding of the basics of writing and a general sense of grammar. I also expect a partner who can post at least once per day!\n\nAs an added part of this ad, I'm also gonna freely admit to not being the best at leading scenes or controlling the world, and I'm hoping for somebody more capable of doing that! I am usually hard-pressed to come up with small events and story beats without help, and would also love some advice on how to do that if anyone is interested! I already have a basic character idea or two down. I'm looking forward to talking to you!",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for a long-term roleplay partner willing to do a fantasy-based roleplay with me. This roleplay will include world building, character building, and will require you to be slightly-multiplayer with NPC's occasionally. I would love it if romance was involved, as it just makes these stories more and more interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for the introduction: This world is one full of kingdoms, villages, cursed forests, lords, ladies, peasants, and magic. But magic is forbidden in most kingdoms, and there is a high price listed for capturing a witch. Even still, witches practice their magic in the darkest and most deadly parts of the land to ensure their own safety. Bandits, thieves, and bounty hunters have been on the lookout for witches, just to collect the price that they are worth. Most witches have gone into hiding, and the rest have all been caught and burned at the stake in front of the town. However, magic is difficult to conceal, and those who are born with its gift cannot live normal lives, no matter how hard they try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this roleplay, I will be playing a young lady who is to be married soon. Her mother is dead, died in childbirth, and secretly held the gifts of magic. Bestowing these on their daughter, the father knows nothing of her abilities, or her status as a witch. She practices her magic in deadly places most wouldn't dare travel so that none discover her nature. One night, as she practices among the deadly shores in the northern parts of the land, she is caught using her magic, and by a bounty hunter nonetheless. Worth over double the price alive than dead, the bounty hunter (whom you will be playing) decides to take the girl as prisoner and the two embark on a two-week journey to the nearest kingdom in which he can collect his bounty. What adventures lie in store for them on the journey to the kingdom?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from being detailed, I prefer 3rd person and past tense rp, but I am adaptable if it's something you are very persistent about. I'd prefer there only be humans, so no elves or dwarves. Maybe there could be dragons, but none to ride on. If you're interested, DM me for my discord username and I'd be happy to talk further.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for an advanced RP partner for an original roleplay. Below you'll find a relatively long post detailing the specifics and requirements. I'm willing to compromise, because we're both supposed to have fun doing this, but please read the whole thing and respond accordingly. I won't respond to \"hey wanna play xD\"-type messages. If your reply is well thought out and shows you've read this post, I will definitely respond to you.\n\n**Timezone and Language**  \nI'm in Europe and not a native speaker of English. I've been told the latter doesn't show if I don't announce it, but I'd like you to know that whenever I write something up that seems weird or take a bit longer to respond, that's because of the language barrier. I'm always looking for constructive criticism - don't hold back if I forget how to English (&lt;- that was on purpose)! :)\n\nMy schedule is sometimes all over the place, but generally I'm available in the afternoon and evening, CET. In my experience, with a bit of scheduling it's possible to set up several RP dates a week, regardless of where in the world you are - so don't let the timezone stuff drive you away!\n\n**Synchronous RP and Paragraph Length**  \nI very much prefer one-on-one RPs in which both partners are present, concentrating and eager. I'm not one for leaving a message and getting back to it \"at some point over the next few days\". Much rather I'd schedule a time and then exchange messages in an acceptable pace. As a guide-line, if you haven't started typing your reply half an hour after receiving mine (and that happens more often than not), we're probably not a match.\n\nI understand that people have a life, and life sometimes just happens. That's not a problem. Whenever life happens for me, I find the time to drop you a message along the lines of: \"Hey, sorry, got pulled away. Don't know if I'll be back today, but tomorrow looks good!\" I expect the same from you. Stuff happens, but whenever you can announce it, please **do** announce it.\n\nThis might seem overly strict. It's not intended that way. I'd just like to sort out people who respond once every three hours. That's not the way I like it, and I'm sure there are others like me. Don't be shy, come say hi.\n\nAs a result of my preference for synchronous roleplaying, I don't require you to write half a novel as a reply. Roleplaying is interactive, and while descriptive texts can take up some space, actions and dialogue require cooperation. Giving my partner an opportunity to respond means writing shorter posts. Usually I'm somewhere between two and three proper paragraphs.\n\n**Setting and Plot**  \nI'm up for modern urban fantasy (no, that's not sparkling vampires, see [the definition on this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)), science-fiction, contemporary realistic, slice of life and a variety of other settings.\n\nI don't do fantasy, historical, medieval or ancient settings. I need some sort of modern or futuristic elements, although those can definitely contain fantasy elements like powers, magic, races, beings, etc.\n\nWhatever our setting is: I'd like it to be original (no fandom stuff) and centred around both plot and romance. NSFW scenes shouldn't be the main focus, but romance should lead to those sometimes.\n\n**Characters, Genders and Orientations**  \nPlease be prepared to play several characters, not necessarily at once. I love interweaving story-lines and switching things up. A plot rises and falls with its characters and their relationships; society and interpersonal dealings are the most important aspect to me.\n\nI'm fine with any gender and orientation, and I'd very much prefer if you felt the same. Since we're going to play various characters each, switching up gender combinations is important to me, too. **Please be prepared to play men and women in hetero- and homosexual relationships.** If you do straight and gay, but no lesbians - that's fine. If you do straight and lesbians, but no gay stuff - that's fine, too. But straight and at least one non-straight orientation are my minimum requirement, sorry. In an ideal case, you're fine with transgender characters, too, but that's not a strict requirement.\n\nOur characters should not be archetypes or stereotypes. I always try giving each character a life of their own, sometimes aligning with traditional roles, sometimes not. If you only do overly sexualised women and alpha males, I'm not the right guy for your needs.\n\n**Talk to Me if Something Bothers You**  \nI'm not going to yell at you, cry, rage-quit or send an assassin. Most problems in RPs (except for general incompatibility) can be solved by talking about them. If you feel we're incompatible, I prefer a quick good-bye message over sudden ghosting. If there are other problems, let's solve them together.\n\nNothing bad can happen when you tell me my newest character addition to the roleplay seems boring. I'm not going to tear your head off your shoulders if you tell me you didn't like a specific scene because of reason A. Go ahead and tell me.\n\n-----------------\n\nThat's already a lot to go through, so I'm not going to bore you with any more details - or outrage you with my overly specific requirements. If you think we could pull it off, please contact me. If there's anything I need to clarify, ask. If you think there's something in there we need to discuss and find a compromise for, don't hesitate. I'm looking forward to your message and will reply as quickly as I can.",

No wonder the guy eats the world after he breaks out. But what if he was set free?   \nI had an idea for a story that revolves around two young Vikings that come across a desolate island, only to find that it is the place where Fenrir, The World Eater, is currently held by Gleipnir. They come to find out the big bad wolf isn't so bad after all, and he just misses his brother and sister. So our young protagonists set out on a long journey to free Jormungand and Hel from their binding shackles, traveling amongst the World Tree\\`s branches and meet some interesting characters. This will probably involve a lot of action and comedy, as well as some extremely...interesting subject matter. If you don't know what I'm talking about (looking at you, Sleipnir.) then I would suggest going in and reading some more Norse stories. Cross Dressing, Nudity, and HORSES. These are all things you should expect to encounter, although we can always omit stuff if that's not something you want. If this sounds like your type of roleplay, adventure, action, and comedy all rolled into one Viking Sized burrito, then send me a message and ill let you know where you can get ahold of me on discord!",

Instead of wallowing I figured it couldn't hurt to give this subreddit a try (even though reddit is pretty intimidating for me) \n\nI'm not looking for anything specific.  I find fun in creating plots/universes/characters with a partner so it fits whatever the mood is for both parties. Whether it is fantasy or horror, or whatever else. Though - I do lean HARD towards fantastical plots rather than realistic things. \n\nI like to think I'm generally chill, but I do get enthusiastic about things. I love talking OOC with my RP partners and do genuinely wish to get along outside if the RP. It makes for better and more fun storytelling.\n\nI only have a few catches though.  \n\nThe first being is that I require my RP partners to be 18+. This isn't for the sake of anything NSFW (which can be discussed as we go along)  but for the fact that I am 23. I just don't feel comfortable RPing with anyone who isn't also an adult. Sorry!\n\nSecond - I don't expect novel-length, frequent, and constant grammatically correct posts. I have a life and 40-hour work week outside of Discord. I get it. (Also demanding perfect grammar and spelling all the time has always rubbed me the wrong way. We're having fun - not writing a book.)   But I would like a paragraph or two at minimum. Maybe a couple days a week if that's what your life allows. \n\nThe last is that I just want respect on both sides in and out of roleplay. This should be the easiest and most \"duh\" stipulation I have. \n\nPM if interested! Any questions you have I'll answer too. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read my roleplay request.\n\nI have been a creative writer for much of the past 10-12 years. I\u2019ve published my work both personally and professionally, but recently, I\u2019ve been interested in getting back to my roots and returning to the collaborative roleplaying scene. Even though I do a lot of writing for my professional work, the freedom that comes with roleplaying has always been a creative release for me \u2014 and I figured it would be nice to find a long-term writing partner who is in the same boat.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been interested in nuanced, emotionally-driven themes relating to contemporary, modern settings. I\u2019d like to point out that these themes are very different from the conventional \u201cslice of life\u201d genre that people tend to associate with modern settings. In fact, I think it requires an elevated level of storytelling and plot development to be able to craft engaging, realism-oriented modern settings. I know many writers default to using fantasy elements in their writing, but I\u2019m much more interested in the challenge that comes with contemporary settings. Listed below are some of the types of dynamics I\u2019ve been interested in exploring:\n\n* Interactions taking place at a major university or office setting.\n* Interactions involving two characters who are polar opposites in their demeanor or personalities.\n* Interactions involving religious divides between characters.\n* Interactions involving income inequalities.\n\nIf any of this interests you, please send me a message explaining a bit about your own roleplay background, and what you\u2019re looking for in a writing partnership. At that point, we can discuss our ideas further on Discord, Skype, Hangouts, or another platform of your choice.\n\nThanks again for your time!",

            "selftext": "Hello /Roleplay, I\u2019m looking for a partner (just one at the moment so I\u2019ll be a bit picky) to be the player to my GM. \n\n\nAs it says above- this is not an original setting. We will be using Rokugan. The setting of The Legend of the Five Rings. Currently owned by Fantasy Flight Games, L5R is a long running tabletop rpg and card game. You do not have to be familiar with the setting, I don\u2019t mind teaching/explaining! But you do need to be willing to learn, it\u2019s got a bit of meat to it. And you do not need to have played/know how to play as well simply be writing, no dice rolls or math required!\n\n(heads up, this setting includes forced marriage, suicide, violence, gore, mistreatment of and enforcement of a rigid caste system among these. They will be dealt with maturely and appropriately )\n\nA quick and dirty of the setting- Imagine Game of Throne painted with a broad East Asian brush. An emperor rules over several bickering clans. Allowing them sovereignty in times of peace and intervening when necessary. Politics, war, intrigue, alliances, and betrayal happen non stop in the constantly shifting political landscape. At a top level, Daimyos vie for imperial favor. Vast armies meeting to settle blood feuds, arranged marriages sealing alliances, the silver tongues of the courtiers wheeling and dealing during the illustrious Winter Courts, jockeying for power. At the lower level of nobility, samurai struggle under societal pressure and the inhuman expectations of bushido. Attempting to perform their lord\u2019s orders or die trying. A large peasant caste holds the empire up, farming the food and filling the armies.\n\n\nOutside of structured society- The Great Kaiu Wall holds back the teeming hordes of shadowlands creatures. Spirit realms intercede the mortal realm. Odd gaijin ships show up on the horizon, bristling with profane goods and blasphemous beliefs. Bloodspeakers make pacts with Oni. Conspiracies plot to overthrow the celestial order- and more!\n\n\nThis is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Rokugan. You will be playing a samurai in one of the great clans. Striving to serve your lord while balancing your personal desires. Which clan do you serve? Do you value your ancestors or the Kami more? Does every tenant of bushido hold the same weight, or are some less important? \n\n\n\nHopefully this has whet your appetite! If you are interested message me and we can go into more detail. We will discuss and if you\u2019re a good fit we can have a short \u2018character creation\u2019 where I\u2019ll help establish your character in the settings.\n\n\nIn your message please include details about yourself, your time zone, your familiarity with the setting, and anything else you deem relevant!\n\n\nThank you dearly for your time, and have a great day!\n",

            "selftext": "Welcome to anyone interested! As the title suggests, the roleplay advertised is set in the 4th Era of elder scrolls, set roughly in the time of Skyrim's game events, 4e203.\n\nThe Group is an established roleplay that has existed and expanded for over 3 years, bringing together a combination of the Elder Scrolls' rich lore and history, as well as the in-game occurances being altered or completed in the room's history to make for a well-populated world of player characters, all able to intertwine in their own plotlines across the continent of Tamriel. \n\nThe roleplay is written in 3rd person, past-tense format. There aren\u2019t any strict formatting rules besides that, and there is no requirement of dice-rolling, experience building, or chance elements, the focus is the story and character development through and through! All that is required of members is a knowledge of Elder Scrolls (Skyrim at the very least, preferably), and a good ability to write and tell stories together! Thank you for reading!

As the title suggests, the roleplay advertised is set in the 4th Era of elder scrolls, set roughly in the time of Skyrim's game events, 4e203.\n\nThe Group is an established roleplay that has existed and expanded for over 3 years, bringing together a combination of the Elder Scrolls' rich lore and history, as well as the in-game occurances being altered or completed in the room's history to make for a well-populated world of player characters, all able to intertwine in their own plotlines across the continent of Tamriel.\n\nThe roleplay is written in 3rd person, past-tense format. All that is required of members is a knowledge of Elder Scrolls (Skyrim at the very least, preferably), and a good ability to write and tell stories together! Thank you for reading! The link below is for anybody interested in joining! The group covers most timezones, with the majority of activity being in the afternoon/night time of GMT.\n\nWe look forward to new members!\n\n \\- Oz\n\n  \n[https://discord.gg/4RFd5BB](https://discord.gg/4RFd5BB)",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

            "selftext": " \n\nDisclaimer: Based on the book *The Host*\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since a parasitic and alien species came to earth, taking over the bodies of humans to use as their own and effectively wiping out a chunk of the population. They tunnel their way into humans, kill them from the inside out and take over. Some are able to fight it, living with a half-consciousness of their own and half with an alien inside of them. There is an underground safe house, a small town if you can call it that, where it is supposedly safe to stay. You find yourself there, either as a resident or a passerby trying to outrun humanities biggest predator. Will this be the end, or is there still a sliver of hope that we can take our world back?\n\n\\------\n\nHello All,\n\nThanks for reading our plot! My BFF and I have created this RP based loosely off the Host. If interested, you will be able to play either a regular human or a split - human character. For fair warning, if you play a human you will be at risk for \u2018infestation\u2019, if you will. If you choose a split-human, you will have to play for both your human and your alien. There may be side effects to having an alien inhabitant, though, so choose wisely. We want this RP to be small, 10 people at most. We have planned events for this RP, and while there will be room for plenty of creativity there are certain events that characters will be forced to deal with and react too, but the reaction is up to you.\n\nWe do expect a certain level of literacy, so we would like to ask for anyone interested to please PM me with either a writing sample (which could be anything you\u2019ve already written or wrote on the spot. There is no length requirement, and I honestly don\u2019t want to read a novel, so just send what you think accurately shows your writing skill!) or a short character sheet with an idea you have for your character. This can be as detailed or plain as you want, but you will have to make a formal character sheet once accepted.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello there, I\u2019m looking for someone else to join me in a D&amp;D style high fantasy adventure. If possible I\u2019d like my partner to kinda co-dm with me, meaning we could each take NPCs as are appropriate to make RPing smooth with our characters and NPCs as time goes. If my partner has ideas for arcs in the story, by all means take charge! I\u2019m always open to seeing what things people can come up with for the story. \n\nI\u2019d like to imagine that I\u2019m not toooo picky in finding an RP partner\u2014 I want someone who is literate and can put together some solid responses. Although I know that sometimes in times of dialogue or action sometimes you have to make things brief because others actions are important. I like first person writing, but I\u2019m not strict about it, if someone else likes third person, I\u2019m perfectly capable of switching over. \n\nKnowledge about Dungeons and Dragons isn\u2019t important\u2014 I just want an RP set in a high fantasy\u2014 knights and wizards and rangers against monsters and bandits world. Some dnd knowledge does help so I don\u2019t have to explain what a kobold or a gnoll are. Heh. \n\nI\u2019m fine with the characters getting romantic after appropriate character development. I don\u2019t want to play out any of the nsfw stuff\u2014 if the characters ever get to that point\u2014we could just cut to the next morning. \n\nI do have a world I\u2019ve been building and a character I\u2019m wanting to play, which is my whole reason for making my own post rather than just messaging someone else who wants to play fantasy. \n\nMy character, likely named Rayn, is an ordinary farmer/apprentice/something low end in a small village. He\u2019s trained with a sword but is by no means ready to go out and start killing monsters\u2014 maybe a goblin or a kobold here or there but that\u2019s it. One day he finds a magical staff (which I can explain to my partner once we set up the world some or I can leave it secretive so they can learn at the same time their character does) and with this staff Rayn is able to start to harness magical abilities. The only problem is, when he channels the magic of the staff, it changes Rayn into a female form of himself until the magic has finished, and then for an undetermined amount of time after. Hijinks ensue. (My phone autocorrected hijinks ensue to bikinis ensue... what does it know that I don\u2019t)\n\nThen something can happen to his town or home or family yadda yadda that forces him to go on an adventure where it becomes a journey to save the world. \n\nThere\u2019s lots of rolls to take, you could be his friend from the village, maybe they\u2019ve always had some feelings for each other but have never really had the nerve to bring it up, or maybe you\u2019re a ranger in the woods near where he finds the staff that helps him out of a jam and then you reluctantly agree to go with him after bad stuff happens to his town. \n\nWe can also design a couple other primary NPCs to travel with us (cuz most adventuring groups usually have a well rounded 4 people) which could allow us to have a couple other characters to play in the story, and they could be replaceable if they\u2019ve served their purpose. \n\nI don\u2019t want anyone under 18 if for when the characters may get closer to one another, I\u2019m in my early 30s but I\u2019d suggest the characters be in their late teens early twenty\u2019s. Yknow. Young adventurers. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, bless you and feel free to message me and I\u2019ll see if we can get this game brought to life. ",

A man dressed like Robin [https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/File:TCGCipher_Robin_(male)_01.png] from Fire Emblem: Awakening as best he can comes out of a con's panel, and finds himself being randomly approached by a girl dressed as Morgan [https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/File:TCGCipher_Morgan_(female)_02.jpg], who stays in character pretty well.\n\nWhile I use the word silly, I don't mean I want to have jokes out the wazoo. Just that this isn't going to be too serious a session, and I wanted to have fun with this idea that popped into my head. Hopefully you do too.\n\nI've only been to one Otakon and three Blizzcons, so I don't have the widest array of experience with these. If you want to help me expand on what could go on at a con, that'd be appreciated. Either way, I have a few ideas for what we can do that does not involve 'and then they sat at a panel. It was entertaining.' or the like.\n\nMy preferred methods of RP are on Reddit, whether that's chat or PMs.",

            "selftext": "So i was looking into old lore on League and it inspired me to create an RP around one of my favorite plotlines, a plotline that unfortunately was never really fleshed out. For context, i dont want to copy league lore, merely using this particular plotline as an inspiration. The marriage between Tryndamere, the barbarian king, and Ashe, the frost queen.\nEssebtially i want an adventure romance set within our characters shared homeland, the frozen north. Shattered into tribes and warring factions, the land is under constant threat from more civilised nations. In recent years there has been a few shifts in power with a few key players hoping to unify the north.\nOn one hand, a barbarian prince linked to ancient royal blood has been battling his way across the north. Every tribe he encounters, he conquers the strongest amongst them and absorbs them into his own tribe. Legendary for his skill with a blade and feared far and wide for his unshakable battle fury, he is the last of a magically gifted bloodline of old, a true berserker.\nOn the other, a young woman has been uniting tribes through diplomacy and garnishing trade amidst them. Her hopes are to overthrow the dominant faction and bring lasting peace to the north. She is blessed with the gift to create weapons of blessed ice, and is rumored to be a descendant of a long dead warrior queen who once ruled the north.\nOne day, the barbarian prince discovers her tribe, and makes a single offer.\nThe Frost Queen's hand in marriage, and a unity of every tribe he has conquered and her own. Though not of love at first, the arranged marriage blossoms and becomes of romantic interest to both. A marriage of convenience suddenly becomes ever more serious.\n\nI do ask that my partner be 18+ and is generally okay with adult themes such as accurate violence and sexual themes. The story is meant to follow the twos romance as well as the drama unfolding as rival clans and  enemy nations. ",

            "selftext": "Having a cute son can become an immediate chick magnet for a guy.  I\u2019m looking to play as a single dad and have a few different starters below for what hopefully becomes a long term romance roleplay.  Hopefully this post is okay for this sub?\n\nPlease note that in this roleplay I am NOT in any way looking to include a young child in any sexual activity.  It is simply a plot point.  I\u2019m not into any illegal underage acts.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ll be playing as a 27-29 year old guy with a son in the 3-5 range.  Below are a couple opening scenarios that I\u2019m hoping can lead into a long term roleplay.  As you\u2019ll see, some are more specific and detailed, while some are more open ended.\n\n*Family Friends*\nWe grew up on the same street, even though I\u2019m about 8 years older than you.  Our families got very close and when parents moved away I had established myself here so I stayed.  I\u2019ve got a son that I still bring by to see your parents off and they love babysitting or taking him to lunch.  Your boyfriend thinks that you have a thing for me, and that I want to get into your pants. \n\n*The Beach*\nYou\u2019re at the beach with some friends when you see a little boy that looks familiar.  Upon second glance you realize it\u2019s your older sister\u2019s friend\u2019s son.  You decide to come over and say hi to him, and introduce yourself to me. (Also open to playing this out at the mall, bowling, or a carnival/county fair.)\n\n*The Babysitter*\nYou babysit for my son\u2019s mother.  We\u2019ve never met but one day she tells you that his father will be coming to pick him up to take him for a long weekend.  When I get to her apartment we chat for a few minutes, and maybe get a bit flirty.  You find me on Facebook through her friends and add me, then send me a message.\n\n*Pumpkin Picking*\nYou and your college roommate/friend are in full basic white girl mode with your leggings and uggs taking selfies at the pumpkin patch.  Having some fun, I send him over to try and pick up a pumpkin that\u2019s clearly way to heavy for him and watch the humor that ensues.  Me and you (and your friend?) start talking and decide t hang out.\n\n*Tinder*\nWe had been chatting on Tinder for about a week and decided to finally meet up for lunch and/or a drink.  At the last minute I have t chance because my ex has to drop him (who i hadn\u2019t mentioned yet) off with me.  You say to just bring him along.\n\n*Daycare/Pre School*\nYou can be a teacher? Another parent? Perhaps an older sister that sometimes picks up and/or drops off?\n\nMessage me to start discussing details! I\u2019m looking for probably 1-3 paragraphs in roleplaying, possibly a bit more if setting up a new scene in it.\n",

I have been known to do as many as 30+ if my partner is into it\n\n\n- I like to use google docs the most, but I am open to discord. Chatting can be on discord, hangouts, Skype - in that order. \n\n\n- Smut is fine, unless I\u2019m playing the male, then I fade to black. \n\n\n- I like gut wrenching , dramatic plots. I like for my partner to add twists and turns with me. I like to make us FEEL for our characters. \n\n\n- you should be able to post at least every other day. If not daily. (Obviously with exceptions)\n\n\n\nSome plot ideas I have starters and ideas for: \n\n- A modern day political drama , where love crosses party lines and the media mayhem that follows and the societal pressure. \n\n\n- A mafia arranged marriage, where our characters develop a genuine connection, but in order to preserve one another\u2019s life they have to continue to hold up a tough exterior. \n\n\n- A soldier returning home with PTSD and he starts to destroy his family from the inside out upon his return. \n\n\n- Unrequited love rekindling years later. \n\n",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello there!\n\nI've been in the search for a RP partner for a while now. To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, Pokemon and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind). (Admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am mainly looking for as a partner. And hopefully one who has no limits, like me.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me!\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have to urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)",

            "selftext": "Good (whatever time of day it is for you)! As the title of this ad notes, I'm looking to RP some lines within the Pok\u00e9mon game/anime-verse, and I'm seeking to keep the anime's lighthearted and cheery mood. Over-the-top adventure, copious humor and comedy, witty/snarky banter, meaningful conflict (no constant bleakness or perpetual angst), quiet moments of character growth, good battles, romance (I'm cool with smut, but I wouldn't want it to be the proverbial endgame), our characters genuinely having fun and enjoy each other's company, that sort of thing. (And in full disclosure, I do have a present preference for canon x OC lines. I know I'm trash.)\n\n***All partners must be 21+ years old, and all characters must be written/played as 21 years old if they aren't already older. Also, I'm only looking to roleplay over E-mail.***\n\n[This RoleplayGateway post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/9auwtv/vyces_roleplay_gateway_profile/) has all my OOC info, so I won't repost it here. (You're welcome for that. :P) Instead, let me note what I'm **not** looking to involve in any such lines...\n\n\u2620 *Mere glancing familiarity with the setting.* I'm asking partners to have fairly up-to-date knowledge on the games/anime (at least Gen 4 or 5) so we aren't significantly restricted regarding location or what Pok\u00e9mon we involve in a line.\n\n\u2620 *Making Pok\u00e9mon \"darker and edgier\".* I'm fine with a Pok\u00e9mon Origins-type tone sometimes. Something with a dark or self-serious bleak tone fitting Pok\u00e9mon Apok\u00e9lypse, however? That's not really my cup of tea.\n\n\u2620 *Fixating on game mechanics (mechanics of levels, stats, movesets, IVs, etc).*\n\n\u2620 *Enforcing the games' \"Four Moves of Doom\" limit.* Considering the anime doesn't and the games only do so for the sake of memory, why should we? :P Let's just have it so a Pok\u00e9mon can use--and learn--any of their given moves (which could be part of a plot in itself).\n\n\u2620 *Dry or one-sentence battle descriptions.* I'm certainly not demanding every single nuance receive a paragraph, but I **am** requesting partners be willing to describe moves and battles much like the anime. Just writing/reading *\"(Name of Pok\u00e9mon) used (name of attack)!\"* all the time gets boring, you know?\n\nI have a few general and open-ended ideas here to set the stage, but I'm certainly open to hearing yours...\n\n\u25d3 **The typical Pok\u00e9mon journey** is always a classic fave, our characters just traveling and having highspirited adventures fitting the series in general. (In this case, I'd prefer an *in media res* approach where both our characters are already fairly seasoned and experienced, bringing up their greenhorn days if needed.) Perhaps our characters have been traveling a long time together, or have just started doing so.\n\n\u25d3 **Perhaps one of our characters are a member of Team \\[fill-in-the-blank\\] while the other's a trainer they're tailing for whatever reason**, but they end up battling on a regular basis and ultimately falling for each other? (Think a similar version of the dynamic Ash has with the TR trio, only with some romance added to the mix.)\n\n\u25d3 **One--or both--of our characters are Gym Leaders, Frontier Brains, Elite Four members, Team Rocket members, Top Coordinators and the like.** Maybe exploring the day-to-day deal behind being one of the greats, from training their chosen creatures to dealing with some cocky greenhorns wanting to challenge \u2018em.\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters initially meet battling over a Pok\u00e9mon.** Perhaps they each have a fair case for capture, forcing a temporary team-up if the target's exceptionally clever. Or maybe they join forces to deal with a third party trying to Pok\u00e9-block them?\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters are part of an elite academy for Pok\u00e9mon trainers.** Think Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s answer to Hogwarts or something like that.\n\nNow, I'd love to find a partner willing to play Misty, Jessie, Bianca, Fantina, Georgia, Burgundy, Delia Ketchum, or Iris from the Pokemon anime.\n\nBut there are some non-Pok\u00e9mon canon ladies I'd love to see transplanted into the setting: Mai Shiranui (*King of Fighters*); Peach, Daisy (*Mario*); Korra, Kuvira (*Legend of Korra*); Elsa (*Frozen*); Hermione, Ginny (*Harry Potter*); Suki, Ty Lee, Azula (*Avatar*); Mai Valentine, Ishizu Ishtar (*Yugioh*).\n\nSo if interested in this, please feel free to send me a PM!",

I have been RPing for 15 years now (Since the time of the Yahoo Instant Messenger RPs!...before they got rid of the user rooms). \n\nI have been searching for someone who can Roleplay as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. But heres the catch. I use an Original Character...but fear not! I don't make Mary Sue characters and I have been working on a full bio for my OC that\u00a0 I use just for the Dragonball franchise. It would be post Frieza Saga and go off in an Alternate Universe (no Trunks and the androids will probably come but it'll end up different) and it WILL be a romance! With action and adventure. Fights will be slightly included but if it gets too long we can time skip and try to figure out who is the winner between the characters.. Any more questions about this don't be afraid to ask me!\n\nNow, Rules... I am pretty lienient when it comes to Roleplays. Some literacy is a MUST. Of course we all make grammar mistakes (I know I make quite a bit as I look at myself typing this out lol). I do Semi paragraph to multi paragraph replies and starting posts as well full of detail. I would hope and wish that someone out there would be willing to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0also, this is in 3rd person. This will be romance like I have stated..but if you need to do a time skip through the lovey dovey bits please dont hesitate to tell me and we can time skip. Also...please DO NOT GOD MOD. its annoying.. Also...PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I know real life gets in the way and I'm understanding of that (trust me I work 40 hours a week I understand lol) I LOVE fast repliers they make me really happy trust me. If you get uninterested please just let me know I wont be mad I promise. also..PLOTTING. I love to plot out an idea that you might have or I might have before installing it into the RP.\u00a0also about my OC I can tell you alot more about her if you are interested and I can even supply artwork of her as well.\n\nWell that seems to be the lot of it! I think I remembered everything...I hope I remembered everything lol. But please if you are interested hit me up with a PM or comment here and please don't be shy to ask me questions! I am always happy to answer any questions regarding everything I'm looking for. I hope I hear from someone!! Thanks!",

            "selftext": "Hi! Looking for a RP parter to show me the ropes when it comes to role playing, I understand the main concept of role playing. I\u2019m into most things and looking for someone who loves fallout and Skyrim as much as me. \n\nLooking a long lasting, detailed story with a male or female. The story can be from farmers and merchants, to thieves and adventures. I\u2019m a big fan of both games so don\u2019t mind either. This my first time role playing but I do understand the concept. Hoping to find someone who\u2019s okay with sexual intercourse and romance with him the story \n\nI\u2019d love to hear new ideas or anything people have always wanted to try as an RP, I don\u2019t mind. The story can go for as long as you like or as short as you want. \n\nSkyrim ideas: A farmers, living simple lives. Could be a couple living as friends, they run into trouble with bandits, live a secret life maybe? Have a secret behind the farm? \n\nTwo bandits raiding camps and farms, might stumble into a hero, might get a little drunk one night at their camp?\n\n\nSimple merchants travelling Tamriel. \n\nYou can probably add the same ideas into the fallout category but with different concepts.\n\nLooking forward to hear back from you! \n\n\n\nP.S, just trying to fill in the 300 hundred word limit, I hope to find someone with an open mind and can maybe show me the ropes (sorry if it sounds like I\u2019m repeating myself) Hope to hear back from you! \n",

We cool? Cool.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just can't get enough of these stories, especially with the best pairing (fight me) Shy nerd x Popular Guy. Especially if the former of which also expresses interest in many artistic things, such as drawing, painting, writing or otherwise, likewise with fashion but there... male clothes can be awfully restrictive in how they can look, female clothes do look much much better on them!\n\n\nSo, a TL:DR, I just want a fluffy coming out of the closet story where a shy nerdy type is accepting the fact that he does not really like girls for other things than their clothing of which he adores and wishes he could wear more of!

The characters listed offer a broad range for genres and scenarios. \n\nNow let's go onto the boring rules part of the post. I ask that my partner be very literate and able to write quite a bit. I absolutely love having a bunch of details. I also ask that you be open to any NSFW themes. I do enjoy not having limits to the roleplay experience since it allows me to fully involve myself in my character's role. I hope I don't sound too demanding!\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message.

That said, my schedule varies; though, I will get at least one good post a day, if not more.

I'd like to know how often you reply, but it's not an issue for me.\n* You're literate and you write 2+ paragraphs per reply.  You don't use italics for actions or speech.\n\nSo, that's it! Pretty simple. My ideas!\n\n\\*\\*Hunter and Sympathiser\\*\\*\n\nMy character is fascinated by nature and animals of all kinds- that includes the monsters that walk their world. She's dedicating her life to studying them and vehemently argues against the extinction desired by most of the populous. She's been tracking a rather rare species for a while now and finds a few bounty letters searching for hunters to kill the very beast she so desperately desires to see. For all her defacing of the letters, your character has managed to find one whole and plans to fulfill the contract. They meet. They... do not get along.\n\n\\*\\*Slice of Life In a Magical Medieval World\\*\\*\n\nJust what it sounds like. I've never played slice of life because I've never felt the desire to write in our regular world, but I think it could be fun to just play two 'regular' people in a world that we build together in character. Maybe eventually something fun and big and adventurous happens, or maybe it's just the ups and downs of living in a world with interesting hardships.\n\n\\*\\*TLOU\\*\\*\n\nMy character has been infected and there's no immunity to save her. She was found on a sweep by some of the other folk at your camp, and in a show of mercy, brought her back. You're guarding her 'room', a glorified cell. They chat through the wall. My character is absolutely going to die. It's your choice on whether it ends when that happens or if my character gives yours a last request and sends you on a journey where they'll meet another character (or more) of mine.",

JUST DM ME :)*\\*\n\nI am 32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job during the week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is to roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters (IRL gender doesn't matter).\n\nPlease be prepared for picture usage. I've done writing descriptions for a while, but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC (especially Arrowverse/MCU), Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon Age, etc. Anything else unlisted is better to bring them my way and see if I know them. If any above appeal, feel free to come my way.\n\nSome literacy at a minimum makes me happy, third person only, past tense. I am also VERY reasonable with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I am very nice, I promise, and I want to get niceties out of people in turn. Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a chance! Treat people the way you want to be treated, right?\n\nI do work during the day, so posting will be sporadic, but I am good at night and on weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day or more.\n\nI am usually on from sometime in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours. I hope to talk to all of you soon! :)\n\n***Current Desire: I am really interested in the \"intersex opposite a female\" perspective. Modern is a big medium I could see following through. I have ideas involving that most festive time of the year where romance is the least one can expect to find among many other things. There's also supernatural angles such as \"a goddess walks the Earth to find a worshipper,\" or a ghost gives the friendliest haunt to her new tenant, or a witch finds odd romance in the style of Bewitched or Practical Magic or Simply Irresistible. Please message me for this or any other ideas above in the post!***",

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm likely not your guy.\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something sci-fi/mech related. I'm a **massive** fan of mobile suit gundam, and most of the series that follow the namesake. There are some other things I like in that genre too, but gundam is just...well, it's my favorite. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for anything in a universe from one of the gundam series (not that I'll say no), I'm more or less looking for something *inspired* by it. Mechs, a massive war spanning the solar system and more, I could go on. Of course, I don't intend for the story to just surround the machines and pilots- I'd love to work strings of romance and drama in there, as well.\n\nAs a short aside, if anyone has played Xenogears, that's a setting I'd love to play around with, as well. But I won't say much more than that herbeing, this post is already long enough.\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)\n\nEdit: I should probably say I'm *not* looking for anything revolving around psychological themes. While I don't mind Evangelion, it's not a series I like to pull inspiration and themes from.",

You crave to have someone, a companion that loves you unconditionally and won't cheat on you with a Krogan from clan Urdnot. It's impossible though, or at least it used to be. Now with Intergalactic Harmony, you can find the partner of your dreams. You can sort through species, gender, age, and occupation. Maybe you want to marry an Elcor or settle down with an Asari justicar, Intergalactic Harmony will find you the love of your life. Commander Shepard even said that this is his favorite dating service on the Citadel.\n\nA silly little idea popped into my head as I read some Mass Effect comics, and thus I came up with this prompt. This will be a Mass Effect roleplay with our own original characters, unless you want to roleplay a canon character. The characters will have met through a dating app and meet at the Citadel or Omega for a date. \u00a0You can play any species, and I'll probably stick to Quarian or Drell. I'm obviously wanting some romance for this prompt as well as some adult themes. If you're interested, just send me a message.",

I've roleplayed this before (shoutout to the old Neopets roleplay days), and am itching for another one. Please PM or comment if you're interested in a group roleplay. Hopefully we can find a few people willing to play around with this theme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also ask that people do not write one-line responses. Please keep this a lit.+ roleplay. I like developing character relationships and powers and drama, and that can't really be done if someone is simply writing short responses every time. Thanks!",

Sometimes I want to do super specific roleplays based on a book I\u2019ve read or I want to craft something together, based on an idea for a world or a character or a certain theme. \n\nI try not to take it too seriously, and can spend a lengthy amount of time worldbuilding before I actually roleplay. \n\nI only ever play as a female, just a preference. Though, I\u2019m happy to play Male characters on the side if they add flavour to our roleplay! I can get super attached and when I have a feel for it I can play any character. \n\nI\u2019m currently reading a lot of books, I\u2019m currently reading a series by Maggie Stiefvater, it\u2019s werewolf themed and I think I\u2019d love to do a romanceish roleplay based on that. \n\nWith discord, we can make a server together for the both of us (and potentially a group if I meet more than one likeminded partner) to organise our roleplay. I\u2019m a sucker for that. \n\nI\u2019m recently turned 18 so I can do mature themes, but I don\u2019t want to jump into smut unless we\u2019re close partners and we have a reason to. \n\nThanks all! xo",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. The latter is a big craving at the moment. I wonder why.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here",

            "selftext": "It has been a whole thirty years since the Great Rift. If you haven't heard of it, you either have been living under a rock, or you literally were born yesterday. That day, eyewitnesses reported a giant.. tear in the sky. Many people described it as beautiful, while others described it as horrifyingly ominous. The rift brought nothing.. or so it seemed before closing moments later. Over the next few days, many people with special abilities begin springing up all over the place. A small town librarian with the ability to make her skin turn into the material she was touching, a high school athlete that could protrude his bones from his body and use them as weapons, and even a fifth grader that could grow wings and fly away. Politicians disagreed over what should be done about them, and eventually the nation grew truly divided. One side, now called the Federation believed that metahumans should be studied and given a chance to be citizens or better. The other side, the Kingdom, wanted metahumans separate from regular people and believed they shouldn't be treated as regular people either. We were both unlucky enough to be born in the Kingdom. Metahumans in the Kingdom were placed in prison camps and either worked to death, or scouted to work for the Kingdom's government. I've been in this particular camp for 4 years, and as I was out in the yard reading, I heard the engine of the new arrival bus getting closer.\n\n\nHey! This will be longterm RP featuring, Romance (and by extension sexual content), action, drama, and suggestive themes. It's pretty dark, and will feature sometimes intense violence, drugs and alcohol, heavy sexual themes, and more. If you can't handle this, I would recommend moving on. That being said, these are some things I'm avoiding and looking for.\n\n* No Godmodding!\n* No OP Powers! (Such as stopping time, killing people with one touch, etc..)\n* Please be Literate and Detailed (At least 5 lines.) \n* Come with Ideas for the story as it goes on!\n* Please be fairly active!\n* Communication is Key! \n\n\n\nMessage me if you're interested! Please put at least a little effort into your first message by saying a little about yourself and telling me your favorite animal.\n\n\n",

I live in England, but I'm awake most of the time so don't be too thrown off about it. Imagine I wrote some stuff about how long I've been doing it for. \n\nIn this roleplay. You'd either play as:\n\nSomeone hired to kill him but is in agreement with what he did.\nHis lifelong friend, his AI.\nOr anyone else you'd think of a role for!\nHere's the start of the prompt:\n\nEvery single damn screen in every Federation station, planet, member state, or ship showed the same identical screen. A pale, ghostly white background with details dominating with a piercing black light.\n\nNAME: Omega Trion\nRANK: Fleet Admiral\nAGE: [DATA REDACTED]\nSPECIES: [DATA REDACTED] \nSHIP DETAILS: USS Spectrum.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nx-93681\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trion class\nWEAPONS: (DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ATTACK THE SHIP HEAD ON.

His huge frame. \n\nHowever, what turned the most loved Admiral, teacher, friend and public figure into the most wanted person in Federation history after Khan? Well.. They'd never tell you this. But there were files.. He was never supposed to read them. He did, they concerned the lives of so many innocents he saw it as his duty, yet the Board of Admirals didn't think so. \n\nNow they've hired thousands of assassins, black market under the table armies, soldiers, fleets. All to take him down. Not even neutralise. Kill. No one seemed to comply... Until the martial law was enacted... \n//////////////////////////////////\n\nPrompt over! Any questions or concerns, or if you just wanna give a character profile then continue the prompt go right ahead! This will get dark, most likely, and a lot could happen in the long run.

JUST DM ME :)*\\*\n\nI am 32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job during the week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is to roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters (IRL gender doesn't matter).\n\nPlease be prepared for picture usage. I've done writing descriptions for a while, but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC (especially Arrowverse/MCU), Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon Age, Tomb Raider, Merlin (BBC), etc. Anything else unlisted is better to bring them my way and see if I know them. If any above appeal, feel free to come my way.\n\nSome literacy at a minimum makes me happy, third person only, past tense. I am also VERY reasonable with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I am very nice, I promise, and I want to get niceties out of people in turn. Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a chance! Treat people the way you want to be treated, right?\n\nI do work during the day, so posting will be sporadic, but I am good at night and on weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day or more.\n\nI am usually on from sometime in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours. I hope to talk to all of you soon! :)\n\n***Current Desire: I am really interested in the \"intersex opposite a female\" perspective. Modern is a big medium I could see following through. I have ideas involving that most festive time of the year where romance is the least one can expect to find among many other things. There's also supernatural angles such as \"a goddess walks the Earth to find a worshipper,\" or a ghost gives the friendliest haunt to her new tenant, or a witch finds odd romance in the style of Bewitched or Practical Magic or Simply Irresistible. Please message me for this or any other ideas above in the post!***",
