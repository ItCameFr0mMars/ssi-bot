I have been RPing for 16 years now (Since the time of the Yahoo Instant Messenger RPs!...before they got rid of the user rooms). \n\nI have been searching for someone who can Roleplay as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. But heres the catch. I use an Original Character...but fear not! I don't make Mary Sue characters and I have been working on a full bio for my OC that\u00a0 I use just for the Dragonball franchise. It would be post Frieza Saga and go off in an Alternate Universe (no Trunks and the androids will probably come but it'll end up different) and it WILL be a romance! With action and adventure. Fights will be slightly included but if it gets too long we can time skip and try to figure out who is the winner between the characters.. Any more questions about this don't be afraid to ask me!\n\nNow, Rules... I am pretty lienient when it comes to Roleplays. Some literacy is a MUST. Of course we all make grammar mistakes (I know I make quite a bit as I look at myself typing this out lol). I do Semi paragraph to multi paragraph replies and starting posts as well full of detail. I would hope and wish that someone out there would be willing to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0also, this is in 3rd person. This will be romance like I have stated..but if you need to do a time skip through the lovey dovey bits please dont hesitate to tell me and we can time skip. Also...please DO NOT GOD MOD. its annoying.. Also...PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I know real life gets in the way and I'm understanding of that (trust me I work 40 hours a week I understand lol) I LOVE fast repliers they make me really happy trust me. If you get uninterested please just let me know I wont be mad I promise. also..PLOTTING. I love to plot out an idea that you might have or I might have before installing it into the RP.\u00a0also about my OC I can tell you alot more about her if you are interested and I can even supply artwork of her as well.\n\nWell that seems to be the lot of it! I think I remembered everything...I hope I remembered everything lol. But please if you are interested hit me up with a PM or comment here and please don't be shy to ask me questions! I am always happy to answer any questions regarding everything I'm looking for. I hope I hear from someone!! Thanks!",

Some of these ideas can lead to some dark themes and violence. All the good stuff. \n\nI would like to play a male. I can also play female however. If romance is a thing you want to happen then I'm only interested in MxF or FxF. This point might not be too important as it's possible some of the rps here can utilize multiple characters.\n\nPlease be able to reply regularly. I would like to feel like the rp is actually going somewhere. I will reply as much as I can even though I have odd hours.\n\nI don't care about the length of replies as long as they're good ones.\n\nThe ideas!\n\n* Supernatural western. Ghosts, ghouls, werewolves, vampires, the occult, and even more is possible here! This is the most loose rp idea I have, as we can start it off in a number of undecided ways. Are our characters outlaws? Lawmen? Simple ranchers? You decide! Hit me up with your idea for how you'd like to start this one.\n\n* Medieval fantasy world jumping. Our characters both find a portal on their world. They go through it and find themselves in a maze full of portals, each one leading to a new world. This rp has established lore and rules for the maze and is less loose than the previous one.\n\n* Apocalyptic medieval fantasy world. This rp has the most established lore to it. Basically, demons and beasts have destroyed much of civilization. There is only one city left untouched, and that's where the resistance is. They send parties to the mainland to save people, and maybe even hope to find the way to end the chaos and destruction brought by the demonic invaders.\n\nIf any of these sound interesting to you then send a message over and I'll set up a discord server.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! Recently, I\u2019ve had a craving to try a NieR: Automata roleplay after thinking about the game again. I\u2019m looking for anyone at all who would be interested in playing a story out with me, as I\u2019ve come up with a couple of ideas I\u2019d like to use. \n\nI have completed Automata and reached the true ending, so I am fairly familiar with the game. On the other hand, I know the bare basics of the original NieR game and even barer basics about the Drakengard series. If you would like to include any references to Automata\u2019s precursors in our roleplay, please keep in mind that I don\u2019t have a huge amount of experience with them. \n\nFor characters, I was hoping to use OCs. I planned on playing an OC YoRHa unit (male model/programming) that is also an original type (the F Type units I will mention shortly). I am willing to change or adapt my plans though. For your character, I\u2019m happy to give you plenty of freedom. If you want to play an original character or a canon character, I don\u2019t mind either way. If you create an OC, I don\u2019t really mind what their gender, type (I did have a second vaguely original type in mind for my main idea, but I\u2019m more than willing to adapt), appearance, or whatever else they have is, as long as it mostly fits in with the game. If you would like to include a romance between our characters, I would much prefer that you play a female over a male.\n\nMy main idea for the story would take place some amount of time before the start of Automata. During this time, it was the job of the F (Fighter) series units and the R (Reclaimer) type units to recover any left behind YoRHa materials from previous operations or battles. With the combat support of the R Types, the F Types go into an area first to clear it of any threats. The R types take over after and start the recovery efforts of YoRHa property, whether that involves taking back physical materials, or hacking to regain any lost information. Incase you haven\u2019t finished the game, I won\u2019t reveal the true intentions behind these recovery efforts, but just know that any information regarding that is limited to the Commander\u2019s eyes only. But, our characters will be a part of one of these recovery squads, with each of us possibly taking the role of an F Unit (which the character I have planned is) and an R Unit. If you don\u2019t want to be completely limited to just playing an R unit (assuming that we rigidly follow this idea), maybe we could have two characters each? So we could play both an F and an R unit. Maybe you want us both to be F units or both to be R units? Maybe you want to play a completely different type? I\u2019m happy to adapt and change any parts of this main idea to whatever you\u2019d like. I also have not covered every detail of this idea yet, so adding some of your own or replacing others is more than welcome.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like that idea at all, I would be happy to create a new one with you, or use one of your own. Don\u2019t hold back on sharing any ideas you have.\n\nOne important thing I would like to mention is that I understand that real life things are important. I won\u2019t deny that I\u2019m a bit of a slow writer myself, so if you have to take a heap of time writing out responses because of work, education or other obligations, that\u2019s fine. Please just show the same respect to me.\n\nAs for writing styles, please have decent grammar and general writing skills. You don\u2019t have to write an entire novel for each response if you don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t expect that and I can\u2019t exactly do that myself. A good paragraph is enough for me, though I\u2019d have no problem at all if you\u2019d like to write more than that, I would even encourage it. I usually write 1-3 (most of the time 2) decent paragraphs, but I\u2019m working on improving that stat. My regular writing style is third person.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, please DM me here on reddit so we can exchange Discord usernames. I\u2019d be happy to go into more detail and you can ask me any questions you\u2019d like to. I look forward to roleplaying with you!\n",

Courting and drama and all the fun stuff! Can also have other darker elements too, super open to ideas and very easy going on my end. We can do OC\u2019s or cannon, I don\u2019t mind whatever you prefer! If we fo cannons, however, my two go tos are Margaery and Cersei. Maybe the early years where Cersei was a newly wed to Robert, or an alternative world where Joffrey survived and he\u2019s married to Margaery. Maybe Margaery didn\u2019t marry Tommen and instead fell in love with a new character. Unlimited ideas here and super happy to chat and explore with you! \n\nI do write in 3rd person, I love character growth and drama, and I also enjoy descriptive rp.

My OC is a girl who has Asperger's and her special interest is music, so maybe we can have a plot where the ocs meet through music somehow. I have a bio and pictures for my oc, and I expect you to have one as well or at least the willingness to make one and have photos.   I'm 19 and would prefer that all ocs and participants be over 18. I'm not insanely picky on length, just try to manage like... 4+ sentences? Also, 3rd person literate style only please. If I don't reply tonight, I'm most likely asleep as it's 3:30 am here. \n\nNote: I got rid of my old discord, but I do have a new one SO if any of my old rp partners wanna hmu to RP just message me! New people as well, please do message me and if you have any questions about Asperger's, I'll do my best to answer questions based on experience and research. \n\nIf you are offended by people rping as mentally ill OCS when they don't have that illness or disorder, please do not waste your time with messaging me.

            "selftext": "Hi! First things first, I'm **really** tired of getting low effort, shallow responses, so please understand that I most likely won't respond to your message unless you actually apply some effort. Sorry!\n\nAnyways, I'm more than happy to introduce my true self once we've discussed being partners and everything. But, for now, I'm 18+ and from the United States! I work full-time but I still have plenty of free time to write, which is why I'm looking for an awesome partner. I roleplay exclusively as a GM/DM, which means that I fulfill the role of a storyteller and narrator whilst my partner controls only a single character that acts as the protagonist of our little story. I bring an array of compelling characters and fantastic storytelling ability, and my aim is to always invoke as much emotion as possible.\n\nI (obviously) write in the third person and past tense. I will respond **no less than five times per day**, although it will likely be significantly more if the writing is fun and we mesh well. I don't ask that you reply nearly as much but I would prefer it if you can't reach a similar frequency. My posts will range from one-hundred to one-thousand words, depending on the scenario and whether I'm busy or not, but I'll always give you something to keep you on the edge of your seat!\n\nFor you, all I ask is that you're passionate about writing and that you're not just looking for someone to kill time with for a week. I also do not like being catfished, lied to, being used for sexual fulfillment, and other scummy bullshit like that, so please understand that I would like a level of honesty and transparency between us. Beyond that, I would like us to be actual friends rather than just distant strangers that write together. I'll tell you my real name, what I do, and I'll even show you who I am if you're interested! \n\nNow, onto the actual RP stuff! I prefer to roleplay in pre-existing universes, fandoms essentially, and I avoid the us of canon characters. I'm not opposed to doing original scenarios in the real world though! Here are some ideas I wouldn't mind:\n\n* Star Wars (The Old Republic)\n* World of Warcraft (Pre-Current Era)\n* Red Dead-esque (Western Scenario)\n* Semi-Modern *or* Modern Crime Scenario (Peaky Blinders, Sons of Anarchy, Etc)\n* Law Enforcement or Vigilante (Did someone say Space Cops?)\n* Some sort of Magic Academy (Harry Potter, Wizard101, Skyrim Mages College, Etc)\n* Historical Scenario (Rome, WWI, WWII, Civil War, etc)\n\nAnd plenty more! I honestly forget 3/4 of my ideas whenever I write these, so it's likely better if we just discuss them.\n\nAs I state, I roleplay exclusively as a GM or DM. I'll build a wonderful universe for you to explore and I bring a system of consequences and rewards based on the decisions of you/your character. All of my own characters, whether they're a friend or foe, are always subject to death or injury. While I don't require your character to be subject to consequences as severe as those, I do like to '*encourage*' my partner to make good, well-thought decisions for the sake of the story and their character!\n\nWe'll have a lot to discuss if you're interested! Message me if you'd like to get started or if you have any questions. Please, please, please introduce yourself if you're seriously interested in being my partner! Thanks! :)",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I have yet to come up with a creative name for this rp, but as the title suggests, it is a modern fantasy based rp. To the everyday human eye, everything looks normal and as it should be. But if you look carefully, or adventure into exotic places, you will discover the supernatural. \n\nIn the early years of humanity, two types of magic thrived. There were the Dragons, and the Protectors. There was nothing to determine what you were, as it was a genetic feature. \n\nThe Dragons were like animals. They were fierce hunters who fought for the thrill of a battle. They had an incredible sense of smell and hearing, and were generally on the offence. Their best defence was their offence. \n\nThe Protectors were the opposite. They were mages driven by the will to protect others who wouldn\u2019t protect themselves. They were pure hearted and wanted nothing more in life than to have a peaceful world. They had a sixth sense, as they could always sense when an attack was coming. Their magic was all based around defending, supporting. But do not doubt their offence for a second. \n\nAs humanity aged, magic became more rare by the second, and the Dragons and Protectors became myths. Folklore. But unknown to most, there were still the odd few who carried that magic. \n\nThis story focuses on two university students. Ever since they were five, they knew they had a magic within them. The female was involved in a car accident when she was five. Her magic saved her, but her family passed away in hospital. She grew up in an orphanage, where she met The Male. He was a dragon, who too was an orphan. He always got into fights and tried to run away, causing trouble with the police. The two eventually became friends, and had always grown up together. \n\nIn high school, they met one professor who took an interest in them. One day after school, he called them to his classroom, where he explained everything to them. About the Dragons and Protectors, and their own powers. They learnt more about themselves, and how to control their abilities. \n\nAs they moved into university, something cold was developing. Amongst the city and the outskirts, someone was awakening a third set of powers, nicknamed the Corrupt. This type of magic was hardly ever heard of, but was never good. It was used for evil intentions, and for their own gain. \n\nNow, the Corrupt was growing in numbers, trying to find all of the Dragons and Protectors, and erasing their magic. No one understood where the sudden increase in Corrupt magic users came from, but it didn\u2019t matter. They had to be stopped before all Dragons and Protectors became extinct. \n\nOur two characters must balance battling the Corrupt, and surviving university work. \n\nThat\u2019s my basic idea! If needed, we could make changes to it. \n\nI\u2019m still a student myself, so my replies may vary. I can always promise to give a few replies a day, so don\u2019t worry. With the Christmas holidays coming up, I\u2019ll have more time! \n\nI would like to include some NSFW scenes to it, but it\u2019s up to you. \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey all! So today I am searching for something a bit different and specific. I have been rewatching Yugioh GX and would love to do an rp involving Chumley Huffington x my OC! This can be M/F or M/ M, whatever you prefer, with you playing Chumley.\n\nHow the plot would work is totally up for discussion! Maybe my character is new to duel academy and Chumley instantly takes a liking to them? Totally open!\n\nWe can also divide up background characters as well like Jaden, Syrus, Bastion, Alexis etc.\n\n\u2b50\u2b50 Here are my rules:\n\n1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.\n\n2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.\n\n3. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.\n\n4. Please keep it plot and romance focused in compliance with this subreddit.\n\nAnd I think that is it! If you are interested, feel free to PM me!\n\nThank you for reading my oddly specific post, and I hope to hear from you soon!\n\n*If you read this entire post, comment 'koala' somewhere in your opening message* \ud83d\udc28\ud83d\udc28\ud83d\udc28",

However recently I have found myself lacking in people to RP with so I thought I'd try here to see if I'd have any luck in finding some new people to create some stories with.\n\nI am 19 years old and I live in Britain and I would consider myself to be alright at roleplaying, I am open to pretty much any genre from sci-fi to fantasy to modern as well as darker themes, I like writing romance RPs (with or without smut.) I roleplay mainly in third person and I only use OCs as I find them easier to play than already established characters if in a fandom setting. I don't really have any requirements except for a good understanding of the English language and how it's used and that the people I RP with be somewhat active so that we can keep the RP going. I've never been fussed about post length, (being guilty of short posts myself.) I also like to get to know the people I'm RPing with a bit and I am pretty open about myself.\n\nI RP almost exclusively on discord and I am active pretty much every day, if you are interested in RPing with me then send me a PM and we can work something out hopefully.  \nKind regards,  \nMorokei.",

Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs are NSFW in parts and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least.\n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here's the things im looking for to RP!\n\nThemes marked with an \\[X\\] are my primary genres.\n\n\u2022 Real Life Romance \\[X\\]\n\n\u2022 Fantasy\n\n\u2022 Sci-Fi \\[X\\]\n\n\u2022 Mecha \\[X\\]\n\n\u2022 Halo \\[X\\]\n\n\u2022 Elder Scrolls\n\n\u2022 Destiny \\[X\\]\n\n\u2022 Superhero \\[X\\]\n\n\u2022 Apocalypse\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon!

A popular local gossip rag starts pitting them against each other to stir up drama and increase sales. Instead of actually giving into the artificial drama, the bands only pretend to feud for shits and giggles and to generate more buzz.\n\n* Character A is a drug addict and their girlfriend just had a baby and passed away during the labor. It\u2019s late. The baby is sickly but alive. Character A has no idea how to take care of it. They\u2019re scared they may have to just leave it outside somewhere. Then, Character A spots Character B sitting at a bus stop or walking down the street. They decide to ask Character B for help.\n\n* Character A is in a bad situation and decides to write about what happening to them and send it to a random address. Character B responds and they begin a long correspondence sharing their lives with each other. Alternatively, their correspondence leads to a long-distance relationship.\n\n* A story based on The Lottery where some of the younger townsfolk try to change the system.\n\n* A stalker plot in which a fan with Erotomania is fixated on someone who\u2019s in the public eye.\n\nHope to hear from some of you guys soon~",

            "selftext": "**Setting:** Modern day Japan (Hakone to be exact). Please do some Googling about the place as well as Japan itself if you're unfamiliar. The season will likely be autumn or winter, depending on what we decide upon together.\n\n**Inspired By:** Tokyo Diner: Midnight Stories, and Hungry Hearts Diner: A Tale of Star-Crossed Souls, an application game.\n\n**My Character:** A young woman in her 20s (we can decide on ages together) works in a Michelin star restaurant in Tokyo. Though she's been single most of her life, she finds herself pining for a real relationship. Her cooking career is fine but to her, it's leaving her with a void that cooking cannot fill anymore. She winds up winning a small but sizable lottery and decides to leave the busy city of Tokyo behind for a calmer lifestyle in hopes of finding her passion again. She opens up a small diner in the small town of Hakone. The small diner is modest and seats about ten people and she begins to find her fire for cooking and connecting to those around her.\n\n**Your Character:** Maybe he's a local. Maybe he's from overseas and is an expat? Or maybe he's from the big bustling city too and also wants to get away from the chaos left behind? Maybe he's also interested in cooking and become my character's appearance. Maybe he's a neighbor or school teacher or fisherman. Maybe he works for a local hotel and sees the diner as competition. Maybe he's just a local who becomes a regular at the diner. It's all up to you.\n\n**Expectations:** We use reddit PMs or discord. I want someone who is okay with 1-2 posts a week, nothing overly speedy is required. Romance and slice of life are gonna be heavy here. This is about something calm and peaceful and totally character focused, not about drama or action or spooky happenings. And typically I like to get 3-5 paragraphs per post on average. \n\n**Closing:** I'm looking for someone who is into something cute and wholesome, someone into a slower pace and is easy to brainstorm with.

            "selftext": "The lanterns outside the farmhouse flickered, protected from the rain by the slight overhang of the roof. Under a dark robe and straw hat, an onlooker surveyed the small residence from where he crouched over a limp bleeding body. It was too bad the old timer had denied his offer. He was sworn to no master, but Kiba had morals. He knew this was the place now though, the man cursing Baron Harkonen with his dying breath.\n\nKiba moved down towards the home at a cautious and easy pace thinking then how his master would have frowned upon these actions. Three swift slashes through the thick sheets of rain which blanketed the night and the blood of the old farmer was washed away, the blade itself tucking away neatly into the sheath at Kiba\u2019s hip. His hand rasped at the wooden door warily, a sigh escaping his mouth to dissipate the doubts now rattling his resolve. If further violence could be avoided, that would be preferred.\n\n-\n\nLooking for someone to play a daughter of the Baron Vladimir Harkonen (name credit to Frank Herbert), an evil warlord who controls much of the land in this fantasy setting themed after feudal Japan. Kiba has come to take her away from where she has been hidden, hoping to use her as bait so he can reclaim his honor and slay her father, the Baron.\n\nI leave the details up to you. Maybe she has magical potential, maybe she is training to be a Samurai herself, or maybe she is just an ordinary girl stowed away because the Baron didn\u2019t want a bastard child in the royal house.

            "selftext": "#Hello there! First things first, I only have Reddit on my laptop. Therefore, I do not receive notifications when a PM is sent. Please have patience as I will likely respond between a 2-hour time window. I promise I'm not ignoring you! I just go to school full time. \n\n###I am currently looking for a male or someone who can play a male to do a modern day, romance roleplay! I exclusively use Discord and am not willing to use any other platform. Sorry! \ud83d\ude05\n\nI have been roleplaying for about 5 years now, and I guess one could say I am pretty good. I also am currently writing my own novels. I always roleplay full lit, and my responses are typically 1-3 paragraphs. Of course, that will vary between responses, as they depend on the course the plot is taking. Usually at the beginning, my responses will be pretty long (3-5), but of course, they will go down in length as the scene and characters are introduced and established. Remember, quality over quantity! I do usually do NSFW in my role plays, and would like someone who is capable of integrating it into the plot without making it the main focus or rushing into it.\n\nThough I'm pretty open to all role play idea's I prefer, if not exclusively, do romance plots. However, this does not mean its sub-genre can't be something else! For example, I did a role play a while ago involving a mayor who was at a constant risk of being assassination and her bodyguard, who protected her with all he had. The main genre was romance and the sub-genre was drama/action! ***I do not, however, do fandoms, fantasy, or any pre-modern plots, especially medival (Though the most back I am willing to go in a time era is the 1930\u2019s)***\n\n###Here are some good things to do, and bad things to do/be when roleplaying with me!\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0Please be literate! I don't ask you to speak like a human dictionary, but I do ask you to be mindful of basic grammar skills. *For example, knowing the difference between to/too/two, their/there/they're, wear/where proper spelling of simple words etc.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Try and 'mirror' my replies. *For example, when I write a reply of a few paragraphs, I would expect the same in response. Likewise, when I write a few sentences, you don't have to write a whole novel of a reply.*\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0I would really love to be able to talk out of character, both for planning and just to talk! It's absolutely not necessary, but I just because I feel as though a good relationship between partners can always improve the role play and better the communication of what is going on in the plot.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0Though not an absolute requirement, I prefer when the partner I'm role playing with chooses characters that have the 'Alpha Male' Personality. (Being confident, Dominating, Cocky, Aggressive, Possessive, sometimes a total dick)\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I like when my partners can come up with new characters and personalities unlike the last for the different role plays we may do.\n\n\u00a0\u2713 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do pretty much only Third person. I just prefer it, but I may be willing to change it to First\ud83d\ude04\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't use text speech or little asterisks when you write. I really prefer when my partner writes just as a book would be. *For example; She looked up at him with big eyes, shining from the tears in them. \"You don't understand, do you.\" She murmurs lowly, trying to contain herself. \"I love you and you don't even look at me\"*\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just I will you, please understand if my replies aren't immediate. I do go to school full time and I hope you can understand when I don\u2019t respond quickly. I will be able to reply throughout the day, just don't get upset if I reply a little later than when you sent it. I will, of course, be just as understanding with you!\n\n\u00a0X \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though a character face claim is not necessary, I like them to get a better image of what your character looks like. Also, I need all characters to have a bio, as it makes things like personality and background more clear. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD *PLEASE* NO ANIME FC. \n\nThough I don't have very many plot ideas at the moment, I have lots of OC's and I am more than willing to hear any ideas you have and even brainstorm a new one together!\n\n###REMINDER! If I go a few days without replying/messaging you, *please* don't think I left you hanging! I am likely either busy, or your message didn't come through to me! I will never end a role play without telling you I am doing so.\n\nWith that being said, if you're reading this, you just got brownie points for reading until the end! Congrats! \ud83d\ude0a I hope to hear from you soon! Have a super awesome day!\n\nMuch love, Apple Valentina\n\n***PS!

            "selftext": "Good afternoon, all! My name is, as of yet, unimportant, and my age is increasing in one week so ask me again then (it\u2019ll be 24 for those who are impatient). I\u2019m from about the middle-ish part of the United States (so the bad part!) and, as my title implies, I\u2019m of the female persuasion. Is that everything that matters? Oh, wait, hold on.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI write third person past tense, around 3-5 paragraphs per response (highly variable, though, give me something longer and you bet your bottom dollar that I\u2019ll match you, and give me less and I\u2019ll send you over a bit less), and tend to stick with one main character overall. I can double, but it\u2019s not my favorite, and you\u2019ll probably get less enthusiasm from me if you force the issue. I play both genders but prefer female as it is the one I\u2019m most familiar with, and romance is a *must* within our story, even if it takes some serious time to get to. I do enjoy actually writing out the romance, not just fade-to-black, so hopefully that is something that can be worked with. If not, then we can always fade-to-black, no problem :)\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith the holidays coming up I\u2019m looking at some serious free time, and I\u2019m looking for you, yes you, to fill that time. Even if it\u2019s just, like, a few minutes of that time. It\u2019ll do, trust me. I\u2019ve got some genres below that I\u2019m interested in playing, so if you have any stories idea feel free to reach out to me! We can work something out together! Or, if you\u2019re bad at thinking of ideas, I\u2019ll throw some plots in for funsies and we can tweak as desired.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Genres:** Sci-fi (dystopian, post-apocalyptic); Fantasy (high, low); Historical (Pirate, Western, Viking)\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Themes:** Kidnapping**, Escape, Starcrossed, Open Adventure, Power&amp;Corruption, Conquering\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Pairings:** MxF**, FxF*, MxM\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeel free to mix and match themes if they catch your eye! Two asterisks\u2019s means it\u2019s my very, very, very super duper favorite. One asterisk means it\u2019s pretty freaking awesome. Nothing means yeah, I love it, but it\u2019s not *really* my favorite or there\u2019s no preference.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKidnapping is my favorite of all time, though. Jussayin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, for the plots:\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The Dragon (fantasy):** The beast has lived atop the mountain for as long as anyone can remember\u2014yearly he takes his sacrifices from the villages below, and in return they are protected from any outside influences. They\u2019d lived under their peaceful, if disturbing, pact for centuries verging on millennia, when without warning everything changed. On a night of flashing light, roars, and burning fires, the old dragon was dethroned, another taking his place. The next day the world is silent, peaceful, but the villages are on edge. In desperation they send *her*, the eldest daughter of the town chieftain, in hopes of brokering a new agreement. What will their new protector, or overlord, decide upon?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The Outlaw (western):** Just because a man is an outlaw doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s necessarily a bad man, right? Just a man willing to do bad things. And that was doubly true for a man forced into the life of an outlaw, a man who did what he had to do in order to survive. Of course, the circumstances of being an outlaw aren\u2019t often considered when the name is plastered on a WANTED poster and suddenly every man, woman, and child west of the Mississippi decides that the reward was worth dying for. When bounty hunters come calling, any place to hide will do, and if that place of hiding happens to have a woman to be used for hostage, well, then taking her for safe keeping is only to be expected. And if she happens to be a nurse as well then that\u2019s all the better, she can make herself useful until those bounty hunters give up. As long as said outlaw doesn\u2019t actually hurt her, only makes threats, then all is well in the end\u2026 right?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0**The Beast (fantasy):** Over the past decade, reports have trickled into the town of Monte of a creature lurking in the woods outside the tall, impenetrable walls. It\u2019s a creature that sticks to the shadows, but always seems to appear just when the weather changes and travelers get stuck out on the roads. The bodies that appear afterwards are impossible to identify, always mauled beyond recognition. The creature, though, doesn\u2019t appear to be wholly animal, sometimes seen standing or heard calling for its victims. Hunters have been sent to retrieve its carcass, but all either return empty-handed, or simply don\u2019t return at all. One evening, just as a snowstorm looms over the mountain town, a girl finds herself stuck on the roads, a prime victim for the Beast of Monte.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI rp exclusively on discord, pm me and we can see about getting hooked up on there. I don't do well with rapid-fire responses, more 1-3 responses a day at longer intervals. Sorry if this is a dealbreaker!\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to GM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have. Firstly, a few important notes about me and what I'm looking for.\n\nI roleplay in first-person. Your choice in point-of-view doesn't matter to me at all, I'm fine with whatever you pick!\n\n**I want you to be the GM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\n\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, please shoot me a message.\n\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**Dragon Ball**\n\nIn the far-future of the main series (or in an alternate universe), the dragon balls become closely guarded to prevent anyone unworthy from making wishes. Each of the dragon balls is held by a Keeper. Every ten years, the Keepers set up a world-spanning event, where everyone is invited to participate. All participants gather at one place, at which point the locations of all seven Keepers is revealed to them. From then on, it's a race to not only reach the various Keepers, but to pass their tests in order to obtain their dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are taken from their Keepers, the location of a hidden shrine is revealed to everyone who has at least one of the dragon balls. The dragon balls only work when gathered together at this shrine, drawing all the holders to one spot for a final battle.\n\nI think this idea would be great in terms of character development. All characters would be working towards the goal of having their one wish granted while on a long journey, giving them plenty of time to develop. I'm thinking that before the race begins, some time can be spent showing the main characters training for it. Maybe they're training together, or maybe they're miles apart and only meet for the first time at the starting point of the race.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\n\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.\n\n**Touhou**\n\nWould love an RP set in the wonderful world of Gensokyo! I was thinking my character would be from the Outside World who ends up in Gensokyo during the start of the RP or beforehand. From there, he'd slowly start to explore the world and meet the various characters in it. Maybe there's an incident going on, or maybe he's in Gensokyo during the events of one of the games. In any case, this is one we could definitely discuss further.\n\n**Marvel**\n\nRecently got around to watching the MCU films and have been pretty interested in an RP related to Marvel. Doesn't necessarily have to be set in the MCU, and I'd probably actually prefer an alternate Universe so we have a bit more free-reign with what we want to do with the characters and world. I was thinking that the RP would begin with an origin story for my character, with him either facing a canonical villain or an original character. After that point, the Universe could open up and include more of the heroes from Marvel. It doesn't necessarily have to immediately go into something like the Avengers where everyone comes together to fight a big threat, but maybe the heroes could be slowly introduced one at a time into the story.\n\nI do have a few ideas as to potential powers for my character that we can discuss. But if you'd prefer, I'm also open to my character being an apprentice to a pre-existing hero and having similar abilities/equipment to them. Whatever would work best for you and the story would work best for me.\n",

I only ship him with:\n\n1) Adult Rin\n\n2) Kagome\n\n3) Kagura\n\nAdult Rin is vastly preferred, but I do ship him with the other two as well! \n\nPersona 5 muse is Yusuke Kitagawa. I only ship him with:\n\n1) Ann Takamaki \n\n2) Futaba Sakura\n\nAnn Takamaki is vastly preferred. I\u2019d also prefer if we do a college AU.\n\nJust a heads up, I also want someone who\u2019s pretty active, I know life gets in the way, but I don\u2019t want to wait for a week and more for one reply, ya know? \n\nWe don\u2019t need to chat ooc if you don\u2019t want to, but it\u2019d still be cool. I have a Nintendo Switch and Overwatch on PS4 that we can play or whatever!\n\nYou can find excerpts of my roleplaying as both Sesshomaru and Yusuke below!\n\nSESSHOMARU: \n\nLeather boots soundlessly touched upon the earth below as he made his way through the winding wilderness of Feudal Japan. Around him, petals from the cherry blossom trees flitted past, lifting with them silver strands of hair as the esteemed daiyokai gracefully picked his way through the underbrush. Golden eyes gleamed in the setting sun, reflecting back at the world the fiery oranges and purples that filled the skies above. At his feet, his warty little servant mumbled incoherently under his breath, no doubt cursing his master's decision to return for his ward.\n\nTen years had passed, but to a demon the trials of time felt like the passing of a night. A decade would pass them by quickly with nary a scar, whereas a human would feel the brunt of it in a harsher way. It was these thoughts that Sesshomaru entertained as he gracefully maneuvered through the clearing and towards the village of Edo that lay nestled between rolling mountains. Indeed, the thought of a decade having come and gone filled him with an emotion that he was unfamiliar with but not a stranger to. Apprehension clouded his mind as he considered just how much his ward, Rin, would have changed in the passing of time.\n\n\"Erm... Lord Sesshomaru?\" his servant piped up.\n\n\"What is it, Jaken?\" he demanded in his cool tone. He felt Jaken fidget uncomfortably next to him before he heard the sigh roll off his beak and the question tumble forth.\n\n\"I was just wondering... I don't mean to cause you any offense, none at all, my lord! But... do you think it's wise to come back for Rin?\"\n\n\"Rin...\" he mused. Yes, he wondered the same thing for countless nights. Surely as a human, his ward would feel more comfortable surrounding herself with her kind? The Western Palace was no place for a human, let alone a human woman. Should he bring Rin back with him, he would be subjecting her to scorn from other demons.\n\nAnd so with this thought in mind, Sesshomaru stayed silent, not even bothering to deign Jaken with a response. The little imp would only sigh once more in dejection before picking up his feet to toddle after his master.\n\nSoon, the entrance to Edo came into view, prompting Sesshomaru to pull to a stop. As he did, he found his mind working through his worries once more. Was this wise? Should he have come back at all for her? Would she even remember him? A human's memory was fleeting, if he remembered correctly.\n\n\"Milord?\" Jaken asked hesitantly.\n\n\"Let's go, Jaken,\" he replied. Without a backwards glance, Sesshomaru carried himself into the village, all whilst ignoring the scent of unwashed humans along with their cowering gazes all for the pursuit of his Rin.\n\nYUSUKE KITAGAWA:\n\nA sigh drifted past the artist's lips as he set his paintbrush down in order to study the artwork he'd churned out. His brow furrowed as his eyes scanned the work in front of him before Yusuke would give a heavy sigh and massage his temple in an effort to stave off any frustration that bled into him. Being a student of the Kyoto Institute of Arts was hard enough with all of the deadlines that loomed over him but when inspiration evaded his capture like it had been for weeks now it only made the artist's feelings of hopelessness fester.\n\nAs he lifted his gaze again, Yusuke's mind soon found his friends. It had been quite some time since the former Phantom Thieves had gotten together for old time's sake. In truth, Yusuke often wondered about them and how they were doing these days. As college students, there was no doubt that the workload would have been tripled from since they were only in high school. Now at the age of twenty-three, Yusuke felt his days at Kosei were much easier in comparison.\n\nWordlessly, he climbed onto his feet and carried himself away from his canvas and towards his bag. Perhaps a night away in the sprawling cities of Tokyo would help spur his creativity. People watching had always been one of his favorite pastimes--perhaps he could text one of his old friends and ask them to join him on his quest?\n\nPulling his outdated cell phone from his pocket, long and graceful fingers moved quickly across the miniature keyboard as he sent out his question to his friends. One by one, each denied his request, but he didn't begrudge them as he knew how important their studies were.\n\nGrey eyes moved from one name to the next in his contacts list before finally stopping upon Futaba's. In that moment, he recalled their silly little arguments when they had been children and briefly he wondered if she would even bother responding to his text. After some deliberation, he finally began to type his message to her.\n\n*Greetings, Futaba. Are you busy at the moment? I had the sudden inspiration to visit Shibuya and partake in people watching to spur my creativity. Would you care to join me?*\n\nWith that message typed out, Yusuke then hit send and awaited her reply.",

I like details,  and setting a good plot,  having a sturdy storyline, and keeping things interesting for the both of us.  \n\nWhen it comes to themes,  I'm more into fantasy.

However,  I would be more than willing to hear out any of your ideas,  and try then out,  if we find they're not working,  we can try a different plot.  \n\nAny and everyone is welcome,  i love hearing from people and hearing their ideas.  I also have other plots and themes,  but I figured I share the basis.  I'm open minded and won't reject anything.

Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I have yet to come up with a creative name for this rp, but as the title suggests, it is a modern fantasy based rp. To the everyday human eye, everything looks normal and as it should be. But if you look carefully, or adventure into exotic places, you will discover the supernatural. \n\nIn the early years of humanity, two types of magic thrived. There were the Dragons, and the Protectors. There was nothing to determine what you were, as it was a genetic feature. \n\nThe Dragons were like animals. They were fierce hunters who fought for the thrill of a battle. They had an incredible sense of smell and hearing, and were generally on the offence. Their best defence was their offence. \n\nThe Protectors were the opposite. They were mages driven by the will to protect others who wouldn\u2019t protect themselves. They were pure hearted and wanted nothing more in life than to have a peaceful world. They had a sixth sense, as they could always sense when an attack was coming. Their magic was all based around defending, supporting. But do not doubt their offence for a second. \n\nAs humanity aged, magic became more rare by the second, and the Dragons and Protectors became myths. Folklore. But unknown to most, there were still the odd few who carried that magic. \n\nThis story focuses on two university students. Ever since they were five, they knew they had a magic within them. The female was involved in a car accident when she was five. Her magic saved her, but her family passed away in hospital. She grew up in an orphanage, where she met The Male. He was a dragon, who too was an orphan. He always got into fights and tried to run away, causing trouble with the police. The two eventually became friends, and had always grown up together. \n\nIn high school, they met one professor who took an interest in them. One day after school, he called them to his classroom, where he explained everything to them. About the Dragons and Protectors, and their own powers. They learnt more about themselves, and how to control their abilities. \n\nAs they moved into university, something cold was developing. Amongst the city and the outskirts, someone was awakening a third set of powers, nicknamed the Corrupt. This type of magic was hardly ever heard of, but was never good. It was used for evil intentions, and for their own gain. \n\nNow, the Corrupt was growing in numbers, trying to find all of the Dragons and Protectors, and erasing their magic. No one understood where the sudden increase in Corrupt magic users came from, but it didn\u2019t matter. They had to be stopped before all Dragons and Protectors became extinct. \n\nOur two characters must balance battling the Corrupt, and surviving university work. \n\nThat\u2019s my basic idea! If needed, we could make changes to it. \n\nI would like to have a NSFW side of smut to it. \n\nI\u2019m still a student myself, so my replies may vary. I can always promise to give a few replies a day, so don\u2019t worry. With the Christmas holidays coming up, I\u2019ll have more time! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\n",

We should both be \"DMs\" or \"GMs\" so to speak, either taking turns or equally introducing scenarios to keep things interesting. 2-3 paragraphs at the very least would be preferable, but this is not a hard rule depending on what is happening. Just don't be a passive participant and everything will be dandy. Please be 21+   \nShoot me a message! Happy hunting. ",

As you can see, I'm specifically looking for RP in the world of Harry Potter.\n\nAge: I'm 23, so it is a must that you are 18+, and preferably 20+\n\nTimezone: I'm in EST, but I'm up at all kinds of crazy hours, so don't worry about me not replying because of time zones. Note: I do still sleep. Sometimes.\n\nHow often I reply: I literally have nothing to do all day, so I'll reply as often as you do.\n\nPreferred contact: I'm good with email or Discord, though Discord's been a bit hit-or-miss lately. \n\nLength: I match my partner. I prefer 1-3 paragraph posts, but can go up to about 5 paragraphs. Length isn't super important to me, I prefer quality over quantity.\n\nWriting Style:  3rd person, past tense paragraph or multi-paragraph. At least semi-lit please.\n  \nCravings: I'll list these by era to make things easier. *Italics* is who I'd like to play, * denotes how much I want that pairing. \n\n**Harry Potter**\n**Marauders Era (1971-1981)**\n\n* James/Lily\n* *Sirius*/Remus (never done this one, but been wanting to give it a go)*\n* *Sirius*/OC\n* *Remus*/OC\n\n**Trio Era Post-Hogwarts (1998~2003)**\n\n* Draco/Hermione (I've written them both, so no preference to who I write)\n* *Hermione*/Harry\n* *Draco*/Astoria\n* *Draco*\n* *Theo Nott*/OC or Canon\n\n**Next Gen (2017~2024)**\n\n* *Scorpius*/Lily Luna (I'll play Lily, too, just prefer Scorp)\n* *Teddy*/Victoire\n* Will also play either of these boys against an OC.\n\n**Game of Thrones (Season/Book 1)** \nI have an idea for this, but it needs fleshing out a bit. \n* *Jon Snow*/OC\n* *OC*/ Jon Snow \nI think I've rambled on enough.

The two had almost immediately familiarized themselves with London, going on little dates and adventures whenever they were done with class for the day. They\u2019d both been equally grateful for having been pulled into the same war two years ago, otherwise they probably would have never met and never would\u2019ve had such amazing experiences together. \n\nThe two repeated their same morning routine: washing up, getting dressed, and eating a quick breakfast before locking up their apartment and heading towards the Clock Tower. Once they\u2019d arrived they parted ways for the day, both agreeing they\u2019d meet up outside the school after they were done for the day so they can head home together. Time flew by just as any other day and before long, the two were done for the day. Rin had already been outside the school, sitting on a bench while she waited for Shirou to meet with her. \u201cThat damn Shirou....always taking his sweet time..:\u201d she mumbled, slightly angry but with a sense of humor. \n\nHey, hope you\u2019re all doing wonderful! As you can tell, this roleplay is based on the Fate Series and is between both Rin and Shirou. This specific roleplay more focuses on Fate Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works considering that\u2019s the series in which Rin and Shirou ended up together in. So I\u2019d love to roleplay the relationship between the two because I just love it so much! All I really ask is that you have at least some knowledge over the series and these two characters, be able to type at least two paragraphs or one lengthy one(if you type more then go ahead and type away! I\u2019ll do my best to match.), and be perfectly fine with moments of intimacy. \n\nIf you\u2019re fine with all of this and are still interested, feel free to message me on here for either my kik or discord.

            "selftext": "Hello! It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve posted. I am currently stuck on this one RolePlay. Technically two. I will explain plots and list what a starter what would like. These are cliche but it\u2019d like to put my own twists on it.\nI\u2019m CST US. Though I\u2019m a night owl. I reply rather quickly. \n16+\n\nAbusive Boyfriend: What I\u2019m looking for is someone who can play as an abusive boyfriend for awhile to build up the storyline. My character will leave one day and your character will realize what he lost and promises to change. So it\u2019d be this long journey of building trust and falling Back in love.\n\nThe Starter: (I can make it wayyyyyy more detailed) It was a normal day. Autumn was doing dishes and tidying the house after last nights fight. She was making chili for dinner and she realized she forgot to make the bed. So she hurried and made it then returned to the dishes. She then started cleaning the counters to give them a fresh shine. They lived in a small house, they had bought it for a really low price as it was just something to get them going. Autumn was a bartender and she normally would cover the bruises with make up or clothes. She tried to always seem happy around everyone,  even her boyfriend. She finished just as she heard him come home, dishing up the bowls and putting them on the dinner table. She took a deep breath and greeted him with a smile. \u201cHey! Suppers on the table.\u201d She said, swallowing hard, nervous.\n\nThe Drunk One Night Stand: Looking for someone to have the one night stand, get my character pregnant and then they fight about it, he\u2019s douchey at first until they almost lose the baby in the middle of trying to figure out how to live and deal with a child when they don\u2019t love each other. She almost loses the baby and it brings them closer together... \n\nI\u2019m just throwing these plots at you with really no thought. It\u2019s late and I just want to find partners. ",

            "selftext": " \n\nHowdy Pardners!\n\nTonight We Ride, is a roleplay forum for fans of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. TWR is set in a fictional AU of the second installment of Red Dead Redemption, where you can play both original characters and notable canon characters. Most importantly, you don't need any prior knowledge of the RDR franchise to roleplay here. As long as you're staying true to an old west setting spanning the late 19th and early 20th century, you're good to go.\n\nThe story picks up directly after Chapter 6 of RDR2 but takes a drastic twist. There was no mountain fight and everyone has survived. Now the plot will be driven primarily by the characters on the board with a few quarterly events run by the staff to help shape character development. 18+ on jcink and there is no word count, app approval or activity checks. Friendly staff and members ready to saddle up and write adventures! Discord for chatting, plotting and just hanging out.\n\nVisit us here to join up: [https://tonightweride.jcink.net/](https://tonightweride.jcink.net/)\n\nA Tahitian mango farm awaits!",

            "selftext": "Are you a fan of comics? Do you imagine a world where some people have special abilities they use to the betterment or detriment of their fellow man? Well I do and I wanna rp a world just like that. We can iron out the details of the goings on in the such a world before plungeing in and having fun. In the past Ive done both a school and an island type rp with this premise so I am reasonably seasoned with it. Id love if you can bring original ideas for your powers aswell but the basic flight and stregnth are always fun. Im also open to romance and smut if thats what youd like in the rp however this dose bring a clause to the rp. I cant do lesbian I have tried and I am miserable at it just aweful. I am however capable of multiple characters you dont have to be but if you can it would help alot. All are welcome male, female, furry, anyone. I can appon request play any of theses aswell so feel free to ask if you so like. Hope to hear from you soonKik Tesla337.",

Make connections and build your own faction, group, pack, or clan.  We do the best to offer our members a role-playing escape, including:  \n\n\\-  Story support through our teams of Game Masters.  They provide us with ongoing events to evoke story and create in   \n   character connections. \n\n\\- Fully integrated dice system to create a system of balance.  Life is luck of the draw.  Sometimes the dice gods raise us   \n  high upon their shoulders and are generous with those critical hits.  And sometimes they provide us with the much   \n  needed reality check in battle that can only be captured by a botch.\n\n\\- You, as a player, have the chance to design your own event, pending Moderator/Game Master team approval (don't   \n  worry too much we just need to keep things balanced and make sure it jives.  All for the greater good!).\n\n\\- Group, guild, pack, and clan support. \n\n\\- Cash, money flow! Currency to add depth and realism to earned resources. \n\n\\- We have customized bots including a profile system, dice bot proctor, and more! \n\n\\- Did I talk about the spars? Individual, Mass spars, Honor Matches, Death Matches.  Basically, don't sing it, bring it. :D\n\n\\- Dedicated and knowledgeable Storyline Leads, Moderators/Race Leaders, Game Masters, and Player Reps who are   \n  ready to help. \n\n\\- We also have a dedicated online XP tracking system to help eliminate the need for keeping logs.

What began as a dispute over land turned into a war that has lasted for centuries without end. In spite of this, however, two young Princes destined for the throne have been forced together to save both their peoples from a dark force that seeks to destroy both Kingdoms. \n\nNecessity paves way for friendship, and friendship paves the way for romance. The two Princes will come together to save all that they love and cherish in a world that's becoming increasingly bleak.\n\n**Themes:** I'd like to explore many themes within this RP, especially some of the darker aspects of war. As such there will be blood, maybe a little bit of gore, violence, swearing, and in addition to that I would prefer not to shy away from the sexual nature of the budding relationship.\n\n**Requirements?:** Mainly I'm looking for someone who is at least somewhat literate. I don't need you to post 6 paragraphs per post, but I dislike one liners as well. Also you should be at least 18 for this given the themes. \n\nIf this interests you, drop me a PM with a little bit of info about yourself and I'll give you my Discord.",

This is new and I would probably prefer to use discord or google docs to roleplay. I'm a full time nurse who still has alot of free time to roleplay. My number one annoyance is bugging me for replies. It's annoying and doesn't make me want to reply faster.\n\nSome other things:\n\nI play females or double. I do love playing multiple characters, but if we're doing single mains, I want to be a female. I love dark and mature themes and yes that includes NSFW. (18+) Romance is amazing and most of my rps will have it. I write in the 3rd person, past tense only. Paragraph format. Ill roleolay over discord or google docs, though i really prefer discord for ooc chat.\n\nIm looking for someone to roleplay The Flash with me. I want you to play Jay/Hunter/Zoom for me. We can attempt to double if you want. Just message me if you want to rp! ",

I\u2019m a dungeon, game, whatever you\u2019d like to call it, Master, looking for one person for a Wild West themed Roleplay.\n\nFor the concept/Roleplay itself, It\u2019ll be taking place on the west coast during the 1880\u2019s. Your character could be a native of whatever city is chosen to be the starting city, or a new arrival from the Central or Eastern areas of the U.S. \n\nIt\u2019ll be your choice if you\u2019d want to run with one of the gang of outlaws in the Roleplay, or if you\u2019d rather go on your own. (Even later down the line, you could start up your own crew too!)\n\nIt\u2019s quite vague at the moment, as I like to create the lore for the RP as it goes, so the flow isn\u2019t interrupted. I\u2019ll be playing every character you meet. \n\nFor my requirements, I ask of you to be literate and have basic punctuation. Also, I\u2019d prefer if you could reply in a minimum of 3-4 sentences. Of course, not every situation can be stretched out into paragraph form, so don\u2019t worry about that too much! (Ex. Back and forth conversations won\u2019t require paragraphs, responses setting a scene or are just generally important will.) As for points of views, I prefer a first person P.O.V.  When you message, include the words \u2018pumpernickel pie\u2019 so I know you read throw all of this, along with other RP information.\n\nThat\u2019s all from me, I hope to see your character roaming the west soon!

Our main goal is to find more members that are willing to contribute both in character and in chats. We offer the ability to create your own quests under the condition that they stick to lore, we are also planning various server-wide events and major adventures for members interested in participating. The setting is medieval fantasy in a place called Esnium, a large city-state on an isthmus that connects the northern and southern parts of the continent of Inoctsam. The city itself is governed by a number of guilds, them being the wealthy Merchant's guild, the Church of Vestau (which also supervises the guards), and the University of Magic that unites artificers, casters and scholars. Despite there being only four major guilds, there are numerous smaller ones, the most notable ones being the Vipers, the collective of thieves, outlaws, and other criminals, and the Mercenaries' Guild.\n\nOur server offers lots of clarity on how the admin team works and enables users to contribute to the lore as well, under the \"Writer\" role which we are happy to give once requested. As a community we are aiming to create active group of users that are eager to contribute.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/B6XS3uP",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m looking for a partner to play in a high-fantasy open world sandbox, where the character, a regular person from Earth (or anywhere not \u2018here,\u2019 really), one day wakes up to find themselves in a completely different universe. I\u2019d love to see the character adapt and grow within their new environment as they interact with the world.  \n\n\nTo write a little about me first, I\u2019m a 20-year-old female with about 5 years of experience in roleplay. I write in both first and third, but heavily prefer third over first, especially when using a multitude of characters. I don\u2019t really have a particular preference on the type of character I play, and I\u2019ll play accordingly if you have a preference of some sort. Also, I love anime way more than American shows, so if you throw TV show references\u2026chances are, I won\u2019t get it\u2026  \n\n\nAs for this particular RP, while I have been developing the setting for a while myself, I\u2019m open to discussing more with you and sharing ideas! The setting I have does contain a wide variety of themes, with darker themes as well as common ones within it, so please let me know if there\u2019s anything that may make you uncomfortable. I\u2019m fine with playing out NSFW scenes, but forcing one unnaturally is a big no for me. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with such, we can always fade to black and move on, no big deal!  \n\n\nAlthough everyone knows that we make mistakes and typos then and there, I do ask that you have at least a decent understanding of English and general grammar, write in third person, and\u2026reply once a while? I\u2019ve recently had a lot of free time on my hands, so I\u2019d prefer if my partner could reply frequently, but of course that\u2019s a preference and not a requirement! Once a few days, or once every few hours, anything goes.  \n\n\nI mostly roleplay on discord, and occasionally email. I heavily prefer discord as it provides an easier way of out-of-character communication, and I love talking; I\u2019m the kind of person that\u2019d go on and on about characters and settings and situations and\u2026see how much I rambled on in this post alone? Maybe I should stop\u2026hue.  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, shoot me a PM with your discord! I hope to talk to you soon. Have a good day\\~",

            "selftext": "Howdy, folks! It's your friendly neighborhood Eso, here! Though only 18+ folks need apply! Currently, I'd love a little FxF, but if that's not your cup of tea MxF is fine, too. I've got a couple ideas rolling around the old noodle, and I'd be more than happy to share 'em with you upon request! Just a few things I ask you read through first!\n\nTo state it again, I'm only accepting people who are 18+, like myself.\n\nI ask that you give me a minimum of a paragraph, I understand some scenes sometimes only require a couple of lines, but if it's less than a well thought out sentence, that's just lazy!\n\nSomeone who's interested in being pals as well as writing partners! It's a pretty dull thing to just roleplay and not get to know the person behind the character. Knowing that I'm interacting with a person, rather than a character makes it much more easy to invest!\n\nSomeone who's not afraid to explore character emotion! My characters are all pretty well fleshed out, with their own desires and dreams. They got their own backstories and emotional traumas that impact their responses to things!\n\nAs for smut, it's not a requirement, but it's something I do enjoy writing, but only if the characters have real chemistry. I dislike fading to black, because it just feels awkward to me, but if smut isn't something your comfortable with I have no problem doing so!\n\nAnd finally, someone who's not afraid to get weird! My characters are a pretty eclectic group, and I'm a weirdo myself! So, if you dig bad memes and worse puns then I'm the partner for you! If not, then go on then! Scoot! But thanks for reading! Oh, and just to prove you read this...please put your favorite Gen 1 non-legendary Pokemon in the subject line! Thanks! Hope to hear from all you fine folks soon!",

            "selftext": " \n\n**Rookshaven** is one of the longest running, lore-intensive group role playing storylines on Discord right now.\n\nBased in present-day northern Scotland, Rookshaven Academy and University is a school for mages, though the storyline only allows for university students and professors to be applied.\n\n**A bit about our lore:**\n\nThe mage community has always held their royal families above the rest. Though they aren't considered kings or queens of their mage classes anymore, the royal families are believed to be the first blood lines to develop their particular kind of magics. As such, royalty have always been the law-makers for mages worldwide. In the late 1800s, a rebel sect of mages rose up to attack the royals and all of their complicit, loyal subjects - resulting in a Mage Civil War.\n\nMany mages and their royal families were killed off, while the beast mage class disappeared entirely. From that war, the High Council was formed. A collection of the remaining royal houses, electing one member of their family to represent them in the governing of the mage community.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the original eight royal families, only five are alive in present day. Additionally, two new mage classes have been discovered. Without a way to track the new class's lineage, Mythics and Necromancers have been left without a representative in the Council. As a result, many laws passed since their discovery have been created seemingly for the purpose of keeping Necromancers and Mythics at a disadvantage. While the newest class, Mythics, are sigil-bound at a young age to feel an automatic pull toward royal families, they often grow up to be employed as maids or servants for the royals.\n\nSince 2016, another uprising of rebels has been seen. Between then and 2018 (present day), many royals and loyalists alike have lost their lives in terrorist attacks by these Rebels. In the last year of the group story on Discord, students have been attacked both on and off campus, leading many to believe there are Rebels among the ranks of Rookshaven, despite the school being run by the Council.\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n\\- Monthly events in which your character can earn points to put into their dice, making them stronger.\n\n\\- Lots of lore.\n\n\\- Outlined mage classes, as well as factions to push their own agendas (Royals, Loyalists, Rebels, Sympathizers).\n\n\\- Friendly players willing to work with new players to create backstories and social networks.\n\n\\- A secondary server only viewable to applied and approved players where you can post playlists, aesthetic images, social media posts, journal entries, as well as having 1-2 private channels specific to your character for housing and training.\n\n\\- Active Admins willing to help new players any way we can.\n\n\\- Sect-Specific Moderators to help players get immersed in the story faster.\n\n\\- An NPC Library to check out characters for scenes when your own characters are locked down.\n\n**What we expect:**\n\n\\- literacy\n\n\\- a 3 paragraph minimum per post (there are exceptions to this, but the majority of players should strive for this)\n\n\\- realistic characters that fit the server lore\n\n\\- activity every 2 weeks, or communication with the Admins if you need to take time away\n\n\\- read the FAQ\n\n**Classes Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Water\n\n\\- Darkness\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n\\- Earth\n\n\\- Mythic\n\n\\- Necromancy\n\n**Locked Classes:**\n\n\\- Beast (planned to be unlocked in early 2019)  \n\\- Hybrid Mages (mages born from opposite classed parents, or from one Mirskoy parent)\\*  \n\\- Variant Mages (mages whose ancestors were hybrids, giving them *variation* abilities)\\*  \n\n\n\\*Are available presently under rare circumstances, talk to an Admin.\n\n**Royal Families Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Dark\n\n\\- Spirit  \n\n\n**Upcoming/Ongoing Events:**  \n \\- Winter Games (mage class vs mage class competition)  \n \\- Winter Formal  \n \\- Equinox Spell  \n \\- Beast Unlock  \n \\- Anniversary Event \n\n[**Link to Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/V6SUcaz)",

When it comes to plots/settings I am rather flexible and am willing to go down most routes that you throw.\n\n**Posting Quality/Quantity**\n\nI am and have always been a quality over quantity person. I'd much rather have a handful of sentences from someone than five paragraphs that have the standards of a highschool essay done at 3 a.m. Of course I will reply in kind. The more you give, the longer more my response will contain. Of course in some situations where It would make sense for me to be giving more than you and vice versa are completely understandable.\n\n**Short/Medium/Long-term**\n\nI don't mind doing short and medium-term RPs. However I always have and will prefer long-term if the choice is there. If you prefer only for short and medium-terms I completely understand. Many roleplayers I know don't like to commit to a long-term roleplay for multiple reasons which is also another reason why I am in this subreddit looking for others.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nWhen it comes to where we RP I have three choices. Discord, Skype, and Email. All of these are easily accessible for me. I tend to prefer Discord most of the three choices, but any shall work. However sometimes if I have an influx of people on platform X I won't be taking the other choices.\n\n**Posting Speed**\n\nPersonally I can post often and reply rather quickly, of course I do not expect the same. But I would prefer someone who is able to get at least a few posts in a day. Of course if you are unable I won't suddenly pester you or drop the RP. We all have lives outside of here, and I completely understand that you won't always be free.\n\n**Genres**\n\n*below is a list of genres I am more than happy to take part in.*\n\n* High Fantasy\n* Low Fantasy\n* Alternate Fantasy (Not Urban Fantasy. **Alternate fantasy takes High Fantasy, Steampunk, and post apocalyptic into one universe. Normally it's the kind of world where blades are used and guns don't exist. But airships and mechanical limbs are used. Often having two main areas. The forests/mountains where tradition and more primitive life lives. Vs the badlands/desert where cities, airships, merchants, bandits, floating lands, and all kinds of things come.**)\n* Modern (If the plot is good enough. Rarely it is.)\n* Post-Apocalyptic (But not zombies.) (I do have a list of choices for this one)\n* Romance (Dark is good. But I prefer it as a sub genre)\n* Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Biopunk, Atompunk, Cyberpunk.\n* Sci-Fi\n* Horror\n* Historical Fiction (In rare cases)\n* Historical Realism\n* Medieval/Pre-modern\n* Fandoms (In some cases, explained in another part.)\n* Willing to try new things if it's interesting.\n\n*As for a few I'm not for:*\n\n* Urban Fantasy\n\nAs for dark and light themes. I enjoy both, but will lean towards darker themes in terms of setting and world when world building at times. I am also good with most sensitive topics as along as it isn't there just to be there.\n\n**Fandoms**\n\nThis is just a list of some of the pre-existing worlds that I would not mind having a RP take place in. This doesn't mean I won't do any others, I am always open to other Fandoms and custom worlds. The list includes RPs that I have done already and had been successful, whether I enjoyed them or not was entirely another story. I use fandoms when people are new to RPing, so I'm not always one to jump right into them. I always prefer world building to fandoms. If we do fandoms I will not play a canon character, so please stop messaging me with what character you want to have sex with in a fandom with your OC.\n\n* The Elder Scrolls\n* Warcraft\n* DC Universe\n* Marvel Universe\n* Assassin's Creed\n* Borderlands\n* Dishonored\n* The Maze Runner\n\n**World Building**\n\nI will always prefer world building over fandoms in most cases. I have done world building that has taken only minutes to ones that have taken days.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nThank you for reading this far my friends, I am grateful. If you are interested in becoming a RP partner of mine please just shoot me a reddit PM asking for you're preferred platform from the choices I have given. I hope to hear from some of you guys soon!",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction or fantasy. \u201cReal world\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. (The latter is a big craving at the moment. I wonder why.)\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here",

I play both male and female characters, and I would like for you to do the same! I can write from one to three paragraphs per response, and I'm on Discord almost every day. \n\nI'm looking for a long-term partner who can post at least three sentences per response in third person, and at least one response per day! If you're busy, I understand. Please tell me if you're going on a hiatus or something!\n\nAnyway, I've strangely been into action-oriented animesque shows in a school setting recently, hence the two universes. I'm strongly familiar with both of them, caught up with RWBY, read/watched all of the SE manga/anime.\n\nRWBY- \nFor RWBY, it'll take place at the start of V1, in Beacon. The two of us will each make two characters that will form a team. They'll go through initiation and such, blah, blah. It'll essentially play out like RWBY but with different characters and differences in the world. We can make new professors, alternate teams, new factions, new grimm, etc. Let's make the world our own!\n\nSoul Eater-\nFor Soul Eater, we'll be a weapon-meister pair. I'm/You're trying to get you/me 99 kishin souls and 1 witch soul to attain Death Scythe status! It'll be slice of life-y with lots of action, detailing the adventures that the two go through. We can add more to the world, more missions, other weapon-meister pairs, more rivalries. I want to build a world around these two, similar to the original, but not exactly.\n\nIf you're interested, then PM me! Introduce yourself, tell me your timezone and how active you can be, include a writing sample (about a paragraph or more in length), and leave your tag so I can add you!",

They were always there; singing a siren song that kept Bucky in a panic of going back; going back to being the Winter Soldier. He wanted to believe that he was far away from that life and Y/C often told him just that, but Bucky knew that it wasn\u2019t true. He proved it false everytime he attacked Y/C, though he never really meant to do so. Just like he was now. His metal hand was clenched around Y/C\u2019s throat, pinning him to the bed they shared in the uptown apartment. He kept squeezing, eyes glazed over until gears seemed to click in his head and the nightmare faded.

            "selftext": "Hi! I have been roleplaying for over a decade and I am now looking to return back to it after a few months of break. I am very eager to write and I have a lot of ideas! But I need to start from finding the new partners to write with. \n\n*What do you need to know about me:*\n\n* I am 21 years old and while I'm comfortable with writing more mature themes, I prefer them to be mature/story-based. I also prefer for my writing partners to be 18+.\n* I have work that sometimes consume me entirely and leave me lifeless that I am too lazy to write. But I do my best.\n* I don't dabble in non-con, incest and other such taboo themes. \n\n*What I'm looking for:*\n\n* I want for someone who can give me multiple paragraphs per reply, even if I do prefer quality over quantity. So don't force yourself to write. But I at least want someone who takes their time and tries/put their effort on what they're doing. I just have no idea of what to reply back to one-liners.\n* I don't mind if you are a male or a female or a non-binary person behind the character! Really! \n* I am mostly interested in Marvel, DCU, Miraculous Ladybug stories. \n\n*Plot ideas/Ships:*\n\n* For Miraculous Ladybug, I am interested in Adrinette, that involves Love Square. I am open to any kind of a story. Do you want to have an AU of where they reunite a few years later? Let's do this! Post-reveal? Sure! Mari and Chat start dating each other unaware of their identities? Yes, please!\n* I have a female original character for Marvel and DC characters that I am just eager and want to write her. I want to give her a home. She's a very complex character (and I am willing to elaborate more on her over PMs/when we both finally chat each other up!). She's a mutant-witch/superheroine, depends on where we both choose to head with her story. I am willing to ship her with Magneto, Bruce Banner/Hulk, Johnny Storm/Human Torch, Steve Rogers/Captain America, Tony Stark/Iron Man, Clark Kent/Superman, Peter Parker/Spiderman.\n\n**Discord:**  Captain Ladybug#1082\n\n**e-mail:** sambaofthewhitebutterfly@gmail.com",

(This could either be for air combat, or something like mecha\u2019s). C1 and C2 may be from different planets (but both human) this may still result in different beliefs and values. (One may be more cold hearted etc.) C1 and C2 are then transferred to the main space station for their year long training before being let out into the fleet. Pilot\u2019s and Navigators are paired up together based on testing system in compatibility. C1 and C2 are paired up but they find that they absolutely hate each other but they must learn to work together in order to pass the training and both are extremely competitive.\n\nI have more plots on request!",

On average, I am able to respond 1-3 times during the typical work week. Sometimes more, other times less. I understand that you have a life as well, and will be flexible with how much you respond on a daily basis. With that being said I am looking for someone who is literate and can provide 1-3 paragraph responses. Quality definitely over quantity!\n\nMy interests vary, although I would like for there to be an element of romance. I enjoy Medieval RPs, Harry Potter, The Walking Dead, Vampire RPs, The Hunger Games, HandMaid\u2019s Tale, and historical fiction (specifically during the Revolutionary War). Having these plots and fandoms in mind, I typically create OCs for my own creative freedom!\u00a0If you have something else you are interested in, let me know!\n\nIf you are interested, please message me. I look forward to discussing potential roleplays! Happy holidays :)",

            "selftext": "Are you tired of going to the bars to spend your nights with a bottle of alcohol and three Asari strippers? You crave to have someone, a companion that loves you unconditionally and won't cheat on you with a Krogan from clan Urdnot. It's impossible though, or at least it used to be. Now with Intergalactic Harmony, you can find the partner of your dreams. You can sort through species, gender, age, and occupation. Maybe you want to marry an Elcor or settle down with an Asari justicar, Intergalactic Harmony will find you the love of your life. Commander Shepard even said that this is his favorite dating service on the Citadel.\n\nA silly little idea popped into my head as I read some Mass Effect comics, and thus I came up with this prompt. This will be a Mass Effect roleplay with our own original characters, unless you want to roleplay a canon character. The characters will have met through a dating app and meet at the Citadel or Omega for a date. \u00a0You can play any species, and I'll probably stick to Quarian or Drell. I'm obviously wanting some romance for this prompt as well as some adult themes. If you're interested, just send me a message.",

            "selftext": "Hey all! Today I am looking to try a Scott Pilgrim plot based on the comic! Basically it's Wallace Wells and my OC. There would be other characters from the series too of course, and we could discuss dividing it equally.\n\nI ask that you have a decent knowledge of the characters. I realize it may have been awhile since people have read it, so not expecting perfection. Just a bit of refreshing would be great (I'm currently brushing up on it myself).\n\n\u2b50\u2b50 Here are my rules:\n\n1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.\n\n2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.\n\n3. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.\n\n4. Please keep it plot and romance focused in compliance with this subreddit.\n\nAnd I think that is it! If you are interested, feel free to PM me!\n\n*If you read this entire post, comment 'phone' somewhere in your opening message* \u260e\ud83d\udcde\u260e",

It is similar in many ways to our own, with its history only diverging frrom our own 9 years ago. As the ball dropped, signalling the beggining of a new year and a fresh start for many. Wishes had been shared and moonlight kisses had, smiles of glee apparent on all faces. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. The power went out everyhwere in the world for seemingly no reason. Asides from that nothing was wrong. Except for the metas. The first was Anarchy. A vile woman who sought to take over all inferior \"mortals\", declaring herself the Queen of Boston. No one dared to stop her, many following her example and seeking out to destroy governments. That is until Beacon arrived. The meta with control over the lights of the world dared to stop her.\nThe Anarchists and Beacon allies confronted each other, nearly levelling Boston while doing so. Beacon may have succeeded in the fight but both sides lost. Both Anarchy and Beacon had died. However, that terrible event had passed, with Boston reforming itself, now named Beacon City in his honour.\n\nThe FMSA: A government that were formed to ensure that another Anarchy won't arise. Metas may be registered and employed as officers to enforce metahuman laws, becoming superheroes in a sense. However, not all is well in Beacon City.\n\nA dark legion led by a meta known only as Thanatos, a meta with a formidable grasp over nature itself, scours the city for blood to fuel his twisted agenda. He seems to seek out those powerful and twisted. Could that be you?\n\nJoin Universe 3-0-0, and you too may help decide Beacon City's fate. Will you join the FMSA? Keeping the peace and defending metas and civillians. Will you be an Anarchist? Following the ways of the chaotic group she lived and died for. Or will you be a vigilante? Defying the FMSA while still saving lives.\n\nHello there people of Reddit, I hope you enjoyed the prompt and come roleplay on my newly created server.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/WkFBcFt",

Though I do romance, I prefer to fade to black if that is about to occur.\n-My dynamic is m\u00d7f. \n-I am capable of playing multiple characters of either gender. Most of my muse comes from eastern Europe at the moment. \n-My preferred genres are fantasy, historical (I'm more versed in certain events here but am willing to do research), science fiction, and apocalyptic (which can even be caused by a historical event turning out differently). Any time period is fine!\n-I also roleplay Hetalia and have a ton of muses. Just let me know if you would like to see my muse list. \n\nIf you're interested in roleplaying with me, feel free to message me. I look forward to writing with you!",

            "selftext": " \n\n**Welcome to Shadowline!**\n\n***Shadowline is a Discord located, text based roleplay group.***\n\nCyberpunk meets Underworld in Seattle 2175, a city rife with political, criminal, and supernaturally-charged tension. A world where werewolves, vampires, and the rare bit of ritual magic clash with the neon glow and cybernetic upgrades humanity had been expecting.\n\nPlayers are free to join any of the factions we have. Two major factions, and 3 minor factions:\n\n**Major:**\n\n\\[Division\\]- A government agency responsible for investigating supernatural-based crimes. A supernatural FBI of sorts. They have high jurisdiction, and employ both humans and the supernatural. All agents are highly trained in combat and hostage situations. Their job is to keep the peace, and make both humans and supernaturals feel safe.\n\n(A second major faction is in the works)\n\n**Minor:**\n\nArgus - An entity whispered to be funneling resources into preserving humanity\u2019s place in a world quickly outpacing it. Argus favors the human condition over the supernatural, and tend to do so through hostility, violence, and other less than moral practices.\n\n\\[The Church of Black Magic\\]- A small group of magic specialists who investigate any events that have to do with magic. They tend to be contracted by other agencies, or even individuals to investigate these things, but often look into things on their own time as well.\n\nOr make your own way as an independent character or in one of Seattle\u2019s many gang factions (several of which are player-created and run!) We encourage the creation and pursuit of a personal narrative for everyone's character, and try to make it easy for them to progress and develop as they see fit, so long as what they have in mind is within the rules and lore, but we do allow some things to bend a little bit as long as it doesn't allow for an OP character.\n\nWhile we encourage freedom of choice with characters. However, this doesn't mean there is freedom of consequence. We like to keep things here somewhat realistic, and there is always a chance for repercussions if you make a criminal type. This universe is heavily monitored and has heavy law enforcement. Your character **can** be caught, and **will** be caught if things get carried away. However, you will be contacted directly before anything is done, to ensure that you understand why, how, and how long, ect.\n\nOur server features a detailed catalog of lore for the setting and a work-in-progress timeline from present day to 2175 to help players looking for world details they can employ to fully immerse their character creations into a setting populated by all walks of other players. We even have a map, featuring the general locations of all the places featured in RP channels. Currently all lore is located in a google document, and a website for easy navigation is currently under construction.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our luck to have a relaxed, friendly community of players who are always more than happy to help a new member or write a new scene (no worries about being out of the loop!) New members are expected to treat others with the same respect, and are encouraged to contact a mod on the side if they have an issue with another player (so far we\u2019ve been very drama-free!)\n\nWhile this server does not have an age limit, we do warn new members that due to the tense nature of many story lines content may be regarded as 18+. NSFW content is to be left to private messages between the players involved, but violence, gore, strong language, and drugs are allowed in general server channels.\n\nJoin us for some roleplay fun, all experience levels are welcome!\n\n[https://discord.gg/BWPUR2G](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FBWPUR2G&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIFXuffP9IIy-mFjDnsKr3Y441tw)",

I am not doing much over break so I'll be having a lot of free time the next couple of weeks to write a ton. I'm interested in a slice of life roleplay based around really anything. I'd like to brainstorm some ideas as I feel like that leads to both parties being more involved and into the roleplay. I have no preference for the plot but if you're someone that needs direction I am fine with coming up with something. I'm ok with darker/more serious themes or more lighthearted ones as well. Honestly I'm pretty much open to anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI prefer to use discord as I feel like it's easier to organize everything into their own dedicated channels (one for character background, one for out of rp talk, etc.) I can use 1st person or 3rd person and prefer around 2-3 short paragraphs or more per response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this sounds like something you're interested in, feel free to message me either on here or through discord (Heyzeusvee#4171) with a little about you and some ideas that you have.
