However, it's important that my partner enjoys world building as well... because, well, we're going to be doing a lot of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the title has indicated, I want the both of us to each to design our own race with their own culture and society. Naturally, you will be roleplaying as a member of the race you create. As for the rules surrounding the creation process\u2014there are none. Let your creative juices flow uninhibited! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for plots, I have a couple of bare-boned ideas in my head. However, nothing is set in stone since the plot we will be using is 100% dependent on the races we create.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, too ensure that we're on the same page, let me lay some ground rules:\n\n* We will be writing in third person past tense.\n* Romance is basically a must (cause I'm sappy AF).\n* Post lengths should typically be two or more paragraphs. That said, if our characters are in the middle of dialogue, short replies are fine.\n* I'd really like it if we could post daily. Although I understand there where will be days when this isn't possible.\n* The medium we will be using is discord.\n* I'm open to dark themes and NSFW.\n\nAssuming that none of that has deterred you, send me a DM if you're interested. Please include your discord id and some quick bits about yourself in the message.",

            "selftext": "First of all hello and thanks for taking the time to read my post. I'm Sam, from the UK, nice to meet you all. Now since this is my first post looking for a roleplay partner I may have gone a little overboard and written too much... I'll post a TLDR at the bottom if I remember and include headings so you don't get completely lost!\n\nNow before I jump into describing my idea I just wanna lay out the basic kind of roleplay I have in mind. I am looking for a literate partner to build a long term story with. The main topics I'm looking for are romance, drama, a little intrigue and mystery as well as the general feel of a slice-of-life story. For more see below...\n\n## Oakridge Academy\n\nThe school of that name had stood in the luscious hills of Derbyshire, in the middle of England, for over two centuries. Built on the edges of the peak district, it had educated the sons and daughters of the English elite, counting amongst its alumni politicians, judges, business giants and artists. As the times had changed, slowly but surely so had its students, more now coming from the ranks of the upper middle class. But whatever households they had come from, once they walked through the ancient iron gates, the only opening in the  thick grey walls of stone surrounding the acres of school grounds, students of the academy lived in a world of their own.\n\nParents who entrusted their offspring to the great marble halls and wood panelled classrooms of Oakridge only saw their children for a few weeks a year. They could in exchange however rest assured in the knowledge that their sons and daughters were receiving the best education money could buy. Naturally the level of academic performance expected was considerable, but more than that, Oakridge students were schooled in the ways of high society, preparing them for a life led amongst the lucky few who could count themselves a part of it.\n\nThe schools facilities catered for its pupils every need. When they weren't studying or sleeping, there was an abundance of opportunity to occupy their time. The school's library rivalled that of some universities. The walls encircling the grounds stretched far into the hills and woods in most every direction. Within them, many of the sports one might have expected to see at an English school were played year round, rugby, cricket and hockey pitches strewn amongst the fields surrounding the school buildings. However, having been built originally as a source of education for those of noble birth, somewhat more unusual activities were also catered for. Whether it be stables, a fencing master or shooting gallery, Oakridge had over the years acquired it and was unlikely to ever let it go.\n\nStudents as young as five walked the corridors, the school offering those parents who wished it a complete education, all the way until those who had come as children, left as adults, most bound for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Split into houses, each named after a usually noble benefactor of the academy, every year at the school was spent in a different  building, aside from the final two. Students on the verge of completing their education spent their last two years in Sanderson House, the sixth form accommodation, a building sat on a hill slightly apart from the rest. It is there that our story would be set.\n\n## Cassandra\n\nCassandra Evangeline Amelia Turnbull been one of those students who had never known a school life not at Oakridge. Her parents, who had themselves attended and in fact met during their time at the academy, had sent her to Derbyshire age five, followed a few years later by her sister Emily. She came from the kind of family that might just as well have attended Oakridge when it was first founded. Her father was one of the few remaining hereditary peers of the house of lords, her mother the heiress to an ancient estate in the north of Scotland, which, for antiquated reasons and much to her chagrin, had to pass to her husband. All in all they were the kind of people whose children were very much expected to attend a school like Oakridge, to attend a college at Oxbridge and go on to carry on the family legacy whether they wanted to or not.\n\n## Alexander\n\nAlexander Walker was not the typical Oakridge student. His father a high school teacher, his mother a journalist, he belonged to a household which only a few decades ago could never have dreamed to send a child to the academy. Nevertheless, in the summer before starting his final two years at school, his mum and dad sat him down and told him their hope that he would complete his education at a boarding school. At first he had been reluctant, after all it meant leaving his friends, his home and moving across the country from the busy streets of London to some dreary, stuffed-up estate in the countryside. Bu he could tell that it meant a lot to his father, who saw an opportunity for a brighter future in this move, considerable an investment as it was on the salary of a teacher and part time journalist. So with an appropriate amount of teenage grumbling, Max agreed and at the end of that summer he  found himself bound for Oakridge.\n\n## About the roleplay\n\nOk phew! If you've made it all the way down here congratulations! As you can see I've not gone as mad with the two main characters in terms of detail as the school. This is intentional as I don't want to predetermine too much of my eventual partner's character. I value development and work building as something we do together as much as the actual story we write and so I want to give them as much of an opportunity to Cassie their own as possible. This extends to basically anything I haven't mentioned, from her appearance to her personality, way of speaking etc.\n\nSo as by now you probably have guessed, I am looking for someone to play Cassandra opposite my Alexander. I foresee this (hopefully) becoming a truly long term roleplay, which could stretch not just their time together at the school, but at university and beyond. As (I think) I've mentioned before, I want this to be a slice-of-live romance, with a healthy dose of humour, drama, intrigue and mystery, Whether there are nsfw elements to their romance, or rather, to what extent we play them out, depends on my partners preferences.\n\nOn that note, I want to elaborate on what I said above, regarding world and character building as a team sport. I really do find that I only enjoy a roleplay if both partners are  crafting the story to their liking. Discussing potential plot lines, planning and deliberating is all an important part of the roleplay experience for me, so I'm looking for someone similar in that regard.\n\nSo if you find your appetite somewhat whetted by my rambles above I would love to hear from you and discuss things further. As long as this post is up I am still looking for a partner. You are of course welcome to ask any questions that might have arisen as you made your way through my word soup. I also always welcome any comments or (constructive) criticism on the way my post reads, as well as any suggestions you might have.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you (if any of you are left). x Sam",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'm a 25 year old female with most of my roleplay experience recently being as a tabletop gm. I'm looking for some partners to play in some discord roleplays with me with romance elements.\n\nI prefer fanon plots, usually with oc elements even if not the main pairing, and I'm a sucker for oc/canon but it's not remotely required. I'd be willing to do a double game playing a canon to your oc as well, ofc. My roleplay style tends to be posts as long as they need to be, and I tend to take a hesitant lead and plots forward and sketch out surroundings and such, but I'm always willing to dial it back if it gets to be too much! It's the GM in me that tells me I need to sketch everything out for my players, haha. \n\nI prefer a posting rate of once a day or two--sometimes I'm online and can do quick fire posts, but my work schedule sometimes means needing to let things sit for a few hours, haha. If you want immediate responses, I might not be a good partner for you! \n\nI roleplay in third person, present tense--another quirk of gming in real time. I don't mind if you prefer past tense which seems to be more common. \n\nI like out of character discussion and planning! \n\nI have a very small handful of characters pre-designed that are my OCs from tabletop games and stories. Most of the time, I won't use them because they don't fit the plot and I'll make up a character that fits what we want to play. Characters who last a long time become new ocs, haha, so help me build my collection! \n\nI kind of assume a standard aging up of any character under 18. \n\nIm a massive sucker for bad tropes like soulmate marks or bonding or creature traits etc. I'm also fine with tropes like crossover stuff, cross universe portals, etc.\n\nI'm fine to double for several pairings, and I use a lot of npcs regardless to set scenes. \n\nMy fandom interests include:\nPok\u00e9mon - mostly I'd be fine with ocs for this, but I'd also maybe sell a small part of my soul for anyone who wants to play guzma against an oc of mine. Otherwise, stuff like real people being dropped in the pokemon universe is fun, as is stuff like pokemon becoming people, science experiments, etc could be fun. I take a lot of creative liberties with pokemon, and prefer playing fun and loose with mechanics--i like the idea of people fighting pokemon if they need to, charm winning over pokemon instead of just fighting to capture, fakemon or typeshifted 'alola' versions of mon, etc. \n\nDanny Phantom - I have no idea of what a good plot would be but man I loved this show and I'd be down. I could possibly play a Sam, or we could run ocs that moved to town, or you're welcome to play any character that speaks to you if there's a canon interest. \n\nTeen Titans -  I have a massive love of beast boy and raven and would be done for canon characters, or I'd be equally down for canon/oc or oc/oc. I just love this universe. Could run a new recruit to the tower team sort of plot, a reformed villain plot, a dumb soulmark plot, etc for something with ocs. I think I could play Raven, Terra, or Starfire reasonably well. \n\nHarry Potter - I'm a sucker for a whole host of characters and time periods. No interest in future fic with the kids, but a game with riddle, the marauders, or the trio would all be neat. Creature tropes would be fun, as would some sort of in school recruitment type thing or an eight year post war? I'm weak for time travel, special powers, etc. Let's talk plots. \n\nMy Hero Academia - I'd also offer a small part of my soul for Aizawa/OC lol but beyond that I'd be fine running most things in this verse! Ocs at a new hero agency, future fic with the cast as full heros, villain aus, whatever! Let's talk plots--I'm super down for canon/canon for this one, and I'd be fine with an m/m ship since that's what most of the good ones are given the lack of female characters. \n\nOther random fandoms I'm aware of but don't immediately have a plot idea at hand for include:\nTamora Pierce's Tortall and Circle of Magic series\nMarvel/DC\nWorm\nNaruto\nInuyasha\nOverwatch\nFull Metal Alchemist\nKingdom Hearts\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I've posted this before, and all of the people who I accept as partners failed to respond further to my messages.\n\nSo I am writing a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon fan fiction as a sequel to the Explorers series, which is set in a Pokemon world hundreds of years more advanced than the original games, bringing it up to a similar technological development as the Pokemon anime. It's not necessary to read the fanfiction as I will explain the universe as the roleplay progresses, but you can check my previous RP ad for the link (links are only allowed once every 7 days). Basically, I just want to flesh out the world and have some fun!\n\nThe roleplay will be strictly SFW (and PG level content is preferred) and I tend to write in the style of science fiction since it's my favorite genre. Aside from that, I don't really have a presence of what premise to do.\n\nI would like to use reddit messaging for this roleplay, and I like to think I can be quite detailed in my writing, averaging one short paragraph per response, longer if something needs explaining or the scene is complex.\n\nIf this would be something you are interested in please message me.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

            "selftext": "Happy holidays, dear reader! Okay, admittedly, I\u2019m a little late to the \u201c12 days of Christmas\u201d party, but with free time and a sudden inspiration to write heart-wrenching, adrenaline-inducing, and romantic plots all at once, I\u2019m more than inspired to tackle my own \u201c12 Plots of Christmas\u201d challenge. \n\nSo, my dear reader, should you find interest in this or any of the subsequent plot starters, I\u2019d ask for no better holiday present than a little red message in my inbox. In case you\u2019re not sure we would be a match, I\u2019ll leave a little disclaimer at the end for the kind of writing partners I\u2019m looking for, and maybe that will help guide you a ways! \n\nBelow is a prompt set in the Marauders\u2019 Era of Harry Potter, written from the POV of Lily Evans:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n*He sees you, Mudblood.*\n\nHer reflection stared back at her as blood slid down the smooth glass terrain. Was it blood? Blood did not run so thickly. Or perhaps it did, and she simply had never taken notice. Deep red merged into the reflection of her hair, pooling into amber locks. She must have stood there for a long time, until Marlene\u2019s voice disturbed the silence: \u201cLily, what\u2019s taking you this lo-\u201c \n\nA single scream rang through the Gryffindor dormitories, spilling into the commons room. \n\nThe halls lit, one by one with hushed, hurried whispers of \u201c*lumos*\u201d. The girl\u2019s dormitory came to life in the dead of night, and even voices of sleep and scorn came from the boy\u2019s side of how *dramatic*girls can be. Behind the large door, the Fat Lady\u2019s voice could be heard muffled from the painting. \u2018What\u2019s happened? Oh someone tell me \u2013 I\u2019m not as flexible as I was, which I was quite flexible you know-\u2018 None paid her a passing regard, all wearing drowsy eyes and muffled yawns. \n\n\u201cBack to bed, all of you!\u201d The sharp voice of Professor McGonagall was enough to rouse any young witch or wizard from lingering remnants of sleep. Despite her demand, few followed suit, especially when the Professor charged up the girl\u2019s staircase with a purpose. Amidst the fearful whispers, Minerva managed to stop a more sensible looking witch in her tracks, and demanded: \u201cYou- tell me, what the bloody Merlin has happened here?\u201d \n\nThe answer was a chilling one. \u201cIt\u2019s Lily Evans, Professor. Some prankster has left her a message\u2026\" Then, in a hushed tone, \"They think it\u2019s written in blood.\u201d \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThank you for reading through that (especially on your holidays, no less)!

These are incredibly unique and allow for an interesting spin on a character.

This server is friendly to those people. We have resources to learn the series, such as linking videos on the entire timeline, and bios on each character (Although short as not to drag them on).

The corpses littering the stretch of several miles left an almost indiscernible difference between the warring factions.*\n\n*Global superpowers came together and pooled their resources together long ago, drawing their strengths from stories of old. Over time, the countries themselves devolved into what they are now; Knights, Vikings and Samurai. The Samurai chose for their main forces to stay as they were, weapons of an age coming to an end very quickly, while the others opted for advanced suits and weapons based on older designs with current technology to make them viable. These were those currently winning.*\n\n*With the Samurai on the cusp of extinction, they make one, desperate final gambit. The Yamaha Project.*\n\nThe Dragon battalion, famously known as the dominant force in the Samurai, had been beaten back into a corner and were quickly running out of options when the current ranking officer, Lieutenant Yamamoto, called their homeland with a desperate plea. The conversation went a little something like this:\n\n\"Base, this is Dragon one requesting reinforcements! There's too many of them, they're advancing too fast, we've got nothing left to hold them back! Whatever you can send, we need it and we need it now!\"\n\n\"Dragon one, this is Base. We're sending one out there, mark an LZ for them as far out as you can.\"\n\n\"One what, sir? One battalion? We need everything!\"\n\n\"Trust me, Dragon. ETA is five minutes. Mark with red smoke.\"\n\nThe men scattered between the few buildings accepted what was bound to happen to them, though they still sent out a single can of red smoke as far out into the field as they could. The next five minutes were the longest in Samurai history. \n\nThe familiar sounds of a fighter jet roared overhead, but this one drew the entire field's attention and all that was seen falling from the sky, was a single person, with a naginata in hand. No one could believe what they were seeing and when this line savior hit the ground, an explosion to rival that of a small nuclear device rang out and cleared the field of enemy troops for miles in every direction. The events that followed went down in Samurai history as the single greatest military victory ever; the Yamaha Gambit.\n\nSo yeah, this is supposed to be a futuristic For Honor prompt that I've had in mind forever. I don't really know what to do with it, all I know is I want to be a Nobushi with power armor, basically. So if this interests you, message me and we'll come up with something. But before any of that happens, come to me with a female character, it'll make both our lives easier. ",

This morning though, it would be a strange sight, stranger than perhaps any seen on this lonely road, but perhaps not. This road had a dark history and this was likely not the only blood upon it. A warrior with armor that perhaps once gleamed with a black luster, but was caked with mud and crimson upon it stumbled and limped forth. It was dinged and used, the helmet dented inward sharply from a smart blow, with fresh blood oozing out beneath. Behind the figure, two arrows stuck out of his back, large arrows that weren't for hunting animals, but for hunting men. The arrows were smeared with thick black substance, a poison to bring down prey and it mingled with his blood.*\n\n*Not far, a battle of some terrible purpose was fought, a battle of great scale and destruction, such that all manner of foul creatures have surely appeared to pick over the remains, thieves and cutthroats, dire maggots, storms of crows, and necromancers seeking the freshly dead.*\n\n*The man stumbled, walking half-heartedly, mostly driven by the will to continue on than any true purpose. Blood dripped from his form, seeping out from his armor. A long, thick silvery braid trailed down his back like spun moonlight, matted pink with lifeblood in it. Tired and world-weary green eyes peered out from beneath the helm as he struggled onward, trying to go as far as possible before the inevitable, a great two-handed sword dragging limply behind him in a hand that clung to it for the owner's very life.*\n\n---\n\nI would like to do a roleplay where a witch finds this hurt knight on the roadside and brings him into her care. Her manor, her land, her being should all be mysterious and shrouded in a dark allure. I would like very much to include Gothic themes and to keep as much mystery as possible and her intentions especially should not be known, or even whether she is good or wicked, but she should need him for something, just as he needs her. She might very well see a spark of the arcane in him that can be ignited, a force of steel and magic would be potent indeed, but this is just an idea. He is person of muddy ethics and dubious morality, but he does try to do good things, but his life has been covered in violence until he is nearly an avatar of it. Killing people seems to have been the only use anyone has had for him in his life, maybe she can bring more into it. I'm very comfortable with role-reversal and I am seeking it, to where she is the caretaker, keeping him in safety and comfort, but I would like for him to have his moments of guardianship over her as well, maybe he can hulk out and find strength in rage or righteous fury.\n\nI'm not adverse to NSFW content.",

Currently I am looking for  medieval setting ideas (Or realistic/Modern, if the plot interests me or if it is unique!). Both could include supernatural elements as well. We could brainstorm ideas until we come up with something we both agree on, or you could probably let me know if you have any plots in mind that I might like!\n\nI generally write around 2-4 paragraphs. I understand if you have to write less and I am a very understanding and flexible person when it comes to reply times and such. Several NSFW elements might be included depending on the roleplay so I would really like it if my partner was 18+ like me.\n\nAs for fandoms, I am not really into roleplaying any fandoms other than Game of Thrones and ASoIaF currently. So I am always willing to try it out with you if you know them well. Whether you would prefer using canons, OC\u2019s or a mix of both, that\u2019s all up to you, I like them all.\n\nI only roleplay on Discord. sometimes I might prefer a server to be created for the roleplay, especially if it was detailed and done nicely in order to keep it neatly organized.\n\nFeel free to PM me and we could work something out!\n\n",

It\u2019s incredibly irritating and I\u2019m really tired of partners disappearing after I get excited to start an RP.\n\nHaving said that, let\u2019s cut to the chase.\n\nI\u2019m twenty-six years old, and I have been roleplaying for over ten years, so I have a good deal of experience in my opinion. I am a multi-paragraph sort of writer, which means that frequently, my writing will exceed at least 500 words, and upward of 1000+ words. I love detail and description, and I am actively seeking someone who can tell the same. I love getting several paragraphs to reply to! I also enjoy unexpected twists and people who put effort into the story we're creating. I give my posts my all, and it'd be wonderful if you could do the same. Also, I usually write in third person, past tense.\n\nAs for my schedule, it\u2019s a bit unpredictable. There will be some days where I can reply multiple times and there will be some days where I can\u2019t reply at all. I\u2019ll try my best to let you know in advance if there will be a period of 3+ days where I can\u2019t reply, but things happen.\n\nI only RP via email, I\u2019ll give you my address if you\u2019re interested. I\u2019m looking for someone who has no problem with handling darker themes and is fine with gore/violence/profanity. Basically, I\u2019m hoping for some non-romantic, action-packed long-term RP. You could play an OC or a canon character as well. I\u2019m up for crossovers as well as long as you\u2019re fine with that I play a canon character from Blade Runner 2049.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: for the purposes of what I am looking for, I am going to be rather picky about who contacts me. So please, don\u2019t contact me with a \u201cHey, i\u2019m interested in rping with you,\u201d \u2013 that just doesn\u2019t inspire me. Tell me something about yourself. I promise I won\u2019t bite!\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\n\nLinda",

We live different lives so do not necessarily need to be together to start off. The Aliens have been tasked with destruction of all planets with other species. They may be interested in abduction, experimentation or depending on their perogative may be more inclined in simply eliminating you. \n\nI am also open to other ideas and plots that can be thrown into the mix. There may be romance or other NSFW elements that can consist part of this story.\n\nI prefer Discord as the medium of writing. Thick plots with literary writers describing the environment and emotions are highly enjoyable and that is what I seek too. It makes RP fun and eventful. Like many other ads have said Quality over Quantity. One paragraph responses are fine if you would like to keep the story moving and are busy but we should match each others responses. For example, 3 paragraphs should be met with minimum 2 paragraph responses, etc.\n\nPlease DM me if you are interested and I will share my Discord account.\n\nCheers,\nA",

            "selftext": "Hey all! I think the title says a lot, but I'll expand, obviously :) \n\nI've been roleplaying on-and-off for over a decade, and I've had an itch for a few months to get back into it, so here I am. I began with chat rooms and most recently have done Google Docs, so any format is really fine. \n\nI want a roleplayer, or a group of RPers, who is/are **active but flexible.** My **EST/EDT schedule** is on-and-off, and I'm looking for a job between contracted projects, and I have people IRL who I hang out with almost every day. So while I don't want something to go dark for six days unwarranted, I'm forgiving if things are quiet for one. If we happen to be visibly and actively online, though, I'd love to go back-and-forth with you for a while and chat about the RP! (Nice, but not necessary :) ) Communication is key! \n\nMy posts can go **anywhere from one line of text and dialogue to several paragraphs.** If you're not down for both directions, **I'd prefer someone who leans towards longer posts** - and if you're strict about that, I can absolutely work with that, too. \n\n**I'd prefer someone who works in \"full sentences\" and \"paragraphs,\" too** - I write a lot so my tolerance floor is a bit high. It doesn't have to be academic or professional, but I want to at least feel like I'm reading something worth my own efforts. \n\n**I lean strongly modern fantasy and/or apocalypse settings.** Not, like, Shadowverse - think more Buffy or even Bright. \n\n**I love OCs and love plots centered around their decisions.** There's nobody too \"edgy\" (in the 2010 DeviantArt sense, not the racist-humor sense) or cliche for me. Give me your overdramatic OC children, as long as they're shallow enough to drown in facing down. I'm fine with characters of any sexuality/romantic orientation, race (in all senses of the word), gender, whatever as long as you're not being crude about the identity. \n\nIf you're an aspiring DM/GM or fictional author or building a setting - hello! Let's give your worlds a shot. I'm not good at proposing settings, but I'm in love with world-building and would love to help flesh out your ideas. If you're not good with settings either but like what I've put out so far, I'm sure we'll \"uhh\" each other until something happens. \n\n**I have a romantic partner, so I'm not looking for an explicitly romantic/beyond deal,** and I can tell if you're actively and aggressively pushing towards that. So don't even try to entertain that.  \n\nI'm putting an age barrier because I'm in my mid-20s and don't want to do anything sketchy by accident. I can move into gore, intimacy or other NSFW, but that is extremely far from my focus here. \n\nAnd most of all, while I love serious and mature settings and roleplayers, it's all about fun and engagement in the end. \n\nAlso, throwaway because I use my normal account a lot or other stuff. \n\nDM if interested!!

This star impacted with our world and the energy that gave it its blue hue fused with Mora's surface and all the elements within it. The living energy then assumed a physical form, using its power over the elements to meticulously create itself a body. It then became her, the crafter, and as the crafter with her powers would bring our world life and beauty. She would create plants, then creatures and finally she would create us, the dolls. The first four of our kind were born from her physical body and called the Elementals: Phyra, Isma, Proten, and Ignitis. Each represented an aspect of the Crafters personality and possessed a portion of her power, each controlling one of the elements she had fused with, the crafter herself remaining the sole holder of energy. After the Elementals came the more common dolls, born of pod and seed rather then from the crafter herself. At first they remained near the place of their creation, building up a grand city that still stands today. We call it the Origin. After a while however, as their numbers grew they began to move out farther into world were they used their own powers to build new settlements in all directions outward of the Origin but not leaving the island it was built upon for thousands of years. They lived in such peace and prosperity that the island became known as the Oasis and here each doll lived eternally. The peace was not to last however. Unknown to the crafter and her creations, down just below Mora's surface a being had been slowly coming awake since the crafter's descendants and now it made itself known. Enraged by the presence of unwanted guest, the being who we'd name Notin breached the surface and sent up his dark minions who possessed the bodies of living things and used them against us. Valiantly those early dolls took up arms and alongside the Elementals and the crafter held against the threat from the shadows, but Notin\u2019s power was overwhelming and settlement after settlement fell. Thousands of our precursors were lost and the Crafter, with all her compassion and love for her creations chose to sacrifice her physical form to save all life on Mora. Once again pure energy and one with the world she closed the breeches and trapped Notin and his minions below, preventing them from reinforcing their topside comrades and giving us the reprieve we needed to beat the shadows of destruction back and retake our island. After that first big victory, under the guidance of the Elementals, now the wisest and oldest amongst us, we began to expand rapidly so that we could not be so easily overwhelmed again. For the first time we sailed from the Oasis and settled in unfamiliar foreign lands. We established new settlements and restructured our society to be more efficient, assuring our continued existence. The Authority and its caste system was put in place by the Elementals,and the 1st Arbiter, a doll of pure heart and mind was created to head it and govern us and under her and it we began making new dolls and using the process of strand weaving to manipulate their traits, allowing them to better fit into their caste and better fulfill their roles. Once again Doll kind began to thrive, though our war with the remnants of notins cut off forces, left on the surface when the breeches closed, would continue and still continues thousands of years later. Now a days we have managed to come to a point were most us no longer have to fear for our lives on a daily basis. That said, today doll kind is divided more than ever before. The cities outside of the Oasis and their appointed rulers, the Dons, have become largely independent. Without the Crafter we have also lost our ability to live eternally, and even the mighty Elementals have passed as a result in the years since. This mortality has caused newer generations to seek out the endless lives our ancestor had and some have gone as far as to let their minds be taken in Notins grasp in exchange for power and eternal life. He continues to manipulate the minds of dolls from his realm and we continue to lose cities and towns to treachery and deceit from within. Infighting has also become a problem. Some Dons let their egos outgrow their domains and clash with other of their caste, leading to strife and even war between Dolls. \u00a0Their are also those who don't wish to fulfill their duty to their kind and leave the cities were they are born to lead lives of solitude and sometimes crime in the wilds. However the most recent Arbiter, the fifth to rule, has been the most zealous in her efforts to restore unity under the Authority. She has employed symbols like the Eye of the Authority to instil a sense of dread in our enemies and security in our citizens. She has enforced our new and old laws alike with an attitude of ruthlessness and mercilessness. She directs and coordinates our armies with precision and she does not tolerate the arrogance that some dons have allowed themselves to develop. Still, in spite of her efforts, cities on the frontier line continue to fall and the umbral forces continue to come up with new beast and weapons they use to crack city walls and massacre innocent dolls or take over their bodies and use them against us. However things are,we will continue to fight and we will continue to protect our home and civilization until the the last doll is broken.\n\nIf you are interested here is the Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/6EDRV7n\n\nOtherwise thanks for reading if youve made it this far.

Ah, those were good times when yahoo had chat rooms, but like everything, they came to an abrupt end. I've been trying to find better roleplaying platforms since then but none beats yahoo.\n\nFor starters, I am a paraplayer who likes to get very kinky but these are introduced gradually as the scene progresses. Emotions at times are at times an integral part of my plays. I usually like playing slightly off beat roles. My favorite ones are,\n\n1) Priest\n2) Doctor\n3) Professor\n4) Servant\n\nI also like playing TABOO roles including stepdad, stepson, father in law, grandpa etc type of roles.\n\nI am on Facebook and KIK. If you would like to discuss, please respond in comments or email me at Steve.detailed.roleplayer@gmail.com.\n\nMy KIK is RPwSteve",

I'm really into medieval plots lately but I've also done a lot of sci-fi roleplaying. I like to play sworn swords with dark pasts or green guards/soldiers who have to grow up quickly.\n\nI prefer female characters to be strong and self-sufficient, willing to give orders and not be a damsel in distress. A character who is not afraid of her feelings and is willing to pursue her desires, somewhat of a tsundere character would be ideal, a princess who is cold to the bodyguard her father forces her to have but opens up over time, a woman who isn't afraid to boss a man around.\n\nI\u2019m looking for literate partners that are willing to type at least 1-2 paragraphs per response, there may be some nsfw themes later in the story. Let me know your limits if you decide to PM me about this rp. I roleplay on discord exclusively and like to become friends with my partners. If you find this at all interesting feel free to send me a pm with a short introduction and your discord info.\n\nPreference will be given to you if you come with your own world and plot you want to try!",

Please don't message me offering up Ronon or Sheppard, or any other non-Wraith, canon or OC. While I'm open to other Wraith aside from Todd, including OCs, I'm going to be prioritizing him over any others. Don't let that stop you from requesting to play a different Wraith dude, though! It's very unlikely that I'll brush you off if you'd rather write for a different one, especially if you go with the Wraith out of the** ***Condemned*** **episode, or one very similar to him.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. My character will be human, though that's probably a big ol' *duh*. Her inclusion will turn things into a bit of an AU situation, but I promise it's not too far-fetched/out of line of SG:A's general feel.\n2. I'm currently looking for *Todd* the most and would absolutely adore it if someone could write for him against my OC. I'm open to other canon Wraith too, *especially* the one from *Season 2's episode 5, Condemned*. Open to OC Wraith dudes, as well.\n3. Yes, *long-term* too. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy one-shot wonders. But, if you\u2019re no longer feeling the RP, I can understand the desire to stop. I can also understand life getting in the way of replying. Just tell me if you\u2019d like to stop, or if you might not be able to reply. Definitely try to give me a heads up if you won't be able to reply soonish.\n4. I only RP over **Discord**, **Telegram**, and *very hesitantly* Skype. You might be able to convince me to use something else, but I can just about guarantee I\u2019m not gonna use email, and I'm *very tentatively* open to using notes/PMs.\n5. I do expect **NSFW/Mature/18+/21+** themes. Plot and character development over one particular gritty subject, obviously, but it's still expected and not something I'm willing to gut. If you're not of age, or are squeamish when it comes to NSFW themes (and all aspects it encompasses), then please do not contact me. I've had some folks of the latter, and I just...I don't quite get why they'd message me to begin with, but whatever.\n6. I don\u2019t have many limits, and the ones I do have are rather commonplace ones that I feel most people share. Keep in mind that while I don\u2019t have very many limits, I am still rather *plain*. I\u2019m willing to incorporate certain things, as I have a few of my own that I enjoy, and I\u2019m willing to listen to what you might like as well, within reason. Grittier details will (hopefully) be discussed after contact details are given, or in PM.\n7. I RP *third person*, past tense, and am capable of cranking out 12-14 paragraphs. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but no fewer than 2-3 paragraphs. I don\u2019t expect you to match me, but please don\u2019t throw one-liners at me. I just need something to work with, and it's super discouraging to crank out 6+ paragraphs and get practically nothing in return.\n8. I love details, and I love fluff, but what I really adore is stuff I can genuinely reply to. Give me things that convey emotion and I\u2019ll love you to bits!\n9. I can *double* or do a *split* RP of your choosing (so long as I know the genre or at least can get a feel for it, if it's not SG related), with any sort of pairing, if that would 'sweeten the pot\u2019. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Keep in mind that I'm a little rusty when it comes to writing for two main characters, but I will most certainly try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m online more often than not, at all hours of the day, so catching me shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue.

            "selftext": " Hi everyone!  \nI am searching for a writing partner or two to take on a new story or two with me. I\u2019ve looked here once or twice in the past few months, but unfortunately didn\u2019t have much time to dedicate to the process due to the end of semester and holidays. I should have more time with the new year, and I\u2019m looking forward to diving back into my favorite hobby.  \n\n\nA little about me: I\u2019m in my late 20s, female, in the southern US (CST), and I frequently have time during my workday where I can write, so that's how I enjoy passing the time. On most days, you can expect at least 2-3 responses, however evenings and weekends are dependent upon family activities. I write in third person, multi-paragraph responses, though rapid fire can be useful at times when heavy dialogue is occurring. I leave that up to you, as I'm perfectly capable of providing a well rounded paragraph or two even during lots of dialogue. Discord is my preferred platform, but email is fine too.  \n\n\nI live for brainstorming, plotting, and worldbuilding...not to mention a fiery, passionate love story. I enjoy adding romantic themes into all of my stories, preferably between the two main characters. It's where I get the most enjoyment. That being said, I do like writing adult content, but the buildup is the best part, and diving into character development leading up to it is worth the wait. But overall, my stories do not have to be solely centered around that and romance, I just like to include it. I also like to consider darker themes, and don't shy away from violence and language when the plot calls for it.  \n\n\nMy last several RPs, I've written as the dominant male, and I'm hoping to take a step away from that. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m only wanting a submissive, damsel-in-distress female, but simply that I would prefer to have my main character be female. I do enjoy adding plenty of side-characters and NPCs too!   \n\n\nHere are some ideas I\u2019ve been brainstorming - Please note that none of these are set in stone, just conversation starters to see if some good matches can be made!  \n\n\n1. Medieval/Maybe low-fantasy/GoT-ish: Arranged marriages, kidnappings, kingdoms being overrun, politics...I\u2019m all for it! So many possibilities for fun power dynamics, opposites attracted to each other, hierarchy differences etc.   \n\n\n2. Wild West/Red Dead Redemption: I\u2019ve been playing the latest RDR game and I\u2019m obsessed with this genre lately! I\u2019d love to write up a good story between two star-crossed lovers in this type of world.  \n\n\n3. Angels/Demons: Biblical-type apocalypse looms, and I have an idea for an angel that chooses to become fallen in order to infiltrate hell. Playing her opposite a demon of some sort would be awesome! It\u2019s a mix of ideas swirling right now, but if anyone is at all interested in this type of theme I\u2019d be happy to chat more.  \n\n\n4. Supernatural/Modern: A woman starts over in a new town, and unknowingly accepts a position at a company run by \\[vampires? Lycans?\\] I love anything supernatural related and worldbuilding would be tons of fun.  \n\n\nAnyway, those are just a few thoughts, but I am totally down to discuss anything you shoot my way. I\u2019m happy to chat about any idea, and I will be straightforward and honest if for some reason I\u2019m not interested.   \n\n\nHope to hear from some writers soon!",

            "selftext": " \n\nGood day, my fellow role players! I\u2019m back to try and get my RP on, once again. I\u2019ve been away due to some IRL and I had tried to get something going with people, but ultimately was torn away by adulting. I\u2019d really like to try and start RPing again to get my creative juices flowing. But right now; I have absolutely no idea what I\u2019d like to do! So, please, feel free to plot it down with me. Some facts about me: I\u2019m in my twenties and have been role playing since I\u2019m about eleven years old! I currently work in a school so I\u2019m usually working from about 8am to 2 or 4pm, with weekends off. Making friends with my RP partners is something I always do, because a healthy friendship always makes RPing with someone just that much sweeter! That being said; I\u2019m referred to as being very sweet, very open but extremely blunt. At least I\u2019ll be honest with you! xD\n\nWhat genres I\u2019m good with:\n\n* Supernatural\n* Sci-fi\n* Fandom (Video games, movies, shows etc.)\n* Horror/Thriller\n* Mature\n* NSFW\n* Modern\n* Victorian\n* Slice of life (Long as it\u2019s not too dramatic/boring)\n\nI will say that I have the most experience in the supernatural and fandom realms. I\u2019m also willing to do a spin-off of a game/show/movie universe and create something of our own.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\n* I will only play female characters (I\u2019ll play males if it\u2019s needed for story building) and I only do MxF if pairing happens.\n* I will not do only NSFW (aka do not contact me if you\u2019re just looking to get your freak on. It\u2019s not going to happen.)\n* World of Warcraft has been my bae for a loooong time and I have many characters I\u2019ve developed. I\u2019m willing to work with yours but if I don\u2019t like them, I will voice it!\n* With that being said; I need you to know that for any reason, if I begin to feel that I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to work, I will voice it as well. Sometimes people are awesome as friends but with Role Playing, it just doesn\u2019t work!\n* Please, please, please! Basic High School - College level grammar and spelling, and lots of juicy details! I get bored easily!\n* I will match your post as much as possible. If we are in a lull, you\u2019ll know it by the amount I post. I try to keep my paragraphs thick! (Giggity.)\n\nAnything else, we can talk about over discussion! Send me a PM! I\u2019ll be waiting! Thanks for reading over this c: And I\u2019m open to more than just what I\u2019ve listed! Throw ideas at me, do it! DO IT!",

If you have any interesting plots on your mind feel free to send those my way as well!\n\nSome basics: \n\n* 18+ only! Please mention your age when you send me a PM\n* Please don't just send me your discord username. Tell me a bit about yourself or what ideas you might have. \n* I really prefer mxm or fxf. All of the characters I have right now are male, but if you send me a plot that is mxf or fxf, that's okay too. \n* I write casual paragraph style. Unless it's an introduction or a scene change, I don't write more than a paragraph, usually only a few sentences. However, I typically don't do one liners either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to the characters! I don't want to list too much here, so these are just snippets of their personality. \n\n* Jean: A young (20 or so) Frenchman, set in the 1800's or so. He's a thief who mingles with high society in order to steal their goods. Acts a bit like a snob, but is really just trying to be able to get into high class parties. \n* Leon: A bratty prince type character, fantasy setting. Probably around 22 or so. He can be an actual prince or just the type. Good at magic but not the best. Is often demanding and selfish. Tends to take command, but doesn't always have the best ideas. \n* Milan: A college professor, around 25, in a modern setting. He's a good person, who likes to focus on the good of others. However, he's often disorganized, late, and clumsy. He's good at his discipline (British Literature) but sometimes not a very rational thinking. Occasionally does really dumb things for the right reasons. \n\nPM me if you want to write with me with any of these characters, or if you have any other ideas!",

I don\u2019t mind writing in either third or first person or in what tense I write, however I care for consistency when writing. My preferred medium is discord. As for adult themes I am totally open.\n\nA few things I really to write are:\n\n-High Fantasy Viking-esque Settings\n\n-Supernatural Urban Fantasy \n\n-Victorian Era\n\n-Medival Settings\n\nI also could see myself doing the following Fandoms: \n\n-Elder Scrolls \n\n-Dragon Age\n\n-Asoiaf/Game of Thrones\n\nMost important to me though is the romance aspect. Pm me for my discord Tag to work specifics out, I would also love prompts if you have one already!\n\nThank you for reading and have a nice night/day!",

I know that might be a turn off for some but the communities I am apart of, along with the other partners I have require good quality role-playing. I can easily reply with a good length (anywhere from 1-5 paragraphs, even more). Grammar and spelling are very important to me, so I would consider myself very literate. I'm looking for F4F because it's something I'm passionate about, I have no intentions of excluding anyone I swear, boys and boy rpers. ;)   \n\n\n**Some genres I'm interested in:** \n\n- Mystery/Thriller \n\n- Fantasy\n\n- Crime\n\n- Dark Themes \n\n- Romance \n\n- Si - Fi\n\n- Open to anything else interesting. \n\n**Fandoms:**   \n- I only have experience or knowledge of the Marvel universe, both Comics and MCU. (Sorry for the lack)   \n\n\n***RP RULES:*** \n\n1. Please if you want to do Romance of any kind, be over the age of eighteen. \n2. Be literate, I am not interested in role-playing with someone who one lines, at least two paragraphs with each response. \n3. NSFW is something I'm open to but after we speak for a while and it needs to come naturally in the story. I will not write strictly sexual stories. \n4. Please be patient, my responses might take a bit due to real life issues, but I do care about our story and have no intention of ghosting you once we begin. \n\n\n*I would rather us RP on discord but if you need to do it in another place, we can talk about it.* \n\nI hope that we can come together to create something amazing!! Just PM me for my Discord info, and we can get started with discussions and whatnot. \n",

A decade after the two most powerful potentials were demolished, Maximization and Deterioration, maybe a century after came the rise of something greater\u2026 Something much more dangerous\u2026 Rouge.*   \n*Inckurus.

The source behind the disease is unknown and heroes and researches alike conclude that it might be because of the potential itself, the genes in the DNA of humans causing such an outrage among the earth. The effects of Inckurus, as described by witnesses causes the potentials of the host to multiply in power by a tenfold and have the user have no control over it.

You can also be an infected.\n\nWe really lack of members right now, so we'd love if some people joined the fun. We also lack of staff members, so staff applications may open soon.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention this, roleplayers are able to submit their own ideas for an arc of the roleplay.\n\nThis server took a lot of time to make, so we'd really appreciate if some people joined to roleplay with us, no matter if it's one-liners or people that write a whole paragraph about a single action. We do this for fun!\n\nSo... want to join? The link is right below.\n\n[https://discord.gg/Jg6dgRu](https://discord.gg/Jg6dgRu)",

I\u2019m looking for someone to create stories with me- I\u2019m all for smut and hot and heavy sessions, but there needs to be a REASON for it, and it needs to flow naturally with what we\u2019re doing.\n\nI also, on account of the fact that smut will most likely eventually be a thing, am only looking for play with female characters. Truthfully I don\u2019t care if you yourself are female or not- but in my experience men don\u2019t play female characters as well in that regard- but feel free to come prove me wrong!\n\nSo, once more- story focused plots centered around the women of Overwatch, wherein I play D.Va about 99.9% of the time, and smut happens on occasion with good reason. If interested, PM me and we can get things rolling! And, if enough people do, I might be inclined to start a group. We\u2019ll see.",

I\u2019m looking for a long term/one rp partner, better if 18+.\nI\u2019m open pretty much to anything, from fantasy to modern, from romance to action. \nI also prefer OC, but I\u2019m okay with fandoms too (I\u2019m pretty much into Manga/Anime, Marvel, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, some other stuff I don\u2019t remember right now).\nNothing wrong with nsfw rps. but I don\u2019t like nsfw based plots.\n\nI usually write medium par (5-8 rows) but, again,  that can be decided. I\u2019m not particularly picky about the language, just wanna see some effort in writing anything.\n\nI usually like elaborated plots, and create them with my partner. I\u2019m mainly on Discord, so please dm me if you\u2019re interested!",

            "selftext": "So I am writing a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon fan fiction as a sequel to the Explorers series, which is set in a Pokemon world hundreds of years more advanced than the original games, bringing it up to a similar technological development as the Pokemon anime.  [Here's](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13094588/1/Pokemon-Mystery-Dungeon-Protectors-of-Time) the fan fiction if you're interested, but it's not necessary to read it as I will explain the universe as the roleplay progresses. Basically, I just want to flesh out the world and have some fun!\n\nThe roleplay will be strictly SFW (and PG level content is preferred) and I tend to write in the style of science fiction since it's my favorite genre. Aside from that, I don't really have a preference of what premise to do.\n\nI would like to use reddit messaging for this roleplay but I am open to suggestions in terms of medium, and I like to think I can be quite detailed in my writing, averaging one short paragraph per response, longer if something needs explaining or the scene is complex.\n\nIf this would be something you are interested in then please message me.",

            "selftext": "I could really use a lot more writing to keep me busy right now, so here I am. Thanks for reading my ad.\n\nCurrently Craving: Some kind of m//, slice of life, best friend drama and fluff. I have a character in mind for this that needs attention. - This is usually always true. XP!\n\nOkay! I feel like I\u2019m horrible at these things, but here goes\u2026\n\nFor the purpose of the roleplay, you can call me Phina (hi!). I seem to have slowly lost all my roleplay partners \u2013 such is life, I know - but entropy is only natural, right? (No, really\u2026I\u2019ve been really lucky overall recently, but I have lost one or two partners and could really use one or two more roleplays.)\n\nAnyway! I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to scare people off by saying this, but I love both quality and quantity. I love writing detailed stories with strong character development and relationships. For me, it\u2019s the characters that are most important. I do understand that posts tend to vary in length as the roleplay goes on \u2013 I don\u2019t want filler, but please try for at least two paragraphs every time. I will write you novels (at least four paragraphs, probably more), especially if I am inspired. If that bothers you, we are not a good match. That being said, I am very laid back once I get to know you. If you have a character that I love, I will probably be more accepting of shorter replies (no less than a paragraph) - especially if I know a lot about them already.\n\nI hate that we have to cover this at all, but all the standard rules apply. If you don\u2019t know them already, I will list a few of them for you, just because I\u2019m nice like that. Still, if you haven\u2019t been roleplaying long enough to know them, it\u2019s very unlikely that we will make a good match.\n\n*No god modding or power playing\n*No Mary-Sues or Gary-Stews etc..\n\nNo, this is stupid and I don\u2019t want anyone to think I think they\u2019re stupid, because I don\u2019t, so\u2026I won\u2019t bore you - you get the picture. Just show me respect and I will do you the same kindness. If you need to drop the roleplay, please tell me. That way, I know and I can move on (or we can create something new together). If you\u2019re going to be away -again- please tell me. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell me if something isn\u2019t working, either. Overall, I think communication is really the key thing here. I want us both to be comfortable with everything about the roleplay, and we shouldn\u2019t roleplay at all if something doesn\u2019t feel right. Other than that, just do your best to create/write a realistic and engaging character and we will be best friends.\n\nLimits\n\nBlood and Gore: None; realistic blood and gore is totally okay and a natural part of life\nSwearing: None; swearing is a valid and a much needed form of expression\nSmut: We fade to black unless I know you well.\n\nTimeline\n*I live in the Eastern Standard timezone\n*I\u2019m finished school and I don\u2019t work, so I have a lot of time on my hands, but I do spend a lot of time training for three different sports and LARP/tabletop has become a passion. I can still get pretty busy, trust me.\n*I will probably have time to post about once a week. However, as workload and other commitments change, it could be more often \u2013 or less often. I think the main issues now are energy levels and muse. I\u2019m finding myself needing more roleplays than I had during school because I do have both more free time and more energy. I still get busy - I still have days where I can\u2019t reply - but I would like to have more than one active, long-term roleplay at a time. Muse and energy levels be damned.\n*I will try my best to keep you updated on those changes. I expect you to try to do the same.\n*I would love a reply once a week (more often is great, too!). However, I totally understand those when life eats you whole and you have to painstakingly de-zombie-fy yourself because there is/was just too much life going on at once for you to both handle and stay sane at the same time \u2013 never mind roleplaying! Just try to warn me?\n\nImportant Notes\n*This roleplay will be 21 plus (I\u2019m 28 now) and over email. I may do a forum or a Google Docs roleplay if you are lucky, though\u2026or even Skype or Discord for the right person and plot.\n*Also! I primarily do queer roleplays. I haven\u2019t found a standard mxf roleplay fun in years. However, the full gender spectrum is more than welcome. I guess you could get me to do mxf that way\u2026lol!\u00a0\n*I\u2019m queer and NB myself. (I love they pronouns. &lt;3)\n\nOn to the genres!\n*Sci-fi\n*Modern/futuristic fantasy\n*Gifted\n*Runaways\n*School (boarding school, arts school, high school, college)\n*Dystopian Society/Post-Apocalyptic Society\n*Anything with disabilities included in a positive way\n*Some modern, slice of life stuff, where we can make cute, fluffy awkwardness together; think close childhood friends that accidentally get separated by life and are reunited years later and all the feelings that could/would bring up, or a long time unspoken crush that is only brought to light when a mutual friend brings together an unlikely couple\n*Modern vampires, werewolves and mages\n- I like characters with depth. I want fluff, but I also love it when a character has a backstory chalked full of things that make them them, both good and bad. I love to see how they are feeling, what they are thinking and why. I want to see them change and grow as time goes on and they process the things that have happened to them in life. I would love a roleplay and characters that I can get invested in, one that will make me both laugh and cry. Basically, I want realistic characters that I can relate to.\u00a0\n\nOdd Pairings\nRich x Poor (street kid)\nDeaf x Hearing\nGifted x Gifted (or non-gifted human; think X-Men style)\nGay x Closeted\n(Childhood) Best friend x (Childhood) Best friend\n\nI\u2019m sure there are more I\u2019m forgetting\u2026but any of these can also be combined together for even more fun! I want to take the time to plot with you.\n\nNote: I don\u2019t really do fandoms, and I definitely don\u2019t play with cannon characters.\n\nRandom: The friendship between Matt and Foggy in Netflix Daredevil is really well done and adorable. Too bad I never play cannon characters. &lt;3 That\u2019s the kind of bonding and character development that I live for!\n\nAlso! Something based on Sense8 would be cool. What I\u2019ve seen of it so far is awesome - though I\u2019m not sure how a roleplay could be done or how it would go. Falling Skies is also cool, as are Firefly, Orphan Black and Guardians of the Galaxy.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Oh! A note about my writing style: I tend to like to paint pictures with my writing, especially when inspired. I write detailed, flowy and almost poetic posts a lot. Everything has to fit together. If you like that sort of thing and have a writing style close to that, we\u2019ll be wonderful. That\u2019s a bonus in my mind.\u00a0\n\nThanks for reading. I look forward to hearing from you!\n\n",

            "selftext": "With everyone\u2019s favourite manga on a break next week, it\u2019s just impossible to get your weekly dose of the One Piece world\u2026 Or is it?\n\n#StrawHatRPG: An Open World Roleplay Community\n\nWelcome to StrawHatRPG, the **oldest ongoing One Piece Roleplay Subreddit**. We are an alternate universe set in the rules of the One Piece World but without any of the canon characters, entirely new locations and a few familiar ones. The new storyline has just started and we have a huge active playerbase at the moment, so it\u2019s a great time for you to join us!\n\nWe\u2019ve started a new adventure in the One Piece world, and have had some scuffles with the Marines in the North Blue. To go on an offensive against the rising new age pirates, the Marines have begun mobilising and executing pirates by the dozens! But thankfully some powerful allies intercepted the mass murder and saved us all! Now we\u2019re making our way to Reverse Mountain and the Grand Line! A spark ignites a blazing flame in the hearts of the next era of Pirates. Come join us on a brand new adventure and immerse yourself in the stunning world of One Piece!\n\n***\n\nOur goal here at the sub is to be a story-driven, pseudo-linear RPG. Similar to the One Piece Manga, we continually journey forward from island to island. The island is completely open-world, meaning you can go where you like. This means you can explore, investigate, rabble-rouse, pick fights, get drunk, lay on the beach, train, or anything else you can think of! There will be events that players can participate in, or simply do their own thing, making up their own mini-story. Besides this, each island will also have a main story, open to all of the players.\n\nWe encourage **creativity and individualism**, and will try and help facilitate that as much as we can (while keeping in mind the themes, and tone of One Piece, and the sub). Players have various different options to customise their characters such as **Custom Devil fruits**, Abilities like **Diable Jambe or Asura** that are unique to their character etc. Players can also choose to **play as any race** from the world of One Piece or they can even combine races to get the best of both worlds! In fact, players can even make up and moderate their own mini-island stories!\n\nIf all of these seem daunting, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve simplified the rules into easily digestible docs so that anyone can easily get started. Between our experienced mod team and **super friendly and helpful community**, you won\u2019t have any trouble finding all the help you need. We\u2019ve also taken into account all the feedback we\u2019ve received and constructed **Brand New and Improved Systems**. \n\n***\n\nAs a New Year's gift to all our players, we'll also be having a **double score fortnight** for the 1st fortnight of the year (1-15 January) so don\u2019t miss out!\n\nCome on over to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/qc4hRv7) to talk with other players, get advice from the mods, talk about the sub, or just talk! Everyone is friendly and loves to talk about any subject imaginable! It's a great place to just connect to other One Piece fans, if nothing else!\n \nWell what are you waiting for?[Dive right in into the adventure of your lifetime!](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrawHatRPG/comments/9niqk0/welcome_and_guidelines/)\n",

            "selftext": "Hello Ladies,\n\nI am seeking a RP partner for a plot that consists of survival elements due to a recent invasion of Planet Earth. The story starts off in modern day (circa Independence Day) where a City (we choose) is being taken over by alien life forms. These alien life forms have come not in peace but to dominate and exterminate weaker life forms, us humans. The UN doesn't stand a chance and no country is safe. Homo Sapiens are soon to be extinct. This will be a survival type RP.\n\nOur characters lead different lives so we do not necessarily need to be together to start off. The Aliens have been tasked with destruction of all planets with other species. They may be interested in abduction, experimentation or depending on their perogative may be more inclined in simply eliminating you. \n\nI am also open to other ideas and plots that can be thrown into the mix. There may be romance or other NSFW elements that can consist part of this story.\n\nI prefer Discord as the medium of writing. Thick plots with literary writers describing the environment and emotions are highly enjoyable and that is what I seek too. It makes RP fun and eventful. Like many other ads have said Quality over Quantity. One paragraph responses are fine if you would like to keep the story moving and are busy but we should match each others responses.\n\nPlease DM me if you are interested and I will share my Discord account.\n\nCheers,\nA",

JUST DM ME :)*\\*\n\nI am 32 years old, in the East Coast U.S. with a steady 9 to 5 job during the week. One thing I find myself wanting more than anything is to roleplay. I am friendly, polite, engaging, and bored.\n\nI play all genders (males, females, everything in between such as intersex) and I want to play them opposite willing female characters (IRL gender doesn't matter).\n\nPlease be prepared for picture usage. I've done writing descriptions for a while, but I am used to visuals after playing in SLs for many years. I would prefer someone who is also open to them. I usually prefer to use real pics (actors/actresses/models) depending on the medium, but some animated pics will be welcome depending (again) on the medium.\n\nI dabble in a few different things:\n\n\\-Modern, modern fantasy, historical, sci fi, horror, adventure, alternate reality/universe, or fantasy in the mix\n\n\\-Some fandoms I know are Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, Harry Potter, Marvel/DC (especially Arrowverse/MCU), Once Upon a Time/Disney, Star Wars, Dragon Age, Tomb Raider, Merlin (BBC), etc. Anything else unlisted is better to bring them my way and see if I know them. If any above appeal, feel free to come my way.\n\nSome literacy at a minimum makes me happy, third person only, past tense. I am also VERY reasonable with people, so don't be nervous or afraid. I am very nice, I promise, and I want to get niceties out of people in turn. Whether you're a great poster or a good one, I give everyone a chance! Treat people the way you want to be treated, right?\n\nI do work during the day, so posting will be sporadic, but I am good at night and on weekends/holidays for regular posting. I am hunting for people that are on daily and can knock out least a couple of posts a day or more.\n\nI am usually on from sometime in the morning to late at night Eastern time. If you want to play sometime, feel free to DM me for my Discord name or to offer yours. I hope to talk to all of you soon! :)\n\n***Current Desire: I am really interested in the \"intersex opposite a female\" perspective. Modern is a big medium I could see following through. I have some festive setups in mind, some supernatural setups, some fandom ideas...virtually anything. However, I will play other stuff if someone isn't into the intersex x female pairing. Shoot me a DM! :)***",

            "selftext": "Hello! I've been playing D&amp;D both over text and on voice session and have fallen in love with collaborative storytelling. However, I have no sources of guidance for actually getting started. So, I'm looking for someone to take me under their wing as my first official roleplay partner! Here are a few things about me based on what I've seen is commonly asked for:\n\n- I heavily prefer third person present tense, but I am willing to switch over to past tense.\n- 18+\n- LITERACY is IMPERATIVE to my enjoyment . Typos are fine, but if you don't know how to write properly (complete sentences, proper paragraphs, understandable grammar) than why are you here?\n- Willing to chat, whether about the RP or otherwise. Communication is important.\n- I have a strict no-ghost policy. If I start something I will not disappear on you. I will tell you if I want to cut things off. Don't message if you plan to ghost. If you aren't feeling things, just say so.\n- Out of respect for my SO, be willing to skip over sexual scenes. (I know, I know. Boohoohoo.)\n- I don't see the fun in playing a canon character, but you are free to do so. (Acceptable fandoms include Naruto, Mass Effect, My Hero Academia, and possibly Pokemon.)\n\n\nThat's all. I'm open to anything. Any setting. Any characters. Want me to GM/DM? Sure, how different from D&amp;D could it be? I just ask that you be willing to show me the ropes and conventions of the world of written roleplaying! ",

Ideally it would be totally clean, but if you are interested in adding some mature elements I'm willing to talk about it.\n\nI'm on a bit of a writer's block lately, so I would love to hear any creative ideas you may have. The more original, the better! I consider myself pretty open-minded so don't be afraid to suggest anything you want to try. The only thing I will ask you is to not give too short replies, and not be very picky with grammar (I'm not a native speaker so I may have some typos here and there). Friendly talk outside the roleplay is great as well, specially to discuss any ideas we may have. \n\nFor now I'm open to using kik or maybe the reddit app/email, but you may be able to convince me to use Discord if I really like your ideas. \n\nThat's all, if you have made it this far thank you very much for giving me some of your time! Hopefully I will get at least one reply...",

It is similar in many ways to our own, with its history only diverging frrom our own 9 years ago. As the ball dropped, signalling the beggining of a new year and a fresh start for many. Wishes had been shared and moonlight kisses had, smiles of glee apparent on all faces. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. The power went out everyhwere in the world for seemingly no reason. Asides from that nothing was wrong. Except for the metas. The first was Anarchy. A vile woman who sought to take over all inferior \"mortals\", declaring herself the Queen of Boston. No one dared to stop her, many following her example and seeking out to destroy governments. That is until Beacon arrived. The meta with control over the lights of the world dared to stop her.\nThe Anarchists and Beacon allies confronted each other, nearly levelling Boston while doing so. Beacon may have succeeded in the fight but both sides lost. Both Anarchy and Beacon had died. However, that terrible event had passed, with Boston reforming itself, now named Beacon City in his honour.\n\nThe FMSA: A government that were formed to ensure that another Anarchy won't arise. Metas may be registered and employed as officers to enforce metahuman laws, becoming superheroes in a sense. However, not all is well in Beacon City.\n\nA dark legion led by a meta known only as Thanatos, a meta with a formidable grasp over nature itself, scours the city for blood to fuel his twisted agenda. He seems to seek out those powerful and twisted. Could that be you?\n\nJoin Universe 3-0-0, and you too may help decide Beacon City's fate. Will you join the FMSA? Keeping the peace and defending metas and civillians. Will you be an Anarchist? Following the ways of the chaotic group she lived and died for. Or will you be a vigilante? Defying the FMSA while still saving lives.\n\nHello there people of Reddit, I hope you enjoyed the prompt and come roleplay on my newly created server.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/WkFBcFt",

He's a 35 year old ex-mercenary, who gave up the life to go travel the world; similar to Jules from the end of Pulp Fiction. He has abnormally fast reflexes, and is partial lycan. He's kind hearted, but willing to fight when needed.  My reference drawing will be provided to anyone interested.\n\nI'm somewhat fascinated with continuity, and Casimir has a 15 year gap while he's travelling, which is spaced between my last 2 major stories. I want to fill that gap with some great ideas with anyone who's interested! Ideally a travelling companion.\n\nRomance and ERP are acceptable, just on the condition that they're not the story's focus\n\nI welcome all! Whether your format is similar to novel writing, or simply \\*asterisk action cues\\*, I work with either!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can best be reached on Discord: Nons#2513\n\nI can't wait to meet you!",

If you've shown interest prior, just hit me up again :)\n\nIf you aren't familiar with what Rimworld is here's the quick rundown: far future, but it isn't necessarily advanced- some places could have devolved back to a medieval state or even tribal, but some places are very much technologically advanced. People from all sorts of place, backgrounds, races, ages, even eras all seem to have crashed out of cryosleep and on to some backwater world where they do what they have to to survive. \n\nThis could be done as a group if enough people show interest. Otherwise, feel free and shoot me a message and we'll discuss where to go from this! ",

I am a current science fiction writer and find role playing to be a fun way to practice writing characters I come up with. \nSo, I\u2019ve come to this subreddit to find a partner or two.\nI\u2019m cool with literally anyone, at the very least 18 (I\u2019m 22) I would prefer at least 20. \nNot at all looking for any kind of shipping or romance, I just think it to be inappropriate to RP with a minor. \n\nAs for my character, I use a man named Jason Stross. \n\nJason is a Paladin, a Space Cop/Marine that travels through the galaxy and patrol. (Which is actually perfect for any genre, IMO, because that just means he could end up in any setting and just roll with it.)\n\nHis equipment is a specially made blaster known as a Reaper-VI, a hand gun that fires pulse blasts that have the same impact as a 50 caliber round. \nThe gauntlets of his armor project hardlight swords and shields. \n\nHe\u2019s trained in marksmanship and unarmed combat. He is at peak human strength and stamina. \n\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\nI am down for almost anything, also going as it isn\u2019t some insane kink or anything like that. \nI prefer plotting out the RP and literate folks. Nothing too much, just a paragraph at least. As long as we can get the right idea from each other. \nFeel free to DM or comment below!",

Not necessarily Becky herself; but a swaggering redhead with more BDE than you've ever seen before. \n\nI love adventures, urban fantasy, post-apocalyptic, romance, the MCU (_a lot,_) and a whole host of other things. I'd love it if you guys came at me with some ideas and I can plunk my Irish Lasskicker into it. Or we can work on a new concept together! \n\nI'm available just about every day and I have a lot of time to devote to writing. I'm looking for partners who are enthusiastic and excited to plot. Bonus points if they like using faceclaims, exchanging shippy songs, and throwing headcanons back and forth. I don't care about the gender of the mun; but I generally prefer to write opposite male characters. However, I'm not adverse to femmeships for the right plot. \n\n**Please**: \n\n* - Have Discord.\n* - Be over twenty. \n* - Be enthusiastic!\n* - Be creative! ",

Zuko has always been my favorite character but I understand that most people won't have fun playing a canon character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO I would love to work with your OC! :D  You can pick whatever kingdom you like and if they are bender/nonbender.  :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy character is an earthbender, and my idea was that he would have been given to Prince Zuko for a birthday gift as a servant/companion/bodyguard shortly after Zuko lost his mother so they have a sort of strained friendship after all these years.  My character even has some budding feelings for the angry prince that will go unrequited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoping to follow the series and add our own twists and turns and original scenes between. Lots of moments with Iroh, drama, angst, personal development and pg13 romance. We can discuss more in pms! I typically use 3rd person\n\nOpen to reddit pms or discord :)",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! I recently got back into role playing to pass time. I use to role play for a very long time a few years ago and I\u2019m searching for someone to role play with.\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to do a bit of a simple adventure role play with the element being fantasy. The plot would involve a male human sorcerer encountering a female orc (she can be any type of class) where they would both have to kind of work out their differences to survive and fight a common enemy.\n\nWe can elaborate more on the characters, we can make the role play have comical elements and dark ones as well. I\u2019m okay with romance happening along the way if it would make the story more interesting or comical in some aspects.\n\nI have been writing for awhile, several lab reports and research papers (etc.) and I can write extensive responses. However what I search for in a partner is someone who can just write out good quality pieces. I sometimes feel a response that is short can have more impact than a lengthy response.\n\nI\u2019m pretty much just a casual role player and hoping to find someone who wants to have fun. If you\u2019re interested in hearing more or want to do some world building, PM me. \n\nIf you\u2019re also just getting your feet wet and want to try to gain some role play experience, I\u2019m willing to help out those who are starting new! \n\nHope you all have a happy role play!",

Unless it is dialogue and the character is standing completely still and not emoting at all like a robot, you can make it more than a few sentences.\n\nScheduling: I can post +3 times a day if it happens to be a lighter day for me, but life happens. I get it. I expect at least one post from you a day unless you are going through a life or death situation. You feeling a bit ill should not hamper your RP abilities. If you feel that once a day is too restrictive, leave now.\n\nContent: I prefer to play straight male characters, and I expect my partner to play a straight female. However, I do not force romance or smut between characters, as I feel that romance needs to naturally evolve between two characters. I also follow book canon, but can adjust to show canon if necessary\n\nPlot: I am most flexible with plot, and will compromise heavily on plot points. I have RP'd just about every role in Game of Thrones, from Flea Bottom thief to a Lannister Lord.\n\nHere are some of my more specific interests:\n\nMargaery X Robb\n\nCatelyn X Brandon\n\nAshara X Ned\n\nIf any of that interests you, shoot me a PM.\n",

            "selftext": "Hello all, this will be a fairly brief opening, since this is a role that could go in several different ways. Suffice it to day, this role will have a Science-Fiction Tone and Theme to it.\n\nWhen you message me, include in your answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat Time Periods do you Enjoy?*\n-Historic (1800-1945)\n-Modern (2019)\n-Futuristic (2030-2300)\n\nWhat Time Zone are you in?\n\nWhich of these, \"Character Factions,\" are you willing to play characters in?*\n-Military.\n-Police.\n-First Responder (Fire and Medical).\n-Civilian.\n\nOn a Scale of 1 - 10, how graphic do you accept violence? (1 - Blood makes me squeamish, 5 - I like Saw, 10 - I watch Cannibal Holocaust with the kids).\n\n* - I will accept multiple answers for these questions.\n\n~~~~~\n\nRules for the Role:\n\n1.] No matter the role, you have to play multiple characters. A minimum of two, one being male, one being female. However many you want, it doesn't make as much a difference as some think. This is the base line for simple character creation in the role.\n\n2.] You have to play in Third Person.\n\n3.] You have to have some sort of dedication to the roleplay. This isn't meant to be a one-'n-done situation. This is an actual, full-length STORY.\n\nI'm very open and willing to discuss, if there's something that bothers you or if something is against what you typically would be comfortable doing, let me know and we can work something out.",

I enjoy writing and creating, with worldbuilding, character building and storytelling being me true passions. I\u2019m looking for a partner with the same sorts of interests to build a story, some characters and the world in which they live. I can play by Discord or Email, with no real preference for which. I typically try to post several times a week.\n\nI am principally looking for RP in Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic, Cyberpunk and Low-Fantasy settings. I have a few ideas and prompts available on request, and would welcome yours.\n\nI write in the third person, and I usually will do three decently sized paragraphs per post. I look for quality in a post; it doesn\u2019t have to be the best thing ever, but it does have to show some effort. That\u2019s all. I do ask that my partner be eighteen (18) or older. I am okay with NSFW elements in a story, but I don\u2019t want them to be the focus. I\u2019m not interested in a smut-based RP at all. Likewise, I am not interested in extreme violence or gore.\n\nAt the moment I am craving a specific relationship, one that can be best described as \"sexy but not sexual\". This is one where there could potentially be romantic and intimate themes (ie: NSFW), but no actual sex involved.\n\nAlso note that I only reply to messages sent by DM. Replies posted here will not be followed up on. It's a way to test if you're paying attention, among other things.",

            "selftext": ".: hello. this is a search for mxm rps only because I am bored and winter break made me sick. \nagain, I do not to mxf or fxf, if you contact me seeking either of these chances are I will not be interested, sorry! ): \n\nnow that\u2019s out of the way. I love dark and sad plots, the title of this is purely ironic. that\u2019s all that seems to capture my interest now because I can use my shitkickers and assholes. drugs, violence, whatever; it\u2019s all fine by me as long as we\u2019re respectful to each other and equally fine with ruining our character\u2019s lives. :)\n\n.: plots ...\n. best friend / best friend\u2019s boyfriend. \n- A spends all their time pining after their closest friend\u2014 their group seems to be somewhat aware of A\u2019s longtime crush, if all the thoughtful gifts and too-long stares have anything to say about it, however she ignores it and insists he\u2019s a close friend. To quell any idea of them ending up together, she finds herself in a new relationship with character B. he\u2019s attractive and smart, and the first time they met he gave A home baked goods, so he can\u2019t even call him an asshole! however, little gestures like those start to pile up and A has to wonder why on earth the object of his affection\u2019s crush is hitting on him. \n..winter option because we\u2019re fun here.. - A and his best friend\u2019s families are close-knit, so when it gets harder to ignore B and she asks if he can come along a family trip, A starts panicking. \ntldr; shitty teen drama, cheating, angst. \n\n. hitman / recruit . \n- A kills for filthy rich people. The cream of the crop doesn\u2019t want to get their hands dirty, so they turn to an elite underground network of hitmen that takes care of things in an efficient and clean manner\u2014 it\u2019s a small organization in a very closed market, with tons of cash flowing. the perks are amazing. A just has to shoot people and sleep at night, which isn\u2019t hard. however, when training a new recruit, B, he\u2019s unecessarily tough and a complete hardass despite usually being a level-headed person and B\u2019s evident skill. when they\u2019re assigned as partners, A doesn\u2019t seem to be turning over a new leaf. \ntldr; hate-to-love, slow burn kinda deal here. a little fantasy-ish obviously theyre hitmen (unless u believe in conspiracies), but no dark magicks on my post. \n\n. cross-dresser / jock .\n- A dresses like a girl for the sake of taking cute pictures to post online, without ever really disclosing his gender or posting any photos without makeup. B is a hot-headed jock type, all for preserving his masculinity and straight as can be. when they meet at a concert and exchange social media, they get to talking and A still hasn\u2019t thought to bring up that he\u2019s a guy. \ntldr; manipulation, catfishing/not really, closet hugging, shitty decisions, yup.:\n\n.: pairings ... \n. student / tutor .\n. athlete / coach\u2019s son . \n. bartender / just broken up with... or alcoholic, it isn\u2019t clear . \n. dealer / buyer . \n. frat brothers . it sounds adorable and complicated.: \n\ni could probably think of some other ones but im lazy and that\u2019s enough I think. also open to any suggestions, if you have any fucked up plots you wanna throw at me id most likely be down, who knows. you miss all the shots you don\u2019t take bros. \npce out. merry christmas!\n\n.: email: pm me for this! :.\n\n.:of note; \n- no script rp! third person past tense please \n- 2-3 paragraphs+ is a good rule of thumb \n- mxf might be okay if the plot is good enough or we double. idk.",

We are a turn-based roleplay with tabletop elements, who have been around for over two and a half years. But let\u2019s get on with Tale of Hope and War.\n\n**What is tales?**\nTale of Hope &amp; War is a roleplay set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world, where only a few cities have survived and mobilized the cities themselves. The world is riddled with corruption from the gods, who have tried to invade the corporeal plane to obtain artifacts left behind by the elder gods, objects of immense power. Sadly these artifacts are also what keeps the world alive. So in order to survive mankind and other species have to become strong, strong enough to fend off the avatars of gods and perhaps the very gods themselves. For a god stepping into the corporeal plane is the cause of cataclysm.\n\nWe offer a unique system that consists of traits, skill-tree, items and guilds with unique abilities. Easy to do character creation and a helpful, friendly staff willing to aid anyone concerns they may have.\n\nIf you think this is something that you may be interested in, feel free to join and looks around. We are always happy to accept new players. Now, gather around as we tell you a Tale of Hope and War.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/aqWkHYU",

Now then I'm hoping to do a story based around a dragon and a prisoner/sacrifice or otherwise unwilling companion. The classic princess in the tower if you like however I want the prisoner to end up befriending and/or falling in love with the dragon (NSFW optional but preferred).\n\nNow that's the basics out of the way a bit about me. I like to think I'm a fairly good writer and I have been doing it both RP and story writing for more than a few years now. I tend to prefer posts of a bout a paragraph or two depending on what's happening of course. I don't particularly care what gender you are and it doesn't have to match the gender you write as nor am I picky about it being strictly heterosexual I'm perfectly happy doing any pairing. I would tend towards playing the dragon but I'm comfortable with being the prisoner as well. \n\nIf you are at all interested feel free to DM me and we can talk shop.",

            "selftext": "Hey! Thank you for checking out this post. I\u2019m Avarice, and I\u2019ve been role playing for a long time. I\u2019ve been role playing in groups for as long as I can remember, but I\u2019ve never really done extended romance and 1x1 Roleplay, and I kinda want to change that. \n\nI\u2019m interested in writing a superhero romance. My favorite character to write is Conner Kent/Kon-El (DC comics) because I think the dynamic of being born from one incredible man and one terrible man (he was cloned from Superman and lex Luther) and with the capacity to surpass them both is a very interesting dilemma to put a young adult into, and adding in the cloning \u201cam I really worth a person\u201d morality makes a very complicated character. The icing on the cake is his fun-loving and easygoing personality to cover it all up, and it makes a very interesting character to play. \n\nI\u2019d like to do a romance with him and some other character. OCs are welcome and canon characters are awesome as well, provided they are in a relatively similar age range. I prefer to Roleplay him opposite males, but I won\u2019t turn down a female character either. I want complex characters that have potential to plan out and Roleplay with, because I\u2019m looking for a complicated romance where a powerful bond can grow. \n\nAs for requirements on the part of the role player, i tend to be lax. I like literate, third person role players who can write back with at least 3-4 sentences and get back to me sooner rather than later. I prefer to go back and forth at least once per day, but I\u2019m flexible in the timeframe. It\u2019s important for any Roleplay partners to be 18+ because mature themes are always great to explore in my opinion. I\u2019m 20, so there is no need to worry on my end. I operate in EST, and can respond most evenings. Please PM me any questions, plot ideas or characters that you want to Roleplay, I\u2019m really looking forward to finding a Roleplay partner! Have a good one!",

            "selftext": "Good evening, all (or whatever greeting suits your time zone). I hope everyone had a nice holiday. As usual, I'm looking for some more great partners for some of my cravings. Hopefully you'll find something that interests you.\n\nJust a few things first:\n\n* I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I'm an editor for a living, which has ruined me for polite society, but I also love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them, and I probably have some in this post. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. I know I'm finicky, but I am, unfortunately, what I am. \n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving hopeless romantic.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor \"Saw V,\" and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* I do not use any IM service. I use *email* or, if necessary, reddit PMs.\n\n* I may at times be sporadic. I struggle with depression, and I just had a death in my immediate family. I'm looking for distraction, but I can't be around all the time.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Final Fantasy X(Yuna)\n* Final Fantasy XII(Ashe)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)[Convince me? Preferably before season 7.]\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: (I don't answer or pay much attention to comment replies.) Thank you! ",

When you message, include what you are interested in, and we can discuss for a bit to create a plot, or I can send all applicable roles I have premade. If you have your own plot to play out, feel free to share.\n\n~~~~~\n\nRules for the Role:\n\n1.] No matter the role, you have to play multiple characters. A minimum of two, one being male, one being female. However many you want, it doesn't make as much a difference as some think. This is the base line for simple character creation in the role.\n\n2.] You have to play in Third Person.\n\n3.] You have to have some sort of dedication to the roleplay. This isn't meant to be a one-'n-done situation. This is an actual, full-length STORY.\n\n~~~~~\n\nI'm not a stickler for, \"Password!!@&amp;$(@:@(!!!!\" Or anything like that, just don't make yourself sound completely unappealing.\n\n**Note. - If you message me, and I don't respond, be sure to message me here with your contact information so I can check for it.\n\n~~~~~\n\nFeel free to look into some of my other posts if you need to get my contact information from them, or PM me here for it. Do be aware that I may be slow to respond to PMs on here, but I will try my best to get to everyone interested.",
