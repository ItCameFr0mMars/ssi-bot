            "selftext": "Hello Ladies,\n\nThe name is Malik. I am in my Early 30s, male from Canada and I am in a respectable profession doing a 9-5. Lately, I have gotten into RP and it has been a lot of fun and time-consuming, in a good way!\n\nWhat I am seeking for is a fun and friendly person who is literal, grammatically correct and descriptive when it comes to doing roleplays. 3rd person roleplaying in the past tense is preferred. Typos are whatever, things happen and I have no hard limits on paragraph or line responses, any is fine. \n\nPlease be 18+, there will be NFSW elements. I love ooc chats so feel free to communicate and make a connection, I am open to human to human interaction :)\n\nHere is a sci-fi plot:\n\nSpace station mission - We have been selected as the most healthiest and smartest pair in our organization to validate if life can thrive on a distant planet. We will carry some life forms with us during our mission, these life forms must survive and make it to the planet. They can include cattle and our pets. The premise is that there may be extra-terrestrial life forms that possibly inhabit this planet. Reports are not suggestive of hostile life forms. There is vegetation on this planet therefore life can exist and our mission again to is to validate this statement and report it back to HQ. \n\nIf life can thrive, we will create the first human settlement on this planet and attempt to survive off the planet's ecosystem. Our health and well being, including the life forms that are with us will be constantly monitored. We are not just space riders but scientists who will dissect the information this planet holds.\n\nOther RPs:\nPost-Apocalyptica/Survival is appealing to me as well so if there is a plot you would like to explore, I am all ears. I also enjoy some age-play and race-play so that can be thrown into the mix as well or if that is something you would like to explore in a different plot, I am open to that as well. PM me for more details!\n\nM",

            "selftext": "Having a cute son can become an immediate chick magnet for a guy.  I\u2019m looking to play as a single dad and have a few different starters below for what hopefully becomes a long term romance roleplay. \n\nPlease note that in this roleplay I am NOT in any way looking to include a young child in any sexual activity.  It is simply a plot point.  I\u2019m not into any illegal underage acts.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ll be playing as a 27-29 year old guy with a son in the 3-5 range.  Below are a couple opening scenarios that I\u2019m hoping can lead into a long term roleplay.  As you\u2019ll see, some are more specific and detailed, while some are more open ended.\n\n*Family Friends*\nWe grew up on the same street, even though I\u2019m about 8 years older than you.  Our families got very close and when parents moved away I had established myself here so I stayed.  I\u2019ve got a son that I still bring by to see your parents off and they love babysitting or taking him to lunch.  Your boyfriend thinks that you have a thing for me, and that I want to get into your pants. \n\n*Sports League*\nWe meet playing in a long adult co ed basketball or softball league.  We could be on the same tram or competing teams.  You could be a regular or just filling in for a friend.  And our main initial convos can take place at the game or the bar afterwards where everyone goes.\n\n*The Beach*\nYou\u2019re at the beach with some friends when you see a little boy that looks familiar.  Upon second glance you realize it\u2019s your older sister\u2019s friend\u2019s son.  You decide to come over and say hi to him, and introduce yourself to me. (Also open to playing this out at the mall, bowling, or a carnival/county fair.)\n\n*Football on Sunday*\nI\u2019m at the sports bar with a few friends watching the games.  My 5 year old son is with us and he\u2019s got all his gear on too eating his chicken tenders and fries.  You\u2019re there with some friends? Rooting for the same teams as us or maybe the opposite?\n\n*Alumni*\nI\u2019m an alum of the university you go to.  You\u2019re volunteering to work an alumni event or reunion and we meet there.\n\n*The Babysitter*\nYou babysit for my son\u2019s mother.  We\u2019ve never met but one day she tells you that his father will be coming to pick him up to take him for a long weekend.  When I get to her apartment we chat for a few minutes, and maybe get a bit flirty.  You find me on Facebook through her friends and add me, then send me a message.\n\n*Pumpkin Picking*\nYou and your college roommate/friend are in full basic white girl mode with your leggings and uggs taking selfies at the pumpkin patch.  Having some fun, I send him over to try and pick up a pumpkin that\u2019s clearly way to heavy for him and watch the humor that ensues.  Me and you (and your friend?) start talking and decide t hang out.\n\n*Tinder*\nWe had been chatting on Tinder for about a week and decided to finally meet up for lunch and/or a drink.  At the last minute I have t chance because my ex has to drop him (who i hadn\u2019t mentioned yet) off with me.  You say to just bring him along.\n\n*Daycare/Pre School*\nYou can be a teacher? Another parent? Perhaps an older sister that sometimes picks up and/or drops off?\n\nMessage me to start discussing details! I\u2019m looking for probably 1-3 paragraphs in roleplaying, possibly a bit more if setting up a new scene in it.\n",

            "selftext": "RP etiquette is so different from irl etiquette and I'm used to having either short-term partners where people disappear for any reason or long-term partners where things got messy.\n\nI decided after splitting with my last long-term partner that I wasn't going to sacrifice my peace of mind for one or multiple RPs ever again. I have an incredibly busy life. Not so busy that I can't be active, but busier than seems to be normal among my partners. I work full-time and occasionally take classes. I'm generally around to post for a few hours after midnight each night since I leave work at 11.\n\nThe person I'm currently RPing with seemed extremely promising at first. For the past two weeks she's been spamming me with chats/fan content almost everyday and getting incredibly excited when we talk headcanons/future ideas. She's a full time student and will literally RP almost all day everyday and has between three and five partners at a given time. We like a lot of the same things and were getting along surprisingly well. I thought this would be a potential long-term partner, maybe even a friend?\n\nThen I took two days off to sleep in between 12-hour shifts. My job is currently requiring mandatory overtime and I made her aware of this beforehand. She acted like it was cool! But ever since I came back online, she's been acting super distant--responding with one-word answers or just emoticons where she used to send a wall of text, and acting sort of inconvenienced if I show her things. I don't want it to feel like I'm pressuring her to behave a certain way, but I also don't want to kill each other with kindness until one of us jumps ship.",

How about I just start listing them off?\n\nOverwatch: Love this universe intensely. Having both of us play multiple character is always an option but I\u2019d love to have a relationship between two character be the focus while the others are in the background. We could either do something in the established universe or maybe something slice of life related? Some characters I can play are Sombra(Favorite), Tracer, Ana, D.VA, Moira. As for background characters... I\u2019ll play any one at all! Prefer established characters for this one.\n\nFallout: Another adored franchise. I already have a character I\u2019d love to fit into a RP. My favorite part of the Post Apocalyptic setting is things can get weird... and I like weird, especially when it comes to Raiders. I prefer OCs for this one\n\nWarcraft: This is where I first started my roleplay adventure and it shows! I know a lot about Warcraft lore and I love how diverse it can really be. Ready for anything you throw at me for this one. I prefer OCs for this one.\n\nSoul Eater: I\u2019ll be honest.. haven\u2019t watched the series for awhile now but the idea of having a pair of character so close together is fascinating! That combined with the high school-esc setting it takes place in makes for a great combination... that and there are lots of scary monsters to fight. I prefer OCs for this one.\n\n\nOriginal Idea(s): I've been searching for a modern fantasy related RP for while. Think Harry Potter but maybe with more demons and darker themes? I already got some ideas bouncing around in my head for this so be sure to let me know if your are interested in something of that nature! *OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS AS WELL*\n\n------------------------\n\nI\u2019d like to stress I\u2019m looking for partner who experienced in Roleplay! I\u2019d love to work with someone who has the same skill level of story telling and creativity to make something magical. I post around 1-3 paragraphs per response and would love something of similar weight. Of course when there are times in the RP where not much is going on my length might be shorter. I\u2019m also open to NSFW themes and almost prefer them in most RPs... but having it be the main part of the RP is something I\u2019m not interested in. Anywho, thanks for reading and don\u2019t be afraid to shoot me a message! &lt;3",

But also, I want someone that will move the plot and not only concentrate over it. I want someone willing to do the romance, the hurt and all the cute things in between.

Harry Potter is dead. One character is a slytherin pureblood who have always flirted with the other character, a ravenclaw mudblood. They never dated, but they always cleared had feelings for each other. Since the war began, however, they havent seen each other. One day, (A) character is finds (B) in trouble, running away and trying to hide. (A) offers to help. I want this to be very difficult, and romantic, and hurt. A lot of angst. A lot of conflicted feelings and torture, and fear. \n\n\u2661 Kylo/Rey, but genderbender. Kylo is actually a girl, abandoned by Luke and manipulated by Snoke.

            "selftext": "**Hey there! Are you interested in joining a well-structured, in-depth, and unique fantasy roleplay? Then Darkness Awakened may be for you! Read on to find out more.**\n\nDarkness Awakened is set in the fictional realm of Rhodenia, with many classical high fantasy elements such as magic users, various races, and Renaissance-esque governments. But Darkness Awakened is unique from other fantasy roleplays in a few key ways: firstly, Darkness Awakened has a set plot. Designed to facilitate moral grayness, the plot of Darkness Awakened focuses on the Empire of Vllaistrae, an ancient and prosperous land governed by aristocratic nobility and the Empress. It is a time of plenty and a cultural flourishing, but stirring is a revolutionary force. An ancient entity is encouraging this, known only as Enkai, and is whispering to the oppressed peasants of this land to rebel against their noble lords and ladies. However, the ruling forces of Vllaistrae have provided well for everyone. Despite this, the rebels are on the rise. The plot centers around the revolutionary forces calling for equality and democracy, and the royalist forces fighting for peace and order. Neither side is truly evil, but which will you pick? Or will you toe the line to better the interests of your character? The possibilities are endless!\n\nSecondly, Darkness Awakened has many elements that add to its in-depth lore. From factions for your character to join, to detailed religions, to other countries surrounding Vllaistrae, there are many little things that make Darkness Awakened unique when compared to other fantasy roleplays.\n\nThirdly, Darkness Awakened functions as a democracy outside of the roleplay. Though our roleplay is open-form and freeworld, we take into consideration the opinions of each of our roleplayers when adding new lore, rules, or NPCs.\n\nIf you are interested in joining a well-developed fantasy roleplay with unique elements and a structured plot that fosters character development and action, then Darkness Awakened may be for you! We are especially looking for advanced roleplayers that can help to progress the plot and many subplots in our roleplay.\n\nBelow is a link to the server; if you have any questions, we will be happy to answer them there! A more more in-depth look at the rules, plot, factions, religions, and other lore is available there.\n\nWe look forward to having you!  \n\n\n**LINK**: [https://discord.gg/HMnB2HZ](https://discord.gg/HMnB2HZ)",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, Jack here! Hope you are all are having a good day/night at the time of reading this. I wanna thank everyone who's responded so far to my posts, I greatly appreciate it. I'm getting back into RP after a long hiatus, aiming to find some cool partners. I prefer writing longterm stories, with more of an emphasis on action and story rather than romance and smut. I'm okay with romance and smut being part of the RP, but not when it becomes the main focus of everything.\n\nI'm open to playing both female and male characters. I am a bi guy irl but I also enjoy playing female characters like Samus Aran from Metroid or 2B from NieR Automata frequently, so I'm open to a lot. As for a partner, I don't mind the gender of the other person, and I will not ask for a pic from anyone who wishes to message me. I hope you guys can extend the same courtesy, I'm here to just meet and have fun with talented peeps.\n\nI write usually 1-3 paragraphs, both in first and third person depending on my partner's preferences. I can do anime, video game, and original RPs. Here is a list of both fandoms and genres I'd be interested in RPing. However if you wanna do something that is not in the list and/or suggest a crossover please still contact me! I'm open to suggestions!\n\n**Anime**\n\nKill la Kill, Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Ruroni Kenshin, Berserk, Fate Series, Evangelion, Gundam, Golden Kamuy, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Highschool of the Dead, Goblin Slayer, Re:Zero, One Piece, One Punch Man, Ghost in the Shell, Claymore, Code Geass, SSSS. Gridman\n\n**Games**\n\nResident Evil, Silent Hill, PUBG, Final Fantasy, Super Smash Bros., Fire Emblem, Ace Combat, Nioh, Dark Souls/Bloodborne, Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, Tekken, Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, Metal Gear Solid, NieR Automata, Metroid, League of Legends, Smite, Devil May Cry, Castlevania, Zone of the Enders, Armored Core\n\n**Genres/Settings**\n\nCyberpunk, Sci-fi, High/Dark Fantasy, Slice of Life, Modern, Wartime (WWII or Modern), Cold War, Mystery/Crime, Supernatural, Horror, Action Adventure, Romance, Western, Post Apocalypse, Trapped in a Video Game/MMO, Normal Video Game/MMO\n\nI am a full time college student, meaning I won't be always available to respond but I will have time every day to get at least a few responses in, along with being in the Pacific Standard time zone. If I have to get off for some reason I will definitely let my partners know before hand. I hope to also become friends, meaning frequent OOC chat along with possibly playing some PC or Switch games together! I honestly care about my partners, so of you need time off or need someone to talk to just let me know, I'm a patient guy!\n\nWith that out of the way, I hope to hear from all of you soon! PM me with a little bit about yourself. I can roleplay on both Kik and Discord so make sure to include your preference in the message! Also a heads up, my college winter semester started already so sorry in advance if I don't get to you right away!",

Listed below are some of the fandoms I\u2019m interested in but you can suggest anything to me and I\u2019ll at least look it up or read about it to understand it better and attempt a compromise.\n\n\u2022Harry Potter\n\u2022The Last of Us\n\u2022TWD or FTWD\n\u2022Steven Universe\n\u2022Over the Garden Wall\n\u2022Gravity Falls\n\u2022and many more\n\nI\u2019m also very interested in supernatural, history, crime and many other role plays, so even if it wasn\u2019t on the list you can always ask and I\u2019ll be down to compromise until something works.\n\nNow grammar-wise. I don\u2019t really care how much you write, just as long as it\u2019s moving the story forward, but preferably stay away from one liners and very short posts. I do care about quality of the writing. I know everyone makes mistakes but I would like to be able to understand your messages. \n\nIf any of this caught your attention feel free to message me or leave your discord!",

This is a crossover focused server, so characters from completely different eras will meet up and interact.\n\nWe have AR roles, which are versions of existing that are not from the games/media they star in. These are incredibly unique and allow for an interesting spin on a character. You are allowed t come up with your own AR role, or pick from the ones we have laid out.\n\nWe are looking for semi-literate to literate writers, and you will have to submit a writing sample before choosing a character.\n\nFor people who do not know much about Castlevania, or want to get into the series. This server is friendly to those people. We have resources to learn the series, such as linking videos on the entire timeline, and bios on each character (Although short as not to drag them on). If you want to play the games yourself, I'm happy to recommend some games for you to play first.\n\nIf any of that intrigued you, please consider dropping by. You might just make a difference in the everlasting battle between light and dark.\n\n[https://discord.gg/P3TF8wY](https://discord.gg/P3TF8wY)",

I would really like to participate in a slice of life prompt with someone who is not only seeking a long-term role playing partner, but also wanting to see a story to it's conclusion.\n\nA few of my ideas:\n\n* **The Best Friend**  \nYour character and mine have been best friends for as long as they can remember. While their feelings have always been platonic, when one of them returns home from College, they begin to realize that maybe they want things to change. Will they take the risk? Or will they not be willing to sacrifice their friendship for their feelings?  \n\n* **The Foreign Exchange Student**  \nYour character has moved to the United States for opportunity, and my characters family has taken you in. My character isn't thrilled to have you, being an only sibling and having wanted someone that could resemble a younger brother or sister. Will he learn to accept you? Will it turn into something more?\n\nWhile these are just a few of my ideas, don't be fooled. **I'm open to any suggestions.** What I would really like is a partner with whom I can build out an original world and characters.\n\nA few quick notes that you should know about me:\n\n* I role play on Discord.\n* I am a sucker for romance, mystery, and drama.\n* While not required, I am 18+ and am open to NSFW content.\n\nThank you for taking your time to read this. \n\nI hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hi there and thanks for taking the time to look at this ad!\n\nFirst of all, a little about me. I am an experienced (15+ years across various mediums), roleplayer. I enjoy writing and creating, with worldbuilding, character building and storytelling being me true passions. I\u2019m looking for a partner with the same sorts of interests to build a story, some characters and the world in which they live. I can play by Discord or Email, with no real preference for which. I typically try to post several times a week.\n\nI write in the third person, and I usually will do three decently sized paragraphs per post. I look for quality in a post; it doesn\u2019t have to be the best thing ever, but it does have to show some effort. That\u2019s all. I do ask that my partner be eighteen (18) or older. I am okay with NSFW elements in a story, but I don\u2019t want them to be the focus. I\u2019m not interested in a smut-based RP at all. Likewise, I am not interested in extreme violence or gore.\n\nI'm only interested in playing opposite male characters. My own characters are female, although I'm interested in trying to play a Trans-Female character as well.\n\nAlso note that I only reply to messages sent by DM. Replies posted here will not be followed up on. It's a way to test if you're paying attention, among other things\n\nAnd now for some story prompts. These are just a few off the top of my head, but I\u2019m open to other ideas. I am principally looking for RP in Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic, Cyberpunk and Low-Fantasy settings.\n\n* *Arena* (Fantasy/Sci-Fi) - Our characters are prisoners who have been forced to fight for their lives in an arena. Despite their circumstances, rather than killing each other, they plot to escape and overthrow their cruel masters. This one is flexible; it could as easily be Low Fantasy as anything else.\n\n**Reunited Survivors* (Post-Apocalyptic) - Once our characters were friends. Now, years later, after some great cataclysm, they have been reunited, surprised to find a familiar face in a changed world. However, they have both been changed by this new world\n\n* *Resistance* (Sci-Fi/Post Apocalyptic) - The world was invaded and conquered by an unknown alien force. Now they rule the world, supported by their human lackeys who police their subjugated people. However, there are those who are willing to stand against them. This could go all the way from urban guerrilla groups to armed uprising on a devastated world.\n\n* *Cyborg* (Sci-Fi) - Either or both of our characters are cyborgs, heavily augmented with artificial limbs and other modifications. Maybe they were maimed and offered \"upgrades\" as replacements, or maybe they chose to do this to themselves. Regardless, they are a part of an elite, augmented military force dealing with other extraordinary threats.\n\n* *Colonial Expeditionary Force* (Sci-Fi) - Our characters are soldiers in the military force of some interstellar power. Our role is to step in where needed, to protect the people from various threats, like pirates, raiders, insurgents, terrorists and the like. Depending on how you feel, they could be a legitimate force for good, or the heavy-handed hammer of a totalitarian regime.\n",

            "selftext": "General information first, I'm 20 years old and in the CST time zone. I'm busy on Sunday and Monday nights with occasional busy periods peppered throughout the week. I like to roleplay obviously, but I'm also happy with making friends on the side if you can deal with my shitty sense of humor.\n\nBefore I get into it, some obligitory rules:\n1. Be able to spell and write decently.\n2. RP in 3rd person.\n2. Please don't rush me, I get busy sometimes. I will let you know OOC if I'm about to get busy, it's rare that something is sprung in me so abruptly that I can't at least warn you.\n3. In regards to NSFW, respect the things I'm not into.\n4. Be at the very least 18 years old, preferably my age or older.\n\nFinally. I want to do a light fantasy RP, and I mean really light on the fantasy. This means magic and magic-related items/powers are mere myths (but possibly do exist), no races that are outwardly magical, celestial, etc. (angels, demons, dragons), and no overt intervention of deities. This isn't a rule against what your character can and can't be however, the only reason I want there to be such a minimal fantasy aspect is because when something magical *does* happen, it will feel like it has a lot more meaning and power behind it. If you want to play a pure magical being, you can, you'll probably just be the most powerful thing in existence.\n\nThat said, I haven't got a story figured out (surprising, I know), but it's because I always prefer to plan with my partner. What I like to do is plan in increments, where we plan a bit of the story, we play it out, plan some more OOC, then keep going and repeat the process until we reach an end. That way we don't have to plan forever and just end up forgetting everything half way through. Oh, also, I'm a total nerd for image references, anything that helps me visualize our characters, the setting, armor/weapons and anything else is appreciated.\n\nWhat a word salad. If you're still interested, shoot me a PM and we can discuss this some more.",

I'd just like to take a second to thank you guys for such a warm welcome after my first post on this sub.\n\nSince everything has well so far I thought I'd throw another one of these out there. New roleplay partners are always welcome! \n\nAs the title says I'm looking for realistic modern roleplays. I mostly play in the thirdperson and I am very comfortable with playing both male and female characters. \n\nIf any of this sounds interesting feel free to message me and we can exchange discords and all that good stuff. My schedule is usually clear so message me anytime, although I totally understand if your schedule isn't as flexible.\n\nHope to hear from you guys soon. Thanks. ",

            "selftext": "Yeah, I know that this topic has been going around, but I just barely finished the movie and I have so many ideas swirling around in my head. I want to roleplay in this setting because it sets up for an action packed, romantic, and dramatic plot. \n\nI am 21 years old. I have been role-playing for nearly 8 years now. I am laid back and not to picky about my partners. I prefer my partners to be the same, but not to the point it takes away from the roleplay. I write anywhere from a paragraph to 3-4 paragraph responses. I don't expect a novel's worth in a response, just enough to feel like we're putting in evenly. Ideas must come from both sides. I don't want to roleplay with someone that is basically the equivalent of Cleverbot. As long as you can be detailed, creative and at least write as much as I do, we will get along perfectly. \n\nI have quite a few ideas on where our roleplay can go, but my preference would be after the events of the movie, more than likely with OC's. I do prefer there be a romance subplot, so if that is a no go, I may not be the partner for you. I ask not to make your character over powered and immune to anything and everything, that tends to ruin motivation to continue. NSFW themes, (Smut, graphic descriptions, violence, sensitive subjects, etc.. ) are preferred, but not mandatory. \n\nI do roleplay on Discord, and unless you can convince me otherwise, I'd prefer to stay on that platform. I'm more than willing to discuss ideas and other matters on there, (Reddit's messaging system seems to hate me.) Also, don't be afraid to ask any questions you might have, I love when my partners ask questions, helps clear up confusion and helps us vibe together. PM me for my Discord handle and I'll be more than happy to give it to you. If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this mess. If your reading this in the future, feel free to message me anyway, I'm always interested in role-playing with skilled partners. Thanks again! ",

We will carry some life forms with us during our mission, these life forms must survive and make it to the planet. They can include cattle and our pets. The premise is that there may be extra-terrestrial life forms that possibly inhabit this planet. Reports are not suggestive of hostile life forms. There is vegetation on this planet therefore life can exist and our mission again to is to validate this statement and report it back to HQ. If life can thrive, we will create the first human settlement on this planet and attempt to survive off the planet's ecosystem. Our health and well being, including the life forms that are with us will be constantly monitored. We are not just space riders but scientists who will dissect the information this planet holds.\n\nPost-Apocalyptica/Survival is appealing to me as well so if that is a plot you would like to explore, I am all ears. I also enjoy some age-play and race-play so that can be thrown into the mix as well or if that is something you would like to explore in a different plot, I am open to that as well. PM me for more details!\n\nA",

I have some ideas in mind, but ofcourse you can put your ideas out on the table as well. I am very open minded but I have my limits.\n\nMy ideas:\n- highschool sweethearts: building up the romantic relationship in highschool and then continue after graduation. Starts off with some drama\n- healthcoach and popstar: I will sketch the history off our characters because it starts at a specific scene. If you want we can do some scenes before this specific scene. This specific scene evolves a lot of drama to start with\n- best friends who meet again: we can different scenes before we meet again to get that connection, if you are up to it. Very romantic and we can decide the tempo of how fast we want to let this roleplay go.\n- prince who falls in love with normal girl: one of my favorites haha. I just love royalty. I don't exactly know how I want to start this one. I would like to discuss this with you. But ofcourse, I first want to build up things between our characters before they eventually fall in love\n\nThese are a few that I like to roleplay. I am still open for new ideas. I am also open for fantasy. I love fantasy as well.\nAll of the roleplays will have pregnancy and marriage in it togheter with a kind of stalking. We can discuss this as well. I like to add a lot of drama with third characters or in the history of our characters or even while we roleplay.\n\nI use two platforms: Kik and Discord. Contact me if you want one of the two. I prefer kik but I am fine with Discord.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon\n\nLoves, Ari",

            "selftext": "**What are we?**\nHello! My name is Xeno, owner and developer of a server called Tale of Hope and War. We are a turn-based roleplay with tabletop elements, who have been around for over two and a half years. But let\u2019s get on with Tale of Hope and War.\n\n**What is tales?**\nTale of Hope &amp; War is a roleplay set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world, where only a few cities have survived and mobilized the cities themselves. The world is riddled with corruption from the gods, who have tried to invade the corporeal plane to obtain artifacts left behind by the elder gods, objects of immense power. Sadly these artifacts are also what keeps the world alive. So in order to survive mankind and other species have to become strong, strong enough to fend off the avatars of gods and perhaps the very gods themselves. For a god stepping into the corporeal plane is the cause of cataclysm.\n\nWe offer a unique system that consists of traits, skill-tree, items and guilds with unique abilities. Easy to do character creation and a helpful, friendly staff willing to aid anyone concerns they may have.\n\nIf you think this is something that you may be interested in, feel free to join and looks around. We are always happy to accept new players. Now, gather around as we tell you a Tale of Hope and War.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/aqWkHYU",

            "selftext": "Good evening, all (or whatever greeting suits your time zone). I hope everyone had a nice couple of holidays. As usual, I'm looking for some more great partners for some of my cravings. Hopefully you'll find something that interests you.\n\nJust a few things first:\n\n* I need a partner with as much love of the language as I have: someone who will use correct capitalization, punctuation and grammar; who can write posts that have both quality and a modicum of quantity (don't need constant novellas, but I need more than two tiny paragraphs); who knows the difference between possessives and plurals, \"your\" and \"you're,\" etc. I'm an editor for a living, which has ruined me for polite society, but I also love words (no kidding, eh?), and I love all the fascinating rules and nuances around them. Typos? Not a problem. Occasional mistakes? We all make them, and I probably have some in this post. Stylistic rule-bending? I'm doing it right now. I know I'm finicky, but I am, unfortunately, what I am. \n\n* I only write hetero couples. I have nothing against non-straight people or relationships, but it's outside my wheelhouse. I would like romance in the story, because I'm such a chick-flick-loving hopeless romantic.\n\n* Along similar lines, I write SFW content. I love romance, and I love conflict and action in my fantasy and sci-fi adventures, but I'm more PG-13 than R-rated when it comes to my writing. Plenty of very good stories are neither *Fifty Shades* nor \"Saw V,\" and - quite frankly - we're not here for TV ratings; we're here to create compelling stories that make us laugh and cry and think. All that being said, I still prefer my partners to be over the age of 18. I don't want to risk crossing any line, and given that I'm well-established in my twenties, it's easier for me.\n\n* More often than not, my characters are female. However, I'm just as adept at male characters, and I'm more than happy to double as anyone of your choice, if you'll do the same for me. If your pick is the person I've listed as \"looking for,\" then great - but I don't expect it, so best be prepared on both sides.\n\n* I do not use any IM service. I use *email* or, if necessary, reddit PMs.\n\n* I may at times be sporadic. I struggle with depression, and I just had a death in my immediate family. I'm looking for distraction, but I can't be around all the time.\n\nAlright, list time. Topics are listed in order of preference. My character is in parentheses. A \"%\" means that I don't like OCs. When OCs are used in the others, I REQUIRE that a canon be played, as well.\n\n* Tales of Symphonia%(Raine)[Huge craving. Post-game, ignoring Dawn. Looking for someone to take/double as Regal.]\n* Star Trek: Voyager(Janeway)[&lt;3 Looking for someone to double as/take Chakotay. OR, alternatively, we could do something set 20 or so years after \"End Game,\" in which case I'll be playing J/C's spitfire rebel of a daughter, and you can play whomever your heart desires.]\n* Harry Potter Trio Era(OC teacher)[Feeling this, too. Defined as the period between Harry's birth and the end of the final book. Looking for someone to take/double as Remus Lupin.]\n* Harry Potter Marauders' Era(Same OC as a student)[Again, Remus.]\n* World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King(TBD)[Could use one of these, too.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist%(Riza)[Looking for someone to double as/take Roy.]\n* Fullmetal Alchemist, post-series(Roy&amp;Riza's OC daughter)\n* Final Fantasy X(Yuna)\n* Final Fantasy XII(Ashe)\n* Once Upon a Time(Regina)[Convince me? Preferably before season 7.]\n* Sherlock(Sherlock **and** probably an OC)[Convince me. Play John and your OC? Also, something set before season 3 would be preferable.]\n\nRight now, that's all I'm really looking for. If you're still with me, by some chance, feel free to toss me a PM. (: (I don't answer or pay much attention to comment replies.) Thank you! ",

I'm looking for someone to brainstorm with and drum something up, get some character concepts (I don't have premade OCs). I have some writing samples on request, and I'd like if anyone replying would include a sample of their own writing when you message me. I'm looking for eventual smut, too, not a 100% focus on it- I'm equally if not more interested in good character interaction. I should be available mostly late at night (MST) but I enjoy being able to write a post and leave it to be responded to whenever either of us have time, forum-style, so if you strongly prefer someone who can focus on a back and forth for multiple hours regularly, I'm probably not that person.",

People tended to try and take advantage of her, but her friend always had her back.

She\u2019s wearing a long sleeve shirt when it\u2019s almost 75 degrees out, and seems very closed off...\n\n\nHello! As you can tell from the prompt, this RP is a dark scenario, but if played long term, can bloom itself into a beautiful prompt. I do ask that any who inquire are at least 18+, as there will be adult themes in this RP! I look forward to hearing from you guys! :D",

I write in third person past tense only, I can try first person but it usually doesn\u2019t flow well for me. I write anywhere from 2 good sized paragraphs to six to eight paragraphs depending on the scene we\u2019re writing. I do expect my partner to do the same. If you send me just a couple lines, I\u2019m sorry but I just can\u2019t work with that. I roleplay solely on discord and usually won\u2019t go away from that unless we really have a strong plot planned and you just can\u2019t stand discord. Last thing about me, I keep weird hours and sleep at all different times so I need someone who is okay with waiting for responses every now and again as I do work as well.\n\nI\u2019m looking for original romance content I do not do fandoms. I\u2019m sorry, they just don\u2019t do it for me. I\u2019m looking for any kind of pairing, m/f, m/m, f/f. I am an adult so NSFW themes will present themselves. I\u2019m an adult and I use adult language when it comes to NSFW senses or smut scenes. I play male and female roles, NPC\u2019s and side characters if we need them. \n\nI would like my partner to be detailed, or at least put some sort of effort into our story. I love to plot and come up with drama to keep something going long term, I would expect you to do the same. I personally feel more comfortable writing with another woman but if we jive well, I\u2019m not opposed to writing with a man. \n\nNow with all that being said there are a few pairings I have in mind which I\u2019ll list below. If you see something you like or something you wanna mix up or play on, send me a DM and we can figure it out. \n\nPairings\n* Vampire/human \n* Werewolf/human\n* Demon/angel \n* Angel/human\n* Demon/human\n* Human/human - slice of life\n* Demi-god/human\n* Magical being/human\n* Clairvoyant/ human \n* Shapeshifter/human\n\nThese are just some ideas that I like.

Are you looking for something more than a quickie?

We\u2019ve got people from all walks of life so why not walk with us as we have fun in this seemingly ordinary town with extraordinary people as it\u2019s residents. We\u2019d like a few more fine women to bolster our ranks and I hope you\u2019ll be it! We\u2019ve got your men, your women, anything you want. Nekos, deities, shapeshifters...everyone is welcome! 18 years and older only!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\n*The sky above the town of Aurora Springs was grey, the light of the sun scarcely peeking down. Autumn\u2019s crimson colors faded from the leafless trees and took an obsidian appearance in their stead. The air was frigid, snowflakes falling and coating the town in a crystallized blanket. Beds of snow lay dormant on the grounds, the initial sign that Winter had come to the rural mountain town. Aurora Springs is home to Mountcrest University and is unrivaled with its recreational and outdoor activities. From hiking through our nature park to boating, fishing, and camping out near beautiful Lake Eros.*\n\n*For being relatively small, the town of Aurora Springs offers their residents and college students an astounding number of recreational attractions. From bars with live music and clubs to restaurants and the newly added ski resort, the town has become a highly sought out place to both study and call home.*\n\n**If interested, please click the link to join the server and start the application process!

I consider myself to be a literal and descriptive roleplayer trying to capture as much emotion and detail as I can in a scene. \n\nPlot:\nMy mom has a best friend who has adored me since I was born and has watched me grow all these years. She is very affectionate towards me and I am very fond of her also. She considers me as he own even though she doesn't have any children of her own (or she does... you decide?). We keep spending time during the Christmas Break or summer holidays as I am still in highschool. A different type of bond develops between us.\n\nI prefer this to be a long term roleplay as I am seeking somebody who wants the same fix in their life as me, I have had this missing in my life for a while. An older mother type figure who takes me under her wing and with whom I can develop a bond with. I know you are out there somewhere, hopefully you are reading this.",

I would like a mxf main, maybe with a side character or two. \n\nI'm 24 and would prefer a 21+ partner, but as long as you're 18+ that's fine too.\n\nI write in third person only. Para/multi para. I'm not too picky on length. A few sentences to a few paragraphs is fine. I don't want too little, but I also don't want things to be bogged down with overly detailed long posts. Give me something to work with, let me know what your character is thinking or feeling. I love that stuff.  \n\nI would like an active partner. A few posts a day, one at the very least. People get busy, myself included, so I don't expect a ton of posts in a day, but would like a fair amount. \nI'm pretty active as long as I'm awake.\n\nThis will be done over discord. I don't really use anything else these days. \n\n\nNow onto the main event. \n\nI'm not used to doing any sort of space focused RP and my sci-fi settings don't go beyond cyberpunk. But I got this idea for a character that would definitely be in a sci-fi space setting. So I'm branching out a bit and taking a leap into space.\n\nI'm willing to world build a bit, looking for an mxf romance, likely a slow burn but we'll see how it goes, a bit of adventure, and if course some drama mixed in as well. I'm open to a lot of ideas and plot points.\n\nI don't have a plot in mind, so I'd love to work together with someone to figure that out. Again, I'm open to ideas.\n\nI'm easy going, love OOC chatter, and just love to create and write. \n\nIf you're interested, feel free to send me a direct message.\n",

Unfortunately i usually don't have time to do consistent chat-based games. This is a \u201csandbox\u201d hard sci fi RPG idea i've been developing for a while: A few words about the setting: it's a grand scale space opera style, with spaceships traveling between systems, establishing bases and doing the von Newman thing.. (more spaceships) \u00a0there is no known faster than light travel, no artificial gravity. \n\nEnergy produced mostly by fusion and antimatter catalysed fusion, so antimatter is extremely rare and expensive, big spaceships will have maybe a few grams on board. \n\nInterstellar propulsion made possible by fusion engines, and a combination of solar/laser sails which require megastructures in form of laser arrays at least in the outbound system and gravitational maneuvering, with possible bussard ramjets if the gas density in the region is very high. \n\nInterstellar ships is massive with large crew, with most of the crew in \u201ccold sleep\u201d anabiosis for most of the voyage. Voyages between even close stars take decades.\n\n\nOn the story: You will start as part of a reduced crew of an interstellar ship Red Star sent to investigate an outpost that went \u201cquiet\u201d unexpectedly. \n\n\nWhere the story takes us, the sky's the limit. Depending on a scale we wish to take it could be from individual adventure to massive scale with players controlling multiple ships and colonies. NSFW is fine if its in a scope of a game (and everyone involved is an adult) this is however mostly an adventure game not exclusively romance game. \n\n",

NSFW is welcome but I, of course, need a plot. I am down for any of your interest since I am very flexible. Some of my favorite plots would be Jock/Nerd, Anything to do with the mafia. Corrupted person changes, forbidden love, and hidden secrets. I am able to do any other background characters to keep the story going. I appreciate your age to be 18-36. I am 22 in case your wondering. I live in the united states and use EST time zone, but of course, any other time zone is welcomed. I am able to do lesbian/gay rps also.

            "selftext": "**Hello and Welcome!**\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this long post. Before you begin reading the huge wall of text I just wanted to preface the entire post with a few things that i'm looking for going into this idea.\n\n* This is a Group Roleplay with original characters. Each character has an ideal plot-line and specific traits that they must adhere to, but for the most part the rest of their backgrounds and personalities are determined by their writers.\n* Nobody can lay claim to multiple characters; unless it would be needed to fill in spots.\n* The story will begin once the Lord and Micheal Roles have been filled.\n* Romance is open within the story\n* The story is open to Original Characters that are regular civilians apart from the Mafioso. A 2nd group of antagonists (villains) will be introduced later on.\n* Posting frequency is not a big issue, but for larger plot points those involved will all need to be present. Time will stop within the world to finish plot points that will move the story further.\n* ANIME OR DIGITALLY DRAWN IMAGES ARE USED FOR VISUAL REFERENCES. This is just a personal preference of mine. (Face-claims of real people don't sit well with me.)\n* Literacy when writing is kept at a minimum (as long as it keeps the story moving forward); Just use spell check and proper grammar and everything will be fine.\n* This story has religious themes.\n\nIf you're okay with everything above then let me explain the story! A TL;DR:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis story is largely inspired by the anime Katekyo Hitman Reborn. The story follows an heir that unknowingly is chosen to become the next head of the Italian Mafia: Evangelo. This family has been around for years, passing their roles from one generation to the other, their mission being to protect their country and their civilians so that they can lead a peaceful life, but within the past few generations of the family this idea was lost and pushed aside in favor of power and wealth. The current head of the family without an heir has chosen to pick from an estranged bloodline in the family, tracing back to the very first generation, in hopes that they would be able to push the family back on track.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany within the family disagree with the decision the current boss has made, favoring another one of the archangels of the family to take the spot instead. With a family so large and torn apart at the seams, and the chosen heir refusing his fate there is no knowing how the future will look. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould you be interested in taking part of this journey feel free to join my discord server for this story: [https://discord.gg/JpMvr3p](https://discord.gg/JpMvr3p)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny questions can be directed here! If not, feel free to join me to chat about ideas or to read how the story will turn out. I look forward to seeing you all in either case! (I might just end up writing by myself, haha.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow this line is the full story and the descriptions of each character. Thank you for your time and for reading everything here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**History** \n\n^(The year was 1806 and the place was in a small rural town in Italy. Eight Civilians gathered around a table at the home of Leon Di Evangelo as they discussed the heavy war that was threatening to destroy their once peaceful village in the name of religion.Their country was at war with another at the stake of their religion, the enemy wanting to convert their Catholicism to another belief and the land their homes were placed on was right in the middle of the countries which made their land highly sought after as a battle ground. Little was known about this group of vigilantes that emerged but what was known was their will. It was strong within their faith and they wanted to fight for what they believed in even if it meant losing their lives.) \n\n^(Their leader held the courage of twenty-men, leading without a hint of doubt in his abilities and strength. He was known as the Lord. The man right beside him helped the leader with his knowledge and prowess in strategy. He was the Lord's right hand man and shield Micheal. Seeking out punishment and maintaining order was the Lord's 3rd man Gabriel. With his level head and precision he was the best in scouting. The 4th man healed the team with his expertise in herbs and medicine. He was the best medic in town and as such there was no competition when it came to healers. His name was Raphael. Most of the manpower came from the 5th team member Uriel which served as the Lord's fury and Strength. As his sword he could plow down through groups of men and open up spots for his comrades to strike. Jehudiel did not do much fighting but they did serve an important role of keeping his friends well fed and tended to. They were not very skilled as fighter as he was a lowly servant, but he did his role with gusto and pride to help the cause. Reloading, creating, cleaning. It was all done by him. The Priest from their town's church would not be found in his place of worship as he joined the Lord and his friend in their fight to preserve their Religion. He fought vigorously with prayer and might as Sealtiel. When apart the one that would keep all of them in contact with those that they needed to be in contact with was the messenger Barachiel. Without his agility and stamina they would not have been able to be in contact as much as he allowed them to be.)\n\n^(All 8 of these men came to be known as the Lord and his Archangels or as they are known as now, The Famiglia Evangelo. They were Evangelists at the beginning and their efforts were not in vain as they eventually helped regain their town's peace. At the end of the war they were offered a place as the King's Knights, but refused to continue their peaceful lives. Unfortunately this would not be the case as they eventually created the Evangelo name to be a group of protectors. Even though they all moved and acted separately, at the end of the day they would all be contacted if needed if the Lord beckoned.)\n\n^(Years and decades will pass, each Lord passing on their duties to their Kin, the only one being unable to do so is the 4th lord. With that being said, each archangel was given the option to pass down their heritage to their own sons, keeping the position within the family. The family itself grew from their party of 8 to a full blown Mafia as it were known. Unfortunately, with the rise of the 4th and 5th Lord they were unable to break away from corruption. The position of Lord meant power and wealth and many were after such power and name. Eventually the family started to become split within itself some holding onto the original purpose of the group meanwhile others fought for the wrong reasons. Money being the root of it all.)\n\n^(In total there are 9 generations of the family with the 10th being the start of a new era for the Evangelo family. There are different branches of the family now as well and this all started with the 4th head which was brought into power even though he was not a blood heir. Up to his reign all leaders where the kin of those who were the original Lord and Archangels. The 3rd Lord was unable to have kin and as such he failed to pass on his title to his children and instead elected someone from within his family who was not an archangel. Even though his trust was placed on this man, the 4th head was overwhelmed with power and went crazy. He had 2 children, one which would become heir to the title and the other that was given full authority of a separate Family that would follow the main Evangelo Family for years to come. This would be the start of the Family's Decline.)\n\n^(In the present day the 9th Lord has not appointed an heir as he had no son, which would be the 2nd occurrence of a transfer of power within the family within its legacy. Many are lining up to be crowned as the leader, however he is not planning on appointing any of them. In a turn of events he has looked into the bloodline of the Family and managed to find a distant relative of the 1st Lord that was born from the 1st Lord's Sister's family tree. With this decision he hopes that someone unknowing of the Family's existence would bring it back to it's days of glory and justice rather than the destructive path of fear-mongering and greed that it is on. Many hopes and dreams rest on this move.)\n\n^(Archangel Micheal has sent his son, next in line to serve the young 10th Lord, to bring him the news without causing so much of a disturbance that would alert neighboring families to the plans of making them the Lord. As such it is only fitting that the next in line to be the 10th Archangels are to meet up for the first time to ready themselves for their inheritances. They all have to be on equal terms for to be able to rule the family with the fullest potential. Should they fail, the family risks falling apart.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Familia ( the characters)**\n\n* **Lord/God (taken)**\n\n^(This is the character I am planning to play, but that can be changed if I can find someone else who is suitable for this role. He is characterized by his love for others and selflessness. Above all this character is a man/woman who is courageous and holds a tremendous amount of power within himself. While this is true for the 1st Lord, this new Heir is anything but his predecessor. He is standoffish and cold, preferring to keep himself out of unnecessary trouble that could cause him to lose time and energy. One thing that could be redeeming about him is his ability to have a complete shift in attitude when those who are precious to him or are totally helpless are in trouble. This is evident in his love for his mother and gentleness towards children. He knows that) **^(Micheal)** ^(does not trust him nor does he like him, and tries to use this to his advantage to back out of his duty. Even then it is slightly amusing to flip-flop from taking responsibility and then flat out ignoring it just to see) **^(Micheal's)** ^(irritated reactions. Is currently a regular student.)\n\n* **Head of Security/Archangel Micheal (open)**\n\n**^(Archangel Micheal)** ^(has two jobs which is being the right hand man to the) **^(Lord)** ^(and keeping the) **^(Lord)** ^(safe as the head of Security for the Family and leader to the Archangels.) **^(Micheal)** ^(is characterized by their intense Loyalty to the Lord and his natural Instincts. As well, his main role of a Guardian means he is keen in his senses and a huge amount of patience. His Father follows the current Lord with total Loyalty and complete trust in every decision he makes, but deep down inside) **^(Micheal)** ^(does not agree with the choice of Lord and even thinks that the next) **^(Archangel Uriel)** ^(would be much better suited to becoming the head of the Evangelo Family. He was put in charge of bringing the new Lord to the Family base in his country to be filled in of the situation, however his lack of Lordly qualities almost made Micheal give up in bringing him at all until he was proven otherwise when they fought off some bullies picking on a young woman. Even though he does not agree with the decision, he will follow orders until it is proven that the new heir is not capable of taking responsibility. Even if it is more trouble than it is worth. Is currently acting as a transfer student in the Lord's class.)\n\n* **Head of Judgement/Archangel Gabriel (open)**\n\n^(As the Family grew in numbers, the 1st Lord appointed) **^(Gabriel)** ^(to be the head of all Judgement on those within the family he/she is responsible of carrying out any punishments to those who have broken any rules of the family. They are also in charge of the investigation department of the family which is directly linked with) **^(Micheal's)** ^(department. They know every member and they are in charge of any new admissions which puts him/her in the perfect spot to check out those who are not following correct conduct. As time passed each Gabriel has always had trouble trying to convince the Lord to keep certain members in or out of the Family. However, they must follow in his decision. The current) **^(Gabriel)** ^(had been newly appointed following the death of their mother, finding the change in the) **^(Lord's)** ^(bloodline to be a great decision to stop the corruption on their end of the job.) **^(Gabriel)** ^(is characterized by their Purity and their strong moral compass. Even if they are a bit OCD and try to keep everything organized and orderly, but without fail everything ends up going astray from original plans. Their stubbornness often clashes with) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(when they are giving out punishment,) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(always being the voice of reason. Is currently undergoing Law School.)\n\n* **Head of Medicine/Archangel Raphael (open)**\n\n^(Ever the genius,) **^(Archangel Raphael)** ^(is the medic of the Archangels with the healing touch and knowledge of modern medicine. When the Family needs to be patched up one can go to) **^(Raphael)** ^(and they'd be more than happy to help. This guardian isn't really seen much with the) **^(Lord)** ^(as he has other things on his mind when it comes to researching new advances in treatment. This angel commands the the nurses and doctors in the family, dropping in here and there to give members personal check-ups every once in awhile. While) **^(Raphael)** ^(seems happy and eager to help, he is actually hiding a dark side within himself. He doesn't really care about the Family or his position in power as a guardian and would much rather spend his time researching and experimenting in his Lab. When he is around the next) **^(Lord)** ^(he often finds himself expressing this wish to him, seeing that there might be someone else who understands the burden of this family is not worth bearing. This lack of interest causes him to butt heads with) **^(Micheal)** ^(but he always plays it off when things get too heated. Even with this distaste, he follows his duty without fail. Is currently enrolled in Med School and part-time) researcher.\n\n* **Head of Militia/Archangel Uriel (open)**\n\n^(All of the training the Family goes through is usually undergone by) **^(Uriel's)** ^(command and guidance. As the Lord's sword,) **^(Uriel)** ^(is the 2nd strongest member of the group, however his temper is viewed as problematic. He believes he is much better suited in leading the Family, but he doesn't let this be known too openly. The only one he has told is) **^(Micheal)** ^(but even then it was a comment that was made jokingly. He openly resists being close to the new) **^(Lord)** ^(and even is seen scolding his manners and attitude when they are together. If the two don't get along then most of the Archangel's Strength is unable to be used. This is evident in their inability to properly sync with one another when they all are as a group. However,) **^(Uriel)** ^(sees this divide as a perfect opportunity to show his Alpha Superiority to the group and often does come out on top with the majority of the group agreeing with his decision. He is the force driving the group at this point even if the current heads disagree with his behavior, most of the corrupted members of the Family like the idea of having Uriel as the new Lord. Is currently working next to his father as a soldier in the Military.)\n\n* **Head of Staff/Archangel Jehudiel (open)**\n\n^(Originally the caretaker of the original Family, Jehudiel is the leader of those maids and butlers who tend to the Houses of the Evangelo Family. Even though they mostly do the dirty work, Jehudiel gladly does their job with excitement and love. It isn't as bad as the actual maids and butlers, but they do lend a hand here and there if something needs to be done. It's hard to not like Jehudiel with their compassion and understanding, but sometimes that love is a little bit too much for some members. You can even say it is akin to motherly-love. Not one to take 'No' for an answer, Jehudiel can be quite aggravating to argue with. However, do not make a mess around them unless you want to unleash the aggressive side of this dutiful maid/butler. You can often find this Archangel chummy with Sealtiel when they are together. Of course the righteous will always join forces to get good to win. As far as the new Lord is concerned, one could say that there might be some infatuation seen between these two even though they are quick to deny it. Lord will say it is just a sibling love, but Jehudiel feels otherwise. Barachiel notices this, though they don't know if they can condone this between Guardian and Lord. They often tease Jehudiel about this. They are currently working as the head maid/butler in the Family home while their Father is in bed with an illness.)\n\n* **Head of Prayers/Archangel Sealtiel (open)**\n\n**^(Sealtiel)** ^(holds the most obvious job within the Archangels as the one in charge of their Religion. The original Sealtiel was a priest at the village's church, however they were not against joining these band of characters for the preservation of their religion. In the modern generation of the Evangelo the need for Religion and Righteousness has gone ignored which causes great distress to the current Sealtiel of the Family. Not many of the members go to pray at the church and this worries them. The next) **^(Sealtiel)** ^(is not as passive as their mother and prays for the day they can restore morals back into the Family for its original purpose. Even if they have a slight white knight complex, Sealtiel is very ambitious and ready for war at any moment. This does cause conflict between him and) **^(Uriel)**^(. Just like) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(and) **^(Gabriel)** ^(He welcomes this new) **^(Lord)** ^(with open arms. Being reduced to the lowest Rank of the Archangels won't stop them from returning their Family back to Glory. Currently they are a priest in training.)\n\n* **Head of Communications/Archangel Barachiel (open)**\n\n^(Communicating with important figureheads and keeping track of important dates and events is the job of) **^(Barachiel)**^(. You could say that he is more like the glue that keeps everyone in touch with the rest of the Family and the world, this messenger is the silent left-hand man for the) **^(Lord)**^(. While) **^(Micheal)** ^(does most of the work with the) **^(Lord)**^(,  if there is ever a need for a 3rd opinion Barachiel is always there.) **^(Micheal)** ^(dislikes) **^(Barachiel's)** ^(laziness and horrible attitude, but they know that) **^(Barachiel)** ^(is only acting out of dread towards the future of his duty. Secretly) **^(Barachiel)** ^(does enjoy studying up on idol groups and even had dreamt of becoming an idol themselves one day, but the blood-duty of being a guardian has stopped them from achieving or chasing said dream. Well, they'll settle for the opportunities Family Gatherings allow him. He'll enjoy being the Star until it's his turn to take on the role of the manager of their rag-tag group and be the manager instead of the shining star he wishes to be. For now he'll try to get their group into doing some fun things and keep them together as much as they can before they separate once more. Currently they are in School for Music.)",

            "selftext": "Lately I've been craving a bit of roleplay excitement. I havent been able to decide whether I want something daring and adventurous and tense, or a steamy and dramatic romance story. So, after searching deep within myself I decided \"What would be more exciting than both!?\". So with that taken care of now I just need to find a partner...or partners with which to bring the idea to life.\n\nAs an idea I was thinking of a story where the primary characters are in direct opposition to each other to begin with IE: A Thief and a Detective, or some sort of specialist hunting an assassin, perhaps even a Vigilante and an Underworld boss, constantly trying to hunt each other in a violent and exciting game of cat and mouse. Perhaps even teaming up reluctantly to solve a problem bigger than their differences. (I'm a bit cheesy and cliche I know.)\n\nThe uncommon bit comes in that I want uncommon or creative races and abilities to be featured (Not entirely necessary but I think it'd be exciting and give a new edge of creativity and imagination to the story) Harpies, Nagas, Dragon morphs, Centaurs, Dullahans, or if the setting gets pushed to sci-fi  any number of colorful, humanoid or even inhuman aliens.\n\n  \n\\[Actual info -I guess-\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I don't know what I'd call my level of experience, but I try to write a good amount for replies, but I'm willing to take instruction/pointers on improving my writing style or reply style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I prefer roleplaying with women as most of my characters are male, but I am entirely okay with roleplaying with anyone really.\\~I prefer original stories and worlds to fan-work stories. I do really enjoy fan-work stories but whenever I do them I like to have them be just stories in the world and not involve any of the canon cast, people always have different interpretations of what makes a character 'them' and I like avoiding that and learning/playing with new ideas more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I like building relationships in writing, romance, friends, enemies, frenemies, antagonistic sexual tension is the best!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I don't shy away from smut, I prefer it be a part of a character interaction or have a bearing on the story, but I mean I do love writing steamier scenes, whether or not I'm good at writing them is a completely different story, but I do enjoy them none-the-less. As such I would really like anyone I RP with to be over 18.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I enjoy discussing storylines, character interactions, and just plain chatting sometimes. Though if you prefer I can keep it to just 'professional' RP talk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love to get a message from anyone interested\\~",

            "selftext": "Hey all!\n\nI've recently decided to get back into text based roleplaying after a long string of, well... not roleplaying. It was something I would actively participate in for a long time until I had trouble feeling inspired or creative. Luckily, I've addressed those issues and I'm ready to get back on the horse, so to speak.\n\nA bit about myself; I have over a decade of RP experience under my belt and I've done properly every genre, era, style etc of creative/non fandom RP conceivable. I've also had lots of experience in fandoms so I'm open to that as well. I just don't really want to play in a setting that I don't know. I write exclusively in third party, and it would be heavily preferred if my partner did too. You will get at least a paragraph out of me, bar minimum. I have some soft limits, but open to pretty much anything as long as it has reason to be there. I'm over 21 as well, if that's important for you. I don't mind if you're not, as long as you're not asking for any NSFW themes.\n\nRealistically, I can play anyone, any thing, any gender though I do lean to playing my own gender more often than not. As far as romantic pairings, I'm down for anything! Though I do have a soft spot for F/F. My preference of original stuff usually lies in Fantasy (medieval or urban), Victorian era, or post-apocalyptic. If you have something in mind, I'm game to try it out. Even if you think it's a bit out there, I like a challenge.\n\nLast time I RP'd it was through email but I'm open to trying out Discord or other methods of contact. Hit me up via PM with some ideas or introducing yourself and we'll take it from there. :)\n\nHappy writing!",

We are searching for advanced writers who are available and able to write frequently, on an ideally daily basis, as The Bends is highly expansive and requires frequent participation in order to keep the progression at a steady pace! The Bends is simply brimming with content, as its been a work in progress for several months. Currently the character application is only open for party member spots, but more characters will be allowed once the party is established! There\u2019s much, much, MUCH more to The Bends than this brief synopsis, including the element system, the weapon system, the different species of **Imps**, random events, etc. Feel free to request any additional information via contacting me!\n\nSYNOPSIS: The once illustrious city of **Skyden**, along with the majority of human civilization, has nearly completely vanished. Out of the blue, matter began disappearing from Earth at an extreme rate. Automobiles, structures, organic matter, and even humans were all snatched from their respective dimension, and it turns out they were all transported somewhere: **LAYER ONE**of **The Upside Down**. This alternate dimension is a lawless, disturbing, entirely black, parasitic hellscape home to a malevolent set of species known as **Imps**. Chaotic in nature, **LAYER ONE\u2019s** very atmosphere is corrosive to humans, and it corrupts anything it comes into contact with which isn\u2019t sufficiently protected. This huge, evil domain is home to a plethora of locations to explore and mysteries to solve. **The Digital Sea**, **Machine Elf Island**, **the** **Whispering Forest**, **the** **Skyden Art Gallery**, **the** **Hall of the Revered One**, just to name a few, are otherworldly areas teeming with secrets to discover and enemies to defeat. This undertaking cannot be done alone, which is why **Intellia Kaelita** needs your help. While her history is unknown, there\u2019s one thing for certain: she refuses to let her realm be ripped from her without a fight. Join her and take the fight to the **Upside Down**, it will not be easy, but there\u2019s no other option. Will you take up arms and take the fight to the surreal realm, or will you cower in fear until your time is up and you\u2019re sent to the essence? The choice is yours.\n\n  \n**ENLIST TO BE A DIMENSIONAL DIVER:** [**https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxbv4VKq5ZwJ6wn5nog9WuqMWJfXiU3rKBUANnfeFEyPBvcQ/viewform?usp=sf\\_link**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxbv4VKq5ZwJ6wn5nog9WuqMWJfXiU3rKBUANnfeFEyPBvcQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

            "selftext": "Hey all, looking for a younger sister to play a casual and fun bro x sis rp. The scene opens with our characters being home alone while our mother is out of town for a week. Multiple characters are allowed if you want to play more than one sister, and if you want me to do the same.\n\nI primarily write in 1st person as well, although if I\u2019m writing two brothers I\u2019ll write in a mixture of 1st and 3rd\n\nIt can either be on here, kik or discord, just provide your users for one of those! Hope to hear from you all soon!  \n\\--------------\n\nStarter:\n\nOur mother has left us home alone while she goes on vacation for a week. We have always been kind of close, so it wasn't a big deal. She asked me to make sure you\u2019re taken care of and I agreed. I\u2019m 18 years old, six feet tall and have a job teaching at a martial arts dojo.\n\nIt\u2019s a hot summers day and since we have a back-yard pool I decide to head out and take a swim. I\u2019m wearing a pair of casual swimming trunks and nothing else. I rush over to the edge and after tossing my towel down leap into the cool water.  \nInstantly I feel the cold water cooling me down Once I resurface I head over to the shallow end and begin stretching out my body.",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am an 27 year old man looking for someone interesting in GMing a Pok\u00e9mon roleplay! I have a few general ideas of where I'd like it to go, but they're all very open ended. I'd like to travel on an adventure, making friends, capturing Pokemon, fighting evil, and winning battles. \n\nI'm not looking for any particularly strict system of GMing. There don't need to be stats or dice rolls or anything like that. Just collaborative writing, really!\n\nI love to play GMed roleplays, on either side of the table. Lately, though, I've found myself being GM more and more often, so if there were someone out there who was interested in GMing for me, I'd absolutely adore them. Of course, if you don't have much experience, that's fine! I'm happy to help and share the load of GMing. I love plotting and world building and creating characters\n\nI'm not very strict when it comes to Pok\u00e9mon Canon, either. Its more important to have fun than it is to keep track of which Pokemon appear at which routes and learn which attacks and what levels, you know? I'm just looking for fun!\n\nAlso, I can imagine this roleplay having adult themes along the way. I'd prefer it actually. Without going into detail, I'll just say I'd prefer to have partners over the age of 18.\n\nAnyway, that's all I can think of for now! I'm sure there's a lot more to talk about, but we can get around to it once you message me. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey! Thank you for checking out this post. I\u2019m Avarice, and I\u2019ve been role playing for a long time. I\u2019ve been role playing in groups for as long as I can remember, but I\u2019ve never really done extended romance and 1x1 Roleplay, and I kinda want to change that.\n\nI\u2019m interested in writing a superhero romance. My favorite character to write is Conner Kent/Kon-El (DC comics) because I think the dynamic of being born from one incredible man and one terrible man (he was cloned from Superman and lex Luther) and with the capacity to surpass them both is a very interesting dilemma to put a young adult into, and adding in the cloning \u201cam I really worth a person\u201d morality makes a very complicated character. The icing on the cake is his fun-loving and easygoing personality to cover it all up, and it makes a very interesting character to play.\n\nI\u2019d like to do a romance with him and some other character. OCs are welcome and canon characters are awesome as well, provided they are in a relatively similar age range. (Around 25) I don\u2019t mind crossovers as long as they make sense. Most of all, I want complex characters that have potential to plan out and Roleplay with, because I\u2019m looking for a complicated romance where a powerful bond can grow.\n\nAs for requirements on the part of the role player, i tend to be lax. I like literate, third person role players who can write back with at least 3-4 sentences and up to 5 paragraphs and get back to me sooner rather than later. I prefer to go back and forth at least once per day, but I\u2019m flexible in the timeframe. It\u2019s important for any Roleplay partners to be 18+ (I\u2019m 20) because mature themes are always great to explore in my opinion, they keep things interesting. I operate in EST, and can respond most evenings. I write over discord. Please PM me any questions, plot ideas or characters that you want to Roleplay, I\u2019m really hoping to find a good Roleplay partner! Have a good one!",

I write in third person past tense only, I can try first person but it usually doesn\u2019t flow well for me. I write anywhere from 2 good sized paragraphs to six to eight paragraphs depending on the scene we\u2019re writing. I do expect my partner to do the same. If you send me just a couple lines, I\u2019m sorry but I just can\u2019t work with that. I roleplay solely on discord and usually won\u2019t go away from that unless we really have a strong plot planned and you just can\u2019t stand discord. Last thing about me, I keep weird hours and sleep at all different times so I need someone who is okay with waiting for responses every now and again as I do work as well.\n\nI\u2019m looking for original romance content I do not do fandoms. I\u2019m sorry, they just don\u2019t do it for me. I\u2019m looking for any kind of pairing, m/f, m/m, f/f. I am an adult so NSFW themes will present themselves. I\u2019m an adult and I use adult language when it comes to NSFW senses or smut scenes. I play male and female roles, NPC\u2019s and side characters if we need them. \n\nI would like my partner to be detailed, or at least put some sort of effort into our story. I love to plot and come up with drama to keep something going long term, I would expect you to do the same. I personally feel more comfortable writing with another woman but if we jive well, I\u2019m not opposed to writing with a man. \n\nNow with all that being said there are a few pairings I have in mind which I\u2019ll list below. If you see something you like or something you wanna mix up or play on, send me a DM and we can figure it out. \n\nPairings\n* Vampire/human \n* Werewolf/human\n* Demon/angel \n* Angel/human\n* Demon/human\n* Human/human - slice of life\n* Demi-god/human\n* Magical being/human\n* Clairvoyant/ human \n* Shapeshifter/human\n\nThese are just some ideas that I like. I am looking for a more urban fantasy setting with go around so if you have an idea, I would love to hear it. \n\nI look forward to hearing from some of you. ",

Roleplay is currently active already, but the more the merrier! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a fully-made world map and setting, which allows for both fantasy-esque/tribal style lycanthrope RP, or modern-day, living-in-the-big city style! The setting has established locations, lore, and plot points for you to use, or you can make your own! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a few restrictions on character types (for example, we don't allow weredragons and other high-fantasy creatures), but for the most part, what kind of character you play is unrestricted and up to you. We're LGBT+ friendly, and active every day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have the option for both group RP anyone can jump into, or private threads can that only be posted in by the people who wanted the thread made. So if 1 on 1 is your more style, you can arrange to start one with anyone there, or jump into the ongoing group RP!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to message me for the link! ",

All of the partners I've had in the past ended up losing interest in roleplaying as a whole quite some time ago and ever since I haven't been roleplaying as much as I'd like to. All I've ever known is fandom roleplaying though so I know that makes things a tad more difficult finding partners, I have tried original in the past but just couldn't get into it.\n\nI'm in my early 20's and am fairly available, I don't mind if your schedule is less open than mine though.\n\nPost length isn't an issue with me.\n\nNSFW friendly. If we do nsfw, all characters involved must be aged over 18!\n\nI don't mind OOC, but it isn't a requirement\n\nFandoms:\n\nPokemon - The biggest of the bunch, I've been a fan since the Red and Blue days. I've played every game, read most of the manga, and have seen every episode of the anime! I'd be down for just about anything plot wise, but what I really want to do is a Pokemon journey rp in a fashion similar to the anime. Where a couple of trainers travel across one of the many regions and catch Pokemon, challenge gym leaders, develop romances, and slice of life stuff.\n\nNaruto - I've got a few ideas, but the one I really want to do is a Shippuden rewrite where Naruto's new team mate is secretly an Akatsuki spy.\n\nMass Effect\n\nSaints Row\n\nMarvel and DC\n\nPlatform:\n\nI honestly prefer Discord but I'm fine with whatever your preference is.\n\nIf I kept your interest this long, feel free to send me a message! I'm looking forward to hearing from some of you",

I also can play pretty much any role you want but I like to discuss kinks, limits, and roles. I am open to pretty much anything but I prefer things that are very kinky and usually not done so hmu with your unique ideas! ^-^ my favorite kink is feet so if you also share that kink we already have something in common. Sorry this post sucks but it has to be 300 characters and I would prefer if we just chat on kik to see how comparable we are! Very few people will be turned away so feel free to dm me!",

I didn't see anything that said you can't post things like this so if I missed it my apologies to the moderation team!  \n\n\nI'm not too active on Reddit but I thought it would be a good place to     promote a server I created for Gay RP on Discord. I've been  roleplaying   for about fourteen years and made a server oriented  toward gay smut  RP a few weeks ago. Within days it had at least  100+ members but  it had to be deleted because of an unforeseen  emergency. This is its    reincarnation, and a permanent one. There are  places to post character  profiles, create   advertisements looking for  play, NSFW channels where  you can post  gifs,  pictures, and videos,  along with gaming channels  and other ones.  It's a  pretty interactive  community and as I say in  the introduction  portion  that's what it's  meant to be - a community of  people coming  together to  create, write,  making friends, and get the  social  interaction we need.  Please come  join us! There's a lot of  great people  here already and it  is going  to keep growing! Click the  link to come  hang out!\n\n[https://discord.gg/fH7JVH9](https://discord.gg/fH7JVH9)",

            "selftext": "Just to get a few things out of the way... \n\nPlease only respond if you are 21+, okay with my character being a real life celebrity (your character does not have to be and would probably be best if not one), and are willing to play a character aged 30+. I am looking for someone literate that can match my responses (2-4 paragraphs usually). However, I do prefer quality over quantity. If you can convey details and give me enough to work with with a shorter response than that's perfectly fine too. I just really want to look forward to each post and I want you to be able to do the same. Also I write in 3rd person past tense and would prefer you do the same just so that it flows better.  I\u2019m pretty good at writing humorous characters. I like drama as well as romance, just to stir things up and keep things from getting stale. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for the goods...\n\nI would like to play the part of a popular late night talk show host. You could play the part of a crew member on the show or something else that interests you as long as it belongs in the same world and would be interacting with him on a daily basis. \n\nThis would be a romance of sorts but it won\u2019t start out that way. Our characters could be anywhere from indifferent to each other to friendly at first before a connection is made and they become more. Do they try to fight it because they work together? Do they give in but try to keep it a secret from their co-workers? Will they remain completely professional? Who knows?\n\nThe crew would spend many hours a day together brainstorming for new ideas for the show, writing jokes, eating lunch together, and just generally trying to not kill each other on a daily basis. Basically like any work environment but slightly more interesting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to hear your ideas on this as well, if you have any. Any input will be considered. So\u2026does this interest you? Send me a pm and we can go from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "The two adventurers had been traveling for months, fighting off evil and saving countless innocent souls. Lindo had a fighting spirit inside him which contributer to him being a faithful paladin. His short black hair was always covered by his helmet but was extremely fluffy when it came off. His eyes were a shade of ocean blue with a sharp chiseled chin making his face come together perfectly. Lindo always got up close and personal with his foes... and his lovely partner. \n\nWhen Lindo met her, they had an instant connection. They were only partners for a simple delivery mission at first. As time went on, they were inseparable, spending each and every moment with eachother as they fought side by side. It would have been an understatement to call them lovers, they were soulmates. \n\nThey complimented eachother with their fighting styles, becoming eachothers safety net in the event of a failure, they promised that to eachother. Little did she know, her love and her vow to Lindo would soon be put to the test.\n\nIn present day, Lindo and his partner were fighting an giant that had locked them in his cave, like many they had fought before. The giant swung his club eratically, making it hard for the two of them to decipher where it would go next. They spent the greater amount an hour trying to come up with a plan to at the very least, stun the ogre. \n\nLindo was getting restless and his fighting style got the better of him. He charged in with his spear in hand and lunged at the giant when he was focussed on Lindo's soulmate. His spear pierced the chest of the raging giant and screamed. \"I got him!\" Lindo was about to push himself off before turning his head to see the club moving fast and soon being inches away from his face.\n\nLindo's body flew across the cave and crashed into a wall, the sheer force of the impact made a crater in the wall before he fell down and smacked his head off the ground. It would have been the better part of an hour before he had regained some consciousness, seeing his soulmate holding him from above with the giant's body was mangled in the distance of the cave. Lindo looked up at her and the first few words that escaped his mouth shocked her. \n\n\"Who... am I? Who are... you?\"\n\n___________________________\n\nHello there! My name's Chris and I just really felt like doing some sort of amnesia prompt today! This story is meant to explore the rekindling of a strong love between soulmates. My character, Lindo, would be a paladin who had fallen in love with your character and the two of them had been adventuring together ever since.\n\nYour character can virtually be anything you want, from a mage to a soldier. \n\nObviously, the impact of the smack and the wall had rendered him unconscious and given him a very heavy form of amnesia. He remembers nothing but how to talk and how to fight, along with basic knowledge of survival. The rest has been wiped from his pretty little head.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in incorporating some NSFW or smut into our RP with the romance. It wouldnt just be for the sake of doing it but it would make sense with the tension building and stuff.\n\nThe rest is up to you! As it says above in the title, I only RP using reddit PMs and talk out of context in reddit chats. Feel free to use either of those mediums to message me about this prompt and I will surely get back to you! \n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red/ orange envalope or a chat request and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys!

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Bun, I'm 19. I've been rping 7 years and I'm looking for an RP partner who'll stick through for many a plot and don't ghost at the smallest bump in the road or at least let's me know what's happening before they go silent for days. \n\nI'm perfectly open to switching up the role play entirely if its not enticing anymore so don't worry about getting locked into a certain plot or using a certain OC. If you wanna change stuff, we can change stuff!\n\nI'm big on grammar and spelling, as well as good OCs. Length isn't something I'm usually too worried about, as long as we're pretty much matching each other in length.  I'm a female, so I prefer playing females in straight relationships. I do also like LGBT Role-play as well, though! So I'll basically only play a guy if it's mxm! \nAnother thing is, alot of my OCs have mental illness and things like that and I would love to use some of them! Feel free to ask about them, I try to portray these illnesses as accurately as possible and as non cringe inducing as possible. I'm also sensitive to any triggers my partner might have. \n\nMy favorite genres are slice of life and urban fantasy, paired with romance of course. I have some plots and can think up fairly simple ones if we have our characters sorted out. That being said, I would love for someone to come in with 1 or more plot ideas we can discuss and build on though its not required. \n\nIf you've read this and are interested, please leave an interesting and informative message about you and your role-playing skills, preferences, and ideas if you have them. Thanks so much! \n",

            "selftext": " Hi, I'm Meloria. You can call me Mel. I will be honest, I tend to be quite dark. However, I am an easy-going sort. Most things I don't take too seriously (myself included), but I am ever the sarcastic one. I suppose the best way to sum me up is that I can be rather abrasive, but quite lovely once you get to know me.\n\nI'm a twenty-something parental unit. I'm a retail manager so my available hours are the wonkiest of wonky. I would like to say I am super chatty, but I can be horrible responding to personal messages. I read them, and get distracted doing other things- and days go by until I realize I never got a response and whoops. It's not because I try to purposely be a jerk or anything, I just have a million things going on at once. I like to think I'm worth the wait, however. That being said, sometimes it's because of my health- I have a bad heart and sometimes I have to unplug from social media and the ilk for a few days while I gather my bearings and try to anchor back into existing. I don't cope with stress as well as I once used to.\n\nHowever, all that aside, I'm a rather fun person! I tend to make people laugh, even if I am quite cheeky most of the time. I become fiercely loyal and often go to bat for those I believe in without hesitation- which says a lot, as I have quite a way with words. I only use Discord as a messenger now, but I've been around since MSN Groups and Messenger. RIP they were the best ever.\n\nAbout Roleplaying\n\nWhat is the plot (or plots) that you'd like to play out with someone? This is where it gets weird.\n\nGothic Horror/Supernatural - Just give me gruesome and bloody. The scarier, the better I get. I live for this and honestly I'm game to write just about anything in this genre. I even have a plot for this, that's historical and twisted and amazing. It does have a romance theme, but isn't the entire basis of the story.\n\nModern Fantasy- I started reading a series called the Vampire Knitting Club, and I'm obsessed with the idea: England, a human(or a witch, like in the novels) running a front for a bunch of vampires to meet and knit (it doesn't have to be knitting, but I actually love the idea). Generally speaking, the vampires are well-kept and helpful, but I'm not opposed to a few rogues. Other mythological creatures are strongly welcomed.\n\nSteampunk - I've been desperately wanting to try my hand in this. I don't have a specific era in mind, but if we could include supernatural creatures, I would love that.\n\nSailor Moon - I have a very, very specific plot for this. It's pretty intricate, but also has proven loads of fun in the past.\n\nDragon Ball - Honestly, I've never written this. I've only recently gotten into the series, but I want to try it. Come at me with ideas.\n\nFallout - I have a few of these going, so I kinda need a good storyline to write more of this.\n\nBioShock - If you are interested in writing this, let me tell you, you're my new favorite person. I have an OC who is my literal baby and I would fight armies for her.\n\nHow often do you generally post? Honestly. Honestly. Like once a week. I have a billion other things that go on in my life and sometimes I get so caught up in them I barely have time to breathe. However, if I'm really into what I'm writing you'll see me every day. Sometimes more than once a day.\n\nHow much do you generally post? This might be why I take so long to reply - I generally write 1k+. I am an avid lover of description. However, I can tone it down to about 400-600. I try to match what's given to me.\n\nI wrtie third person, generally. I also tend to write male characters more, but I'm not inept with female characters. I have basically no limits, and I will discuss everything with you prior to starting an rp. I would prefer to create a server exclusive to the rp, as it allows me to be meticulous and keep all things separate.\n\nIF interested, please DM me here or a reply to this post is fine. Be aware that I am only interested in writing over Discord. Thank you!",

I also prefer things to remain consistent, that doesn't mean I want a reply every day but if you're going to disappear for awhile I do like to be in the know, especially so I don't assume you ghosted.\n\nNow what I have in mind is a Pokemon journey with darker themes, more mature if you will. NSFW would be preferred, of course whenever NSFW is involved all characters involved will be over 18! That is not solely what I'm looking for though, I know wanting that can mean many things... but I want both that and plot!\n\nThe region doesn't really matter much to me, we can choose whatever region you feel like.\n\nPost length is also not an issue, I'll match with your own!\n\nWhen it comes to crossovers, I don't mind in the slightest though I prefer simply adding characters from other fandoms.\n\nPlatform of choice, I honestly prefer here or on Discord.

I've been enjoying jumping through the games recently and remembering how adorable the characters are, and I've been craving a particular idea for a while now but haven't ever gotten the chance to play it out.\n\nThe Idea: For as long as the world can remember, there have only been the four CPU Goddesses, and, more recently, the CPU candidates. When an ancient prophecy is revealed and another God enters the fray, how will the other's react? A new nation, a new God, destined to marry one of the CPU's and bring prosperity to his wife's nation and his own through an unbreakable alliance which will alter the very balance of the world forever? Even Neptune can't laze around with an opportunity THAT good!\n\nI'd be playing my own character, 'Red Heart', the first male CPU, ideally with my partner playing the competing goddesses and candidates competing to bring him to their respective lands. I'm more than willing to help plan things out and can play some of the more minor characters, but would prefer the Candidates and Goddesses be played by my partner. We can include Plutia/Iris Heart as another Planeptune CPU if we desire, or an aged up Peashy/Yellow Heart ruling her own nation, and any of the Mascot characters can find their way in as well! Whether this turns into a  largely monogamous RP or a harem full of CPU goddesses, let's see how the balance of Gameindustry shifts!",
