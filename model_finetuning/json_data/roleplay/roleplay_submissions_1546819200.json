I\u2019ll make this short and sweet and I\u2019m not looking for anything much, just a partner for a possible long term roleplay! \n\nThis would center around the (obvious) realm of Naruto and Tsunade\u2019s connection to her guard platoon! More specifically, Genma, one of my favorite side characters.~ I\u2019d simply want someone to portray Tsunade, as I\u2019d do the same with Genma. \n\nI\u2019d love to explore the realms of a relationship between the two with buildup, romance, with smut being completely optional. We can talk plot, the story and whatever else should you be interested. I haven\u2019t had a partner in a while and would just like someone to keep me busy I suppose. \n\nSadly I can only use PM\u2019s or the messaging system on reddit and can average a few posts a week, more or less depending. I write third person and have good grammar, typically mirroring my partners posts. I adore the concept of Tsunade moving on in her love life to find someone else who could move closer to her, she\u2019s probably my favorite female lead of the series. \n\nThis can be as slow or fast paced as needed but more or less I\u2019m simply looking for a good, romantic buildup and story!

            "selftext": "**EDIT:** I decided to repost with this update. Before I posted for long term RP partners, I know that can take a while to get into an RP and finding a partner could take even longer. Please don't be intimidated to reach out, although I am looking for long term players, I'm open to short term.  My style of writing is very character driven. So whatever the plot may be I like to stick them in some sort of situation that they're working to get out of. If you're not up for that, then I'm open to smutty PWP scenarios. It the very least has to have a beginning middle and end. Anyhow, I'm at work and will be slow to reply. Thanks for reading this!\n\nSorry  **I don't RP ANY fandoms**. I just can't do it. It feels weird. I like  building characters and worlds from scratch. I really like focusing on  the characters and their character arcs and their interactions with each  other.\n\n**NO SELF INSERTION.** I like keeping  my character and me separate and would not like to mix the two and vice  versa, I would rather you play a character you made than a version of  yourself.\n\nI'm up for any kind of pairing,  friends, siblings, lovers, working partners, enemies. (This can be  romantic or platonic but the characters need to be interacting in a way  that drives the story forward. For example, a shut in that isn't  motivated to absolutely anything is really hard to play against if all  my character is doing is forcing them to do everything.)\n\n\\[If  you want to play several characters and go for a big intertwining  story, anticipate that this will take a long time to set up and I'd like  to play a couple of times before jumping into that.\\]\n\nFor  romantic pairings I'm up for any sexual orientation and any non-human  pairings \\[They have to at least be of human intelligence and self aware  and vaguely humanoid. Nothing like a horse that's just a horse but is as  smart a human. Also no furries. The actual fur part in furries is the  thing that makes me uncomfortable.\\]\n\nGenre:  Any genre goes. I can enjoy just about any type of genre setting, high  fantasy, or sci or magic, or anything you can think of, just know I'll  be thorough about going through all the basic world building stuff. I  like to start with slice of life dramas to really gauge our writing  styles and interests.\n\nTropes: Any trope  can usually go as long as it's legal. I'm fine with using tropes as a  base to start off a story but then really flesh out characters and story  as we go.\n\nI'm up for pretty much anything as long as it's engaging.\n\nI mainly play M4M but am open to everything!\n\nFor  anyone that got this far and is still interested. My name is Len, I'm a  29 year old woman and I've been RPing for 15ish years. I'm looking  forward to making friends and having fun :D",

I'm extremely literate, minus a rare typo every now and again, and I expect the same out of my partner. I'm not asking you to throw an essay at me everytime you reply - I just ask that you try your best, and nothing more.\n\nFor this role, I want to aim for a fantasy fit with a female DM, mostly because I'm rather proficient when it comes to the genre. Be it High Fantasy or Low, I don't really mind! I just love the material, and I'm well versed to writing in it. I would definitely love to have some romance/NSFW elements throw into the plot, and I'm all for darker stuff too! I love dark fantasy, so do not be shy if you are. \n\nI'm a reliable partner with a lot of experience, and I don't dip from RP's halfway through. I only ask that you be literate and willing to write fantasy - so, take my OC and I on an adventure! \n\nComment below or message me what you're interested in, or what you'd like to do.

The Swamps, which were stuck between these regions with a large gulf to the south, were next.  The most recent to be settled were the Deserts and the Plains.  The most advanced societies are Middleswich, Greenram, and Joanville.  They mostly rely on trade and the railroads.  The smaller settlements focus more on hunting and fishing, if they're not being raided by bandits or dishonorable gunslingers.  Besides animals and people, there are other things to worry about.  Wendigos, skinwalkers, sasquatches, demon dogs, the undead, and much, much more.  So what will you do in the west?  Will you seek land?  Will you raid people?  Will you survive?

            "selftext": "**DO NOT MESSAGE ME IF YOU DID NOT READ ALL OF THIS, I WILL KNOW IF YOU DID OR NOT**\n\n\nAd revisionnnnnnn.  I'm consistently available and would **prefer my partners are too, ghosting is a serious problem** and have been RPing for 12 years.  I'm here looking for action-adventure type fandom RPs with plenty of character interaction and development focus rather than JUST constant ego stroking fight scenes.  Environmental and interpersonal exploration is good too, throw some bits and pieces of slice of life into the mix and I'd say it's perfect.  I only play Female characters and I prefer that whoever approaches me plays one as well as I've had basically zero good experiences with male character players.  That is to also say if any romance occurs I prefer it be Female X Female.  I'd prefer that a partner that approaches me is 18+ in most cases and OOC gender doesn't matter as long as the character being played is Female.  I'm in the CST timezone of America and I tend to stay up all night and be asleep in the day.  Nocturnal sleep schedule and such so I work rather well with EU, Australia and other late night Americans.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs for fandoms themselves, some I am fine with both sides playing an OC or a partner playing a canon if one wishes to, though I'm honestly a bit picky in terms of OCs of some fandoms.  In a descending order will tell you which fandoms I currently have the most muse for at the moment and at the bottom are ones I usually do but would need something particularly good to really be up to put something together for.\n\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nSplatoon\n\nPokemon\n\nDragon Ball\n\nHunterxHunter\n\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid ~~(I suppose if one is up for playing a canon in that and shoehorning all sorts of stuff, sorta just something someone dragged me into trying once which applies as an option)~~\n\nMaplestory 2 based stuff maybe if one is up to it.\n\nLittle Witch Academia\n\nKingdom Hearts (Kinda iffy on this unless you come with a solid plan)\n\nThere are a few others but they're not ones I'm all too interested in playing alongside someone else's OC unfortunately so I'm leaving them out.  You're also free to suggest fandoms if they're anything like the ones listed above and if it tickles my fancy I can definitely give it a go.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Platforms**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only use Discord.\n\n\n\n**Age Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI usually prefer my partner being 18 or older given I'm 23 but in some cases I can make exceptions if I'm feeling it.\n\n\n\n**Character Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI prefer whoever I am writing with to play a Female character.  I've had zero good experiences with male ones and have just been put off from them entirely.  With that said I also only play Female characters.  I only play OCs myself but if the partner wants to they can play either a canon character or an OC, their choice as long as it's a female.  I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.  Basically if aiming for a romance I'd prefer the partner character being the one making advances and such.\n\n\n\n**Romance Junk since it was mentioned**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only do FxF but am fine regardless of if it's OCxOC or OCxCanon.  Makes no difference to me as long as the character itself is appealing.  I prefer it being slow burn/developing over the course of a play than immediately set up before even starting.  Won't do CanonxCanon though cause I'm garbage at playing Canon characters.\n\n\n\n**Post Length Stuff**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs long as you're detailed/descriptive and got good grammar it'll fine and stuff.   I'm a rather literate person and can easily put out multiple paragraphs if given enough to work with and I'd prefer that my partner is plenty literate as well while also giving me paragraph posts.  But I am rather flexible on this depending on a situation within a scene.  Exceptions and times I'd allow shorter than a single paragraph being when a situation within a scene becomes back and forth plain chatter and so on.\n\n\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done.  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Vaal  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",

While I do enjoy roleplaying very much, I do also play games on PS4 and PC. I have been roleplaying for over 15 years and while I am a woman of quality over quantity, I would like responses equal roughly to my own. I write exclusively in third person limited as well. \n\nNow; on to the fandoms I\u2019d like to experiment with!\n\n\u2022 Bloodborne\n\n \u2022 OVERWATCH \n\n\u2022 The Forest \n\n\u2022 Fallout ( I have only played 4 &amp; 76 at this time. ) \n\n\u2022 Dead By Daylight\n\n\u2022 I am fond of several anime\u2019s so we can discuss those options too. \n\n\u2022 General smut. \n\n\u2022 Harry Potter\n\n\n\nIf those games interest you, please continue reading.\n\n**I AM OC FRIENDLY**; however the only game I\u2019d prefer to have you play a canon character from is OVERWATCH.\n\nThe genres that I prefer to write from are Drama, Adventure and Romance. Smut is a given in many stories. While I myself am fine with this premise, please remember that there must be a story leading up to the sexual acts.\n\nStill interested? Feel free to message me for my Discord if you meet the following criteria.\n\n\u2022 You are 21 or over. \n\n\u2022 My timezone is not an issue. \n\n\u2022 You are literate. \\[ I am such a stickler for good grammar it is ridiculous. \\] \n\n\u2022 \\[ This is optional. \\] You game on either PS4 or PC.\n\n \u2022 You\u2019re responsive and talkative. \n\nI look forward to seeing you in my inbox.",

Which caused fear even envy amongst them. A prophecy wad written, that spoke of the one who could control the God if chaos and bring him to his knees. The gods took this as the one who would destroy him. They combined there powers and tried to place them in those that they felt would be worthy but none survived the ritual. Until the god of war fell in love with an imorta l elven queen and there daughter was born. \n\nThe council of twelve convinced the God of war that his daughter would be the perfect controler to the god of Chaos. They preformed the ritual and she survived. She was raised to obey her father's wishes and taught that one day she would destroy the God if chaos. When she came of age to marry her father and mother threw a huge celebration inviting all the gods except for chaos and any potential suitors. But the God of Chaos had other plans. He had heard of the prophecy and was determined to find out who it was that was destined to destroy him. As the celebration went into full swing the God of Chaos made his appearance. \n\nAs you can see it's a little rough, I want to play out from here what could happen. You would be playing the God of Chaos, you are an aragont controlling man, what powers and what you look like is up to you.

Hatred is beginning to spur in the hearts of those with great and little power. While there may be peace today, will it be there tomorrow?\n\nHi, I hope to have excited you with the promise of a home driven campaign.

All that we ask of you is that you're willing to put a wonderful story about when good goes too far and evil encompasses all at the forefront.\n\nPlease follow this link: https://discord.gg/NT236PA",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m looking for a female rp partner to do a modern world Greek mythology rp. \nI am a 18 year old student living in the UK, so my replies will vary. However, I will always be able to reply at least a few times per day. \n\nThis is set in present day, on the east coast of Florida. Our characters are demigods tasked by the gods with protecting the area, killing or driving away any monsters. My character is the son of Poseidon, and it\u2019s up to you what godly parent you want! Preferably not Poseidon, though. I would like a romantic aspect to this rp, and I\u2019m not sure two children of Poseidon falling in love would be what we want. \n\nOur characters stay in an apartment right by the beach, with a large balcony where they can watch events unfold. However, they don\u2019t really need to constantly be on the lookout. Three harpies circle the area, and they will land on the balcony to get their attention. Once they are alerted, they have to go find the monster and kill it, bringing it away from other mortals. Humans struggle to see anything supernatural like minotaurs, furies, hellhounds and such, so they could be being chased by a Nemean lion, and to humans it would look like two teenagers being chased by a really angry cat. \n\nAside from this, I do have a plot and storyline to go alongside it, which I will reveal to you either when we get talking, or further in the rp. \n\nI would like to have a nsfw aspect to this, but if you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s alright! \n\nI hope this plot interests you, and I hope to see you soon! \n",

To put it simply, I'm looking for a roleplay partner. \n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n- **Quality replies.** I generally don't mind how long/short your replies are. However, constant one liners can quickly make a roleplay boring. As a minimum, all I ask is a paragraph. \n\n- **Other.** As a general rule, I usually like my partner to play an older/taller character than mine. The differences don't have to be insane, but there typically has to be at least some. OOC is appreciated as well! I will try to warn you if I'll be gone for a couple of days, I ask the same of you if possible. \n\n**Roles I would like you to play:**\n\n*Here's a list of roles I'm interested in my partners playing.*\n\n- Soldier.\n- Cop.\n- Security guard.\n- Serial Killer.\n- Yandere\n- A classmate who bullies MC.\n- A classmate or person who hates MC.\n- Guardian Angel.\n- Pilot.\n- Android. \n- Steampunker from another dimension.\n- Famous YouTuber (OC preferred).\n- Slime/Monster girl. \n\n*Note: Want to play something that isn't mentioned here?

            "selftext": "Hello fellow RPers! I've been tossing out ye old line for RP partners based on several prompts I wrote out [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P-8H1g6mXU6lQhB0UMUogCcob3wzf9g_e8a6r3cg1ws/edit?usp=sharing). Thank you all who responded to me and I do apologize if I ended up either not RPing with you or starting and ending up ghosting you. I'm an asshole.\n\nI have a slightly different offer this time...and basically that's just that I'm looking for new partners for...something. I'm not sure what, that's up to *you*. That's right, I'm open to *your* ideas...with a few caveats.\n\nFirstly, if you want the long story about who I am, you can check out my bio [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p4e3RBYQM9WYfYG57pZtoNxNPHdVTWEL18-Ha23Lj7U/edit?usp=sharing). This will give you a good example of who I am and what I'm about, but I'll try to concisely hit the bullet points here...\n\nFirst of all, I'm a very experienced, very literate RP partner. I've been RPing for more than 25 years and I've been a professional writer and teacher at various points in my career. I'm not looking for the next Shakespeare or Hemmingway, but I would like someone who is comfortable saying they are extremely literate and detailed. Now, when I say this, I'm not looking for someone who writes a novel with every post. I want someone who is comfortable sharing description duty, narration duty, picking up other NPCs, basically helping to bring the world to life. Something this will require 10 pages. But sometimes a post is just fine with a paragraph. And I would like someone who is comfortable with their ability to make those decisions.\n\nI would also like someone with clean writing. The most important thing to me, beyond someone who enjoys sharing descriptive and narrative duties, is someone who is comfortable with the basics of language - syntax, grammar, and punctuation. If it's not clean, I spend too much time trying to decipher and decode what you're writing and it takes me out of the experience. I know this kinda goes along with asking for a very literate partner, but I feel it's important to point this out.\n\nI'm also looking for someone who is comfortable with me playing my OC, who is either a transgender woman or a man transformed into a woman willingly via magical or sci-fi means. Prompt #4 on my prompt document above would be a good example of what I'm looking for...but I would be fine brainstorming or using one of your ideas. Also, romance is a must and I'm *only* looking for FxM at this time with your character playing the M. Sorry ladies! If you read this far, please include the word marshmallow in your message to me.\n\nThe rest of the details of the RP are up in the air. I strongly prefer modern fantasy stories, but I also like \"fish out of water\" stories where my character is sent to another world with supernatural elements (again, prompt #4 would fit very well with this). I also strongly prefer NSFW being included, so **only 18+ applicants please**.\n\nHowever, I will say this right off the bat: my muse is incredibly fickle and annoying, and I can be a bit of a flake. So I will be relatively picky about who I end up RPing with. I can tell when I will be compatible with my partners almost immediately and I don't want to waste my time or, more importantly, yours. I apologize if this makes me sound like a jerk or elitist, but it's just how my muse (and my very bad, stupid brain) works. I'll try to be up front with you, but sometimes my anxiety makes it difficult for me to confront someone...if I end up panicking and ghosting you, I very deeply apologize. Just know that it's as much for your benefit as my own (I know that sounds like a lame \"it's not you, it's me\" excuse, but I'm being genuine here).\n\nAnyways, that's it. Thanks for reading this far and whether you end up messaging me or moving on, good luck and happy RPing!",

This person should be able to play as another character who drives the plot or just GM through a story arc. I am open to many NSFW themes as well as just vanilla adventure. I prefer to write in 1st person but can also write in 3rd.]\n\nMutants are outlawed. New Genosha is their only safe refuge, president Trump have declared us a threat to the national interest after a handful of mutants defected to the Canadian and Mexican militaries.  New Genosha sits on an island just west of Los Angeles which wouldn't be an issue for me if I weren't loving quietly in a suburb I'm Connecticut.\n\nIt happened last weekend. It was the first weekend of the new school year and I couldn't believe that I'd been invited to an upperclassmen party as a freshman. My parents made it very clear that I would only be allowed to go if I agreed to a few rules, no makeup, no drinking, no drugs, and home by midnight. I eagerly agreed and attended. However a few of the older boys had made no such agreements with their parents and after a few drinks decided I'd be an easy target to have a little fun with. So there I was, cornered in a room, 3 boys standing between me and the door. My heart racing, them demanding I strip, two of them offering to \"help me\" out of my clothes. I fought back tears, my dead cell phone in my left hand my right hand balled into a fist. As they came toward me I fought back as best I could they each took turns tearing at my t-shirt, or pulling at my pants. As I screamed everything went black. An hours later when I came too there was only silence. The three boys in the room lay motionless, I look around, confused, quickly grabbing my purse and making my way downstairs. To my horror every other kid at the party is in the same condition, I freeze. Did I do this? What the hell is happening. I dart from the house, the morning sun greets me. How long was I out. \"Shit,\" I exclaim before I burst into a full sprint, my parents are going to kill me.\n\n1.5 miles later I'm covered in sweat and gasping for air, I hadn't stopped once and now I stood at my front door, only to realize I wasn't sure how I'd explain where I'd been for the last 6 hours. The front door swings open, my mother stand teary eyed and enraged \"Wendy Wong where the hell have you been!\" She shouts pulling me inside. \"Your father an I have been calling you all night. She slams the door behind me, \"he's out now checking hospitals we were worried sick.\" I open my mouth to explain only to be cut off, \"I don't want to hear it, you show up at 7 in the morning,\" she sniffs, \"smelling like booze, and painted like it's fucking Halloween!!!\" \n\nI pause, what the hell is she talking about, I look backwards over my shoulder, in the hallway mirror an unrecognizable face looks back at me. What was once a light caramel complexion from my Korean heritage is an unmistakable green hue. \"I-I\" words escape me. My mind races. \"I don't want to hear it you're grounded. Probably for the better part of the decade, now go shower whatever that is off and head to your room. \n\nI don't object, instead heading straight for the bathroom. As I arrive i immediately run water in the sink grabbing a towel, I wet it and scrub furiously praying this is all some kind of trick. After two minutes of non-stop scrubbing my skin on my arm is irritated but no less green. I run my fingers through my black hair pacing nervously, \"This isn't happening, this isn't happening,\" I whimper over and over. But it is. I'm a mutant.\n\n[If you wanna GM my adventure of my cross country trek to New Genosha as I discorver my powers, slide into my DM's with some ideas.]",

Negotiations broke down on someone else's hurt-comfort idea and left me with a major craving, so here it is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm looking for a writer with great grammar and syntax who might be interested in playing a wounded warrior in an original high fantasy setting.  By high fantasy I mean there are definitely supernatural elements and nonhuman races, though not so commonly that you would see an elf at the market.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may choose your character's sex, and mine if you wish.  The important part to me is that my character finds your skilled veteran wounded after a huge battle, dying of severe injuries but still on their feet, and brings them home to a fortress in a black wood to nurse them back to health through their strange arts.  We can talk over particulars.  Chiefly what I want is that you are a good writer, you give me good solid paragraph-style RP, and I play the caregiver.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe can talk about what happens after that, but I would love a story where the spellslinger plans to shape your character into a bodyguard, enhancing what were once purely human abilities into terrifyingly powerful war-magic.  Again, we can talk it over, but I have lots of ideas for this dark fantasy setting if you're interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have a huge number of writing samples to offer, SFW or NSFW.  Please be prepared to also offer a sample of your writing.  **I'm a 37-year-old female and prefer to write with people who are at least post-college and have a settled life; I don't care about your sex or orientation, just your skills.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n Looking forward to writing with you!",

I\u2019m planning on doing Keith Kogane, and I\u2019d prefer to do it either after season five or after season six. I have seen all eight seasons of Voltron, but I honestly think it\u2019d be better to start in one of those spots.\nIt\u2019s preferred for you to be in either EST, or somewhere with just a couple hours time difference, and for you to be semi-literate or above. My literacy level usually fluctuates, depending on yours. I\u2019m usually a semi-literate, but if you\u2019re a literate, I can usually manage a few more sentences.\nIf you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to ask.

I will double rp for you. Please DM me! Thanks.\n\nAs It says Above I'm dying for some Stranger Things action as I wait for Season 3. I'd love to find a partner that can play a decent and at least semi-literate Steve Harrington. I am a literate writer with over a decade of RP experience. I like romance, action and drama and want all to be incorporated plus your own tastes. I will write an OC (Dustin's childhood babysitter who works at the neighborhood gas station) and we can discuss their personality and looks to be suited to your taste.\n\nThough I've got a lot of experience and consider myself literate I'm ultimately pretty casual. I'm online most nights and some evenings US Central Standard Time and I can be patient as well as very active. I'm not a grammar hound or a post-length nag as long as it is understandable, in character, and keeps the rp going.\n\nI do want to write a romance with one of my OCs but I want the focus to be their developing feelings not their hormones. That said I prefer an 18+ partner and we can discuss boundaries more.\n\nAs for my OC, I have a few in mind so please contact me and if you have a \"type\" so to speak we can talk about my OC!\n\nI do think I prefer a MalexFemale pairing for this but you're welcome to try and persuade me otherwise. Also I'm willing to double for you in an RP with a different set of characters (from this or another fandom we share).",

            "selftext": "Hello and welcome to my prompt. The main idea behind this plot actually comes from a Manga I read a few chapters of the other day. Basically, Earth in the not so distant future has become a melting pot for various alien species.\n\nI would like to take that idea and have some fun with it. For the setting I was thinking an artificial island built in international waters on which a city and space port was constructed. The island itself would be populated, as would the tunnels underneath it, and some of the ocean floor surrounding it. The reason this city was built was to make sure no one country would be able to get ahead of the other in terms of interplanetary relations. The city was built by an intergalactic  federation of sorts that helps planets develop and reach out into the stars, so it would be very advanced compared to the rest of the world.\n\n\"Immigration\" was used in my title because either your character or mine would have just moved to said city. Now I know this is cliche but I would like to stay human, and hopefully my female partner would be of another world..... but I am flexible. So either you could be a resident/neighbor who was asked to show me around or I could do the same for you. I was thinking I would play a human who moved to the city out of sheer curiosity and stayed after growing to like the various foods and cultures there.\n\nI very much enjoy world building and exploration, and I can get very detailed. As for the NSFW elements, well those could happen if we decide to go a romantic route but even if included the plot and characters would continue to be the focus. \n\nIt this interests you please feel free to send me a PM, and in return I will send my Discord info thingy. \n\nHave a good day.",

I just have a hard limit about writing actively abusive relationships and it's one I'm not going to cross here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince this is Blake we're talking about, I'll have to slap a bit of a trigger warning on this roleplay because of what happened in her past with Adam. If you're someone that's upset by any sort of abuse, this will not be the roleplay for you. I'd say just be prepared for anything.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for what I'm looking for:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-18+ given the material at hand\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-generally faster reply times. I'm trying to use this as a character exploration for her so someone who can reply a couple times a day would be preferred. It's hard to learn a lot about a character if there's only one reply a week. Not impossible, but difficult with how I RP. I can also do rapidfire replies personally but it's not required. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-a solid paragraph at minimum. I'm not a novella RPer personally and I don't feel like it's necessary most of the time. If you want to do longer posts, cool; you can do it. I'm just personally gonna stick to my shorter ones most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-GDocs and Discord are my preferred mediums, email is also acceptable\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-obviously a good grasp of characterisation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-okay with deviating away from canon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout me:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I'm 25+ with too much time on my hands and I tend to spend most of said time roleplaying, writing, or watching YouTube.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I tend to be more of a slowburn, character-based writer myself which is my preference. Plotting can use some work, so don't be afraid to toss ideas out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Honestly, I'm just super chill when it comes to roleplay. You don't have to freak out around me over things. I want to create a relaxed environment where we can both just kick back, relax, and have a good time. Even if our emotions get destroyed in the process because this is Blake we're talking about.",

            "selftext": "\n\"Where am I?\"\n\nWhen the words finally came they felt like they had been said by someone else. An altogether different person that had been concealed somewhere in the many dark alcoves, shadowed corners and hidden corridors that seemed to surround the young woman. It didn't help that the language she heard herself speak in wasn't a familiar one. It was still somehow 'known'. She understood the words, the sounds, the feeling, the tone, the delivery, yet it would have been impossible for her to and consciously say something else in that new language. She had wished to speak in her mother tongue, and although that's how the thoughts came in her mind, the end result had been something altogether alien. It would have been immidiatly unsettling for her, immidiatly foreboding and indeed almost mocking the lost state she had found herself in. The stillness of the questions reception was also haunting. While there had been no reaction to her pressence beforehand, the continued innitial indifference grew to be perfectly malevolent. Perhaps it wasn't an apathetic surounding at all, but one of silent, calculating, dangerous hostility?\n\nThe dark and horrifically gloomy chamber she stood in had been nothing like the warm brightness of normalcy, the all too familiar surroundings that had held her what felt like just a few minutes ago. The synthetic security of modern 21st century architecture instantly replaced by a sudden miasma of grim darkness with just the blink of an eye. Furniture had turned to collapsed piles of rubble, carpets and floorboards to cold cobble floor that almost hurt to stand on. Expansive crystal clear windows shattered to reveal walls of ancient rotting wood and cracking stained stone brick. Vast arrays of bleak grey and ill green fungus crawled everywhere. Large frilled islands, some even a couple of feet long, jutting from the walls like teeth. The comfortable cieling was torn out from above, brought higher and higher until disappearing into an inky black abyss. A sickeningly sweet putrid rotting smell overwhelmed ones senses, forcing itself on her, repulsion from all directions at once. The only illumination found within the alien, derelict environment came from tiny blue motes, firefly or glowworm like creatures that scuttled over the decaying walls and buzzed softly in the air. The effect was positively unreal, shrouding the entire passage in eerie empty twilight. \n\nThe object of her address had seemed like at ordinary human at first. The, admittedly skinny, frame had its back turned to her, clad in non descript brown rags that appeared more draped than actually worn. A thick white fur scarf, the skin of some unknown animal, and a bright mass of maroon locks cascading about their head rendered their actual identity invisible. However, the longer one looked the more horrific the figure became. It's limbs, part obscured by darkness, where sickeningly thin, the same tragic uncanniness found admist starvation and poverty of the most severe kind. As well as a worn leather satchel, it appeared to be carrying a kind of knife, or cleaver, a violent tool fashioned out of some black metal, easily as long as a fore arm, auspicious stains marking it's edge as well as a firearm, a brutish handgun that looked like the same kind of six shooter popular during the Old West, a weathered leather holstered revolver. This... 'entity' was armed. Well armed. Armed to kill. \n\nAnd then, finally, the world seemed to recognise the young woman's existence. The figure had been squatting, examining something on the ground and had appeared small, condensed, unassuming, but as it picked itself up it grew taller, taller and taller still, eventually towering at well over six foot. As the spindly thing moved, it caught more of the light revealing a sickeningly fascinating absence of flesh or even skin, indeed, instead it was named, shining bleached bone. It turned slowly, passively one might say, with care and curios awareness, and finally, it's face, or rather, lack of one, crept into view. The dark red hair had been placed as some kind of wig, almost comically out of place, attached firmly around the scalp. The simple unsettling purity of a human skull. Eyeless sockets stared into the young woman, a lipless, clenched jaw remained perfectly still. \n\nA few beats passed before the skeletal figure moved a muscle-less arm that had no right moving to its bag while tendon-less fingers slowly produced a black tablet and a small white powdery cylinder. Then came a brief, soft scratching sound as the figure finnessely etched, with what one could have quickly deduced to be chalk, onto its small slab of black board, stepping a few light steps forward as it focussed on its penmanship. It wasn't long before it was finished, and produced it's scribbles almost proudly to the young woman, flipping the marked blackboard over while raising it's chin.\n\nLike her own spoken word, the young woman understood the meaning of the strange spiraling script without actually recognising the eldtrich shapes themselves. It looked like nothing more than meaningless lines, but in her mind the message was soul shatteringly clear. Two words:\n\n'Hell, probably.'\n\n-\n\nIf you want to roleplay, give me a PM. I only use Discord. 18+. Long term roleplay. Women roleplayers only, simply because that's a personal preference. Call me sexist if it makes you feel better. No hard feelings if you ghost. We all do it, we have to make an effort to maintain each others attention.\n\n",

            "selftext": "**Welcome to Eldertree Academy!**\n\n\nA prestigious private school for the wealthy children of even wealthier parents. One day, in the middle of the semester a new student(me) arrives, which is very unusual. The principal decides to pick you as this seemingly oblivious new kid's guide and, to your dismay, new roommate. In the course of a few days you start noticing little things, my strange way of expressing myself, my unusual diet and my extremely close 'relationship' with nature, which is quite obvious from the way I talk to plants as if they were people and the strangest thing is that I always seem to have a strange, barely visible glimmer around me as if I was surrounded by a shroud of glitters, although others don't seem to notice the last part for some reason. One day, after we spent an afternoon in the town, we get back to find our dorm room wrecked. I immediately change as if I was a completely different person and soon, even though you would rather not, you end up being dragged into a world or magic, betrayal, adventure and, yes, romance.\n\n\n\nI'm 25M and ONLY looking for other guys for this roleplay. Be open minded, interested in \"modern day fantasy\" settings and AT LEAST semi-literate. Please message me with your Kik or Discord so I can add you and any questions you may have.",

I enjoy a few fandoms such as; Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Cherub, Riverdale and Peaky Blinders. Other than that I am open to any ideas you have as well as more fandoms, ask about any not listed there are loads more! I can also play cannon or OC characters, or a mix. For cannon I would love a percy/Annabeth, Ron/Hermione and Finn Shelby/OC. But please suggest more ideas, I love to hear them! For the actual role play I can play both first or third person and don\u2019t care as well as I can play both male and female characters. But for the parings I will only do MxF or FxF. Now all that\u2019s out of the way my kik is RP_Person1998\nPlease message me with any ideas you have, or if you like mine and want to build one ",

This is a crossover focused server, so characters from completely different eras will meet up and interact.\n\nWe have AR roles, which are versions of existing that are not from the games/media they star in. These are incredibly unique and allow for an interesting spin on a character. You are allowed t come up with your own AR role, or pick from the ones we have laid out.\n\nWe are looking for semi-literate to literate writers, and you will have to submit a writing sample before choosing a character.\n\nFor people who do not know much about Castlevania, or want to get into the series. This server is friendly to those people. We have resources to learn the series, such as linking videos on the entire timeline, and bios on each character (Although short as not to drag them on). If you want to play the games yourself, I'm happy to recommend some games for you to play first.\n\nIf any of that intrigued you, please consider dropping by. You might just make a difference in the everlasting battle between light and dark.\n\n[https://discord.gg/P3TF8wY](https://discord.gg/P3TF8wY)",

First things first, I'm 28 and find it a little weird to RP with anyone under the age of 18, regardless of whether sexual situations come up or not. It's not you its me, honest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, something different to me maybe not to you, or maybe it will be different to you and we can both have a new and exciting experience. Up to now every RP I've taken place in involves normal relationships between humans, demi-humans, or humanoids. BORING!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking to delve into the complex nuances of relationships spanning the spectrum of body-shapes, types, and consistancies, Boy meets Girl? No! Boy meets pokemon? Yes! Boy meets Dragon-girl! Hells yeah! Shapeshifters, monsters, mutants, aliens, I'm willing to try it all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Actual info -I guess-\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I don't know what I'd call my level of experience, but I try to write a good amount for replies, but I'm willing to take instruction/pointers on improving my writing style or reply style. I also try to match the quality and 'tone' of my partner if I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I prefer roleplaying with women. I do really enjoy fan-work stories but whenever I do them I like to have them be just stories in the world and not involve any of the canon cast, people always have different interpretations of what makes a character 'them' and I like avoiding that and learning/playing with new ideas more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I like building relationships in writing, romance, friends, enemies, frenemies, antagonistic sexual tension is the best!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I don't shy away from smut in fact in this situation It's probably a big part of the 'flavor', I prefer it be a part of a character interaction than just jumping right on into it, but I do love writing steamier scenes, whether or not I'm good at writing them is a completely different story, but I do enjoy them none-the-less. As such I would really like anyone I RP with to be over 18.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I like to RP over Discord, I find it keeps things neat and tidy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I enjoy discussing storylines, character interactions, and just plain chatting sometimes. Though if you prefer I can keep it to just 'professional' RP talk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope we can get to know eachother and have a good time together. Send me a Message if you're interested.",

I'll even allow the return of certain lost characters. \n\n[https://www.fanfiction.net/forum/Young-Justice-Outsiders-a-Path-of-It-s-Own/218279/](https://www.fanfiction.net/forum/Young-Justice-Outsiders-a-Path-of-It-s-Own/218279/)",

            "selftext": "(Note: Long Post Ahead)  \nI'm  seeking an RP partner with Discord interested in crafting a romance and  action/adventure story set in a fantasy world of our own design. We  would essentially worldbuild the basics of this High Fantasy/High Magic  setting together before RPing, and we would flesh out the world as we  went through the story. I have many ideas for the world already, but  this post is long enough already so I'll communicate them over messages if  you're interested. If worldbuilding isn't your thing, I'd be happy to  take the lead on that front. Before we get there, however, here's some  information about me!  \n\n\nI'm 26 years old, and a graduate  student with years of writing practice. I have been RPing for two years  as a way to unwind/cope with a busy study schedule, but I have been on a  break from reddit for a while now. I enjoy tabletop RPGs, fantasy  novels, and a few videogames. I am big fan of high magic settings, and I  adore worldbuilding. Too many RPs and stories are about doom/gloom and  darkness. While adversity is necessary I prefer my stories to be filled  with colorful, exotic settings and magic present throughout the world,  similar to many D&amp;D settings if you're familiar with the game's  lore. In terms of partner, I'm open to someone of any experience level,  and I actually enjoy first-timers. That said, I do have some  stipulations.   \n\n\nThere are a few requirements and preferences I have for an RP partner.  \n1) Be over 18, like me.  \n2)  Be LGBTQ friendly. I would actually prefer LGBTQ themes to be present  the story if possible and the central romance itself to be such.  \n3)  Be a lengthy writer, which to me means at least one to two lengthy  paragraph per response minimum. Although this may seem like a lot, it  works best with my schedule.  \n4) Schedule: I rarely have time  for chat \"sessions\" and so I prefer the \"respond when you can\" method. I  only ask for one response per day, and even then I recognize life  happens. My only stipulation is that if you DO have time to send  multiple responses, you do so, and I will endeavor to do the same.  \n5)  As a preference, not a requirement, I would very much enjoy a partner  who is not only comfortable with, but actively enjoys NSFW elements and  themes. In fact, I would be quite open to having this be a primarily  NSFW RP, provided that we could interweave plenty of plot and actual  character development. A blend of NSFW and story-depth is difficult, but  when it happens, it can be exceedingly fun.  \n\n\nIf you check  all the aforementioned boxes, please message me on reddit with the types  of characters you normally play, your experience RPing, and perhaps a  favorite hobby! I will respond to every message I get (in time). Just  because I don't reply the day you send a message doesn't mean I'm not  going to get back to you. If we click, we'll exchange Discord usernames  and go from there! I hope to hear from someone!  \nOh and as long as this post is up, I'm open to receiving messages!  \n   \n\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n  \n   \n",

It does have some horror to it, the whole concept is based off a novel I read.. but basically here's the RP plot.\n\n\nA powerful legion of demons have planned to take over human authority (demon hunters, police, military, ECT). The one in command isn't quite as what they are rumored to be. They take interest in y/c for whatever reason.\n\nThis rp will contain things such as.\nPhysically altering ones appearance through surgery (ex; turning from human to demon)\nProfanity\nDescription of violence (mild..)\nStrong subjects (will be explained)\nDeath (obviously)\nI'll give you a warning if anything else comes to mind. Other than that, throughout the rp, the legion and what not will be explained more in depth. \n\nIf you don't like descriptions of violence, tell me and I'll tone it down. This is typically an MXF rp but FxF is alright. \n\n\nThanks\ud83d\udda4",

            "selftext": "Hi there~! The name is Sam, and I'm looking for a literate partner to write some stuff with! I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nI'm looking for two things very particularly today, and they vary in tone and themes! The first is something involving an arranged, or in someway, a sudden marriage between almost two strangers. I would prefer for this to be female/female, so anyone looking to play a male character will have to settle for my other idea. In this sudden marriage, I would like to play a woman with a violent past and reputation, or atleast the other woman to know just how cruel/terrible she was a few years back. Though, I'd want to the story to revolve around the two falling in love regardless of her past; Mostly because she's trying her hardest to live a normal and secure life for the woman, bonus points if the woman already has a kid from another marriage.\n\nFor the second idea, it involves something akin to The Walking Dead. Zombies or not, it would revolve around a community of people trying to survive the Apocalypse together, and what lengths they will go to. I will be playing a younger character in this, a woman who would have been plunged into whatever disaster on her first day as a Deputy for the Sheriff's in her home town. I'm more then okay with exploring themes of the transition from a normal group just surviving, to maybe even the villains of someone else's story? Killing those that stand in their way or even threaten their groups stability, etc. Mainly, I'd wanna focus on the rebuilding aspect. Farming, building, etc. Town drama and what not!\n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. It comes with the territory! Sex, Alcohol, Murder. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well. So, if you're going to play a male character just keep in mind I wouldn't want a romance arc, but am okay with sex.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

If you have any interesting plots on your mind feel free to send those my way as well! If you message me for outside of these two characters, please already have some kind of plot in mind, even if it's just a little idea.\n\nSome basics: \n\n* 18+ only! Please mention your age when you send me a PM\n* Please don't just send me your discord username. Tell me a bit about yourself or what ideas you might have. \n* I really prefer mxm or fxf. All of the characters I have right now are male, but if you send me a plot that is mxf or fxf, that's okay too. \n* I write casual paragraph style. Unless it's an introduction or a scene change, I don't write more than a paragraph, usually only a few sentences. However, I typically don't do one liners either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to the characters! I don't want to list too much here, so these are just snippets of their personality. \n\n* Jean: A young (20 or so) Frenchman, set in the 1800's or so. He's a thief who mingles with high society in order to steal their goods. Acts a bit like a snob, but is really just trying to be able to get into high class parties. \n* Leon: A bratty prince type character, fantasy setting. Probably around 22 or so. He can be an actual prince or just the type. Good at magic but not the best. Is often demanding and selfish. Tends to take command, but doesn't always have the best ideas. \n\nPM me if you want to write with me with any of these characters, or if you have any other ideas!",

I enjoy writing and creating, with worldbuilding, character building and storytelling being me true passions. I\u2019m looking for a partner with the same sorts of interests to build a story, some characters and the world in which they live. I can play by Discord or Email, with no real preference for which. I typically try to post several times a week.\n\nI am principally looking for RP in Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic, Cyberpunk and Low-Fantasy settings. I have a few ideas and prompts available on request, and would welcome yours.\n\nI write in the third person, and I usually will do three decently sized paragraphs per post. I look for quality in a post; it doesn\u2019t have to be the best thing ever, but it does have to show some effort. That\u2019s all. I do ask that my partner be eighteen (18) or older. I am okay with NSFW elements in a story, but I don\u2019t want them to be the focus. I\u2019m not interested in a smut-based RP at all. Likewise, I am not interested in extreme violence or gore.\n\nAt the moment I am craving a specific relationship, one that can be best described as \"sexy but not sexual\". This is one where there could potentially be romantic and intimate themes (ie: NSFW), but no actual sex involved.\n\nAlso note that I only reply to messages sent by DM. Replies posted here will not be followed up on. It's a way to test if you're paying attention, among other things.",

Most importantly, you don't need any prior knowledge of the RDR franchise to roleplay here.

I have a few more ideas on my profile, or I'm open to other suggestions.

What starts on the radio could then transition to the diner at the local airport, or they could just happen to run into each other around the airport and recognize each other's voice. IT could be the other way around where they were at a bar and met, but then recognized each other over the radio one day flying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "My name is Valentine. I'm male and 20 and I quite enjoy playing around with anime ideas I like. Particularly at the moment Naruto is my main interest yet I have some more I quite enjoy if asked, including but not limited to Medaka Box, Hunter X Hunter, Bleach, Dragon Ball, My Hero Acadamia, Gantz, and Overlord, with ideas in mind for most. I will share three ideas from three anime, the most popular to draw in the most people.\n\nI'll start with Naruto. This will either be set post the Chunin exams in part one or in our own seperate timeline at our discretion, where or characters have been hand picked by our village's Kage for a secret mission and are teamed up. While I personally prefer the Cloud and Sand villages to be the subject of this one, we can freely choose between any.\n\nThe second is My Hero Acadamia. It will be similar to some of the more recent events in the anime where you'll get your temporary hero licence and I will play as your mentor and model hero who will oversee your hero work.\n\nThe third and final idea is my personal favorite of my Dragon Ball ideas. Being loosely based off of Xenoverse and Dragon Ball Heroes as one of us as an elite Time Patrol member and the other as a student to them. We can vary the reasons as to why.\n\nThe possibilities with this idea abound and I would love a creative and intelligent partner to complete any of these ideas or propose ones along the same lines.\n\nPlease message me privately to discuss ideas. Thank you very much for reading and I look forward for the responses I may receive. My ideas for the other animes are mostly unformed and would appreciate input. If you would kindly name your favorite anime character in your first message, I would appreciate it.\nI have a kik and a discord with no preference between either.",

Depending how this goes this can turn into NSFW which I am perfectly fine with as long as that is not what the whole story is. Please be willing and able to play more then one character as I will do the same. \n\nThe God of Chaos and destruction was created more powerful then the rest of the gods. Which caused fear even envy amongst them. A prophecy wad written, that spoke of the one who could control the God if chaos and bring him to his knees. The gods took this as the one who would destroy him. They combined there powers and tried to place them in those that they felt would be worthy but none survived the ritual. Until the god of war fell in love with an imorta l elven queen and there daughter was born. \n\nThe council of twelve convinced the God of war that his daughter would be the perfect controler to the god of Chaos. They preformed the ritual and she survived. She was raised to obey her father's wishes and taught that one day she would destroy the God if chaos. When she came of age to marry her father and mother threw a huge celebration inviting all the gods except for chaos and any potential suitors. But the God of Chaos had other plans. He had heard of the prophecy and was determined to find out who it was that was destined to destroy him. As the celebration went into full swing the God of Chaos made his appearance. \n\nAs you can see it's a little rough, I want to play out from here what could happen. You would be playing the God of Chaos, you are an aragont controlling man, what powers and what you look like is up to you. If this is something you are interested in message me for kik and we can discuss more detail. ",

If that is a big deal, feel free to stop reading here.\n\nI enjoy doing long term, romantic roleplays. I try to be as descriptive as possible, and do expect my partner to do the same. I like making up the plot of the roleplay with my partner together. Because i feel like both people should get a chance to use their imagination for a bit, and make the roleplay as fitting as possible to the both of us. But ofcours i am fine with coming up with something myself or the parner profiding a roleplay. I also make my characters fitting to the role, so i get to be creative a little bit every time. \n\nI like either realistic or fantasy roleplays, so don't worry if you you dislike one of them. Both are fine with me.\n\nI like when the roleplays to eventualy turn a little sexual (or not at all, if you prefer that), but not super fast like some people usualy want. Atleast some buildup is prefered by me. And not too much of it, else the roleplay will turn boring realy fast.\n\nAlso, i like to improve my skills as a roleplayer, or english speaker always. So if i make mistakes in spelling or grammar, please tell me. Same goes with suggestions for the roleplay, or for my overall roleplaying style. If you realy dislike the roleplay we could start another or i can try to improve it. So please don't ghost me, since i would be left wondering what i did wrong and learn nothing from it.\n\nWell if anyone is interested (or would like more information), feel free to messege me. We could roleplay on Kik or somewhere else if you prefer that. \n\nThat was quite a long text, sorry about that. But i guess you do get an idea of how descriptive i am.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Look folks, I may not be the most gramaticly correct writer, I mean hell calling myself a writer is honestly far too boastful. However I just want to say this, why is it everytime I get involved in some RP these days the breadth of the content just seems, lacking. I recall back on MSN IM, and Yahoo, back in the days of Vampire Freaks and Myspace Accounts. A time when RP was walls of beautifully, albeit poorly written text. Often the stories made no sense, but you could tell that the effort was there. The person on the other side WANTED to write something, to develop a story THEY would read, and now it seems that people want to just post short blurbs. No one leaves hooks at the end of their paragraphs for the next person to pick up on, no one seems to really \"get it\" anymore...\n\n\nI don't know, chastise me if you will, but I am just feeling a bit defeated today and wanted to vent to the only community who maybe, just maybe might understand my woes...\n\nIf you are looking for RP, hit me up. I stick to google docs these days for RP, I don't use many IM's for it, don't like posting text into a little box to later realize I made a mistake.\n",

I'm really into medieval plots lately but I've also done a lot of sci-fi roleplaying. I like to play sworn swords with dark pasts or green guards/soldiers who have to grow up quickly, maybe even a teacher-student dynamic could be fun.\n\nI prefer female characters to be strong and self-sufficient, willing to give orders and not be a damsel in distress. A character who is not afraid of her feelings and is willing to pursue her desires, somewhat of a tsundere character would be ideal, a princess who is cold to the bodyguard her father forces her to have but opens up over time, a teacher who has to be strict with her students etc.\n\nI\u2019m looking for literate partners that are willing to type at least 1-2 paragraphs per response, there may be some nsfw themes later in the story. Let me know your limits if you decide to PM me about this rp. I roleplay on discord exclusively and like to become friends with my partners. If you find this at all interesting feel free to send me a pm with a short introduction and your discord info.\n\nPreference will be given to you if you come with your own world and plot you want to try!",

I've been roleplaying for the past five years or so, mostly in fantasy/sci-themed roleplays.\n\nTwo years ago, I read the PJO/HoO series for the first time and I've been hooked ever since. While I do have some plot ideas, what we ultimately decide to go with really depends on my partner's OC. This could involve activities at camp, quests, and even worldbuilding beyond the boundaries of CHB. If romance of any kind is involved, I'd really prefer that my partner be 18+. \n\nQualities I'm looking for in a partner:\n\n\u2014Writes in 3rd person, past-tense. (Roleplayers of all experience are welcome! Whether concise in response or multi-paragraph too.)\n\n\u2014Transparency: If there's anything you'd like for me to do differently, just say the word! If you've lost interest, not a problem! After all, if both of us aren't enjoying the experience, then what's the point?\n\n\u2014Enthusiasm: I'm the kind of guy who loves to scream and fanboy about OC's/plot progression. While not mandatory, I'd love to meet someone who likes to do the same.\n\nI've already met some wonderful rpers, but I'm always willing to meet even more. If any of this interests you, feel free to shoot me a Reddit PM! Tell me a bit about yourself and your preferences as a roleplayer. If you've already got some ideas ready for OC's and/or plots as well, I'd love to hear them!\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Getting right to it, I\u2019m a female in my twenties, looking for others preferably 21+. I\u2019ve been roleplaying off and on for about ten years or so. I write in third person past tense only, I can try first person but it usually doesn\u2019t flow well for me. I write anywhere from 2 good sized paragraphs to six to eight paragraphs depending on the scene we\u2019re writing. I do expect my partner to do the same. If you send me just a couple lines, I\u2019m sorry but I just can\u2019t work with that. I roleplay solely on discord and usually won\u2019t go away from that unless we really have a strong plot planned and you just can\u2019t stand discord. Last thing about me, I keep weird hours and sleep at all different times so I need someone who is okay with waiting for responses every now and again as I do work as well.\n\nI\u2019m looking for original romance content I do not do fandoms. I\u2019m sorry, they just don\u2019t do it for me. I\u2019m looking for any kind of pairing, m/f, m/m, f/f. I have played more men than women in the past but either way I\u2019m comfortable. I am an adult so NSFW themes will present themselves. I\u2019m an adult and I use adult language when it comes to NSFW senses or smut scenes. I play male and female roles, NPC\u2019s and side characters if we need them. \n\nI would like my partner to be detailed, or at least put some sort of effort into our story. I love to plot and come up with drama to keep something going long term, I would expect you to do the same. I personally feel more comfortable writing with another woman but if we jive well, I\u2019m not opposed to writing with a man. Also, if you\u2019re going to message me, please send me a little more than a line saying, \u201chey, id love to write with you.\u201d That\u2019s great and all, but tell me some about yourself! I like to make friends with my partners but if that\u2019s not your thing, that\u2019s cool too. \n\nNow with all that being said there are a few pairings I have in mind are vampire/human, witch or warlock/ human, other supernatural beings/ human. \n\nThese are just some ideas that I like. I am more than willing to be open minded if you have a pairing or plot idea.  \n\nI hope to hear from you guys soon. \n",

            "selftext": "Heyo kiddos. I have been playing back through random Tomb Raider games, like really random, and from it\u2019s highs and lows of the game I\u2019ve gotten the itch to play against the 90\u2019s female protag. Of course this thread implements my past fandom search, so feel free to lurk that if you need to. \n\nA bit about me, I\u2019m a guy in my 30\u2019s. I have been writing for a very long time now and I believe I am rather good at it. Although I am terrible at self-revision so the errors are probably abundant. I work full time and have a busy home life, but am available pretty often and also understand people getting busy. I like to get to know my partners, at least enough to meme and joke around with. I prefer long term partners instead of short term partners, especially if I am looking on this subreddit.\n\nI write anywhere from 100 words to 3,000. It really depends on mood and what I recieved, but mostly what is necessary to get a decent post out. I am very open and will chat about any issues I foresee in the story, especially if I find myself not enjoying the rp. I like to either commit triage to the rp than ghost anyone. Or worst case, agree we\u2019re not great for one another and let the rp die. I am not adverse to confrontation, the respectful kind of course. I also like to include some &lt;NSFW&gt; elements if that interests you. \n\nSo, my Lara Croft can be any imagining you have for her. I prefer real life face claims for this, but am open to any ideas/inspirations you may have. I will be playing a modern sort of haggard Indiana Jones sort and have no problem \u2018GMing\u2019 a bunch of side characters. It can be a prequel, a sequel, whatever. I\u2019d like to not rehash any of her old stories directly, but we can use them for inspiration. We can discuss my ideas in the dm\u2019s, I don\u2019t want to wall-of-text too hard. My character would/could be a sort of ousted/ignored has-been of an archeologist turned 3rd-rate professor. Perhaps a beholder of radical theories of meso-america or something. I\u2019m not saying aliens. But\u2026 \n\nAnyhoo, I have a handful of entertaining ideas I think, at the very least, will cause an inspired conversation.\n\nOther Fandoms include the likes of Metal Gear Solid, Disgaea, Pok\u00e9mon, Digimon, Sword Art Online, Donmachi, Rezero, Another, League of Legends, Overwatch, Warcraft, whatever, name stuff. \n\nI also like original stuff. From fantasy to slice of life. Not super into scifi at the moment. Or the punk iterations. But I like character drama, so long as it leads to something. Please come to me with ideas in mind as well, not just character profiles. Why does everyone send me character profiles. They do Nothing for me. I prefer to hear about your character from you and our conversations as well as in the actual RP. Finding out about every trauma and focus of your character on a single sheet of paper makes me feel like they're just as flat as that sheet of paper.\n\nPlease be mature and able to talk and aren\u2019t afraid of the internet. I am respectful, but will clearly state, bluntly, my thoughts. Hope you will too. Also if you need samples, just ask, or check my profile. If you have a sample or two of your writing, I\u2019d love to see that too, but it\u2019s not required.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, light up my PM\u2019s here. I like to make a disco-server for rp\u2019s, so please have discord.",

            "selftext": "Obviously I'm looking for a certain type of folks who have interest in planes, air traffic controllers, pilots, flight attendants, etc. I'm an aviation nerd myself and so these ideas popped in my mind. If you are an aviation nerd but want to sort of escape that world then I'm certainly up for doing a different kind of role play! I have a few more ideas on my profile, or I'm open to other suggestions. All of the ones below are more bent on romance. Lets just say that I'm currently continuing to look for writing partners to kill time when I'm not working to keep my mind off of other things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The ATC/Tower Controller and Pilot**\n\nI know that things have to be kept mostly professional on the radio, but maybe somehow an attraction or romance develops between a controller and a pilot (either private or commercial). What starts on the radio could then transition to the diner at the local airport, or they could just happen to run into each other around the airport and recognize each other's voice. It could be the other way around where they were at a bar and met, but then recognized each other over the radio one day flying. Lastly maybe the controller helped out a pilot in a tough spot and the whole \"traumatic events bring you closer together\" thing happens between the pair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pilot/Pilot, Pilot/Flight Attendant, Flight Attendant/Flight Attendant**\n\nThis one is the typical idea of romance developing in the skies. Maybe there is some truth to it, maybe their isn't (if you are a real Pilot or FA and have some stories we could base this on I'm all for it!). Spending that much time together and especially having overnights in various cities gives plenty of opportunity for something to develop. There really isn't much more to say on this one. There could be elements of infidelity and also more wild things with this one, some non regulation shenanigans going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Passenger/FA or Passenger/Passenger**\n\nMaybe think the movie the Terminal with this one. Passenger feels like they are living in an airport, maybe a business traveler. Away from home a lot and looking for a friend or connection. They always seem to end up on the same planes with the same people and it becomes a family or becomes more of a romantic relationship. Just like the first idea this could be more where they meet out and about while the crew or passengers are exploring the city but then they end up on the same plane together or in seats next to one another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a lot of variations here. I was just looking for something with more of an aviation setting. As an added bonus if you are a pilot, ATC, or FA I'd enjoy the RP even more because we could chat about real life experiences while we write out fictional ones. Hope to hear from someone! ",

            "selftext": "Alrightly then before we get down to business I'll talk about myself for a little. So I am good and have experience at roleplaying, maybe 5 or 4 years? I don't know. I do 2-4 and 4-7 lines as my preferment and comfortable to put in. I can add more paragraph and detail in any kinds of situation I'm in so really I'm just a varies type of guy, so. I always love playing first person, but second and third person is acceptable for me to play in and I'm alright with one-shot and short term for the roleplay and I've always play my main character for roleplaying\n\nNow that you know a little about me. Let's get down to business\n\nBut wait before you message me you'll ask this \"Are there any requirement?\" Hell no! Just as long you message me in discord or here that's good!\n\nWhile I am seeking rp partners to play the character I'm giving to them, unless you got a roleplay idea. Here's an interesting roleplay scene list (There will be a spoiler for games, tv shows, and movies. So I'll try my best not to spoiler them much)\n\n1: [Choose your own adventure]: Ahh yes. The only thing I've always love to do, build the world, plot twist, doesn't go as plan, free choices, use NPC, build new characters, daily life, anything. Roleplay in school, job place, military, bar, Pokemon, my little pony, fantasy, wow (I don't a lot of things about wow &gt;.&gt;) being a bandit, dark lord, angel, demon, slave, king, emperor. Anything to build and that is what I always love to do\n\n2: [Undertale or Underfell: Character: Toriel]\nWhat if you stay in your room and do nothing: Now if you really didnt do nothing and she just destroys that door does she really has plans? Does she really know how to get food, water, medical and other stuff? Does she really know a way out? Or maybe she has a secret that she'll never tell a thing...we're gonna have to find out\n\n3: [Fallout: Character: Female Deathclaw]\nThe last deathclaw with intelligence brian (or not whatever you prefer): You ever wonder how many deathclaws are out there waiting for their preys? 5, 8, 3, 2, 10? Or just one left? But who knows where that deathclaw is. Maybe trying to find a mate, a lover, a nice home or a tribe to grow...Well  is not too late to go and find her out in the wasteland\n\n4: [Fallout: Species: Any kinds requirement: The female body shape T-60 power armor]\nSo you are a soldier, civilian, doctor, robber or bandit and you steal the new special power armor that was only meant for someone else. You use it for destroying your enemies, use it for fun, use it to act as a guardian, use it for good and what it's right or use it to keep it for yourself and hide it. It was so special that any kinds of the new feature will be a good surprise for anyone to use it or jump on it. I'll tell you more for what I'm talking about\n\n\nGuess that's about it, for now, may add more to it later. But hope you're interested for those idea and come to roleplay with me. I'm friendly by the way and add me in discord name Kian#7247 and we can talk about our kinks and other stuff to talk about, till now. I'll see you once you approach me\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Nyx. I'll tell you more about myself later, but I'm sure you're wondering what this project is about, so I'll show you now :)\n\n**The Potterverse Network**\n\nAs the name suggests, it's a network of roleplay servers all set in the same world, but divided by location (or plot). The Potterverse aims to provide an expansive world for all to explore; in short, the goal is to offer servers for everything from Hogwarts to America and even smaller campaigns.\n\nA website prototype is already in the works, and this will act as the base of operations and wiki. It will include a server-wide calendar, a summary of everything happening in the roleplays and guides for getting started. Currently, the plan is to start with an adventure campaign (something Auror related), two schools (Hogwarts and Ilvermorny), and their respective locations; meaning, wizarding America and the London/Scotland area. Each with their own servers, they'll offer their own main plots and plenty of ways to get involved.\n\nBut this is a lot of work, and something one cannot do alone. This is where YOU come in! Are you interested in moderating? Coordinating epic plots for the players? Contributing to and writing how the world works? If none of that interests you, or it sounds like a lot of time you don't have, don't worry; your contribution doesn't have to be as grand -- in fact, it can be anything! Suggest and discuss ideas, test the website, or even just sit back and wait for the server to open; the choice is yours, and everything is appreciated.\n\nSo, are you intrigued? Keep reading to find out more, and how you can get involved.\n\n**A Quick Rundown**\n\n* Everything is set in the present day Harry Potter universe. Cursed Child does not exist, and Harry Potter lives happily ever after\n* Everything is connected, meaning the servers are part of a whole. The death of a character in one server carries over to the rest\n* The Potterverse Network is multiple servers because fitting everything into a single server would get too overwhelming\n* We offer something for everyone to explore, no matter their RP style\n* Work is already being started, including a website prototype\n* Multiple characters can be created, meaning you can roleplay different characters in each server\n\n**What We Need**\n\nWe primarily need the following:\n\n* active, or semi-active writers interested in coordinating plots and writing world lore and technical information (this means rules, descriptions, and ads)\n* moderators\n* people to offer feedback and suggest ideas\n\n**Getting Involved**\n\nSo you want to contribute -- that's great! As of now, there is no application and everyone is welcome, so long as you're respectful and write well. Feel free to DM me your Discord tag and an introduction to you (prompt below). Once I read your DM, I'll shoot a friend request on Discord your way and invite you to the Discord server. This server is not a roleplay, it's a place to discuss the server with your fellow contributors (of course, friendly chat is okay c:).\n\nIntroduction Prompt\n\nName:\n\nAge:\n\nRP and Writing Experience:\n\n**Closing Notes**\n\nIf you're interested in roleplaying on the servers but not contributing, feel free to DM me and ask to be notified when we're ready to open; this can include your Discord tag, or I can just shoot you a message through Reddit. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to GM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have.\n\n**I want you to be the GM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\n\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, please shoot me a message.\n\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\n\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.\n\n\n**Touhou**\n\nWould love an RP set in the wonderful world of Gensokyo! I was thinking my character would be from the Outside World who ends up in Gensokyo during the start of the RP or beforehand. From there, he'd slowly start to explore the world and meet the various characters in it. Maybe there's an incident going on, or maybe he's in Gensokyo during the events of one of the games. In any case, this is one we could definitely discuss further.\n\n**Marvel**\n\nRecently got around to watching the MCU films and have been pretty interested in an RP related to Marvel. Doesn't necessarily have to be set in the MCU, and I'd probably actually prefer an alternate Universe so we have a bit more free-reign with what we want to do with the characters and world. I was thinking that the RP would begin with an origin story for my character, with him either facing a canonical villain or an original character. After that point, the Universe could open up and include more of the heroes from Marvel. It doesn't necessarily have to immediately go into something like the Avengers where everyone comes together to fight a big threat, but maybe the heroes could be slowly introduced one at a time into the story.\n\nI do have a few ideas as to potential powers for my character that we can discuss. But if you'd prefer, I'm also open to my character being an apprentice to a pre-existing hero and having similar abilities/equipment to them. Whatever would work best for you and the story would work best for me.\n",

I've been writing stories for as long as I can remember but I've only been roleplaying since I was thirteen or so. I started out on roleplaygateway and have used Facebook (but Facebook is rather cancerous for roleplaying.)\n\nI'm completely literate other than the occasional mistake here and there. I write in third person, past-tense mainly. I play mainly as a heterosexual female.\n\nI love apocalyptic plots, historical plots, and romance. I'm not necessarily in any fandoms but I play Skyrim religiously. \n\nLet me know if you think I'd be a good fit somewhere! ",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, i'm new to this subreddit. But i've been debating this for a long time. And it has gotten to a point where i kinda have to do this, but i'm looking for more active Roleplayers on my discord server (Sylvalia). I've previously owned a 100+ members Discord Roleplaying server. And although most of the activity has dwindled there due to me basically closing it down cause i wanted change. And the way it was handled was to old. I still wan't the new server to experience the Roleplaying that used to happen. But with the people we have now there's simply not enough active members to really continue much.\n\nThe server is:\n-Plural friendly, as the owner (me) is Plural\n-Still under construction, So expect change. We listen to the community and love to listen to your feed-back to improve our ways.\n-Lead by teens. So keep that in mind.\n\nI don't know what our demographic really would be, but most likely between the 13 to 18, but older is allowed to of course. If you don't mind Roleplaying with youngins that is :P\n\nIt hardly ever gets erotic. So that's a plus, unless your into those kinds of things. We don't judge.\n\nI hope to see you on Sylvalia!\n-Rose (The owner)\nLink: https://discord.gg/gbcmGuN",

            "selftext": "Greetings, all. My name is Ash, I\u2019m 20 years old, and I\u2019ve been in the roleplaying game for about seven years. What I\u2019m looking for is pretty simple. Over the years I\u2019ve had very few roleplaying partners who haven\u2019t eventually flaked out on me. So I\u2019m looking for a partner, maybe a few partners, who would be willing to stick it out with me. I\u2019m involved in a number of fandoms and am interested in making a roleplay on most of them (listed below), but I\u2019d be up for making a more original story, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. If there\u2019s a fandom you\u2019re interested in that\u2019s not on this list, feel free to ask me about it. I might be up for roleplaying it. I just want to roleplay with someone. \n\nFandoms:\n\nRWBY\n\nRed vs. Blue\n\nFairy Tail\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nThe Fate series\n\n\nWriting stuffs -\nI write exclusively in past-tense, third-person limited, with proper grammar and punctuation. I\u2019d prefer you write in this style as well, as I think it makes the story flow better. I\u2019m very literate and I would prefer a partner who is more ore less the same. If you are interested, I would like a sample of your writing, just to make sure it\u2019s alright for me. As for post length, I tend to write somewhere between two sentences and two paragraphs, usually matching the length of my partner\u2019s posts. I\u2019d be glad to provide a sample of my own writing, if you wanted. \n\nCharacter stuffs -\nAs indicated in the title of this post, I\u2019m seeking someone who will play female characters. I can play either male or female, but I prefer to play male characters. I don\u2019t particularly care if you play canon characters or original characters, but I prefer to play OC\u2019s myself. If you go with an OC, I will ask for a character sheet of sorts, with a description of their appearance, personality, and bio. Nothing too detailed is needed, I just want to get to know your character. \n\nGenre stuffs -\nI prefer to write romance stories. Plain and simple. I\u2019ll do other genres, but I\u2019d like for them to have elements of romance worked in. I also like to have a bit of smut, which is while I\u2019ll label this post as NSFW. I don\u2019t typically go into exacting detail, but I prefer to play it out than \u2018fade-to-black\u2019. If you\u2019re interested, please give me a list of your limits so I don\u2019t step on any toes. \n\nOther stuffs - \nAs I indicated in the title of the post, I prefer to roleplay on Discord. It doesn\u2019t matter to me if it\u2019s in dms or on a server. If Discord isn\u2019t your thing, never fear. I\u2019m pretty flexible. I\u2019ll just let you know that I\u2019m a college student with a part-time job, so my schedule is a little weird. I try to get in as much rp as I can throughout the day, and I try to let my partner know when I\u2019m about to get busy. If you need to know more about my schedule, I\u2019m willing to provide. \n\nConclusion - \nThat wraps it up. If you\u2019ve made it this far, congratulations. Please give me a pm or a message of some kind, and say \u2018Mistborn.\u2019 Just so I know you read this whole thing. Thank you!\n\nEdit: Posting this again cuz all my partners disappeared on me. ",

            "selftext": "Name:James\n\nEmail: reindeerprince@gmail(.)com\n\nWhat you RP: Lots of things... historical,slice of life, modern, omegaverse, pregnancy, ROMANCE. \nCharacters you RP: Original characters. Male mains, secondary characters of any gender.\n\nCharacters you\u2019re looking to interact with: Usually looking for a romantic partner, prefer a female partner but am open to other genders, depending on the plot. I also will do plots with gay-trans guys, I really enjoy those.\n\nFandoms: Life is Strange, Marvel (OCs or not), AHS (Season 1 or 3), many, many more.\n\nDo you smut?: yes.\n\nWant a partner that is 18+, since I'm definitely over 18.\n\nContact me through email if you want to rp!\n\n\nSOME PLOTS:\n\nBest Friends:  That seems like it would be fun, jumping from story to story as two best friends fall for each other.\n\nOnline: Our characters are YouTube famous, making videos and those Benjamins. So they have to deal with that unique brand of fame and a budding relationship.\n\nKnocked Up: again, it explains itself. Two people have an unplanned pregnancy. It could be two friends, two strangers, the world is open. Or maybe she's pregnant by a guy who is no longer around but is vibing with someone else, which could add more drama. Could be combined with the best friends plot.\n\nRelated to the above: not quite accidental pregnancy. A single man decides to hire a surrogate so he can have an heir. Feelings crop up, shenanagins ensue. And of course, the RP continues after the kid is born. I am super into this one right now for some reason.\n\nArranged Marriage: Can take place in modern day or a historical setting. For the modern day, it could be a business deal on the parent's end that includes a wedding of some sort. As for a historical setting, it could be a few things. Maybe it is how they end a war. Or it is a business deal of some sort. For those two or something similar, I like the idea of them sniping, having hate sex, generally being snippy and then, thing progress and they learn to work together. \n\nInspired by Stranger Things/Twin Peaks/Riverdale: A Bad Thing (to be thought up by us) happens and upheaves a small town or suburb. Our characters try to navigate the aftermath and figure things out. Can be supernatural or not.\n\nThere are some relationship dynamics I would like to explore: hate to love, age gaps (older man, younger woman, up to 15 years), best friends falling for each other, werewolves or werewolf/human, vampire/human, artist and their muse, opposites attract, boss/employee, co-workers or partners.\n",

            "selftext": "This is my first foray in this sub, please be gentle!\n\n-----\nEven though Christmas already passed, it seemed as if the cold weather decided it wanted to hang around for just a little bit longer. It too every bit of willpower from me to not stay home that day, my warm, soft bed crying out to me to keep it company. As I drove to work, a little jingle came on. It didn't sound anything like the generic advertisements you hear these days, this was actually catchy and clever, with some real music, a remnant of my childhood, just as that advertisement itself was a remnant of a holiday season already passed.\n\nThis one seemed to provoke an especially strong sense of nostalgia in me, but I couldn't place why. Only about halfway through did the gears in my brain grind enough to bring some of the memories to the front. Images of you and I exchanging gifts with each other at Christmas time, promising that we would get something for each other just in case Santa deemed us to have been naughty that year, while that advertisement played on the radio in the background. Running out of school excitedly on the last day, our minds looking forward to all the time we had to play during the holidays, without a care in the world, and play we did.\n\nWe were inseparable, as we always had been, ever since the day that you said 'hi' to me, and we swiftly became best friends. Every birthday it was a given that we would cut our cake with each other, every afternoon we would play together until one of our parents told us it was time to come inside. Every childhood incident we went through together, the first time you fell off your bike and bruised your knee, then I had to support you for the walk home even though it was a small bruise, when I climbed the fruit tree to pick something for you, even though you told me not to, and then fell off and fractured my collarbone and it was your turn to get help for me. *Didn't we even one promise that we would marry each other, when we learned what marriage actually was, so that we could play together forever?*\n\nWe made enough memories to last a lifetime, and we looked forward to making even more that Christmas. Little did we know that it would be the last one we would spend together.\n\nThe news came suddenly, on New years morning when I woke up and asked my mother what time she could drive me to your house. We were moving away. My brain couldn't process why, why did we have to leave? I liked our house, I liked our school. All of that paled in comparison to when I asked the most important question of all, if you would be coming with us. When my mother uttered that 'no', I was crushed. I ran off crying to my room, the first time I shed a tear since the fracture. You couldn't understand it either, and you cried just as much as I did when I told you the news. Every moment we spent together from then on seemed to matter more than the last, as we both knew they were coming to an end. As the sun set on our last day together, we made that solemn pinky promise that we would never forget each other, and that we would always be best friends forever.\n\nAll those memories, brought flooding back by a single commercial. How could I forget you? Every January I should have remembered you, as that was when we made our promise, yet I allowed the last twenty years to erode the oath we both took. My best friend in the whole world, the first companionship I ever knew. No one who came after you ever came even close to the bond that we shared.\n\n*I wonder if I'll ever see her again?*\n\n-----\nSo that was a bit wordy, and if you made it to the end then thank you for your attention. I initially posted this on DPP, but seeing as this is pretty much entirely a romance based idea, I thought it might have a place in this sub as well. I'm looking for a partner to play the female half of this pairing. We manage to find our way back into each other's lives after all these years, and discover just how much the other has developed. While it is a bit awkward at first, upon catching up with each other we realise that even though time has changed us, we still mix together as easily as salt and water. Not just in terms of friendship, but we figure that there's something more budding there? Could we be soulmates as well?\n\nThat's the general premise behind this, the romance that develops between the both of us was reconnect and try to make up for the lost years. I would prefer to discuss the specifics of this with my partner rather than just tossing ideas out here. I'm thinking that both our characters will be in their mid twenties for this.\n\nObviously this isn't something that can be rushed, so I'm looking for a partner willing to take their time and really flesh out our characters, and how they interact with the world around them.\n\nIf this post interests you, then send me a message telling me your thoughts, and any ideas that you have for the scene, and we can discuss what needs to be discussed together. Take your time with the message, I'm not going anywhere, and neither is this post.",

            "selftext": "You have never known your mother. Dad often spoke of her with a dreamy air in his voice. A 'great and beautiful woman'. It was becoming difficult to continue believing that. She had to have been around for your birth of course, but as soon as you turned two she left you, as dad explains, and returned to her homeland far to the West\u00a0 The Spirit Valley, otherwise known as Elinia. Dad had made her out to be some kind of incredible and all poweful witch who was needed by her clan, she had a great duty to fulfill and leaving the sleepy island town you had spent your entire life on, leaving you, was a small sacrifice in the name of the greater good. \n\nAnd still, it would be difficult not to resent her. A childhood that had been stripped away before you even knew it. Dad had attempted to raise you on his own. A doctor by trade, a pleasant man well respected by loyal patients within town. But a doctor has alot of work, and despite his best attempts for the most part you were left to your own devices. There wasn't much to do on the island nation of Hanstrasia. It was populous enough not be a wasteland, busy enough so that one could work as any job they wished as long as they were qualified. But nothing seemed to happen. One would go through school, attend college, get a job, find a partner, get married... It was a simple stable uneventful existence. And that was how you always thought it would be. \n\nUntil you received the letter. A request to meet, sent from your mother, who signed the brief document by the name Cecile Vengi. It was the first time you had experienced her actions directly. After much debate, and encouragement from dad who didn't seem to mind Cecile had changed her last name, you decided to rent passage on a merchant airship to the mainland and travel to the Spirit Valley, the famous, but distant pilgrimage site. The homeland of witches. \n\nAs soon as you left your boring, but safe island, things starting going wrong. The crew who maintained the airship proved to be lazy and uncooperative with you. The 'War of the Lions' between the great democratic Northern Federation and zealous Southern Empire had spread to the Eastern mainland and the fear of winding up in the hands of the fanatically religious Empire had gripped the crew into paranoia and anxiety.\n\nTo make matters even worse, you had just been boarded by aeropirates. Or at least, you thought you had. rustling and shouting from up deck in a foreign, unfamiliar tongue echoed through the steel corridors of the airship and it had slowed to merely floating sluggishly within the aether. out the port hole window you could see a small, streamlined black vessel, its float dust vents emitting a slight purple haze. A triplet of winch harpoons preventing any hope of your merchant ship from breaking away, and even then it would be impossible to outrun the pirate vessel.\n\nLeft alone in the sky, nothing but the open ocean serval thousand feet beneath you, the world seemed totally silent for a brief moment. Then the unmistakable sound of footsteps crept faintly from behind your cabins door.\n\n-\n\nThat was a brief starter to the roleplay I wish to write with you! The setting is a fantasy post industrial world, similar to diesel punk. Magic fights side by side with machine guns. Radios exist, but computers do not. Expect a level of 1940s technology.\n\nI will roleplay in third person, acting in a GM role, while you would play as the protagonist. Ideally I'd get you to role play in first person, I think the personal insight of the protagonist gain provide tremendous depth and make you really get to love building your character, but if it that seems like poison we can try having both of us write in third.\n\nI'd like a bit of detail, not so much that it's padding, but enough so that we can excercise our abilities as amateur writers. I normally write two or three paragraphs a reply.\n\n18+ please, just because if something adult does come up I don't want to feel guilty. Just tell me you're 18 if you're not and we will be golden. \nI role play on Discord and Kik.\n\nI'm a college student, and will be able to reply at least once or twice a day, on some days alot more, on others not at all. I will tell you whenever I can if I will be busy too busy to reply.\n\nIf you have any questions please ask away in the comments. \n\nIf you didnt like the prompt please tell me why! Love me some criticism.\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "So, just like the title says. I've tried to do Steven Universe in the past and I've had mixed results. I've had a couple good roleplays and a couple bad ones, and a couple people that'll plan and then just disappear. I used to love the show and my girlfriend of many years and I would role-play it every so often, but that's neither here nor there so I'll leave it at that. The other day my friends were watching it and I felt like trying my hand at it one more time. I have an original character I want to use, and her history is a bit of a mess but the straight and narrow is she's been looking for Rose for a long time and doesn't know what happened to her. So when she finds the gang, it's gonna be a lot to take in. I think I've droned on long enough, anything more, just feel free to ask. Sorry if the post is pretty lackluster.\n\nThe temple had been especially quiet that day, with Pearl only coming out of her room for a short while to look out at the ocean. As if on cue, when she grabbed the handle to the door, the warp pad came to life and only produced a very dusty Steven. He spat a bit out of sand out of his mouth and rubbed his eyes, then caught sight of Pearl at last and let out a gasp. \n\n\"Pearl! There's something I have to tell you!\" He leapt off the warp pad and went over to her, shaking some of the dust out of his hair. \"I was just in this place, it was really dusty and kinda cold. But that's beside the point, I saw another gem there!\"\n\n\"What? Where was this place? What did she look like? Did she try to attack you? Did she even notice you?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly where it was, but when I was there, it felt really calm and kinda quiet, like it had been abandoned. I didn't get very far into it, but I heard someone talking and when I followed the voice, I saw her sitting against the wall.\"\n\n\"Alright, what did she look like? Was there anyone else around or was it just her?\"\n\n\"It was just her, but it sounded like she was having a conversation with herself. I think she was a fusion, maybe.\"\n\nPearl let out a sigh and crossed her arms, pressing her fingers against one of her temples. \"Steven, I know you were trying to help, but you could've been really hurt. You should've just turned away and left.\"\n\n\"Believe me, I know. But she looked kinda hurt and she wasn't moving a whole lot. I don't know how, but she found where I was hiding and when I went out, she just asked me what I was doing there. I told her I was just exploring and she told me to leave before I got hurt. Then the whole place started to shake and that's why I was so dusty just now.\"\n\nPearl took her hand off the side of her face and looked down at him again.\n\n\"It kinda caught me off guard and I went to step back, then tripped on something and fell. And when I did, the whole roof collapsed!\"\n\nPearl's expression grew even more worried. \"Steven--\"\n\n\"But then she suddenly just got up and ran to where I was, it was like from us to the warp pad! She just crossed it like nothing, and then she held up everything!\" At this point, he had stars in his eyes.\n\n\"Everything?\"\n\n\"Yeah! The whole thing came down on top of us, but she was holding it up on her own!\"\n\n\"Well, I know Garnet can hold up quite a bit, but you make it sound like quite a lot.\"\n\n\"She was almost sitting down, but she was still holding it. I tried to help with my bubble, but she just yelled at me to run, so I ran and got back to the warp pad, but...\"\n\nPearl knelt down in front of him and tilted up his head with one hand. \"But what, Steven?\"\n\n\"I...don't think she made it out. When I looked back, she was in the same spot, but the roof was getting down pretty low. I tried to tell her to come with me, but she wouldn't, so I had to leave...\" He looked off to the side and held his hands together. \"It didn't feel right leaving her behind, it didn't look like she was in any shape to even walk and then she did all that...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Steven. I'm sure you did all you could to help her.\"\n\n\"Pearl, I feel like I've seen her before. But not me, it's hard to explain...but I want to go back and look for her. She needed help and I only made things worse.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, you did all you could. If she's as strong as you make it sound, I'm sure she'll be alright. But I'll talk to Garnet about it and see if we can't get back there to try and help her.\"\n\n\"Thanks Pearl. I hope we can find her...\"\n\nHe went by her and out onto the beach, ultimately toward the town. The lanky gem sighed again and crossed her arms and went back to the magic door, going into her room again.",

            "selftext": "First off, all characters that I want to roleplay are going to be 18+. I have to make that super clear before I continue.\n\nSo I am looking for a female partner to dive into the world of college sororities and fraternities. So you should have a little bit of background on those topics to roleplay with me but if you don\u2019t just ask! We can do a little crash course.\n\nI want this to be set at a massive American university where the Greek System of Sororities and Fraternities dominates campus. The drama between groups, the process to get into the groups the days-in-days-out functions of the organizations.\n\nWe have so many options from the top sorority full of the prettiest girls on campus to the sorority know for the girls that always are down for fun, to the fraternity full of athletes, the one full of nerds, the frat known for drug-use.\n\nOne role I had in mind\u2026 you play a freshman girl coming onto campus. She\u2019s a legacy in the top sorority meaning that her mom was in that sorority when she went to college. I play the president of the top fraternity on campus. First off, pledges aren\u2019t supposed to date anyone in a greek group.. Second off, my character might he dating the president of your sorority! Imagine the drama as our characters get to know each other!\n\nThat\u2019s just one idea. We can discuss more options. This is clearly going to be long-term. I can chat on here or on Discord. Let me know!\n\nI have years and years of playing experience. I look for longer posts to get us started and then typically do paragraph responses as we get into the play.\n\nThe way I see it, details are what matter most here. Since we can't physically see or touch one another, I need to be able to feel you through your writing - and you'll certainly feel the same from me.\n\nI hope you message me back letting me know you are interested. We need to talk about a few things in this role before we get going. I love using photographs for faceclaims, outfits, settings, etc.\n\nHope to hear from you soon! Xx Daniel",
