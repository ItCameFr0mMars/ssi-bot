A couple things you should know, I have eleven years of roleplaying experience and am in my twenties! I also prefer things to remain consistent, that doesn't mean I want a reply every day but if you're going to disappear for awhile I do like to be in the know, especially so I don't assume you ghosted.\n\nNow what I have in mind is a Pokemon journey with darker themes, more mature if you will. NSFW would be preferred, of course whenever NSFW is involved all characters involved will be over 18! That is not solely what I'm looking for though, I know wanting that can mean many things... but I want both that and plot!\n\nThe region doesn't really matter much to me, we can choose whatever region you feel like.\n\nPost length is also not an issue, I'll match with your own!\n\nWhen it comes to crossovers, I don't mind in the slightest though I prefer simply adding characters from other fandoms.\n\nPlatform of choice, I honestly prefer here or on Discord. Whatever works for you!\n\nI feel like I'm forgetting something but I think that is everything needed to be said. If you're interested or have any questions, feel free to send me a message!",

            "selftext": "  \n\nTokugawa Industrial had turned Tokyo into a hellscape of factories and business arcologies. RayLeonard Solutions had rendered Rio De Janeiro an imperial palace, complete with shining silver castle corporate aristocracy surrounded by unknown millions of shanty town peasants. Calcifer Pharmaceuticals had found Cape Town ready and waiting for a new overlord and reduced the city to nothing but a mindless clockwork automaton of schedules and stagnancy. Almost every major city in the world had found itself under the boot of one corporation or another, nothing but another subsidiary, another asset for an empire of the mind. As the world crumbled to dust and war in the latter half of the twenty third century these organisations became the new normal, the only source of somewhat agreeable order left in a world gone mad. Only New Seoul remained as a great independent city, a grin on its beautiful synthetic face, one hand gripping the throttle, the other with an empty bottle of Soju. One last ride! Only New Seoul remained...\n\nNew Seoul was a roller coaster. New Seoul was a playground. Always disjointed between night and day. Always the gallery for the great invisible war. Fever dream day times of clear blue skies reflected against valleys of shimmering steel and glass. Kaleidoscopic night times of burning neon, screaming aero-cars, distant gunfire the continuous lullaby for the next generation of citizens. A city of fraying threads hopelessly knitted together by an uneasy co-operation of corporate Guarde companies, loyal only to their masters in their skyscraper palaces, and a constantly shrinking police department, resorting to unrestrained full lethal violence more and more often. An illusion of control that one could buy into like a drug, a lie of security and order that allowed someone to try and forget the endless gang wars, the sprawling grey markets, the government by assassination, the growing militarisation of the police. The last great bastion of organised anarchy, where anyone with grit and a handgun could become a king. While the richest of the rich built new-style chateaux atop mountain like mega-towers, singing songs and drinking wine, the poorest of the poor ran mag-bike races across miles of vertical slums, betting not on hopeful victors but potential victims of the lethal break neck motor sport. Where people with unknowable names needed people with unconcerned moral codes to perform unspeakable acts and would pay undisclosed riches left by unassuming couriers. Where the position of crime lord and chief corporate officer where separated by nothing but the absence of small pieces of led inserted violently and forcefully in between the right persons eyes. Where individuality was a dying art, where rebellion was a nine to five day job, where spies and terrorists would laugh about their victories while rubbing shoulders with their victims in clubs and bars. \n\nWithin the madness, within the freedom, was you. A young woman new to the city, with only faint rumours like these ever reaching your ears. Perhaps a student chasing the legacy of the still great Korean education system. Perhaps a new employee of the one of the great corporations with fire in your heart and not enough money in your pocket. Perhaps an exiled ganger fleeing after your adoptive family of hoodlums where all but wiped out by a corporate raid. Perhaps an ace EisenRauser mech pilot, fresh out of combat school, ready to make a name for yourself as a mercenary on the frontiers of civilisation.\n\nA woman with the opportunity to take the world In the palm of her hand. To carve your own place in the most volatile city left in the still civilised world. \n\nNew Seoul is your roller coaster. New Seoul is your playground.\n\n\\-\n\nIf you want to roleplay, give me a PM. I only use Discord. 18+. Long term roleplay. Women roleplayers only, simply because that's a personal preference. Call me sexist if it makes you feel better. No hard feelings if you ghost. We all do it, we have to make an effort to maintain each others attention.",

I was hoping to find someone that is willing to DM an adventure for me using the dungeons and deviants setup. If you don't know what it is or are interested, PM me and we can talk more. Just to be clear, I am looking for someone to GM for me, I had issues with that with my last post.I use discord and kik for roleplaying, although I tend to prefer discord.

            "selftext": "Hi! I'm looking for a long-term dedicated partner in a romantic plot. I'd also like a partner who likes headcanons and talking ooc, since I believe communication between partners is important. I have discord, I would like my partner does too.\n\n* Good spelling and grammar is a must. Third person, quality over quantity but I like to write long paras along with short paras.\n* I do write mature themes but I'm happy to keep it PG-13 if you're not comfortable with it, fade to black works as well. I only ask my partner to be 18+ since I'm 21+ and I wouldn't feel comfortable.\n* I don't have triggers, but there are a few things I'm not comfortable with, so as long as we discuss them before doing anything, we're fine.\n* I can be as active as I can, but rl comes first. I normally try to reply at least twice every day, some days even more.\n* I\u2019m open to all the ideas and suggestions for the plot, I love talking and deciding what to do together. Any line can be AU, after canon, before canon, anything goes as we can plot it out together.\n* I love fluff just as much as I love angst, so a nice combination of both would be great.\n* I get super excited about my plots, so I always end up making moodboards, manips, gifsets, graphics, and even playlists.\n\n**Goblin:** This can either be OCs, OCxCanon or CanonxCanon. Perhaps Ji Eun Tak/Kim Shin, or OC/Kim Shin, or OCxOC. There is just a lot to play with, rewrites, AUs or post-finale.\n\n**The Greatest Marriage:** I know this isn't a very popular kdrama, but it's on Netflix and tbh I loved it. I'm looking for somoene to write Park Tae Yeon against my Cha Ki Young in a rewrite/AU. We can start from the begnning or when she finds out she's pregnant. I'm open to discuss it and decide together.\n\n**Blood:** I fell so in love with this drama, but the ending let me wanting more. I want a Park Ji Sang for Yoo Ri Ta. I'm thinking a rewrite could be fun, but I'm also open to something after the ending.\n\n**Descendants of the Sun:** I would absolutely love a Yoo Si Jin for my Kang Mo Yeon in a post finale plot, but I'm also open to any kind of AU.\n\n**If interested, feel free to message me via PM!**\n\n *\\*I'm looking for active partners, please don't message me if you're not in for a long-term.* ",

RP... so bear with me here.\n\n\nThe year is 2019, a comet recently grazed our sun a little too cloely and a fragment of it cracked off, falling into the sun, when that fragment imploded it sent a wave of a isotopic radiation through space, and when it eventually hit earth, it affect a number of particular type of genetic strands altering them and the generations of that family forever.\n\nI was 20 when the wave hit earth, and from that day, my life changed, orginally i thought i was going crazy, but when you can basically create lightning bolts from your hands, through some ancient runic ring around your hand that looks like some doctor strange shit, and blackout half your neighbourhood, you get the reality check pretty quickly.\n\nEveryone was affected in a different way, certain genomes got certain elements, according to stats on online forums...lightining was a rare one, so rare no one believed me when i said i had that element.\n\nI wish it were still those days... before the Invictus Act was put in place... all Hyper-Elemental Humanoids were deemed a danger to global safety... and were ordered to hand themselves in for detainment.\n\nBetween you and me, the Minister Of Global Affairs probably watches too much X-Men.\n\nKnowing that word would spread, and people would talk, i decided to vanish, left my family and friends, and disappeared into the desert plains of Australia, a country id lived in all my life, if anyone knew how to disappear out here, and still live...it was me.\n\nThat was 5 years ago... today, i was at my camp, when i came across a letter slotted in my Helemt on my motorcycle... i hadnt had any contact with the outside world since i disappeared, but somehow, you had found me... you called yourself the Leader Of The New Dawn... some kind of resistance... hearing a branch snap behind me... it was clear that you werent the only one able to track me down after 5 years.\n\n****\n\nApolgies for my slapstick comedy, it sounds funny in my head, but aside from that, if you found this interesting, and heck would be interested in giving this a go, feel free to give me a DM.\n\nI RP via: Kik, Discord &amp; Reddit",

Although I have nothing against Reddit, Kik, or emailing, I've found that servers on Discord work best ... so, yeah. Discord.\n\nAlthough I have a few prompts in mind, I don't want to share them just yet. Why? I don't want to squash, or override, any ideas that you might have. Believe it or not, your ideas may even be better than my own. Besides, I don't know about you, but I've found that my favorite role-plays have been formed through a strong world building session with my partner.\n\nHowever, what I am going to share, are some of the things I would enjoy role-playing:\n\n* Fantasy\n* Science Fiction\n* Fandoms\n   * Harry Potter\n   * Star Wars\n\nLast but not least, I am over 18, so I am open to romance and NSFW content as long as there's a build up. I don't like jumping right in, as I've found that takes a lot of the fun away.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon!\n\nLove,\n\nThe Nerd",

            "selftext": "Hello, Roleplayers!  \nI'm a long time roleplayer across many different communities. Pokemon is at the heart of the roleplays I love best. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI adore Pokemon, and I adore Roleplaying. So what I am offering is to DM a small Pokemon Nuzlocke roleplay which is set in the Unova region. The roleplay will happen on Discord and when we need to battle we will use Pokemon Showdown. This will be at most me plus three other players.  \n\n\nAnyway, the story is full of mysteries to figure out and will hopefully offer a genuine experience of becoming a Pokemon trainer.   \n\n\n This takes place in the well-known world of Pokemon. In the Unova region to be exact, around the time of the original Black and White games.   For the past month, an outbreak of a horrifying Pokemon virus has been spreading wildly across the region. Reports say that this virus causes erratic behavior in Pokemon, causing them to attack more violently than normal. Once a Pokemon with the virus has worn itself out there is no chance of recovery. Pokemon who faint while infected with the virus will never wake up.  Some say it is an issue with the immune system. Others assume it was a government conspiracy. Professor Juniper wasn't sure what exactly was going on so she knew she had to study everything she could about this virus. She hired 3 lab hands in order to help her further investigate and plans to have them track the progress of the virus through the Unova region.    \n\n\n This will require training and dedication. Of course, it would be dangerous to send them into the field with potentially infected Pokemon. A vaccine was developed by a friend of hers and administered to the starters raised in the lab. Many important trainers such as gym leaders have also administered the vaccine to their Pokemon.     \n\n\nShe just hopes it to be enough to help them make it through the region alive.   \n\n\nSo if you are interested please message me with Pokemon trainer profile including their name, personality, and some background information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "My name is Katherine, but my friends call me Kat. I\u2019m from Nice, France and am 23 years old. I have long honey coloured hair that falls in waves down to the midpoint of my back, high cheekbones, full lips, tanned skin, wide catlike green eyes, and a petite and fit body frame, standing at 180 cm (5 foot 9). I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nI am a professional assassin, paid heavy sums of money to take out my assigned target, from heads of state and members of monarchies to ordinary people. I work alone and jet off across the globe for my missions, and I\u2019ve gotten good enough to the point where I\u2019ve begun to show off. I have a record, however. As a teenager, I spent a bit in prison for petty theft and robbery, but nothing beyond that. I\u2019ve been able to hide my tracks well with the help of my organisation and constant changing identities and passports. When not working, I live in a large flat in London with a grey kitten. \n\nFor this role-play, you are the police/investigator trying to find and catch me. You may work for any organisation that you\u2019d like, and can start as far along in the process as you\u2019d like (i.e. anywhere from just being assigned the case to hot on my trail). Please be detailed, have good grammar, and paragraph-length responses. We can do this over kik or discord. Merci\n\n",

But everyone makes mistakes so I won't hold them against you!\n\nThe premise of the roleplay is that my character(OC) would be the hero that started to go around the city saving people. But he's more of a vigilante than a hero.\n\nYou can decide what kind of villain you are, whether it's another OC that you have already or if you make one up, whatever is fine! \n\nMore details can be discussed in the role play with myself\n\nThe more detailed and intense you can be is always helpful\n\nPlease say a little more than just hi or hey messages\n\nInterested?

            "selftext": " \n\nHello there! I'm searching for someone to do a lengthy Pokemon roleplay with, if you couldn't guess by the title! I'm looking to include a few rather...obscure elements we can discuss through PMs, but one of them involves one of the classes from the tabletop game! Although that is mostly in concept rather than execution. I'm hoping to play a pair of younger kids who are introduced a small bit into their journey, rather than right at the beginning, although that is rather up to us!  \n\n\nI\"m fine with all the regions except Alola, I feel it doesn't quite have enough landmass to do quite what we would want to do.  I have a slight preference to Sinnoh, however, since it's my favorite region!  The adventure will involve legendaries of varying pokemon, depending, once again, on the scene we want to go with!  \n\nThe kids would be young to early teens, think 12-14 in ages. We wouldn't need to be the same age, but we could discuss. I'm not the best at leading the scenes, but I'm pretty good at larger scenes in general, small scenes are sorta...hard for me to create, and I would need some help! I'm also happy to take advice from you! Please Pm me to hear more, hope to hear from you Soon!",

And as for you, it can be either an OC or Alice. Now seem people need requirements I will say them now.\nI don\u2019t mind if your semi-literate or literate. It really is just how much attention to detail you pay. With Timezone I can be flexible.\nWith plot I would prefer to discuss it with you. There may NSFW later in the rp. If you came only for that then I\u2019m sorry. \nMessage me if your interested,",

            "selftext": "Kade Jenzen had fallen asleep at the controls again. His own snoring woke him up, and he looked over to SSID, short for Self-Sufficient Intelligence Droid, who currently passed as his copilot. \"How long was I out?\"\n\nThe droid let out a few beeps, then a static-filled response. Kade rubbed his face, and grunted, \"I gotta fix your vocalizer...\"\n\nThe console chimed, indicating that short-range sensors had picked up something. \"Let's see what that is,\" Kade said, more to himself than SSID. He pressed a few keys, and his eyes widened in surprise. \"A life pod?\" He switched to long-range scanners. \"No wreckage... what the hell is that doing out here all by itself? SSID, take us in.\"\n\nKade moved over to the engineering console, and powered up the tractor beam. \"Get us close enough so I can bring it in.\" When the droid did, Kade locked onto the pod with the beam, and brought it into the cargo hold. \"Take us out of the space lane,\" he told SSID. \"If this is something valuable, I don't want anyone trying to take it from us.\"\n\nHe made his way to the cargo hold, empty save for the life pod, and waited until the air pressure equalized. He checked the sensors to make sure the hold had been decontaminated, then opened the hatch. His blaster was at his hip, and he set it to stun. After a moment, he put it back to the kill setting, then re-holstered it. He moved forward, and opened the life pod.\n\n((Hello there. I role play in the third-person, past tense style, and offer 1-3 paragraphs per post. I'd like the same, if possible. Someone with a good sense of humour and an appreciation of smut would also be cool, as long as smut isn't the sole focus. This is set in no established universe, but it could be, or we could just make it something random. If you're interested, hit me up.))",

INCIDENT REPORT](https://imgur.com/a/OXlACED)**\n\n\nRecord #63\n\n\nIncident Date: 01.10.2019\n\n\nIncident Location: NYC, New York\n\n*****\n\n\n**Report:**\n\n\nOn the 10th of January, 2019, superhero and recently-licensed Avenger [SPIDER-MAN](https://imgur.com/a/2C8ZN09) was subjected to a number of sizable blasts, each made up of an unknown energy form. The source of the strikes was an emotionally-unstable *homo superior*, whom Spider-Man was attempting to reason with (little data has been collected regarding the teenage mutant \u2013 for the purpose of this report, he will be referred to as MUTANT X). The adolescent\u2019s strikes, while wild in aim, proved enough to K.O. Spider-Man and, in the vigilante\u2019s absence of consciousness, Mutant X managed to swiftly vacate the scene.\n\n\nThis leads to the subject of the report: Spider-Man, the interceding hero, has been undergoing notable, physical alterations since his encounter with Mutant X. The energy attacks left him with a number of cracked ribs, as well as a week-long, still-enduring comatose. However, the most notable change is presumably a result of the unknown energy that Mutant X projected, unexplainable by both S.H.I.E.L.D scientists and mystic artists alike: **Spider-Man has been completely transformed into a [genetic female](https://imgur.com/a/3HToHtK).**\n\n\n**Protocol:**\n\n\nDue to the unique nature of such an incident, S.H.I.E.L.D. has not developed any expansive protocol for the situation. Nevertheless, assistive plans are underway \u2013\u00a0professionals are currently doing their best to nurse Spider-Man out of his coma. Once he awakes, a currently undetermined female from the [growing roster of Avengers](https://imgur.com/a/ceoS1l9) will personally aid him as he adapts to life as a woman. This is in hopes of providing the hero with emotional support in a time of potential shock and confusion.  \n\n\nAs he adapts, S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists will work furiously at finding a cure, while research teams will do their best to track the whereabouts of Mutant X. If the confused adolescent can be found, there stands a chance that he can receive the help he needs and Peter\u2019s life as a male can be restored. \n\n\n**REPORT LAST UPDATED:** 01.17.2019\n\n*****\n\nHey, /r/Roleplay! \n\nI posted this wacky, gender-bender prompt yesterday around the same time and sadly didn\u2019t get too many responses. But, just like good ol\u2019 Spidey, I\u2019m trying to keep my optimism! Here\u2019s a little more specification in what I\u2019m looking for:\n\n- **A character.** Essentially, I\u2019m searching for someone to play one of the many ladies of the Marvel Universe against my now gender-bent Spider-Man. Which female you take on is entirely up to you \u2013 I can provide a list of preferred characters, if you wish, though! OC\u2019s are also welcome as long as they are fleshed out further than a mere name and face. \n\n- **A writer.** Listen, I don\u2019t expect you to be Stephen King. I just want literacy and creativity \u2013 as long as you don\u2019t \u201c*typ liek dis*\u201d and are able to provide fun content, we\u2019re game! I\u2019d also prefer multiple responses a day (if your time allows) and a third person, past-tense style. \n\n- **An adult.** The nature of this roleplay may lead into the more NSFW-realm at points (e.g. nudity, violence, sex), so please be 18 or above. I won\u2019t budge on this one. \n\nYour character will act as a sort-of guide for Peter as he maneuvers the branches of ladyhood \u2013 whether it be the straps of his newly-acquired bras or the painful shock of monthlies, the poor ~~guy~~ gal is going to be needing a *lot* of help. \n\n\nAs the story develops, I\u2019d love to tug on the rope of an unlikely, F/F romance, but that\u2019s not absolutely necessary. Primarily, the plot will consist of Peter\u2019s adaption to life as a female, as well as the pair\u2019s eventual quest to find Mutant X. \n\n\nSo, ya\u2019 think this is a plot you could slip yourself into? Can you match the specifications above?  Then shoot me a PM! I\u2019m not an elitist that requires writing samples, but I *would* like a little bit of information about you, as well as any ideas you may have for the plot (e.g. your character, potential events, etc.)! From there we can hopefully move over to Discord and get the ball rolling! \n\n\nLooking forward to those orange envelopes,\n\n\n**/u/Throwplay-Roleaway**\n\nPS: Even if you\u2019re not interested, an upvote really does go a long way! Thanks! ",

I have always enjoyed fantasy scenes (elves, dragons, and all other fantastical humanoids and creatures). I prefer to RP via the Reddit chat and will try and reply at least daily though weekends can be hit and miss depending on what all is going on (I, like everyone else, have a life away from the computer).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not particular on if I'm to RP with a M/F/T etc nor am I particular what I play as. Just looking for someone to RP with on occasions when I get on here. I do ask that you be 18+ so that I don't have to moderate language and things can progress however they may with no worries from either side. Additionally, I ask that you be able to play more than one character so that we can fill in the world as needed to move the story along and make it interesting.  \n\nI'm thinking something along the lines of a D&amp;D world where anything can be possible, but not everything is probable. Perhaps we even start it much like such a game (meet in a bar or on the street or blah blah blah).  \n\nIf you have an idea for a scene or something that you're itching to play along the lines I have in mind, feel free to let me know.",

The majority of the story though will be simply you exploring the world with a little combat here and there, although not too much as to not make it exactly like d&amp;d. I have a whole story and world set up and ready to go.\n\nI would prefer to use kik or discord as those are the easiest for me, discord more so than kik but I'm down for any medium just not voice chat so that way we're not constricted by a schedule.\n\nFeel free to pm me to work out the details and everything.",

As you can probably tell from the title, I\u2019m looking for a Star Wars roleplay. I prefer long term roleplays, and like those who will put as much effort into long replies as I will.\n\nEra: I\u2019m open to any era. Jedi-Sith War, Mandelorian War, Jedi Civil War, PT, OT, ST, etc. It\u2019s all on the table. Just throw out there what you are most interested in.\n\nI will likely be playing a Jedi/Sith/possibly grey depending on the story we set up. It\u2019s Star Wars, who wouldn\u2019t want to be a force user? As for your character, that\u2019s entirely up to you. Any species, type, background, skill set you want.\n\nMy biggest requirement of my partners is that they continue to or in effort throughout the roleplay. Everyone has off days, but this will not be me creating a plot and pushing your character through it while you roleplay alongside things. You are expected to contribute creatively as well.\n\nIf you are interested just send me a message! Give me a little bit of effort in your introduction. I put a fair bit of time in this post. Even if it\u2019s just letting me know what you\u2019re learning towards for your character or which era you think you\u2019d enjoy role playing in.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "**Setting:** Modern day Japan (Hakone to be exact). Please do some Googling about the place as well as Japan itself if you're unfamiliar. The season will likely be autumn or winter, depending on what we decide upon together. \n\n**Inspired By:** Tokyo Diner: Midnight Stories, and Hungry Hearts Diner: A Tale of Star-Crossed Souls, an application game. Also various anime movies like Your Name.\n\n**My Character:** A young woman in her 20s (we can decide on ages together) works in a Michelin star restaurant in Tokyo. Though she's been single most of her life, she finds herself pining for a real relationship. Her cooking career is fine but to her, it's leaving her with a void that cooking cannot fill anymore. She winds up winning a small but sizable lottery and decides to leave the busy city of Tokyo behind for a calmer lifestyle in hopes of finding her passion again. She opens up a small diner in the small town of Hakone. The small diner is modest and seats about ten people and she begins to find her fire for cooking and connecting to those around her.\n\n**Your Character:** Maybe he's a local. Maybe he's from overseas and is an expat? Or maybe he's from the big bustling city too and also wants to get away from the chaos left behind? Maybe he's also interested in cooking and become my character's appearance. Or maybe he's a neighbor or school teacher or fisherman. Maybe he works for a local hotel and sees the diner as competition and wants to meet the owner for himself. Maybe he's just a local who becomes a regular at the diner. It's all up to you!\n\n**Expectations:** We use reddit PMs or discord. I want someone who is okay with 1-3 posts a week, nothing overly speedy is required. Romance and slice of life are gonna be heavy here. This is about something calm and peaceful and totally character focused, not about drama or action or spooky happenings. And typically I like to get 3-5 paragraphs per post on average. Third person, past tense is preferred. I would like us to use anime pictures but I'd be open to real life.\n\n**Closing:** I'm looking for someone who is into something cute and wholesome, someone into a slower pace and is easy to brainstorm with.

In this, I'd like to play an Imperial deserter looking for a better cause. Whether it be the Rebel Alliance or smuggling, I find it and many adventures with my copilot.\n\nWoW\n\nHate BfA? Sick of playing it but still love the lore and want to explore it more? Here's your chance to dis everything about BfA and remake it what you want. I'd love to play a Demon Hunter, struggling with the loss of his \"purpose\". Preferrably Alliance, but I can be flexible.\n\nI'm a flexible writer and I'm always willing to brainstorm and find different ways to write things! When it comes to romance between characters, I prefer to write the characters for a while and then decide if they'd pursue a romantic relationship or stay platonic.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

I'd really love to try something revolving around a male escort and a high-powered woman (a business executive, politician, etc.).   \n\n\nHow they meet, why they meet, etc., is really up for grabs. My initial thought is she hires him for a night after a few too many drinks - maybe she's at a bachelorette party, something like that. Or, maybe she hires him for a more formal affair, wanting him to be her \"plus one\" to some event or another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this woman as someone who has really had to work her way up from the bottom. Maybe people view her as \"cold\", but she has to be in order to get any kind of respect in her career, and deep down she's super innocent, sweet, wants to be taken care of, etc. But it takes a hell of a lot to bust through that hard exterior. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe male character plays his role extremely well, too. He knows he's good at what he does, he makes good money doing it. But, he's a romantic at heart.   \n\n\nAs you might expect, there could be a lot of drama here, a lot of conflict, a lot of hurt and love and lust. Sweet moments, angry moments, sad moments, everything in between. If you're willing to work it out with me, let's give it a go! \n\n**So who in the world are you looking for, DogDoc?**\n\nI have very few rules and regulations, but here are the basics:\n\n* Be 18+. No wiggle room here. There will undoubtedly be adult themes, so being an adult is necessito.\n* I'm a guy, and I prefer playing male characters. Happy to double up or play female NPCs.\n* That being said, I'm more comfortable RPing with women.\n* If you say you're an 'advanced' writer, please actually be one.\n* Don't be afraid to add in your own ideas! I love plotting with my partners. Gets boring if we aren't able to talk things out.\n* We all have busy lives, so let me know if you're going to be away for awhile, and I'll do the same. If you're not into the RP anymore, don't be afraid to tell me. I'd much rather you tell me that you're bored or uninspired or just need a break, rather than completely disappearing.\n* I typically prefer to RP over Discord or Google Docs, but let me know what works for you. I'm flexible. ",

Gender doesn't matter this time around either. So guys, girls! Hit me up!  \n\n\nIf you're interested, I'd prefer you DM me but if you want to just leave a comment here we'll get around to it.

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI've had a few ideas for RP that I've been interested in for some time now, one being rather new due to a nightmare I had recently that seemed like it could be a really interesting concept to build with someone else! \n\nFor a little about me before hand, I'm 21 years old, currently a part time student and working a daytime job for a school, so I'm normally most free during the afternoons. I've been doing RP for about 12 years now, and I only write in 3rd person. I also write at least one paragraph per reply, as I find story hardly progresses when it's not much more than that. One of my only limits is that you have to be 18+ - it's more just a comfort level thing for me. NSFW isn't a necessity in my RPs, but I do like seeing a side of romance and such if it fits. However, it's not my priority.\n\nNow, if you've read this far, here's my ideas!\n\n\\-------\n\n**The Gem Disease**  \nIt's been about six months since the disease has started, and no one knows why or how it started. The climate has been getting colder, most of the landscape being covered in snow and ice. Strange pillars of bluish-green gems have started to form, some larger and thicker than others. It's heavily expressed to avoid going outside as much as possible, as the cold is bitter, and no one is sure what infects you with the disease - if it's airborne, or if touching those gems in some minor way will make it grow in you like a cancer.\n\nA young individual finds shelter in a school nearby their home, one that was built for college students and where they attend. It's mostly full of teachers, with only a few students being a part of the masses - most of which having left to keep their family safe. When heading out for a quick supply run with someone else, this individual is suddenly stopped by a middle-aged man who appeared to once be a teacher there. He says something cryptic, neither party being able to understand too well. Without pause, his jaw opens wide, and those same bluish-green gems come bursting out of his mouth. He falls to his knees, some gems bursting from his skin and pinning him to the ground. Soon, sharp spikes quickly burst along his jawline from his agape mouth, a grotesque image that he has now solidified in.\n\n\\--------\n\n**The Misguided Angel**  \nA church has been becoming rather popular lately, one that swears up and down that they truly heal the weak, that they are a faith to believe in, all governed by Father Caulder. Several people who once lacked a sense of faith have become a member of the church, and many of which seem to be fanatics - going to the point of murder if someone doesn't believe in the Father.\n\nInside the church is a girl considered to be The Chosen One - the girl that can transfer the Father's power onto those that request his help. However, the girl is simply an angel - one that came to Earth in news of this newfound cult that was forming, and being too ambitious in the concept of trying to destroy it. She had been brainwashed, and several seals are buried in the church to keep her bound to Earth. Her wings have been clipped, and she has gone through an unimaginable amount of torture she doesn't seem to remember. She genuinely believes she is The Chosen One.\n\nAnother angel, or perhaps another individual that knows of such a being, becomes curious of this new \"cure\" and this power the church holds.\n\n\\--------\n\nNow, if you're surprisingly still reading, these ideas are very open to be adapted with my partners! I love talking about the plot and building a world together - and I love becoming friends with whoever I'm interacting with. So if you're not super into OOC chatting, I likely won't be the right partner for you.\n\nIf these ideas don't interest you, I also like quite a few games, a vast amount of anime, and in terms of genre I enjoy: Supernatural, Horror, Slice of Life, Fantasy, Adventure, Post-Apoc, Somewhat Sci-fi.\n\nPlease shoot me a DM if you feel any sort of interest!",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

            "selftext": "#About me:\n\nWhy hello wonderful people of this subreddit, hope everyone's doing well! My name's Shibi, I'm nineteen years old, and I'm looking for a new RP partner for an idea I've been having for a while now! Now, before you continue on reading, I'd like to talk about about myself and what sorts of RPs and settings and what exactly I'm looking for, because if you didn't enjoy my ideas then maybe we can make a new plot to better fit the both of us! \n\n#What I'm looking for:\n\nNow, by the title alone I'm guessing you already know what I have in mind. I've been interested in India culture for quite sometime now, it's such an interesting period I knew it would make for an amazing RP! Now, for the most part I was thinking the plot would be set in India, but honestly that's not really a necessity but I would prefer it being set in a more ancient and medieval times as it's usually my preferred setting. But, what I'm definitely opened for is a modern time but with a mix of fantasy element to it. And lastly that I'd like to note about the RP, is that it'll most likely have some romance and shmexy themes (A 19 year old who's into that stuff, a suprise isn't it?). In all seriousness though, I really do enjoy some romance and some peen in the bean stuff on the side, but obviously it won't be the main theme of the plot, but I do hope something would happen between our characters from time to time. And not to mention, I do enjoy dark and twisted themes with a hint of angst and drama! Edgy, yes, but I just love it! It's always a fun setting when our characters have an angsty love hate relationship, where one wants to beat the other so hard, but in the same time they wanna kiss them... While beating them. Know what I'm saying? That stuff is just s w i g g i t y \n\n#Plots: \n\nWe've been talking all about this amazing setting, so how about we get into the plots already! Note: like I said before, we don't need to do these plots exactly as I'm very open to change and suggestions. In fact, if you dislike them, we can always make something new together. In any case, here are my ideas:\n\n- (My character) was but a humble merchant in town. He didn't have much going for him, just a simple man who only wanted to prosper and thrive in his beautiful life. But of course, not everyone has patience in them, and to truly reach the top and achieve your goals, you needed hard work and dedication to do so. Of course, this merchant wasn't one of those people, he always wanted the easier ways in life, and what's easier than letting demons do your bidding? Acquiring such a skill was no easy task, and even after years of dealing with them, he still found trouble truly controlling these wild spirits. Seeing as how rare it was to use such a skill, many were willing to pay for him to help them either smite or enchant anyone they displease, giving the merchant a fortune to play with, but also a bounty on his neck if he was ever caught in the act. \n\n[In this one, your character could either be a knight sent in disguise to bust him, or just a bounty hunter going after his bounty. Either case, the main idea would be that both our characters would go head on, only for the merchant to fail and get captured.]\n\n- A party was held at the sultan's castle, a celebration for his son would be marrying his \"love\" soon enough. But in truth, the prince hated that woman and didn't want to be anywhere near her. Unfortunately, he didn't have a saying in this.\u00a0 His father forced him into this, telling him she was the princess of a powerful city in Britain (Or any other country, I'm completely open for any other ideas) and marrying her would end the slaughter, so what other choice did he have but to agree? But it seemed he wasn't the only one resenting this marriage. A secret group from the same city were plotting against this marriage as signing this peace contract would stop the war, and stoping the war would stop all arms deals, killing all of their factories they've built specifically to fuel this massacre. The organisation sends one of them to hide in the prince's room, waiting for him to come whenever he feels done with the party, capturing him to stop this foolery.\n\n[This one I'd say is pretty self explanatory. Basically your character is a spy sent to capture the prince and transport him back to Britain where he'll be terrorised so he'd refuse to ever marry that woman and sign the peace contract. The fun part will be that the ride actually breaks down halfway through and the two get stuck, so they can either help one another so they survive through the desert or the prince tries to escape. We'll see what'll happen] \n\n#Platforms and styles:\n\nUsually I RP on discord or hangout, but I can make exceptions and try to RP elsewhere like Skype, Kik or even Reddit. What I don't do is over at email though, I really dislike using an email to RP with someone. I strictly RP in third person as I feel first person is way too... Personal. As for my writing capabilities, I'd say I'm rather semi-literate, or could also be considered lazy literate. What I mean is that I'll definitely write a lot and with detail, but after a while my replies might get a bit shorter as I'm kind of a lazy fellow, not gonna lie about that. Still, I will definitely write as much as I can with wonderful details, but expect my writing length to be somewhere from 400-1000 words per reply, that's usually the lengths I go by, but that doesn't mean I won't write more if needed to. \n\nAnd that's hopefully about it! Be sure to PM me if you're interested or even comment below if you'd like me to approach you first. And of course, if you have any questions or if I missed any important info, be sure to ask and I'll hopefully be able to answer you. And that is all, hope to make a wonderful RP with you peeps! ",

            "selftext": "*Beware here comes a wall of text.*\n\n**The Dark Lords of the Sith.**\n\nIn the year 568 Before the Battle of Yavin, Kuna Vanda. Darth Sanguis, Dark lord of the sith, eliminated his own master the Zabrak, Saldau. Darth Kritus. Taking up the title of sith lord, and master of the order. Picking up his master\u2019s lightsaber, and sliding it into his sleeve, he boarded the ship in which the two sith had arrived on mustafar, now, he was the master, and he must look for an apprentice. This, would require meditation. In his former master\u2019s personal meditation chamber in Osadia. A rich core world, the center of several trades which fed the core of the galaxy. As it was usual for a sith lord of his era, Darth Sanguis held and alter ego. Duke Kuna Vanda, of Osadia. His planet had a seat in the senate, and sat in the council of the faraway planet cluster of the corporate sector, as Osadia held control of several small planets and moons close to it.\n\nThe dark lord activated the droid pilot of the ship, as the polarization of the ship activated, the Ion engines engaged and the ship cut across the atmosphere, then, it broke through it. In orbit, the coordinates of the hyperspace jumps were input by the pilot droid as the man began to remove his traveling robes, instead, slipping into the Fine Clothings he usually wore. A body tight jumpsuit, made of armorweave, but crafted not to look so. And over it, draped on his shoulders, falling a flowing robes of reds, and purples and browns. A few slits of yellow cut the darker colors as he slid the adorned hilt of his [Lightsaber](https://www.yourprops.com/movieprops/original/yp_522bee95433474.81519539/Star-Wars-Revenge-Of-The-Sith-Darth-Sidious-ROTS-Limited-Edition-1.jpg) into a small concealed pocket in one of the looser layers of his sleeves.\n\nThe dark lord retired from the medium sized corvette. He walked through the halls as the only, true dark lord of the sith in existence. He could feel the dark side flowing through his body in a much higher potency than before. He felt he could have cracked a planet\u2019s crust, had he wished to do so. He did not. The calm and calculated steps of the sith lord guided him to the lord\u2019s quarters. He ripped the doors apart with the force. And the durasteel of the door bent to his will, as the panels slid off. He walked inside, and threw the doors together again. He laid into the bed. And shut his eyes. And as if time did not exist, he opened them again. As the ship had docked on his personal state, the dark lord stood, and walked off, through the airlock of the ship as he walked into his former master\u2019s apartments.\n\nIf there was anything the former dark lord deserved praise for, it was his personal apartments, the zabrak had taste. The room had all manner of decorations, from small statues, to paintings and sculptures, all manner of artistic representation coming from several species from all across the galaxy. He walked past it all, past the art, past the scientific stations his master kept. And through the alchemical stations. He walked to the meditation chamber. He walked in, and knelt, reaching out with the force, all the force, scanning the galaxy, looking for his apprentice. It did not take more than a minute, and then the signature of the next dark lord of the sith was reveal to him. He could sense his new apprentice.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWell, hello there, beautiful, awesome, amazing people of /RolePlay! Im trying to scratch my Star Wars itch, and since, who doesn't like the sith, I thought I'd make a prompt about the new dark lord of the sith looking for his new apprentice, and then subsequently training said apprentice. So, here we are.\n\nSo, from this Rp, I want a few specific plot things. I want to build a progression, so I want a few scenes of the master teaching things to the apprentice, your character, from lightsaber combat, to force channelling and control. And, most importantly, I would like to try to make the sith lords a bit more sympathetic. Though I don't want 'good' guy sith lords. I just don't want a cartoonishly evil pair. If that makes sense.\n\nI do want to make include NSFW content here, just an FYI. and of course, dark themes are pretty much built into a prompt with Sith lords being the main characters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, If this seemed interesting, throw me a pm and we can discuss the roleplay in detail, and set everything up.",

A few metal boot steps reverberate through the air of the dark basement, you can only see the faint, red glint of lights belonging to a wicked machine unlike anything you've ever seen. \n\n     \"It's finally time to take the dive. Whatever you do, stay close to me. If my theory is correct, we won't have a lot of time to catch our breath once we transport to this dimension. Theoretically the atmosphere is supposed to be reeeeeal nasty... Thankfully, we've got this.\" \n\n     She cooed, as she flashed a peculiar looking orange orb at you, reminiscent of a buoy. The tips of the spiked barbs sticking out of the machine began to illuminate a light blue, thick strands of electricity materialized between each pike. The room's energy felt intoxicating as it lit up a brilliant azure, like a supernova ready to burst. \n\n     \"NOW!\" The mysterious guide shouted at you over the chaos, the red lights of her sleak, mechanized vision peripheral beaming down on you amidst the laser light show. She slammed her pale fist into the button within the center of her belt, urging you to do the same. A sharp scream pierced through the booms of sound, and the mysterious woman grabbed onto her sides, as if trying to prevent herself from falling apart. As you pushed the button on your belt, you feel the same compulsion to scream. Something's ripping you apart. Cell by cell, atom by atom, quark by quark. The mysterious woman began to violently combust into a flurry of red dust. From the feet then immediately to her head, she went up in a storm of red particles. She's gone. Now it's your turn. The ripping sensation grows stronger and more intense. You're falling apart, you can feel it. The sensation intensifies at your feet. You swear you're taking a dive into a supervolcano. It's all so hot. Reality seems to be melting, and in its place a horrifying realm is taking shape. As your very being feels it's being ripped apart, your surroundings begin to morph more and more.\n\n     The color you took for granted on Earth is gone, everything is black. The land in front of you is a sea of static, with red shadowy figures dancing about the waters. On the horizon you can pick out a small body of land. That's all you can think until the woman from earlier finally registers in your field of view. She's shaking you violently. You notice the black splotches growing on your skin, and on hers. They fester like parasites, you just can't come to, you're shellshocked. She drags you to an object sticking out of the ground casting a bubble of light. Then, you collapse.\n\nAnd that's just the entrance.\n\nAPPLY FOR THE BENDS TODAY, BECOME A DIMENSIONAL DIVER!

I\u2019m looking for someone who will be able to consistently write as much as me. One of my least favourite things is when I write 3 paragraphs, and I get one in reply. I love detail. \nI\u2019d be willing to try 3rd, but I am unexperienced so some patience would be required. \n\nI also tend to play characters who are more uh...morally compromised. I like to play action, crime, some romance.  I have a few OC roles, all based in sci-fi (think mutants, X-Men), crime, and romance. \n\n\nI\u2019m pretty strict on grammar and spelling, but everyone makes mistakes sometimes! I also do not like or engage in asterisk rp. It isn\u2019t my personal style. I will provide a sample of my own rping style if you would like, as I usually ask for one from you as well. \n\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who can reply at least once a day, as well as understand sometimes that is all I can do. I have some medical issues that hopefully will be sorted out, but right now I have good days and bad. On my good days, I usually reply almost right away! I hope that can make up for the days that I\u2019m sick.  Ideally I\u2019m looking for someone who has at least six months experience. I would like someone within ten years of my own age, if that is ok. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to drone on.\nMessage me if this sounds interesting! Looking forward to hearing from you.\n",

I\u2019ve recently watched The Last Kingdom, and the Vikings again..and I feel inspire to do a role play prompt based around that genre.   I have done many viking themed prompts before, and I have spent years gathering an understanding of Viking culture and normalities, and I would prefer if my partner could have some basic knowledge on the Viking life as well.\n\nAs for the prompt, I\u2019d like it if we can discuss this together so that we both get a plot that we can enjoy, instead of having someone become bored because it\u2019s not their style. I would like this role play to have a romantic prompt, but obviously not without the angst and hardships.  \n\nI consider myself a rather literate role player with years of experience, which is why I expect my partner to be the same. I write in third person, past tense only. I can\u2019t stand people who write in first person, although that\u2019s my personal taste. \n\nI\u2019m a female looking for a male partner, that has an original character to give to the prompt. I\u2019ve always preferred my partners character to play a \u201cAlpha male\u201d role. I feel like everyone enjoys the role play more when the characters are historically accurate, from clothing to personalities, and roles. For example, a Viking male may be more rough, dominate, and distant towards others. If you are not comfortable with that, then your character doesn\u2019t have to have that personality. \n\nIf you want a Viking themed RP, please message me and we can exchange contact information(for discord) and then discuss the plot we want to take and other small details.. Also please be working on your character description when you message me, so we can focus more on the prompt.",

            "selftext": "Instead of making several character specific posts, I decided to group them all together. I'm looking for a partner to play any canon character from DC, Marvel, Image, Valiant, IDW, or Dark Horse. I am capable of roleplaying the following characters: Invincible, Tempest, Red Robin, Timothy Hunter, Robin, Ninjak, Hawk, Marko, Spider-Man, Shazam, Batman Beyond, Red Hood, Casey Jones, Black Adam, Hellboy, John Constantine, Jason Blood/Etrigan, Swamp Thing, Nightwing, Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, Bane, Deathstroke, Captain Cold, Deadshot, Atom, Mister Miracle, Kyle Rayner, Beast Boy, Ted Kord, Zachary Zatara, Jaime Reyes, and a few others. The characters listed offer a broad range for genres and scenarios. \n\nNow let's go onto the boring rules part of the post. I ask that my partner be very literate and able to write quite a bit. I absolutely love having a bunch of details. I also ask that you be open to any NSFW themes. I do enjoy not having limits to the roleplay experience since it allows me to fully involve myself in my character's role. I hope I don't sound too demanding!\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message. I look forward to exploring some comic book worlds!",

            "selftext": "**About me:** I am 29, write in close third person, past tense.  Posts can vary from one paragraph to 3 pages depending on what the story calls for, but usually 3-5 paragraphs is the norm.  (Posts get shorter during dialogue.) I like to use Google Docs for the actual writing just because of Discord's low character limit, but it's not a requirement.  I am often available from Noon-4pm and 10pm-2am EST. I like to post multiple times a day.\n\n**What I'm looking for:** Basically, I\u2019m open to anything that\u2019s not contemporary Earth with only human characters.  I like historically realistic medieval settings with some fantasy elements and fantasy races, non-military science fiction, and possibly horror.  I\u2019d prefer a world that\u2019s already built, either your own setting or mine, just because it\u2019s easier to jump in.  That said, I\u2019d be willing to do some worldbuilding with my partner if that\u2019s not possible.  Also, I might be open to doing ASOIAF, Rimworld, or Morrowind with the right person.\n\nI love historical realism, violence, action, grey/complex moral issues, highly emotional drama and dark themes. \n\n**Settings and Plot Ideas**\n\n**First Contact:** In the far future, humans (or your own custom race) have sent seed ships to explore the galaxy and colonize new worlds. A group of explorers have been kept in cryogenic storage for centuries when the onboard AI finally detects a habitable planet and awakens them. Unfortunately, the planet is already inhabited by the [Okee-eet](https://i.imgur.com/eiUqjak.jpg), an arboreal race of bird-like mammals with technology similar to that of modern Earth.\n\n[**The World of Capithua** \\(WIP. Document covers the magic system and many of the races, but there is room for more to be added.\\) An ancient Rome inspired fantasy setting in which magic use is somewhat rare.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p2iEN4RKfEcoYtolhiSbNa0lXT63g9GuWysIhek7QjY/edit#)\n\n Lots of stories could take place in this setting, though I have a few ideas:\n\n* A naive Varg (my character) from a remote tribe accidentally comes into contact with a magestone, a magical gem that imparts abilities and sometimes memories to its user. In this world magic use is strictly regulated, and now she is wanted dead for what she knows. \n\n* A youth from the upper castes runs away from home so they can explore the world, and quickly learns that life outside their beautiful city is not as pleasant as they thought. \n\n*These are just ideas.  My settings can be modified, my ideas can be modified, or you could tell me your own setting/plot ideas.*\n\n\n**Relationships:** I enjoy romance if it develops organically and happens alongside a plot, but I'm not interested in slice-of-life romance.  I prefer romance when I play against a male character, but that\u2019s not a requirement.  Whether I'm interested in describing sex in detail or doing a fade to black depends on the situation, and I am of course fine writing with partners who don't want to do any sex or romance.\n\n**Characters:** I prefer to play nonhuman characters - fantasy races, monsters, beastfolk, aliens, androids, etc.  I am totally comfortable with characters that are really weird or non-humanoid.\n\nI create a new character for every RP so I can tailor them to the plot and to my partner's character, and although I prefer my partner do the same it\u2019s certainly not a requirement.  I am really flexible on the types of characters I play, so if you have a preference let me know!  I like characters that are ugly, weak, or imperfect.  I play both males and females, and have no preference for what you play as.\n \n**If interested** please send me a writing sample and a bit of info about yourself (availability, what you're looking for, all that good stuff.) I promise I'm not that picky about grammar. These are some writing samples from me, taken from previous RPs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-7ss87TsTNI38S-1wjyGRflvhud2jHGVuyAFugaUOV8/edit\n\n\n",

I also find music really inspirational for creative things and, I'm guessing like a lot of people, find myself imagining stories and characters to go along with songs while I listen to them.\n\nI'm looking for a partner who's literate, writes 2+ paragraphs per reply (hopefully more/generally aims to match lengths) and isn't too shy about sharing their music tastes. I promise I won't judge you for whatever you're into! I'm not really looking for music I'll think is good, just *interesting* music. \n\nIf you're interested, send me a PM with a song you enjoy! Genre of both the music and any ideas you have based off of it don't matter.\n\nHope to hear from you! :)",

I like things organized and thought out on Discord as well as someone who can pitch the same energy as I give when it comes to creativity.\n\nI write at least 2,000 words or more depending on the story. I like detail where it is due. I'm still a work in progress when it comes to my writing, so I won't be harsh if you are not that skilled. But I need to be able to understand you as you would expect from me.\n\nThe genre I'm mostly looking for is Romance, slice of life, drama, etc. We can add our own flair to whatever we come up with together. I'm also asking that if you decide to role play with me that we communicate and bounce ideas off of one another. I don't like feeling like I'm the only one interested, or you don't like the idea and choose not to say anything or add to it what you'd like. This is a partnership after all.\n\nI don't have many triggers, but I'll express to you what I'm not comfortable with if we come across it. If you want to rp with me pls hmu. I already have a few ideas of my own as well. ",

I know you see a lot of these, probably, but I figured I'd take a stab at it.\n\nA little bit about me: I'm a 24 year old female, who just received my Master's at my University, and have been working full-time throughout the whole thing. I'm currently living in the United States in the Central Time Zone, however I have odd sleeping hours. I'm willing to respond multiple times per day (up to 5-6), and it could be at all hours of the day. Obviously, I know people don't have strange schedules, so I don't expect you to do the same as me or respond instantly! \n\nRoleplaying: I've been roleplaying for the last 8 years, however with extended breaks here and there. I'm interested in Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror/Survival/Slice of Life roleplays at the moment! I'm also a huge sucker for romance plots, and would be interested in a long-term roleplay involving any of the things listed. I will get into the NSFW topics if it pertains to the story and enriches it, but I'm looking to only do that. I'm all ears for new ideas. I haven't exactly planned a completely OC play in awhile, and would be more than willing to brainstorm some ideas. I normally only RP in Discord as it's the easiest for me to respond in. Also, I'm a huge fan of Blizzard games and have done several roleplays within World of Warcraft, and would be interested in using characters from plenty of different games. Have a game in mind? Just ask! c:\n\nIf you have some ideas that you'd like to flesh-out and give me a try, please don't hesitate! PM me so we can get it started!",

A couple things you should know, I have eleven years of roleplaying experience and am in my twenties! I also prefer things to remain consistent, that doesn't mean I want a reply every day but if you're going to disappear for awhile I do like to be in the know, especially so I don't assume you ghosted.\n\nNow what I have in mind is a Pokemon journey with darker themes, more mature if you will. NSFW would be preferred, of course whenever NSFW is involved all characters involved will be over 18! That is not solely what I'm looking for though, I know wanting that can mean many things... but I want both that and plot!\n\nThe region doesn't really matter much to me, we can choose whatever region you feel like.\n\nPost length is also not an issue, I'll match with your own!\n\nWhen it comes to crossovers, I don't mind in the slightest though I prefer simply adding characters from other fandoms.\n\nPlatform of choice, I honestly prefer here or on Discord. Whatever works for you!\n\nI feel like I'm forgetting something but I think that is everything needed to be said. If you're interested or have any questions, feel free to send me a message!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! My name is Pearl (she/her, they/them). I've been roleplaying for roughly 9 years now, so I'm a pretty experienced roleplayer. I play as Link from both Breath of the Wild and Twilight Princess (BotW is my main muse). Both of these Link's are different muses since they're from different games/different reincarnations.  \n\n\nI'm specifically looking for a Zelda partner, but I would be open to interacting with other characters if you already have ideas for interactions (I will also being posting my roleplay style, likes/dislikes, etc. below). Let me know if you're interested or have any questions!  \n\n\nMy main ship/OTP is Zelink, but I'm also open to ship him with anyone he has chemistry with (so don't be afraid to ask about it). I also won't force this ship on you, and it's 100% fine if you want to roleplay with Zelda platonically.  \n\n\n***This roleplay will be over Discord PM's, so be sure to PM me for my Discord information if you're interested!***  \n\n\n**Basic Information About my Roleplay Style**  \n\n\n**1)** I tend to be a multi-para and novella length writer, but I can write short replies if needed (I usually match my partners reply length). I also am a literate roleplayer, I don't use text abbreviations.  \n\n\n**2)** I write exclusively in third person format, speech in quotations.  \n\n\n**3)** I only write with people who are 18+ of age, I'm not comfortable interacting with minors (I only do smut with partners I\u2019m comfortable with and who are 18+).  \n\n\n**4)** I don't roleplay with OC's unless I'm also playing an OC.  \n\n\n**5)** My favorite genre of roleplay is angst, but I also enjoy slice-of-life roleplays.  \n\n\n**6)** I love plotting and forming friendships with my roleplay partners.  \n\n\n**8)** I'm generally pretty speedy with replies, but I am an adult attending school full time with a full time job. Please don't nag me to reply to you (and please be understanding if it takes me a bit).  \n\n\n**9)** Adding to the last point, communication is a must with me. I need to be able to tell you if I'm uncomfortable with something you're doing, and you should be comfortable telling me if you're also uncomfortable with something I'm doing.  \n\n\n**Wishlist**\n\n* Princess Zelda (BotW) partner.\n* Midna (Twilight Princess) partner.\n\n*I'm also open to and excited to roleplay with other characters from these series (even if they're not on the list)! While I normally do crossovers, I'm* ***not*** *open to them at this time.*\n\n**Genre's**\n\n* Angst (this is my favorite genre to do)\n* Smut\n* Slice-Of-Life\n* Fluff\n* Action\n* Fantasy\n* Heavily Plot-Driven\n* Alternate Canon Endings\n* Alternate Universe (AU)\n\n*If there's a genre on here that you don't see, please ask me about it! I'm usually 100% okay with any theme, these are just the ones I do the most of.*\n\n**Dislikes**\n\n**1)** When there's no communication between myself and my partner. It makes it harder to have a fun roleplay if you don't have an idea/don't communicate on where it's headed.  \n\n\n**2)** Text abbreviations, no punctuation (in replies), incomprehensible use of grammar, not spacing out paragraphs.  \n\n\n**3)** Being nagged/harassed for replies.  \n\n\n**4)** Doing something huge (like a character death) without discussing it beforehand.  \n\n\n**5)** When someone attempts to take control of my character/essentially writes my replies for me.  \n\n\n**6)** Someone force ships with me.  \n\n\n**7)** When the partner is overly attached and gets jealous/upset when I roleplay and interact with other people.  \n\n\n**8)** When I write three paragraphs of a response and only get a sentence back as a reply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***If you're interested or have any questions, be sure to either comment or message me!***",

It\u2019s not without cost- the local wildlife is dangerous, alien tech just as likely to kill you as be useful.\n\nAnd in the streets of Venus\u2019 iconic flying cities, social troubles are on the rise. The Pacification War led to a plethora of war machine cyborgs being created, who now are struggling to fit into society, their niche no longer relevant. Androids flee to Venus from the USF, disgruntling humans and augments alike as they steal jobs and prosperity. Whether or not it\u2019s intentional, it\u2019s a point of contention.\n\nMy expectations are high, but in equal measure I\u2019m willing to reward you for effort and work with you. Everyone who gets in has the power to shape the story, the setting, and the server.\n\nI look forwards to seeing you on Venus.",

I'm looking for someone who puts effort and detail in the replies they send. I don't expect wall after after wall of text from anyone however! I tend to write about one to three paragraphs per reply. It's okay with me if your replies are shorter/longer. Just no one liners, please.\n\n- Someone who knows the game's characters. This is a pretty important thing, given I'm only looking for people to play canon characters. Now, you don't have to know every detail about all of the characters,  I just ask that you have a general idea of how they look. How they act can be up to you, I'm not too much of a stickler on that, as long as they don't act the complete opposite way they normally do.\n\nPlots I had in mind:\n\n- My character would be a stowaway who ran away from home, sneaking aboard a cargo ship. For the last 6 months, he's been traveling the world this way, before accidentally coming across Watchpoint: Gibraltar.\n\n- Any ideas you have, I'll give them a listen. Whether they are alternative versions of my plot, or something else! (Remember: As of now, I'm only looking for people to play *canon* characters.)\n\nIf your interested, please pm me!\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Had this idea in my head for a while and thought it was about time to post it. I'm looking for a fantasy rp, as high as high fantasy gets. Straight out of D&amp;D or LotR or what have you. Genres I'm after would be action, maybe some drama, maybe some geopolitics, and relationship building. Think a Titanfall 2-esque story.\n\nBut anyway, onto the actual prompt. The basic premise would be that two kingdoms are at war. One of them, perhaps the wealthier one, has started abducting younger and smaller dragons to be used as mounts for knights. I'd be a knight, you'd be a dragon. Something real simple that we can take a lot of different places.\n\nI prefer medium length posts around two or three paragraphs posted once or twice a week. While I can force out five plus paragraphs I don't like doing so. Those longer posts can be a one off thing, but not the regular length. Not going to make a big list of requirements either. My only real 'rule' is to put the same amount of effort into the RP as I do. Lastly, don't be afraid to add something into our RP. It gets boring if only one person carries the story along. In fact I'm purposely leaving the prompt a little vague so we can polish it up together.\n\nIf you're interested, send me a PM!",

I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nI'm looking for a partner interested in playing Crime stories that have a Noir-like or sub-genre of Noir aesthetic! Whether that be in a Cyberpunk setting or more Modern Day. My craving in particular has to do with the character I would like to play, who is a tough-silent type. I very much love playing women who alot of angst/past trauma, and that could manifest in many ways. I would also be open to even having her be retiring soon at an early-ish age, and maybe life after her career as the focal point?~ Or, if you much prefer, I would also be open to playing a different character; One that is a family type person, brings their neighbors to BBQs or such, but is corrupt and hypocritical. I would also love some type of overarching story in their job, like a serial killer or such!\n\nAll of this being said, I don't mind adult themes at all. It comes with the territory! Sex, Alcohol, Murder. Though when it comes to romance, I can't write male-on-female too well. So, if you're going to play a male character just keep in mind I wouldn't want a romance arc, but am okay with sex.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

Good taste is appreciated, and pay is scaled accordingly. In retrospect, the ad was as bizarre as it had been appealing. Living abroad and some further travel with expenses covered. The work at first glance wasn\u2019t anything particularly new you thought. Ultimately, it seemed like you were being asked to be a glorified hostess for a holiday home. There was promise to meet many people of talent, and learning opportunities, all on top very solid pay with benefits. This fit all very nicely into your flexible young career. But then there were things that didn\u2019t quite make sense to you at the moment. Who exactly were you working for? What was really in that hulking NDA you had spared five initials and two signatures for? Was this the mob you were working for now? \n\nRegardless of your second thoughts, here you stood, in the gravel courtyard before a looming Villa on the side of an ancient Nepalese mountain. The wind murmurs in your ear of adventure in this strange land. The quiet house beckons to you. The sight of your new home excites you, especially after the fourteen hour flight, and three hour auto-rickshaw ride. Your feet ache and legs sore from inactivity and sitting. Your mind restless and ready to get to know the mountain, the house, the shepherd boy in the pasture behind you, and in particular, the clients you would be taking care of in this mystic house. \n\nOf course, nothing could really prepare anyone for the job behind the tall oak doors.\n\nIf this prompt interests you, PM me with any questions you might have, and with a sample of your writing style in the form of your OC\u2019s background and introduction.   \n \n\nBest of luck.",

You can be any type of demon you want with your own set of powers, just make it interesting.\n\nAll I ask is that you use detail and try to match the length of the paragraphs I send. Please be able to narrate in third person, use discord and above the age of 18.

This is extremely recent, and I'm looking for people to write and flesh out this world with. You'll have to make a character and post it for validation. I'll always be looking to get more people involved and going around this world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lush is** \\-  A magocracy established in the eye of what the council named 'The mist'. A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense smoke, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince they float in the endless void of The Mist, most of the Magocracy's conflicts are born internally amongst guilds. Lush's government system is comprised of a council overseen by the Arcane Sovereign. While every major policy must go by the city's supreme ruler, internal affairs are usually taken care of by the area's ruling guild. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is an adult project, slavery is a thing so, yeah here's the link:  [https://discord.gg/ugXtMYq](https://discord.gg/ugXtMYq) ",

            "selftext": "Hiya there Rpers! I have finally mustered enough courage to post a prompt I have been dwelling on for sometime now. You can find my [profile here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/agc5uo/the_outlaw_kings_roleplay_profile/) \n\n*So now that the niceties can be done away with, I have a post-apocalyptic prompt I would like you to consider - Earth has been ravaged by a solar flare. All our modern technology has been rendered useless by a powerful EMP caused by this solar storm setting us back a few hundred years. What remains of the ozone layer isn't enough to protect a large portion of the world from the harmful radiation of our sun. Basically life on earth is under serious threat of extinction.*\n\n*Amidst the ensuing chaos, one portion of North America has been lucky to survive the Event and the destruction of ozone layer and has formed its own society to survive. With no certainity about future catastrophic events or of any survivors outside the continent, they cautiously start rebuilding. Over the course, the society evolves a new class system. A defined territory for each of the 2 classes - The rich - called the Arcadia (known as heaven), the service class/ workers (Terra Opus - the work land). Things were going fine until the first purge called The Abolition which happened within the 5 years from the superflare. Here the working class raised their arms against their rich oppressors and almost succeeded in toppling the class system. But they were routed in the last ditch attempt even though they had annexed a large portion of Arcadia. Post mutiny, the region was abandoned by the Terra Opus and it soon became the haven for raiders, outlaws and banished citizens, criminals. The Arcadia resolved to let this territory remain ungoverned, serving as a makeshift border against the Terra Opus. They also slowed down the efforts to rebuild Terra Opus. So the Abolition resulted in carving of a new territory popular these days as the Infernum (the hell).*\n\nOur roleplay starts on the 50th anniversary of the Abolition. A celebration event is planned in the Arcadia region while Terra Opus is broiling with civil unrest behind closed doors. I will be playing a second generation Terra Opus immigrant citizen \u2013 a cabbage cultivator. I am also a technician in the secret resistance. Terra Opus doesn\u2019t have any electricity (superflare fried our transformers and disabled the entire powergrid and Arcadia didn\u2019t bother replacing them post the mutiny) so in order to put up a fight against the Arcadians we need the electricity among other things. I am tasked to go to the Infernum region to collect important parts for our generators. This is my first trip to the outlawed lands and despite my trainings I am relatively inexperienced and nervous. Who are you? Are you the courier? Are you a bandit or a hustler? Or are you a spy working for the Arcadian ministry? \n\nIf you are interested please do PM. I would love to discuss the intricacies in further detail. I also understand that there may be serious holes in my prompt but I am willing to discuss and plug them with you before starting the roleplay. \n\n**Obligatory disclaimer - I want to my partner to be 18+. Adult themes maybe involved in this roleplay.**",

With that being said, this is Earthland as you have never known it. Your story starts in the Kingdom of Fiore. Once upon a time, about 300 years ago there was a Dragon civil war which wrecked havoc all across the world, but most notably in the Kingdom of Fiore. The human populace had few means to fight back. There were dragon slayers but they were hardly a match for actual dragons. When the war began coming to a close, most of the Dragon slayers had died, only a few remaining, these weapons of war went their separate ways. Over time the world would begin to rebuild and bring structure and order to a world left in chaos. However even though the world was getting back on it's feet, it was far from peaceful. There were still the occasional dragons, though not all meant harm, humans did their best to kill them out of fear. Adding onto the troubles there were also roaming bands or bandits and marauders. To combat these criminals, people who had the innate ability to use magic, banded together to fight them. Eventually Magic Guilds would form and jobs of varying degrees and and parameters would be taken to help the citizens. Those who would still rather prey on the normal everyday civilians would also come together forming Dark Magic and otherwise Guilds to combat the Legal wizard guilds. And so Dark Guilds were born.   \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/zkBNMXg](https://discord.gg/zkBNMXg)",

However, they have to do with Fantasy and Darker/Supernatural themes. Also, Please be literate, I like my responses long, I will not RP with one-liners, an effort is key. I also do:\n\n* Any kind of Fantasy -Any kind of Sci-Fi\n\nAnything BUT Post Apoc.\n\nGeneral things:\n\nI prefer 18+ because I like messing with darker themes, and am willing to do smut up to a certain point (I don\u2019t want it to be the center of the story). I\u2019d like it if a person can play multiple roles and I\u2019d like a person who likes Longer responses. I want someone who is Literate. Lastly, I want communication, mostly because I have been ghosted multiple times now, if you\u2019re going to go somewhere? Tell me. If you\u2019re having a tough time and need a break?

So I\u2019ll admit off the bat I may be a bit rusty, however I\u2019m enthusiastic and have found a topic I would love to base a roleplay around.  \n\nJaegers\n\nNo not the drink, [the giant robots ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eiNVjkJDsqI). \n\nSeriously if you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. Watch that link. It gets me excited every time.   \n\nSo, I want to build a roleplay around the world of the \u201cPacific Rim\u201d franchise.  Preferably with a focus on the earlier years of the world.  \n\nI\u2019m not an insane stickler for lore and would actually prefer to play our own characters in the world of PR.  The Jaeger pilots were celebrities as well as heroes, so I feel as though this idea gives us a chance to create our own pilot and walk that road.   Dealing with the stardom and stress of a public life as well as the actually of fighting giant monsters.  \n\nThere are many ways this can be taken from veteran pilots to cadets in training.  I\u2019m open to and really prefer discussion and world building before we get started.  Also I\u2019m thinking the relationship between our characters will be intense so nsfw themes will be included at some point if they fit the story.  \n\nAlright!  I hope this catches some eyeballs and I can\u2019t wait to hear from you lovely people!",

Gore and other things is fine. \n\nI don't mind if you are male or female, or over the age of 18. Just be respectful, and I'll be respectful back. Please refrain from swearing. \n\nI'm looking to have a long term role play, themed around Lord of the Rings universe, or a fantasy/sci-fi world that we can come up with. Would like to incorporate world building. I might also take this opportunity to practice my art. If we decide to create our own universe/world I'll try and draw what it looks like. \n\nI prefer a response length that is at least a paragraph. I want to practice my language arts so I'll write at least a paragraph. You can use first person, though I prefer third person. \n\nOC's I don't mind, but please balance them out. I'm not a big fan of totally indestructible characters with absolutely no weakness whatsoever, or Godly characters that do whatever and act however they feel. I want a round and dynamic experience with developing characters. \n\nAs for me, I don't have OC's. I create characters based on the RP that I am doing. I make sure to balance them out with strengths and weakness, and develop them over time. \n\nI should be active almost every day, though I might not respond for a day if I am studying for a test. I'll let you know however in advance.\n\nMy time zone is: GMT-07:00 mountain standard Time.\n\nAnother thing, don't just quit Midway through, or just change the RP out of nowhere. I will try to make the RP as interesting as possible. \n\nPM or message me if interested.",

            "selftext": "**DO NOT MESSAGE ME IF YOU DID NOT READ ALL OF THIS, I WILL KNOW IF YOU DID OR NOT**\n\n\nAd revisionnnnnnn.  I'm consistently available and would **prefer my partners are too, ghosting is a serious problem** and have been RPing for 12 years.  I'm here looking for action-adventure type fandom RPs with plenty of character interaction and development focus rather than JUST constant ego stroking fight scenes.  Environmental and interpersonal exploration is good too, throw some bits and pieces of slice of life into the mix and I'd say it's perfect.  I only play Female characters and I prefer that whoever approaches me plays one as well as I've had basically zero good experiences with male character players.  That is to also say if any romance occurs I prefer it be Female X Female.  I'd prefer that a partner that approaches me is 18+ in most cases and OOC gender doesn't matter as long as the character being played is Female.  I'm in the CST timezone of America and I tend to stay up all night and be asleep in the day.  Nocturnal sleep schedule and such so I work rather well with EU, Australia and other late night Americans.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs for fandoms themselves, some I am fine with both sides playing an OC or a partner playing a canon if one wishes to, though I'm honestly a bit picky in terms of OCs of some fandoms.  In a descending order will tell you which fandoms I currently have the most muse for at the moment and at the bottom are ones I usually do but would need something particularly good to really be up to put something together for.\n\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nSplatoon\n\nPokemon\n\nDragon Ball\n\nHunterxHunter\n\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid ~~(I suppose if one is up for playing a canon in that and shoehorning all sorts of stuff, sorta just something someone dragged me into trying once which applies as an option)~~\n\nMaplestory 2 based stuff maybe if one is up to it.\n\nLittle Witch Academia\n\nKingdom Hearts (Kinda iffy on this unless you come with a solid plan)\n\nThere are a few others but they're not ones I'm all too interested in playing alongside someone else's OC unfortunately so I'm leaving them out.  You're also free to suggest fandoms if they're anything like the ones listed above and if it tickles my fancy I can definitely give it a go.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Platforms**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only use Discord.\n\n\n\n**Age Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI usually prefer my partner being 18 or older given I'm 23 but in some cases I can make exceptions if I'm feeling it.\n\n\n\n**Character Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI prefer whoever I am writing with to play a Female character.  I've had zero good experiences with male ones and have just been put off from them entirely.  With that said I also only play Female characters.  I only play OCs myself but if the partner wants to they can play either a canon character or an OC, their choice as long as it's a female.  I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.  Basically if aiming for a romance I'd prefer the partner character being the one making advances and such.\n\n\n\n**Romance Junk since it was mentioned**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only do FxF but am fine regardless of if it's OCxOC or OCxCanon.  Makes no difference to me as long as the character itself is appealing.  I prefer it being slow burn/developing over the course of a play than immediately set up before even starting.  Won't do CanonxCanon though cause I'm garbage at playing Canon characters.\n\n\n\n**Post Length Stuff**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs long as you're detailed/descriptive and got good grammar it'll fine and stuff.   I'm a rather literate person and can easily put out multiple paragraphs if given enough to work with and I'd prefer that my partner is plenty literate as well while also giving me paragraph posts.  But I am rather flexible on this depending on a situation within a scene.  Exceptions and times I'd allow shorter than a single paragraph being when a situation within a scene becomes back and forth plain chatter and so on.\n\n\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done.  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Vaal  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",
