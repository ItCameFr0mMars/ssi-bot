There is nothing worse than writing three or four paragraphs and only getting one in return. Now will my post always be over 2,000 words? Of course not! But as a rule of thumb be able to have quality and quantity. I don\u2019t care if a comma is out of place, if you have a run off sentence, if you use then instead of than. I\u2019m not a stickler for grammar and punctuation, as long as I can read it I\u2019m good. I am looking for someone to contribute to the story. I don\u2019t want to make all the decisions, it is a partnership after all. To be able to bounce ideas and develop a story together is one of the best aspects of a roleplay. I will be providing a writing sample. I ask that you be prepared to have one or to be honest on whether you can match mine.\n\n\nI love a good romance but I\u2019m not looking for instant romance and just jumping into bed with anyone. I am okay with pretty much anything and if I\u2019m uncomfortable with something I will tell you as I expect you would for me. I am however only interested in fxf romance. Please do not ask me to change my mind because I won\u2019t. Because I am fine with NSFW subject matter I need to have a partner who is over 18+ and would prefer 21+.\n\n\nNow for the good stuff, what type of roleplays that I would like to do. The genres that I having a craving for are: historical, modern and slice of life. I will also do supernatural and fantasy as well. I have several ideas and prompts(they are stared if I have an prompt) the ones that I have listed below and would go into further detail once you get in touch with me.\n\n\nActor x mentor/instructor*\nBodyguard x Principal*(I really really want to do this)\nAnything historical\nAlternative history aftermath of WWII\nDemon x summoner*\n\n\nAll and all I\u2019m an approachable person and little shy but like to talk OOC and be friendly. I prefer to roleplay over email or google docs but have no problem using discord as well. Hope to hear from you soon!\n\n",

Thats cool. Totally your beer, but I will never treat you like this. If I dont like something, I gonna let you know. Respect and everything, even though we dont know each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRPs I am craving for:\n\nOverwatch (McHanzo, Reaper76 etc.)\n\nDCU or Marvel (I have specific pairings, like Superman x Batman or ToddxGrayson.) Just ask me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRP's which I could be talked into:\n\nLeague of Legends\n\nReal-life things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last point really depends, but we will see.\n\nOkay, I think I got everything.\n\nPm me if you're interested.",

I don\u2019t really care how much you write, just as long as it\u2019s moving the story forward, but preferably stay away from one liners and very short posts. I do care about quality of the writing. I know everyone makes mistakes but I would like to be able to understand your messages. \n\nIf any of this caught your attention feel free to message me or leave your discord!",

I'm a 22 year old student looking for a new chill rp partner to share plots and build a plot/ we both will enjoy. I'm pretty much fine with NSFW (As long as you are of the legal age) but it shouldn't be the become the focus of the story.  \n\n\nCurrently I am craving for some sci-fi since I have been playing fantasy nonstop but don't let that stop you from approaching with a fantasy plot! I'm personally not very strict with grammar since we all make mistakes and English is my second language. As for length I'm okay with there are moments of one liners if you or me couldn't think of anything at the moment and I'm not looking for you to write a novel with every post, just write what's you think its best or in your mood.  I do personally prefer third person but I'm willing to adjust to first person.   \n\n\nI have a few plot ideas for a cyberpunk and a space Sci-fi rp but im more than willing to hear what kind of plot you are willing to share! If you are interested then PM me for details! If not then good luck on you search.",

I want to create a simple system of growth that rewards and encourages players to stick around, but not one that is built on numbers. I favor freeform combat heavily. \n\n\\-Site chat is handled through Discord for ease of access.\n\nIf any of this sounds good at all to you, please, contact me! We can be speak briefly here and move to Discord once introductions are out of the way!\n\nI would like to build a diverse staff dedicated to telling a story!\n\nI hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Before I get started I want to make it clear that I\u2019m pretty laid back but this post is gonna be somewhat strict. I\u2019ve come across a lot of people asking to roleplay but then as we begin they\u2019re aren\u2019t following the requirements I laid down to begin with. PLEASE read through everything! If you don\u2019t agree with one of my requirements then please don\u2019t contact me to roleplay. \n\n**About Me**\n\n Anyway! Hi, I'm Shadow and am currently looking for a long term roleplay partner, though that much is obvious. I\u2019m a nineteen year old female and living in the EST timezone. I have about 8-9 years of writing experience and consider myself pretty literate. \n\n**What I\u2019m Searching For** \n\nI am searching for someone who can write a well amount. I\u2019m talking around two to three paragraphs minimum. I understand dialogue can lessen this, but that doesn\u2019t mean you give me strictly dialogue and little detail. I also get writer\u2019s block, but even then I\u2019d like to see the thought process behind the character and all that. I can't stress this enough. There have been multiple occasions where my partners start out strong but fail to carry out when it comes to length. These replies usually die down to a sentence or two and I will not tolerate it. I really want to grow as a writer and I don't see myself doing that when given a few sentences to work with. \n\nI\u2019m also looking for someone who wants to chat OOC. I love building a friendship with my partners and sharing pictures/music that remind me of our characters. So, if you aren\u2019t very social or don\u2019t really want to talk then I\u2019d skip over me and look for someone else. \n\nI will only roleplay on Discord and in third person. \n\n\n**What I\u2019m Interested In**\n\nSandbox! I\u2019m all for sandbox. It leaves a ton of room to do whatever we want, which means a long term roleplay. I almost always do dystopian future settings and possibly some fantasy thrown in there. \n\nI rarely ever do fandoms but I may be open to a Fullmetal Alchemist world with our own characters. It would take place after the events of the series and our two characters could be upcoming alchemists? We can talk more about the plot if interested.\n\nOther than that I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m interested in right now, I\u2019ve been kind of branching out due to partners having some pretty amazing ideas so I guess I\u2019ll just continue with that. Just throw whatever ideas you got at me and we can figure something out! \n\nI will not do modern, most fandoms, canon characters, historic, smut (I prefer to fade to black). I can\u2019t think of anymore, but we can talk about that later. \n\nIf you're interested or just have questions shoot me a message.",

            "selftext": "**No Discord, no kik**\n\nWell, hello there, everyone!\n\nYou can call me James. I\u2019m 25 years old, RPing for the past six or seven years. My style is third person, past tense, the-more-written-the-better. That means I\u2019ll have no problem sending and recieving a few shorter replies every now and then when the plot/action calls for it, but I\u2019ll generally strive to give multi-para replies.\n\nMy preferred pairing is M/F (with me playing as the male main) but I can double on occasion, if the plot calls for it.\n\nI\u2019m on the GMT +2 timezone, if you care. You can expect me to reply 1-3 times a week. I will try to let you know if something\u2019s happening in my life that will keep me from replying. English is not my first language, but no one complained yet about my writing! :) I do try hard to write well, so this is not an issue at all.\n\nI have one big craving at the moment: Batman. Basically, if you\u2019re into the fandom, send a messgage, and we\u2019ll brainstorm! I\u2019m pretty much open for suggestions. However, I have an original idea for a Bruce/Pamela RP. Yep, Pamela. The premise is that Pamela is brought to a hospital after her incident with Woodrue. Bruce, as the main donor of the hospital, in his first years as Batman, takes an interest in her, hoping to assist her recovery and turn her into a role model/symbol of hope for Gotham. However, Pamela\u2019s descent to madness and villainy is inevitable, and Bruce might have an accidental part in that, too. I\u2019d love to RP this thing as a slow burn action/tragedy/drama, exploring our own OC (R-Rated, gritty, dark) Gotham and other characters in it, depicting Pamela\u2019s journey. This is a plot I'm really, really craving to play. Really.\n\nI do have an idea for a Jason Todd/Harley RP, but it's kind of out there and off-canon. Inquire if you're imaginative and flexible! :)\n\nLimits on content can be discussed privately, but I'm not very sensitive, squeamish or conservative. \n\nYou can PM me here, and then we can chat, plot, brainstorm and write over e-mail! I might be convinced to switch to Gdocs, but we have to talk a little over e-mail first.\n\nThat\u2019s all, folks! Have a great day!",

I have been roleplaying for about 15 years and still enjoy building new stories and characters to enjoy with my partners. I am around almost all the time, so I do ask that my partners be very very active as well and have large chunks of day/night to play. I roleplay in the third person only and hate drama in my roleplays. Preferences beyond this can be discussed when we talk.\n\nWith that out of the way, I suppose I should move on to what I am looking for.\n\nI was thinking of a spin on The Greatest Showman, so I am searching for someone to take on a P.T. Barnum role ( can be an original character, but should be able to fill the shoes).\n\nI don't want a huge wall of text, so the exact prompt can be discussed between us and fleshed out together to make sure we both enjoy the story.\n\nSince this is romance and will have NSFW moments, I ask that all my partners be 18+. I am also searching only for Male partners.\n\nIf interested, please message me and we can exchange information.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration\n",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Jack, and for the past year or so, me and some buddies have been creating a Discord server to roleplay in the video game universe of Fallout. However, we decided this wouldn't be a one-off thing and to make it a virtually endless project. With this comes a team of experienced Game Masters who create brand new stories and supply the server with copious amounts of content. We are currently in the need of more people to join up and create some characters! We don't have any player limits, so if you're curious to participate, feel free to! The server would love to welcome aboard some fresh faces.  \n\n\nWhile this takes place in the Fallout universe, me and my team of Game Masters have created an entirely original setting for this project, with new characters, locations, and stories, all of which take place in the glamorous New York City. Any and all templates/rules can be found of the server.  \n\n\nI'll see you there! If you have any questions, please don't be afraid to comment or send me a message. Thanks, - Jack  \n\n\nThe invite link is - [https://discord.gg/fKFU3h](https://discord.gg/fKFU3h)",

I haven't figured out how the  plot would go as I haven't seen a full walk through of the game (mostly  because I'd rather experience it myself) but I'd love to experiment with  ideas!  A lot of my own characters would fit great into the game world  seeing half of them are Russian or Russian citizens from another  country.  I'd love to brainstorm any ideas you may have and I look  forward to meeting you!  PM me your kik if you're interested!",

I have been roleplaying for about 15 years and still enjoy building new stories and characters to enjoy with my partners. I am around almost all the time, so I do ask that my partners be very very active as well and have large chunks of day/night to play. I roleplay in the third person only and hate drama in my roleplays. Preferences beyond this can be discussed when we talk. \n\nWith that out of the way, I suppose I should move on to what I am looking for. \n\nI was thinking of a spin on The Greatest Showman, so I am searching for someone to take on a P.T. Barnum role ( can be an original character, but should be able to fill the shoes). \n\nI don't want a huge wall of text, so the exact prompt can be discussed between us and fleshed out together to make sure we both enjoy the story. \n\nSince this is romance and will have NSFW moments, I ask that all my partners be 18+. I am also searching only for Male partners. \n\nIf interested, please message me and we can exchange information. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.  ",

I'm looking for a good Star Wars RP!\n\n*Note:* I'm only really familiar with the movies and no additional shows or other media, so would prefer to have it set within or between the three trilogy timelines. \n\nI've been writing on and off for a long time, over a decade now. I write in *3rd person past tense multi-paragraph* form with a general minimum of 2 paragraphs per reply, context permitting. I'm not afraid to - and often do - go over Discord character limit! I love little details and exploring characters as people, so I do require internal thoughts and feelings to be written! It's a bit difficult to get invested in a character and story if it's just 'he said/did this. she said/did this'. What about how they feel about it?\n\nFor NSFW elements and adult themes, I'm comfortable with pretty much anything with one exception. Also worth mentioning, if romance is present and progresses to the point of particular adult activities, I am comfortable writing things out in detail but sometimes will want to fade to black.\n\nSince adult themes may be involved 18+ *only* (Sorry!)\n\nFor this roleplay I would like us to discuss things OOC and do the actual roleplay on Discord. I would like for us to be friends too, if possible! If interested, please PM me with your age, what I can call you, a bit about your writing style, NSFW limits, and your favorite color. Any messages without this info will be ignored. Please do not contact me if you're expecting smut to be a huge part of this roleplay. If you have any questions let me know!",

            "selftext": "Ori sat at the tavern bar, a long hood shrouded her face. Although the bustling atmosphere of the tavern still buzzed around her, many eyes kept a close watch on her. She was a tiefling, and around these parts many tieflings didn\u2019t come through Daggerford. Still, she had coin and to the barkeep a paying customer was a paying customer. She sipped on the tankard full of ale, and kept her face down low so she didn\u2019t give anybody a reason to pick a fight with her. She simply wanted to eat some grub then retreat out to her small temporary camp that lay in the outskirts of town.\n\nAs she finished her drink and dropped a few copper pieces on the counter, a person approached and sat next to her, turning to face Orianna completely. She tensed up as she felt them look at her, but made no action - at least not in the middle of this tavern, but she does feel for the dagger just in case. She looked and asks  the mysterious stranger \u201cDo you have business with me?\u201d The person finally speaks. They say...\n\n\n//\n\nHowdy folks! Looking for a partner my roleplay that takes place in the Forgotten Realms. I\u2019ve been playing a lot of DND and would like to play something along with that whole thing. Romance, Adventure, Fighting and everything! Male or female character welcome, I\u2019m not picky or have a preference. What I ask for in my Roleplay partners is simply writing in 3rd person, response at least once a day, although 3-5 times a week is acceptable. I\u2019ll mostly be active around the same time everyday ( 7-10pm west coast ) so I\u2019ll try to reply at the minimum once a day. 1-2 or 3 paragraphs is good for me, if you put out more, I tend to put out about the same too. Lastly, I try to have decent grammar but my phone does sometime mess with me, so I accept typos if you accept mine haha. Let me know if there\u2019s any interest or alterations you have in mind!\n",

Technically, I can do PMs but my replies would be so ridiculously slow you would probably think I was ignoring you, which is why I prefer KIK the most. Email is... okay. I've done it in the past, and it's one of my least preferred methods, for no real particular reason. \n\nI RP just about anything except romance, and to elaborate: if a plot is focused solely on such, I'm honestly not interested. I don't even like movies where it's heavily driven by it. I like romance that's a subplot, but not _the_ plot, does that even make sense? \n\nI'm 21, by the way, so don't be afraid to want to RP darker things, or sex scenes. I'm utterly terrible at things like world building, it's daunting, even for making up my own stories. The only pairing I don't do is FxF, for some reason, I just can't do it. I do MxM just fine, but whatever, just another way I'm weird I guess?? BUT ANYWAY, feel free to comment or message me if you'd like to RP or even chat, I do so in third person novel style (with quotation marks, reply length heavily varies, but I never do one word, one sentence replies).",

I am looking for a long term buddy, now before I get into anything I would like someone literate and at least creative with what they're writing. Also, the point of this is Romance too. I am fine with any pairings, except FXM. Though I am fine with doing FXF, MXM, and MXF, that's really the only point I can stress. I would like development, not our characters instantly in love or anything like that, a crush is different. I am open to your ideas as long as you don't control and force my Role. I have really been wanting FxF but my preferred is also MxF.\n\nI do plenty of Fandoms, I have been Roleplaying for five years now and I can say I am very literate. I strive for that, makes everything better for me. I don't mind smut, as long as it's plot driven. I do love a dark Roleplay, but if anything like that doesn't suit you then tell me.\n\nI Roleplay Naruto, Pokemon, Marvel, DC, Last of Us, Avatar, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Legend of Korra, My Hero Academia and Teen Wolf. I can play canon Characters, we can also mash together ships that don't exist too. I also love themes with Supernatural. I always wanted a Werewolf Roleplay, or even a Vampire Roleplay would sound good to me. It is a great outlet for me, and don't forget to list your themes too. Or any you were interested in. \n\nWhat I look for in my Partners I wish for them to be understanding of lives. We do not always have free time, and business does come around eventually. Try to accept that I won't always be here 24/7 to Roleplay. Another, being literate and creative is a must I can only find find motivation if my partner is doing their best in a response. I do understand some areas will be shorter given the ordeal. I'm pretty laid back, so it's hard to bother me. \n\nLet's not shy away from OC either, I'm more than happy to create one with you! So if you're moderately interested, give me a message. Within the message, tell me about yourself a little bit and what topic you wish to Roleplay in. I may consider playing female if that person is very literate, and if said person desires a female.\n\nP.S I only use Discord, but you have to message me in direct messaging. Or I likely won't answer to you.",

            "selftext": "Hello all! So as the title says I'm looking for an email rp in three different specific genres/plotlines. \n\nThe first is War. This could be a real war in the past (I'm partial to the American civil war and ww2), or a war we make up. Has ww3 finally happened? I am not too familiar with sci-fi futuristic plots though. I have some plots already for this if you want to hear them.\n\nThe second is set on the Oregon trail. This could be two travelers, a woman kidnapped by a native American and has to adjust to life with them, an arranged marriage, anything. \n\nThe last one is a very specific idea. There are a lot of triggers in this one (drugs, abuse, kidnapping). Basically a couple move into a neighborhood and something is off about them. The man is much older than the woman he claims is his wife, and she is rarely seen outside. I have ideas for different ways this can play out in different eras! \n\nNow a little about me: \n-28 years young, with the lifestyle/joints of an 80 year old (just ask my group of silver haired gym buddies haha!)\n-stay at home mom so can reply daily under most circumstances (unless I'm sick because I have a lot of health issues), but I'm not too picky on how often you reply\n-smut friendly (I have a few limits, can discuss in detail during planning)\n-I don't mind post counts fluctuating and evolving organically depending on what's happening, just please no consistent one liners. I've done rps with anywhere from 1 paragraph-12+ paragraphs in the past, though my comfort zone is in the 2-5 paragraph range per character\n-3rd person past tense\n-currently email only\n-Prefer to play female characters, but will double/triple/etc with characters of any gender and orientation\n-original characters only\n-I love face claims but they aren't required\u00a0\n\nIf you are interested send me a message for my Email! \n\nPS. (It sucks that this needs to be said) I am not looking for a relationship outside of a friendship with anyone. Romance stays in the rp. Please stop sending me d-pics it's just another thing for my boyfriend to make jokes about and he's already a walking meme \ud83d\ude02",

My activity has gone down and the reply time gap has widened a little as I settle down with my course outlines and homework. But it's gotten calmer and I had a sudden prompt in mind that I totally would want to work with someone on and fine tune. \n\nIts future based, aliens and planetary civilizations are all a thing. Humanity has a hero, two siblings in combat suits that protect and represent us all. (Can be earth or some colony on a planet we can make up no idea) my character is the younger brother. I'll also play the older sister as it wouldn't be too much to play both. But what I was thinking was the media and all show them as happy go lucky badasses, but deep down and behind the cameras they're tired, scarred, burnt out and almost defeated since they carry so much weight. And your OC, would be the one to find it out. And the craziness ensues after in a way that can go any direction. \n\nIts just a random idea that can totally change depending on our thoughts. It was just something I randomly thought of while reviewing a syllabus lol... NSFW is fine. As long as it's not primary focus. Romance is totally fine and welcome. I dont mind reply lengths as I know down time can be slow and short. I work the 6a-2p shift and I'm PST timezone.. I try to reply within an hour or two. Sometimes even immediately after. It just depends based on what's going IRL... if you took the time to read all the way down here. Thank you so much and I hope to hear from you! ",

I don't expect a post every day but I'd like to not wait a week for a single response.\n\nNow for the plot discussion, what I was thinking about is basically a Pokemon adventure set in one of the seven regions but with a more mature(But not excessively so) setting. And possibly NSFW? I know that could be a deal breaker for some... but any characters involved would be over 18.\n\nI have several plots ready for some of the regions, we don't have to use them though. I'm not going to post them in the event somebody steals them though, it's happened in the past but not here.\n\nAs for where the roleplay takes place.... Discord or here's fine. Just message me which you'd prefer, along with info if Discord.\n\nI believe that's everything needed to be said? If I kept your interest, feel free to send a message!",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. (The latter is a big craving at the moment. I wonder why.)\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here",

I am looking for guys who have kik who would like to roleplay with me. Longterm then. I like to build up stories. I love real life and modern fantasy. I roleplay in first person but I don't mind if you roleplay in the third person.\n\nWhen it comes down to themes, my main theme is romance. I love spicy stuff as well like NSFW. I don't have any problem with that at all. I also like drama like in getting stalked, or getting hurt and violence. It is another way of adding spice into your roleplay.\n\nI am still open for your ideas or things that you wanna change. But here are mine:\n- sister and half-brother \n- I am a new girl in your neighborhood/school\n- you are a famous popstar who is addicted and a asshole and I am your healthcoach \n- you are the best friend of my brother \n- college friends who meet again \n- boss and assistant\n- arraged royal marriage \n- princess and guard/prince \n\nI already had a few comments of guys liking my ideas but not the violence that comes with it after I explained it to them. Guys, every roleplay can be done without violence. No problem at all. Just let me know and I will adjust the story. No worries.\n\nLike I already said, I am still open for your ideas and changes. I am always open for fantasy as well\n\n!!! Hit me up in the chat. I prefer chat over message on reddit. It's faster in my opinion. \n\nI hope to hear from you soon. \n\nLoves, Ari ",

            "selftext": "Hey all!  \n\n\nHave you seen the *Dragon Ball Super* movie yet? I have, and absolutely loved it!  Personally, re-watching the series, and the non-canon movies, has been a good way of helping the wait for Kingdom Hearts 3 go by quicker; though, now I wish to write something within the Dragon Ball world! \n\nWhat am I looking for exactly?\n\nNot too sure; someone that is a Dragon Ball fan, first of all. Second, someone who would like to discuss possible plot/story ideas To carry a roleplay. Bounce ideas off one another, and such. I don\u2019t have anything too solid in mind, but that\u2019s the point of discussion. Someone who isn\u2019t against doubling, if we need more characters within the story, someone who writes in Third person, past tense, as it is my preferred POV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, this can go many ways. We can go a canon-ish approach with our favorite characters, or an AU. I do have the idea, of an AU: Where, the Buu Saga never fully kicks off, and Gohan stays as Great Saiyaman. I adore super hero stuff, so this would be a fun way to have it within Dragon Ball. Videl, of course being a main. In this, we could introduce OC characters as villains, to fight against Saiyaman.  \nOr, we can take more non-canon approaches, like all the DBZ movies- just some fun what if stories, basically. We could take a Xenoverse/Heroes route, have some time-travel fun. Its all in the air really.   \n\n\nCharacters I am open to write, but not limited to are:  :*Broly* (Super's Broly, I really liked his character in the movie.), Cheelai (Also from DBS:Broly)| Future Gohan, the Gohan from Trunks\u2019 time line|the Universe 6 Saiyans| Baby (yeah, I like a few things from GT. Hopefully that doesn't turn people away)|Trunks/Future Trunks in general| Goku Red/Time-Partoller Goku/Xeno Goku (The one in Heores that can turn SSJ4)| *Great Saiyaman*| *Videl Satan/Saiyawoman* and others.  \n\n  \nIf anyone is interested, let's chat!",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit!\n\nI hope I'm not the only one that would like to try a roleplay that focuses far more on the story than the smut side of things.\n\nBefore the roleplay starts I have to say I very heavily disagree with this charchters I'd play and it does not represent me or my views. But the idea of the story intrigued me and so i would like to try out my luck here!\n\nThe year would be 1943, the outskirts of German occupied Paris. American and British Bombers fly over on their way towards Germany,constantly harassed by fighters. On the ground civilians go about their day, as the fight in the sky up ahead ends, people relax a bit more. \n\nYour charchter could be whoever you want, a French resistance fighter? A civilian or a combat nurse? Whatever you feel would fit you the best. As the main focus of the roleplay will be the interaction between our charchters and the romance that will follow, it's up to you. I would play a German Officer coming back from the eastern front. Devastated by the destruction seen and thus sent to France for a bit more calm tasks. \n\nI hope you like the idea, for this roleplay I would like someone who's detailed and can help push a story forward without having me drag the entire story :) \nI hope to hear from you! \n\nI am available on kik and on Discord!",

Idea players would be someone who already have chemistry together, since it can be a bit hard to start with trying for pregnancy plot with a new person. I will be playing the role of Ajay.\n\nCharacters : Ajay, His wife, Her boyfriend\n\nPlot: Ajay had fallen in love with a polyamorous woman and was monogamous to her. They dated each other for a couple of years where she also dated other people and he proposed to her and she agreed and they got married. A couple of years later she got into another relationship with her bf which kept on getting stronger. After 2 years of being in a relationship with their bf, they all decide that it is best if they move in together. Ajay's wife decides to make her boyfriend the primary in the relationship and made him secondary , which means that she starts sleeping with him in bed on a daily basis compared to Ajay. His wife and her boyfriend decide to have a baby and start trying for one, which takes 4 months of trying to bear fruit. She gets pregnant and they are all very happy. Ajay's love for her only grows during this time while the bond with her bf keeps getting stronger. A few months later once the bump is big enough they go to see a doctor and figure out the gender of the baby. They throw a huge gender reveal party where all of their friends and family are invited. There are games like voting for the features of the baby which everybody would like to see like would people want the baby to have father's eyes or mother's, father's hair or mother's etc . Soon she keeps on getting bigger and further ahead in her pregnancy and Ajay and her bf take care of her. She finally goes into labour and delivers the baby. They throw a baby shower where all of their friends are invited again and everybody celebrates the arrival of a new life as the bond between herand him is now concrete. They all start raising the baby together.\n\nStarter: (The play starts just in the middle of when Ajay's wife and her bf have started trying to make a baby ( it can also start earlier ).)\n\nI wake up in the morning feeling all groggy as it was saturday. I look at the time and notice that it is 8AM. I goes over to the other bedroom where my wife and her bf sleep and knock and get no answer, realizing that they must be sleeping. It was expected since I had been woken up couple of times last night with loud noises. Making a baby seemed to be much harder than I had expected. I go over to the kitchen counter and makes some coffee for myself and pancakes for everyone. I sip on my coffee as I turns on the xbox and play a couple of games and notice that the time is now 9.30 but my wife and her bf are still not up. I wonder what time they went to sleep last night as I get up and walk up to their room again and knock on their door, a bit firm this time around as I knocks multiple times. 'Hello sleepyheads, are you guys up yet?'",

I've been so busy since the collapse, and I just found this old thing in the back of the garage. I guess I should fill you in. \n\nFor 2 years now, we've been without a lot of things. Government, public services, electricity, you name it. Money isn't really worth anything (not that anyone has any.) and people seem to be living only to survive. Luckily, we can still get gas, though. There's plenty of oil fields here, and if you've got something to trade, you can fill your gastank. \n\nIf you're going to drive, you'd better know what you're doing. Gangs roam the highways, looking to take anything they can. Wichita is a no-go now, and Kansas City is even more of a hell-hole. Staying West is the best bet anymore.\n\n I'm taking a trip to Topeka tomorrow, and I've only got a few shells left for ol' Darlene. Hopefully I can find what I need and get the hell out.\n \nAnyway, I've got a lot to do. Maybe I'll pick this up again in another two years.*\n\nIn 2021, Inflation reached a breaking point. Money was worth nothing, the government was in shambles, and nobody could control the constant rioting. Soon after, everything came to a grinding halt. Since then, people have been surviving in whatever way they can. \n\n\u2014\n\nHey guys! I've been watching Western movies lately, and I had an Idea. I want that same experience, except with fast cars instead of horses. People will have some small settlements, and outlaws roam the plains. \n\nI realize that this isn't very well structured, but it all kind of came to me really suddenly. I wanted to jot it down before I forgot. \n\nAnyway, I'm looking for a partner (18+) for this setting. I definitely like to write romance (MxF only) but it isn't a nessecity. I use discord, and I write 3rd person, past tense. \n\nAs far as an actual plot goes, I want to hear your suggestions! Shoot me a PM and we can get to talking!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello there! I'm searching for someone to do a lengthy Pokemon roleplay with, if you couldn't guess by the title! I'm looking to include a few rather...obscure elements we can discuss through PMs, but one of them involves one of the classes from the tabletop game! Although that is mostly in concept rather than execution. I'm hoping to play a pair of younger kids who are introduced a small bit into their journey, rather than right at the beginning, although that is rather up to us!\n\nI\"m fine with all the regions except Alola, I feel it doesn't quite have enough landmass to do quite what we would want to do. I have a slight preference to Sinnoh, however, since it's my favorite region! The adventure will involve legendaries of varying pokemon, depending, once again, on the scene we want to go with!\n\nThe kids would be young to early teens, think 12-14 in ages. We wouldn't need to be the same age, but we could discuss. I'm not the best at leading the scenes, but I'm pretty good at larger scenes in general, small scenes are sorta...hard for me to create, and I would need some help! I'm also happy to take advice from you! Please Pm me to hear more, hope to hear from you Soon!  \n\n\nAs an added, I'm also looking for someone with decent writing skills, and the ability to help lead the story, thanks! ",

But first, let me tell you a little bit about myself to get your blood pumpin\u2019. \n\nMy name is Josh, or JP, and I\u2019ve been writing and roleplaying for over 8 years. Ever since I was 11, I\u2019ve had a knack for descriptive writing that expanded as I got older. I wide array of vocabulary, and I can assure you that it\u2019ll be one of or one of the most pleasant experiences you\u2019ve ever had. With my experience, I also harbor a literate passion for NSFW themes. \n\nWith that said, let me give you an idea of what ideas I\u2019d like to play with. However, if I cannot post anything too sexual here, I\u2019ll have to send them in a PM for you. But both of them involve heavy NSFW content. \n\nPlease message me on Reddit first with any ideas, or questions that you may have. I\u2019d also like to see your kinks if possible so we can see if we click a little better or if there\u2019s any kinks you want to explore. \n\nAnyways, thank you for reading my long ass post. I really hope you appreciate it, give me some effort on your end and I\u2019ll return it on mine definitely. Also, put a random emoji in your first message so I know you read everything. \n\n&lt;I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+&gt; ",

With that being said, this is Earthland as you have never known it. Your story starts in the Kingdom of Fiore. Once upon a time, about 300 years ago there was a Dragon civil war which wrecked havoc all across the world, but most notably in the Kingdom of Fiore. The human populace had few means to fight back. There were dragon slayers but they were hardly a match for actual dragons. When the war began coming to a close, most of the Dragon slayers had died, only a few remaining, these weapons of war went their separate ways. Over time the world would begin to rebuild and bring structure and order to a world left in chaos. However even though the world was getting back on it's feet, it was far from peaceful. There were still the occasional dragons, though not all meant harm, humans did their best to kill them out of fear. Adding onto the troubles there were also roaming bands or bandits and marauders. To combat these criminals, people who had the innate ability to use magic, banded together to fight them. Eventually Magic Guilds would form and jobs of varying degrees and and parameters would be taken to help the citizens. Those who would still rather prey on the normal everyday civilians would also come together forming Dark Magic and otherwise Guilds to combat the Legal wizard guilds. And so Dark Guilds were born.\n\n[https://discord.gg/zkBNMXg](https://discord.gg/zkBNMXg)",

I'm looking to include a few rather...obscure elements we can discuss through PMs, but one of them involves one of the classes from the tabletop game! Although that is mostly in concept rather than execution. I'm hoping to play a pair of younger kids who are introduced a small bit into their journey, rather than right at the beginning, although that is rather up to us!\n\nI\"m fine with all the regions except Alola, I feel it doesn't quite have enough landmass to do quite what we would want to do. I have a slight preference to Sinnoh, however, since it's my favorite region! The adventure will involve legendaries of varying pokemon, depending, once again, on the scene we want to go with!\n\nThe kids would be young to early teens, think 12-14 in ages. We wouldn't need to be the same age, but we could discuss. I'm not the best at leading the scenes, but I'm pretty good at larger scenes in general, small scenes are sorta...hard for me to create, and I would need some help! I'm also happy to take advice from you! Please Pm me to hear more, hope to hear from you Soon!\n\nAs an added, I'm also looking for someone with decent writing skills, and the ability to help lead the story, thanks!",

Something romantic but nonsexual, something cuddly and happy and snuggly. I know it's not for everyone but I'm just looking for someone who'd want to give it a shot. I roleplay third person paragraph style and I can play either a man or a woman. I prefer to work over PM or Discord but I'm openminded. If you'd like we can discuss plots and scenarios over PM :) And if you'd like to try a fandom we can discuss it! I'm open to trying a fandom, perhaps Overwatch! Or My Hero Academia since I just got into that! I know they\u2019re real life people but maybe something with the Rooster Teeth personalities, I\u2019m open :) if you have a fandom you wanna suggest please do! Also I would like a partner is 18+. Just personal preference! Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m seeking out some new stories, preferably over email. I\u2019d also settle for Discord if that\u2019s more your thing.\n\nSome things about me:\n- 22 y.o. Female\n- Will write male or female characters\n- I will also double, but not for the sake of making the other happy. It must fit into the story.\n- MxF for romance, however platonic and characters of all gender identities are perfectly welcome.\n- Fade to black, please. I don\u2019t write to indulge my own fantasies, but to tell a story. I\u2019m happily engaged and I\u2019m doing this to have fun and improve my writing.\n- I write using heavy description. It\u2019s how I naturally write, and I don\u2019t expect you to mirror me. However, if I give three paragraphs please don\u2019t give me one sentence.\n- No incest, huge age gaps, or anything morally questionable please. You know what I\u2019m talking about.\n- I enjoy dark themes, angst, fluff, and drama. Tear at my heart strings and then sew them back together again. \n- I prefer to write with other females. This is to avoid some uncomfortable situations I\u2019ve experienced in the past. \n\nOkay! Now on to fandoms:\n\n- Pokemon. Any gen, prefer darker themes. I enjoy canons for this. I have experience playing several, just ask! For pairings? I die for Serena/Calem and Steven/Zinnia. All others are up for suggestion!\n- Fire Emblem. I\u2019ve played Fates (Conquest), and am working my way through Echoes and Awakening. It\u2019d be cool if we did something using the world but our own characters. But I\u2019ll play a canon if there\u2019s one you\u2019re really wanting.\n- Naruto. Again, would really like to use the world with our own characters. Besides, I\u2019m still working through Shippuden. That shit\u2019s long. \n- Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley. Same idea as above!\n- Suggest! I\u2019m a huge nerd and drawing a blank on a lot of stuff I enjoy. Chances are I\u2019ve seen it or played it.\n\nOriginals:\nForbidden pairings, opposites attract, modern settings with a supernatural twist. Give me any of it. You have a plot you\u2019re dying to do? Pitch it to me.\nHere are a few ideas:\n\nSuperhero x Villain\nFestival-goer x Musician\nSoulmates separated by distance and circumstance\nNerdy x Rebellious\nDemon/Mischievous Spirit x Human\n\nYou get the picture. I like corny stuff and hidden secrets. Hope to hear from you soon!  ",

            "selftext": " \n\n**Hello and Welcome!**\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this long post. Before you begin reading the huge wall of text I just wanted to preface the entire post with a few things that i'm looking for going into this idea. Right now we only have two members but we're open and ready to take in more characters! \n\n* This is a Group Roleplay with original characters. Each main character has an ideal plot-line and specific traits that they must adhere to, but for the most part the rest of their backgrounds and personalities are determined by their writers.\n* Nobody can lay claim to multiple main characters; unless it would be needed to fill in spots.\n* The main story will begin once the Lord and Micheal Roles have been filled.\n* Romance is open within the story\n* The story is open to Original Characters that are regular civilians apart from the Mafioso and smaller mafia roles that would work under the main group such as: maids, butlers, gardeners, debt collectors, intelligence agents, lawyers, soldiers, nuns, priests, weapons dealers, etc;  A 2nd group of antagonists (villains) will be introduced later on.\n* Posting frequency is not a big issue, but for larger plot points those involved will all need to be present. Time will stop within the world to finish plot points that will move the story further.\n* ANIME OR DIGITALLY DRAWN IMAGES ARE USED FOR VISUAL REFERENCES. This is just a personal preference of mine. (Face-claims of real people don't sit well with me.)\n* Literacy when writing is kept at a minimum (as long as it keeps the story moving forward); Just use spell check and proper grammar and everything will be fine.\n* This story has religious themes.\n\nIf you're okay with everything above then let me explain the story! A TL;DR:\n\nThis story is largely inspired by the anime Katekyo Hitman Reborn. The story follows an heir that unknowingly is chosen to become the next head of the Italian Mafia: Evangelo. This family has been around for years, passing their roles from one generation to the other, their mission being to protect their country and their civilians so that they can lead a peaceful life, but within the past few generations of the family this idea was lost and pushed aside in favor of power and wealth. The current head of the family without an heir has chosen to pick from an estranged bloodline in the family, tracing back to the very first generation, in hopes that they would be able to push the family back on track.\n\nMany within the family disagree with the decision the current boss has made, favoring another one of the archangels of the family to take the spot instead. With a family so large and torn apart at the seams, and the chosen heir refusing his fate there is no knowing how the future will look.\n\nShould you be interested in taking part of this journey feel free to join my discord server for this story: [https://discord.gg/JpMvr3p](https://discord.gg/JpMvr3p)\n\nAny questions can be directed here! If not, feel free to join me to chat about ideas or to read how the story will turn out. I look forward to seeing you all in either case! (I might just end up writing by myself, haha.)\n\nBelow this line is the full story and the descriptions of each character. Thank you for your time and for reading everything here!\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n**^(History)**\n\n^(The year was 1806 and the place was in a small rural town in Italy. Eight Civilians gathered around a table at the home of Leon Di Evangelo as they discussed the heavy war that was threatening to destroy their once peaceful village in the name of religion.Their country was at war with another at the stake of their religion, the enemy wanting to convert their Catholicism to another belief and the land their homes were placed on was right in the middle of the countries which made their land highly sought after as a battle ground. Little was known about this group of vigilantes that emerged but what was known was their will. It was strong within their faith and they wanted to fight for what they believed in even if it meant losing their lives.) \n\n^(Their leader held the courage of twenty-men, leading without a hint of doubt in his abilities and strength. He was known as the Lord. The man right beside him helped the leader with his knowledge and prowess in strategy. He was the Lord's right hand man and shield Micheal. Seeking out punishment and maintaining order was the Lord's 3rd man Gabriel. With his level head and precision he was the best in scouting. The 4th man healed the team with his expertise in herbs and medicine. He was the best medic in town and as such there was no competition when it came to healers. His name was Raphael. Most of the manpower came from the 5th team member Uriel which served as the Lord's fury and Strength. As his sword he could plow down through groups of men and open up spots for his comrades to strike. Jehudiel did not do much fighting but they did serve an important role of keeping his friends well fed and tended to. They were not very skilled as fighter as he was a lowly servant, but he did his role with gusto and pride to help the cause. Reloading, creating, cleaning. It was all done by him. The Priest from their town's church would not be found in his place of worship as he joined the Lord and his friend in their fight to preserve their Religion. He fought vigorously with prayer and might as Selaphiel. When apart the one that would keep all of them in contact with those that they needed to be in contact with was the messenger Barachiel. Without his agility and stamina they would not have been able to be in contact as much as he allowed them to be.)\n\n^(All 8 of these men came to be known as the Lord and his Archangels or as they are known as now, The Famiglia Evangelo. They were Evangelists at the beginning and their efforts were not in vain as they eventually helped regain their town's peace. People often speculated that the true Lord himself granted these men supernatural abilities to win the war. At the end of the war they were offered a place as the King's Knights, but all refused to continue their peaceful lives. Unfortunately this would not be the case as they eventually created the Evangelo name to be a group of protectors. Even though they all moved and acted separately, at the end of the day they would all be contacted if needed if the Lord beckoned.)\n\n^(Years and decades will pass, each Lord passing on their duties to their Kin, the only one being unable to do so is the 4th lord. With that being said, each archangel also followed suit in passing down their heritage to their own sons, keeping the position within the family bloodline. The family itself grew from their party of 8 to a full blown Mafia as it were known. Unfortunately, with the rise of the 4th and 5th Lord they were unable to break away from corruption. The position of Lord meant power and wealth and many were after such power and name. Eventually the family started to become split within itself some holding onto the original purpose of the group meanwhile others fought for the wrong reasons. Money being the root of it all.)\n\n^(In total there are 9 generations of the family with the 10th being the start of a new era for the Evangelo family. There are different branches of the family now as well and this all started with the 4th head which was brought into power even though he was not a blood heir. Up to his reign all leaders were the kin of those who were the original Lord and Archangels. The 3rd Lord was unable to have kin and as such he failed to pass on his title to his children and instead elected someone from within his family who was not an archangel. Even though his trust was placed on this man, the 4th head was overwhelmed with power and went crazy. He had 2 children, one which would become heir to the title and the other that was given full authority of a separate Family that would follow the main Evangelo Family for years to come. This would be the start of the Family's Decline.)\n\n^(In the present day the 9th Lord has not appointed an heir as he had no son, which would be the 2nd occurrence of a transfer of power within the family within its legacy. Many are lining up to be crowned as the leader, however he is not planning on appointing any of them. In a turn of events he has looked into the bloodline of the Family and managed to find a distant relative of the 1st Lord that was born from the 1st Lord's Sister's family tree. With this decision he hopes that someone unknowing of the Family's existence would bring it back to it's days of glory and justice rather than the destructive path of fear-mongering and greed that it is on. Many hopes and dreams rest on this move.)\n\n^(Archangel Micheal has sent his son, next in line to serve the young 10th Lord, to bring him the news without causing so much of a disturbance that would alert neighboring families to the plans of making them the Lord. As such it is only fitting that the next in line to be the 10th Archangels are to meet up for the first time to ready themselves for their inheritances. They all have to be on equal terms for to be able to rule the family with the fullest potential. Should they fail, the family risks falling apart.)\n\n**^(Familia)**\n\n* **^(Lord/God (taken))**\n\n^(This is the character I am planning to play, but that can be changed if I can find someone else who is suitable for this role. He is characterized by his love for others and selflessness. Above all this character is a man/woman who is courageous and holds a tremendous amount of power within himself. While this is true for the 1st Lord, this new Heir is anything but his predecessor. He is standoffish and cold, preferring to keep himself out of unnecessary trouble that could cause him to lose time and energy. One thing that could be redeeming about him is his ability to have a complete shift in attitude when those who are precious to him or are totally helpless are in trouble. This is evident in his love for his mother and gentleness towards children. He knows that) **^(Micheal)** ^(does not trust him nor does he like him, and tries to use this to his advantage to back out of his duty. Even then it is slightly amusing to flip-flop from taking responsibility and then flat out ignoring it just to see) **^(Micheal's)** ^(irritated reactions. Is currently a regular student.)\n\n* **^(Head of Security/Archangel Micheal (open))**\n\n**^(Archangel Micheal)** ^(has two jobs which is being the right hand man to the) **^(Lord)** ^(and keeping the) **^(Lord)** ^(safe as the head of Security for the Family and leader to the Archangels.) **^(Micheal)** ^(is characterized by their intense Loyalty to the Lord and his natural Instincts. As well, his main role of a Guardian means he is keen in his senses and a huge amount of patience. His Father follows the current Lord with total Loyalty and complete trust in every decision he makes, but deep down inside) **^(Micheal)** ^(does not agree with the choice of Lord and even thinks that the next) **^(Archangel Uriel)** ^(would be much better suited to becoming the head of the Evangelo Family. He was put in charge of bringing the new Lord to the Family base in his country to be filled in of the situation, however his lack of Lordly qualities almost made Micheal give up in bringing him at all until he was proven otherwise when they fought off some bullies picking on a young woman. Even though he does not agree with the decision, he will follow orders until it is proven that the new heir is not capable of taking responsibility. Even if it is more trouble than it is worth. Is currently acting as a transfer student in the Lord's class.)\n\n* **^(Head of Judgement/Archangel Gabriel (open))**\n\n^(As the Family grew in numbers, the 1st Lord appointed) **^(Gabriel)** ^(to be the head of all Judgement on those within the family he/she is responsible of carrying out any punishments to those who have broken any rules of the family. They are also in charge of the investigation department of the family which is directly linked with) **^(Micheal's)** ^(department. They know every member and they are in charge of any new admissions which puts him/her in the perfect spot to check out those who are not following correct conduct. As time passed each Gabriel has always had trouble trying to convince the Lord to keep certain members in or out of the Family. However, they must follow in his decision. The current) **^(Gabriel)** ^(had been newly appointed following the death of their mother, finding the change in the) **^(Lord's)** ^(bloodline to be a great decision to stop the corruption on their end of the job.) **^(Gabriel)** ^(is characterized by their Purity and their strong moral compass. Even if they are a bit OCD and try to keep everything organized and orderly, but without fail everything ends up going astray from original plans. Their stubbornness often clashes with) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(when they are giving out punishment,) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(always being the voice of reason. Is currently undergoing Law School.)\n\n* **^(Head of Medicine/Archangel Raphael (open))**\n\n^(Ever the genius,) **^(Archangel Raphael)** ^(is the medic of the Archangels with the healing touch and knowledge of modern medicine. When the Family needs to be patched up one can go to) **^(Raphael)** ^(and they'd be more than happy to help. This guardian isn't really seen much with the) **^(Lord)** ^(as he has other things on his mind when it comes to researching new advances in treatment. This angel commands the the nurses and doctors in the family, dropping in here and there to give members personal check-ups every once in awhile. While) **^(Raphael)** ^(seems happy and eager to help, he is actually hiding a dark side within himself. He doesn't really care about the Family or his position in power as a guardian and would much rather spend his time researching and experimenting in his Lab. When he is around the next) **^(Lord)** ^(he often finds himself expressing this wish to him, seeing that there might be someone else who understands the burden of this family is not worth bearing. This lack of interest causes him to butt heads with) **^(Micheal)** ^(but he always plays it off when things get too heated. Even with this distaste, he follows his duty without fail. Is currently enrolled in Med School and part-time researcher.)\n\n* **^(Head of Militia/Archangel Uriel (open))**\n\n^(All of the training the Family goes through is usually undergone by) **^(Uriel's)** ^(command and guidance. As the Lord's sword,) **^(Uriel)** ^(is the 2nd strongest member of the group, however his temper is viewed as problematic. He believes he is much better suited in leading the Family, but he doesn't let this be known too openly. The only one he has told is) **^(Micheal)** ^(but even then it was a comment that was made jokingly. He openly resists being close to the new) **^(Lord)** ^(and even is seen scolding his manners and attitude when they are together. If the two don't get along then most of the Archangel's Strength is unable to be used. This is evident in their inability to properly sync with one another when they all are as a group. However,) **^(Uriel)** ^(sees this divide as a perfect opportunity to show his Alpha Superiority to the group and often does come out on top with the majority of the group agreeing with his decision. He is the force driving the group at this point even if the current heads disagree with his behavior, most of the corrupted members of the Family like the idea of having Uriel as the new Lord. Is currently working next to his father as a soldier in the Military.)\n\n* **^(Head of Staff/Archangel Jehudiel  (open))**\n\n^(Originally the caretaker of the original Family,) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(is the leader of those maids and butlers who tend to the Houses of the Evangelo Family. Even though they mostly do the dirty work,) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(gladly does their job with excitement and love. It isn't as bad as the actual maids and butlers, but they do lend a hand here and there if something needs to be done. It's hard to not like) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(with their compassion and understanding, but sometimes that love is a little bit too much for some members. You can even say it is akin to motherly-love. Not one to take 'No' for an answer,) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(can be quite aggravating to argue with. However, do not make a mess around them unless you want to unleash the aggressive side of this dutiful maid/butler. You can often find this Archangel chummy with) **^(Selaphiel)** ^(when they are together. Of course the righteous will always join forces to get good to win. As far as the new) **^(Lord)** ^(is concerned, one could say that there might be some infatuation seen between these two even though they are quick to deny it.) **^(Lord)** ^(will say it is just a sibling love, but) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(feels otherwise.) **^(Barachiel)** ^(notices this, though they don't know if they can condone this between Guardian and Lord. They often tease) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(about this. They are currently working as the head maid/butler in the Family home while their Father is in bed with an illness.)\n\n* **^(Head of Prayers/Archangel Selaphiel (open))**\n\n**^(Selaphiel)** ^(holds the most obvious job within the Archangels as the one in charge of their Religion. The original Selaphiel was a priest at the village's church, however they were not against joining these band of characters for the preservation of their religion. In the modern generation of the Evangelo the need for Religion and Righteousness has gone ignored which causes great distress to the current Sealtiel of the Family. Not many of the members go to pray at the church and this worries them. The next) **^(Selaphiel)** ^(is not as passive as their mother and prays for the day they can restore morals back into the Family for its original purpose. Even if they have a slight white knight complex, Sealtiel is very ambitious and ready for war at any moment. This does cause conflict between him and) **^(Uriel)**^(. Just like) **^(Jehudiel)** ^(and) **^(Gabriel)** ^(He welcomes this new) **^(Lord)** ^(with open arms. Being reduced to the lowest Rank of the Archangels won't stop them from returning their Family back to Glory. Currently they are a priest in training.)\n\n* **^(Head of Communications/Archangel Barachiel (taken))**\n\n^(Communicating with important figureheads and keeping track of important dates and events is the job of) **^(Barachiel)**^(. You could say that he is more like the glue that keeps everyone in touch with the rest of the Family and the world, this messenger is the silent left-hand man for the) **^(Lord)**^(. While) **^(Micheal)** ^(does most of the work with the) **^(Lord)**^(,  if there is ever a need for a 3rd opinion Barachiel is always there.) **^(Micheal)** ^(dislikes) **^(Barachiel's)** ^(laziness and horrible attitude, but they know that) **^(Barachiel)** ^(is only acting out of dread towards the future of his duty. Secretly) **^(Barachiel)** ^(does enjoy studying up on idol groups and even had dreamt of becoming an idol themselves one day, but the blood-duty of being a guardian has stopped them from achieving or chasing said dream. Well, they'll settle for the opportunities Family Gatherings allow him. He'll enjoy being the Star until it's his turn to take on the role of the manager of their rag-tag group and be the manager instead of the shining star he wishes to be. For now he'll try to get their group into doing some fun things and keep them together as much as they can before they separate once more. Currently they are in School for Film Production.)",

My name is Cav. \n\nI\u2019ve put out some posts in this thread and I\u2019ve found some phenomenal partners, but a lot of these stories have fallen through due to scheduling problems or lack of chemistry. \n\nI\u2019m extremely busy and often lack time and energy to respond more than a few times a week. If you\u2019re looking for someone to shoot more than a few replies a day, I\u2019m not your pal. \n\nThat being said, [here's](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kYpeN3DZySLQUfan3BGLai1-loOtvyGt8szeOTU5kqI) a link with tons of info about me/my RP style. \n\nRight now, I would love a (high, low, alternative, any sort) fantasy story at the moment. If there are any other genres you\u2019re into, feel free to let me know!\n\nAll that I'm asking for is a few posts a week, a few paragraphs long (with exceptions, of course), and proper grammar, spelling, details, etc. Anyone who is able to talk OOC and shoot ideas with me would be great! I need someone flexible and understanding with scheduling.\n\nIf you're interested, send me a message! Ideally, discord is the only platform that I use, but I can make some exceptions if there\u2019s nothing else available for you. I'll probably ask for a writing sample (nothing personal, I just like to get a feel for the other person's style before we jump in), so feel free to send any bit of writing along (preferably a rp-style post) with your intro. \n\nThanks so much!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey there, I'm James, I'm a 20 year old from California, and I'm looking for a few quality roleplaying partners! I'm looking for women 18+ who are looking for a long term roleplay, and a chat partner. I like to get to know who I'm writing with, I've found that I not only write better, but also enjoy myself more when I understand who's on the other side of the screen. While talking out of character isn't strictly a requirement, I would prefer it.\n\nAs for genres, I am pretty flexible, really. My only caveat is that whatever we end up doing, it needs to have conflict. Something to keep the story moving. Just kind of wandering around can be so boring, and there is nothing that makes me lose interest in an RP faster than a stale and boring story. The conflict doesn't need to be between our characters, it can be, but it's fine if it isn\u2019t. Do you want slice of life / romance? Great! That's one of my favorite genres! It just needs something to drive the story somewhere. Fantasy? Sci-fi? Post apocalypse? Something else entirely? Perfect! Let's talk about it! I'm open to any suggestions, so long as you're flexible as to the content of the RP. I consider myself quite a creative person, and if I have some freedom, then I'll be happy.\n\nOkay, now onto the other miscellaneous stuff. I use a multitude of platforms, though I generally prefer Discord, because we can make a server and chat and rp all in one place without them interfering with each other. That said, I also have Kik and Google Hangouts, as well as Google docs. As for chatting, it doesn't need to be constant, obviously, and I'm not expecting anything grand. Just some casual conversation, getting to know each other. I'm willing to send a picture of myself once we get to know each other a little bit, but I don't expect the same. I have also been known to use a separate app to chat from the RP, especially if we use Kik or something. Also, we don't need to start with a big, long term rp. I'm fine with writing something simple for our first rp, especially if you want to get to know my style. It can just be a short scene or something quick to get familiar. Or I can send a sample of my writing. Or nothing at all, and we can just jump into a big rp!\n\nOkay, for my schedule now. This might be a deal breaker for some people, and I understand that. I'm a college student, and I work part time (20-24 hours a week), so my time to write is pretty limited. I still usually respond to rp a few times a day, especially if it's longer messages, and I can chat for most of the day, but it won't be super frequent. At least once or twice a day, though!\n\nThanks for reading! I appreciate you sticking with me all the way to the end! If you're interested, go ahead and send me a message! I can't wait to hear from you!",

You can take on as many as you like, no limits as long as you can give them detail and their own personality ( but keep in mind that they will be a gang of friends, so if you want more, than some of them will have to be those friends that you aren't as close to that's outsides of your circle of friends? (If I'm making sense).\n\nSo, it's the last week of school before summer vacation and the end of  junior year. They throw a little party by the beach and get drunk or whatever.. You know, typical teen stuff. Time passes and it's midnight, they can see an image out in the sea followed by a beautiful melodic voice. This voice knocks them out into a slumber. They wake up the next day feeling a little uneasy, but part their ways and go home. It isn't until they have made it home that they find out they have powers. They all find out in different ways and once they do immediately video call one another to tell each other the news.\n\nNow as far as how they react is up to you as well as the powers.\nPlease don't make your character overpowering that's not fun.\nThis RolePlay is supposed to be fun, but I also would like some details at least 3 paragraphs. Or 1-2 paragraphs for each character.\n\nWe can navigate how they deal with power, who ends up corrupt or broken by the power they possess. I would love some heavy topics to go into this that can add to the story. They will be high school students so some NSFW can apply, but fade to black is what I am comfortable with. And please be 20 and up for this kind of subject.\n\nFor any other info or suggestions just PM me. Thanks for reading this \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

As far as characters go I can pretty much play whatever you  wish  (Although I'd prefer to play Seras or even some of my own  characters) my  own personal characters could definitely fit in the  universe of  Hellsing and I'd love to include them in it.

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

            "selftext": "When I was little, I used to be scarred of the monster under my bed. Every night I would call my mom in to check. Some times she would pull out her spray bottle and spritz the darkness before telling me \"All clear.\" If I've learned anything since then, monsters aren't scared of spray bottles. \n\nI don't like night clubs. The loud music, the sweaty patrons, and the drunks that wander around are all great reasons to avoid the establishments all together. Sadly a girl has to work for a leaving. Wearing a short back skirt and tight top, have to fit in somehow, I push my way through the crowed only to slip into a small booth at the corner. \n\nSitting across from me is a hulking man. He's hairy, like a cross between a lumberjack and a biker, though maybe a bit larger. Still the man smiles as I approach. \"Afternoon Connor,\" I say rather dismissively, watching the man's smile drop somewhat.  \n\n\"Afternoon Laura. Do you have the stuff?\" I nods before i pull out a ziploc bag of white powder from my jacket pocket. \"This is powerful stuff. Make it last.\" The man nodded, pulling out a few strange golden coins and passing them my way. \n\nWith that connor took his leave and I let out a sigh. Now I know how it looks but I'm not a drug dealer. Nah, my job is much more dangerous. Inside that little bag was enough glamor to hide a troll for a month. Which is good because that's exactly what Connor was, a troll. \n\nI got into the business about a year ago, answering an add for part time work at an old book shop. Turns out the woman, a witch, was actually looking for an assistant. Despite the danger and the over all craziness, I would have regretted it forever if I had refused. \n\nI start to stand, eager to get out of this place when a man sits down in front of me, taking Connor's seat. He's handsome, extraordinarily handsome. The smirk on his face makes it rather clear he knows this fact well. \n\nI roll my eyes as I sit back down, glaring at the cocky vampire. Yes, they exist too. \"Shouldn't you be off finding tonight's snack.\" Vampires never killed these days, just taking enough. The bat's smirk only seemed to grow wider. \n\n\"I need a favor.\" Vince had helped me out on a separate occasion and I had learned the hard way to always repay a favor. I sighed before nodding, watching the vampire relax slightly. \"My brother is missing. I want you to find him.\" \n\nTracking down a stray vampire. That seemed...safe. \"Why don't you ask the police or something?\" \" The police don't owe me a favor, plus you have certain...talents at your disposal.\" He was right, I did. A witch, even an apprentice with like me, had a resistance to glamour's and magic. It was the only way I was able to talk to a Vampire with out getting all weak in the knees. Though the pheromones still made me blush at times. \n\n\"This is a lot to ask. I don't even know where to start.\" Vince nodded before passing a picture to me. The man in the photo looked similar to Vince same eyes, same stunning looks. \"His name is Ben. Just look around a bit okay. Maybe around Phoenix.\" Another night club, great. \n\nI took my stand, waving at Vince. \"I'll keep an eye out.\" I slipped the photo into my pocket and finally escaped the bright lights of the club, taking a breath of the salty night air. Seems like I had a job to do. \n\nSorry about the long intro, came up with this idea and i didn't know when to stop writing. I would love to find a partner for a supernatural/mystery/romance story. If you've ever read the mercy Thomson series, something along those lines. \n\nI would love someone to world build with, planning where this story will go. Right now I have no idea. Anything in here is open to change, including the characters and the favor. I just want to try and keep this feel. Also I would really prefer if my partner is open to eventual smut. Story comes first of course but I feel like sex can add a lot to the intimacy of a story. \n\nI tend to reply with 1-2 paragraphs at least a few times a day. Been roleplaying for almost 10 years now. If your interested, please send me a message. Hope to hear from you soon. ",

You pass out from your injures and later awake in a medbay. All your injuries have healed and you later find me.\nMy aim is for later in the rp when you start to develop feelings for me.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m seeking out some new stories, preferably over email. I\u2019d also settle for Discord if that\u2019s more your thing.\n\nSome things about me:\n- 22 y.o. Female\n- Will write male or female characters\n- I will also double, but not for the sake of making the other happy. It must fit into the story.\n- MxF for romance, however platonic and characters of all gender identities are perfectly welcome.\n- Fade to black, please. I don\u2019t write to indulge my own fantasies, but to tell a story. I\u2019m happily engaged and I\u2019m doing this to have fun and improve my writing.\n- I write using heavy description. It\u2019s how I naturally write, and I don\u2019t expect you to mirror me. However, if I give three paragraphs please don\u2019t give me one sentence.\n- nothing morally questionable please. You know what I\u2019m talking about.\n- I enjoy dark themes, angst, fluff, and drama. Tear at my heart strings and then sew them back together again. \n- I prefer to write with other females. This is to avoid some uncomfortable situations I\u2019ve experienced in the past. \n- last note: I want to focus on storytelling, character development, and plotting. If you\u2019re crazy about these things too, we\u2019ll get along swimmingly \ud83d\ude07\n\nOkay! Now on to fandoms:\n\n- Pokemon. Any gen, prefer darker themes. I enjoy canons for this. I have experience playing several, just ask! For pairings? I die for Serena/Calem and Steven/Zinnia. All others are up for suggestion!\n- Fire Emblem. I\u2019ve played Fates (Conquest), and am working my way through Echoes and Awakening. It\u2019d be cool if we did something using the world but our own characters. But I\u2019ll play a canon if there\u2019s one you\u2019re really wanting.\n- Naruto. Again, would really like to use the world with our own characters. Besides, I\u2019m still working through Shippuden. That shit\u2019s long. \n- Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley. Same idea as above!\n- Suggest! I\u2019m a huge nerd and drawing a blank on a lot of stuff I enjoy. Chances are I\u2019ve seen it or played it.\n\nOriginals:\nForbidden pairings, opposites attract, modern settings with a supernatural twist. Give me any of it. You have a plot you\u2019re dying to do? Pitch it to me.\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n- Superhero x Villain\n- Festival-goer x Musician\n- Soulmates separated by distance and circumstance\n- Straight-edge x Rebellious\n- Demon/Mischievous Spirit x Human\n- Comatose x Dream-walker\n- wizard x witch\n- your suggestions! \n\nHope to hear from you soon!

To summarize the concept: I've been sold to the Fae and now I have no choice but to become one of them and 'Liberate' people from their concepts of modesty and prudishness. Making them indulge in a new kink willingly? That's a Liberation. Get them into drugs or alcohol? Liberation town baby!\n\nBut that's just the start; if I fail to meet my quota, I lose my soul after 7 strikes... That is, unless I arrange a different deal with my fae masters!\n\nThere's even an interesting little interactive webpage to keep track of all the powers I gather across the roleplay! Feel free to check it out: I've already started with my first choice. The rest will come as we start! https://faypath.neocities.org/FayPath_v1_1_5_overlay.html?8000000000000g000000000000000000000\n\nKinks to include vary widely, but I\"m mostly looking for someone with very few limits. I've already planned out most of my character as I evolve into a powerful Fae in my own right, and that may involve becoming a blood drinking vampiric individual, which obviously isnt' for the squeamish!\n\nI roleplay 3rd person and I'd prefer to do this RP on Discord. The rest of the planning can happen between us! Modern, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, World/Dimension/Fanodm hopping? Whatever we wanna do baby! So check out some of those powers, come up with a few 'overlords' who I report to, and let's decide what we'd like to toy with!",

            "selftext": "https://discord.gg/MZVrnA In the Compared to Washington D.C., the Mojave survived the Great War relatively unscathed, but not for lack of trying on the part of the Chinese. At the culmination of the Sino-American War, 77 atomic warheads were launched at the city of Las Vegas and the surrounding areas, but due to intricate defense systems set in place by wealthy businessman Mr. House, 59 were forcefully disarmed mid-flight, nine were blasted out of the sky by a laser guided missile defense system atop the Lucky 38 Hotel &amp; Casino, and only nine hit the surrounding desert, leaving the city itself intact.\n\nIn the years since, the Mojave has largely been ignored by the developing post-apocalyptic civilizations: the New California Republic in the west, and Caesar's Legion to the east, thus allowing enemies of such civilizations (raiders, the Brotherhood of Steel, and super mutants, for example) to prosper there. For years, Vegas sat at its heart, decayed by almost two centuries of neglect. But when NCR advance scouts reached Hoover Dam with the intent of expanding the NCR's borders, pre-War securitrons rolled out onto the old Las Vegas Strip and rallied the three tribes occupying the city, claiming to act on behalf of Mr. House, the man who had saved the city decades prior. By the time NCR reached Vegas, the city was in full working order, and the NCR returned to Shady Sands with tales of an oasis of light in the middle of the desert. An arrangement was made whereby the NCR were given 95% of Hoover Dam's power output and McCarran International Airport as a regional headquarters, and the Strip, (and secretly Mr. House) retained its sovereignty, as well as the remaining 5% of power.\n\nSince then, the combined armies of 86 conquered tribes arrived from the east, led by Caesar and his Malpais Legate, seeking a city to call their capital. The Legion launched a massive initial attack on the Dam and the NCR troops stationed there, but were repelled by the NCR. Most of the credit went to Chief Hanlon for how he issued a tactical retreat to Boulder City and thus lured the Legion into a trap. He then routed the surviving Legionaries back across the dam, which ultimately led to the execution of the Malpais Legate. The outcome of the battle created a delicate power balance, whereby the tensions between the three big powers in the region (the Strip, the NCR, and the Legion) are the only factor keeping one another from attempting to seize total control of the region; should one attack the other, the third would take advantage of the conflict and attack in turn.

As the title of this ad notes, I'm looking to RP some lines within the Pok\u00e9mon game/anime-verse, and I'm seeking to keep the anime's lighthearted and cheery mood. Over-the-top adventure, copious humor and comedy, witty/snarky banter, meaningful conflict (no constant bleakness or perpetual angst), quiet moments of character growth, good battles, romance (I'm cool with smut, but I wouldn't want it to be the proverbial endgame), our characters genuinely having fun and enjoy each other's company, that sort of thing. (And in full disclosure, I do have a present preference for canon x OC lines. I know I'm trash.)\n\n***All partners must be 21+ years old, and all characters must be written/played as 21 years old if they aren't already older. Also, I'm only looking to roleplay over E-mail.***\n\n[This RoleplayGateway post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/9auwtv/vyces_roleplay_gateway_profile/) has all my OOC info, so I won't repost it here. (You're welcome for that. :P) Instead, let me note what I'm **not** looking to involve in any such lines...\n\n\u2620 *Mere glancing familiarity with the setting.* I'm asking partners to have fairly up-to-date knowledge on the games/anime (at least Gen 4 or 5) so we aren't significantly restricted regarding location or what Pok\u00e9mon we involve in a line.\n\n\u2620 *Making Pok\u00e9mon \"darker and edgier\".* I'm fine with a Pok\u00e9mon Origins-type tone sometimes. Something with a dark or self-serious bleak tone fitting Pok\u00e9mon Apok\u00e9lypse, however? That's not really my cup of tea.\n\n\u2620 *Fixating on game mechanics (mechanics of levels, stats, movesets, IVs, etc).*\n\n\u2620 *Enforcing the games' \"Four Moves of Doom\" limit.* Considering the anime doesn't and the games only do so for the sake of memory, why should we? :P Let's just have it so a Pok\u00e9mon can use--and learn--any of their given moves (which could be part of a plot in itself).\n\n\u2620 *Dry or one-sentence battle descriptions.* I'm certainly not demanding every single nuance receive a paragraph, but I **am** requesting partners be willing to describe moves and battles much like the anime. Just writing/reading *\"(Name of Pok\u00e9mon) used (name of attack)!\"* all the time gets boring, you know?\n\nI have a few general and open-ended ideas here to set the stage, but I'm certainly open to hearing yours...\n\n\u25d3 **The typical Pok\u00e9mon journey** is always a classic fave, our characters just traveling and having highspirited adventures fitting the series in general. (In this case, I'd prefer an *in media res* approach where both our characters are already fairly seasoned and experienced, bringing up their greenhorn days if needed.) Perhaps our characters have been traveling a long time together, or have just started doing so.\n\n\u25d3 **Perhaps one of our characters are a member of Team \\[fill-in-the-blank\\] while the other's a trainer they're tailing for whatever reason**, but they end up battling on a regular basis and ultimately falling for each other? (Think a similar version of the dynamic Ash has with the TR trio, only with some romance added to the mix.)\n\n\u25d3 **One--or both--of our characters are Gym Leaders, Frontier Brains, Elite Four members, Team Rocket members, Top Coordinators and the like.** Maybe exploring the day-to-day deal behind being one of the greats, from training their chosen creatures to dealing with some cocky greenhorns wanting to challenge \u2018em.\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters initially meet battling over a Pok\u00e9mon.** Perhaps they each have a fair case for capture, forcing a temporary team-up if the target's exceptionally clever. Or maybe they join forces to deal with a third party trying to Pok\u00e9-block them?\n\n\u25d3 **Our characters are part of an elite academy for Pok\u00e9mon trainers.** Think Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s answer to Hogwarts or something like that.\n\nNow, I'd love to find a partner willing to play Misty, Jessie, Bianca, Fantina, Delia Ketchum, or Iris from the Pokemon anime. But there are some non-Pok\u00e9mon canon ladies I'd love to see transplanted into the setting:\n\n* Mai Shiranui (*King of Fighters*)\n* Peach, Daisy (*Mario*)\n* Kuvira (*Legend of Korra*)\n* Elsa (*Frozen*)\n* Hermione, Ginny (*Harry Potter*)\n* Suki, Ty Lee, Azula (*Avatar*)\n* Mai Valentine, Ishizu Ishtar (*Yugioh*)\n\nSo if interested in this, please feel free to send me a PM!",
