            "selftext": "Greetings! Here I am on another exciting search for someone who'll venture down the rabbit hole of creative wackado stuff with me. \n\nThis week's cravings include *drumroll*\n\n...\n\nStar Wars! \n\nThere are a few dynamics I'm looking to explore. I can go into greater detail in a one on one circumstance, just so this post doesn't grow to be a thousand paragraphs long. \n\nOn to the important things!\n\nRight now, I'm mainly interested in writing Rey and figuring out how I want my version of her to be. I've got more ideas than I probably should for being so new at obsessing over this stuff, but that's always how this goes. I'm not particularly looking for a totally romance-centric plot, considering there are so many more interesting elements to the SW universe to be explored, but if you talk me into it I'll probably be flexible for you. I can create chemistry between a rock and a pool of mud, so anything is on the table there. \n\n Rey is my main focus but I'm not opposed to having multiple characters involved in a storyline. I'll try to play anyone at least once. Success rates vary, but I never butcher canon characters. And to be clear, I am looking for *canon characters only*. Again, a preference thing. I won't budge on that. \n\nAs far as style goes, I'm a bit wordy. I don't like spending hours and hours working on a post, but I never do less than five paragraphs in general. Some scenes are more dialogue heavy, and there is a margin for shorter stuff there, but as a whole, I put a reasonable effort in and expect reasonable effort back. \n\n Pm me on here and we can discuss!! \n\n",

            "selftext": "So,  I've had this idea for a while now. I've always been interested in the  relationships between classes such as paladins and clerics, and  mages/sorcerers/warlocks. The trials of faith versus magic/demons, and  how they're usually portrayed as enemies (such as the Templars and mages  in *Dragon Age*). We have a world  that's descending into chaos, wrought with religious based civil wars,.  the church and the monarchs struggling to keep their citizens under control. The Dragon Priests (*Skyrim* reference, sue me), a cult hellbent on resurrecting an ancient Dragon god (think *Tiamat* from *Dungeons &amp; Dragons)* have begun plaguing the already struggling world.\n\nTheir  only line of defense is the Order of The Old Ones, a group of Paladins  trained to take down demonic/occult forces. Their base is the basement  of the church, where they're gathering Dragon Priests, rebel mages, to  torture and pull information out of.\n\nEnter, *you.* A Paladin, female, hellbent on justice. Lawful Good, who is tasked with interrogating a new prisoner.\n\n*Me.*  Julian (Juli-en) Vorschov, a female mage who has dabbled in every dark art imaginable. Older than your paladin, she tries to charm the hero, but is quickly shut down. However,  Julian does manage to convince the Paladin to break the rules, and take  her on a journey to defeat the Dragon god.\n\nIt's  still a bit rough, but I want just a basis so I can worldbuild with  someone! I'm super into D&amp;D, so I'd love to make character  sheets/homebrew pages for our characters/items/monsters, etc. I'm very  involved in roleplays, and will make playlists, extra art, content, and  such. So I'd love someone who's just as passionate! The relationship  between my mage and your Paladin, however, will be romantic. A sort of  slow burn, enemies-to-lovers trope. I'm strict about them both being  females, but you can be a male playing a female if you want!\n\nIf any of this sounds alluring, hit me up!",

            "selftext": "*There's something* wrong *in the city of New Canaan. You didn't notice it at first, but it's been creeping up on you.*\n\n*You see it every time you read the newspapers or turn on the TV. Rampant crime. Drugs. Corruption. Murder. Law enforcement has become stretched thin. And that's where people like you have come in to pick up the slack.*\n\n*Your cases used to be simple things: unfaithful partners, missing pets and the occasional runaway kid. Lately, though, you've been asked to find missing people and even investigate the occasional mysterious death. And so far, none of these cases have had any happy endings.*\n\n*And hidden in this growing chaos is something else. Social media is ablaze with rumors about mysterious disappearances. Serial killers with disturbingly sane explanations for their crimes. Monsters that lurk in the dark places of the world. Cults working to realize inscrutable goals.*\n\n*Where will you find yourself as you dig deeper into the rot that's eating away at the neon-streaked streets of New Canaan?*\n\nWhat you've read is a short introductionary text to a scenario that I'm looking to gamemaster. The scenario is a neo-noir mystery thriller that may or may not come to involve elements of urban fantasy.\n\nIn this scenario the player will take on the role of a private investigator in the fictional city of New Canaan. The pace of the adventure will be that of a slow-burning mystery as layers of conspiracy and deceit are uncovered.\n\nThe player will be faced with difficult decisions as they struggle to get at the rot that besets their city and bring it to light. Things may seem dark, but there may be a light at the end of the tunnel. If the player works for it, that is!\n\nThe exact details of this scenario are not set in stone and will be decided through discussion. Furthermore before we even get started I will insist on a discussion to ensure that we are on the same page.\n\nNow a brief blurb about myself:\n\nMy roleplaying experience comes from about 15 years of gamemastering a variety of games for my friends. I've only fairly recently dipped into the roleplaying scene on Reddit as a way to keep my creativity active between tabletop sessions.\n\nMy style of gamemastering is quite laid back and I'm always happy to incorporate ideas from my players. I always make sure to leave my players plenty of material to work with while striving to not overwhelm them, nor to leave them in a dead-end. At the end of the day I make sure to present a world that reacts to my players' actions in interesting and believable ways.\n\nAnd really, and more importantly, I make sure that everybody involved (myself included) is having a good time. Because we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't enjoy it!\n\nAnd now a few disclaimers and general information:\n\n-This will not involve any established intellectual properties, settings or \"fandoms\". We will create something unique together. Taking inspiration from other works is, of course, absolutely welcome. Good artists copy, great artists steal, and all that!\n\n-While I don't have any problems with anime as such, I'm not a fan of making anime-esque scenarios. I find that tropes commonly associated with anime just aren't to my taste in the context of roleplaying.\n\n-This will not involve the exploration of topics one would find on certain age-locked subreddits. There's nothing wrong with that stuff, but it's not something that I will involve here. Feel free to ask me for clarification if you want more information.\n\n-Similarly this is not a \"romantic\" scenario.\n\n-I do not ghost people that I have been in contact with. If our exchange must come to an end it will be communicated clearly.\n\n-I'm in the UTC+1 timezone and I'm available during \"office hours\" (weekdays from about 08:00 to 17:00). My availability during evenings and weekends is spottier.\n\nIf this sounds at all interesting then please don't hesitate to drop me a line.\n\nAnd until then, I hope you all have a great day!\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to GM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have.\n\n**I want you to be the GM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\n\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, please shoot me a message.\n\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\n\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.\n\n**Touhou**\n\nWould love an RP set in the wonderful world of Gensokyo! I was thinking my character would be from the Outside World who ends up in Gensokyo during the start of the RP or beforehand. From there, he'd slowly start to explore the world and meet the various characters in it. Maybe there's an incident going on, or maybe he's in Gensokyo during the events of one of the games. In any case, this is one we could definitely discuss further.\n\n**Marvel**\n\nRecently got around to watching the MCU films and have been pretty interested in an RP related to Marvel. Doesn't necessarily have to be set in the MCU, and I'd probably actually prefer an alternate Universe so we have a bit more free-reign with what we want to do with the characters and world. I was thinking that the RP would begin with an origin story for my character, with him either facing a canonical villain or an original character. After that point, the Universe could open up and include more of the heroes from Marvel. It doesn't necessarily have to immediately go into something like the Avengers where everyone comes together to fight a big threat, but maybe the heroes could be slowly introduced one at a time into the story.\n\nI do have a few ideas as to potential powers for my character that we can discuss. But if you'd prefer, I'm also open to my character being an apprentice to a pre-existing hero and having similar abilities/equipment to them. Whatever would work best for you and the story would work best for me.\n",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to GM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have.\n\n**I want you to be the GM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\n\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, please shoot me a message.\n\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\n\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.\n\n**Touhou**\n\nWould love an RP set in the wonderful world of Gensokyo! I was thinking my character would be from the Outside World who ends up in Gensokyo during the start of the RP or beforehand. From there, he'd slowly start to explore the world and meet the various characters in it. Maybe there's an incident going on, or maybe he's in Gensokyo during the events of one of the games. In any case, this is one we could definitely discuss further.\n\n**Marvel**\n\nRecently got around to watching the MCU films and have been pretty interested in an RP related to Marvel. Doesn't necessarily have to be set in the MCU, and I'd probably actually prefer an alternate Universe so we have a bit more free-reign with what we want to do with the characters and world. I was thinking that the RP would begin with an origin story for my character, with him either facing a canonical villain or an original character. After that point, the Universe could open up and include more of the heroes from Marvel. It doesn't necessarily have to immediately go into something like the Avengers where everyone comes together to fight a big threat, but maybe the heroes could be slowly introduced one at a time into the story.\n\nI do have a few ideas as to potential powers for my character that we can discuss. But if you'd prefer, I'm also open to my character being an apprentice to a pre-existing hero and having similar abilities/equipment to them. Whatever would work best for you and the story would work best for me.\n",

And post length also doesn't bother me, so long as I'm getting more than a few words every response anyways.\n\nI'm in the 20-25 range, so please be over 18!\n\nNSFW friendly. I love it, but I know not everyone does. Of course if we do NSFW, all characters will be over 18!\n\nI do have plot ideas for these, we aren't limited to my ideas though. If you have any ideas of your own, you're free to suggest them!  \nNow for the fandoms:\n\nPokemon- The biggest one, been a fan since I was super young! Honestly it's what I'm mostly looking for but it feels like I have better luck finding Pokemon partners when I make general fandom ads than just solely Pokemon focused ones haha! I've got a ton of plots in mind for this fandom....\n\nNaruto\n\nSaints Row\n\nSonic\n\nHarry Potter\n\nAnd that's about it, I do have others but they're a bit harder to make a roleplay revolved around.\n\nIf I happened to catch your interest, message me.

Unknowing of what she did or who she was )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point is that my character decided to leave behind most of her knowledge when she joined this world, pretty much coming into it a little naive and very fascinated by life and the little things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can talk a lot more in pm or on discord, or anywhere tbh but now ill describe a bit the world I had in mind ( if I wouldn't be so lazy I would have drawn it or painted it but I didn't )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point is the class division is pretty much law and trying to get into a higher class in impossible. The upper class lives in high rise buildings in the middle of town enjoying luxury while the middle-class work mostly desks jobs, but also some lower jobs and live in a ring around the inner city. The Poor live in suburbs, slums, and just the open fields around, they use old technology and have a whole society of their own, pretty much living the same way we do now and having their own class ladder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink of the cities like the attack on titan city, an inner small one ( that's the upper class ) then a really large area walled in ( that's the middle class ) and then the rest of the world ( low class).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain we can discuss everything later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading again and hope you decide to message me.",

These creatures were soon named the gare. \n\nTheos slayed many of these creatures in order to save his kingdom, but soon he recieved a message from Rephyc. He opened the scroll and a rune fell out. He used this rune to create a magical shield around the kingdom preventing the gare from entering. \n\n\nTheos was not imortal and eventually he passed.

If not, then read on if you'd like a crash course in this crazy and fun tabletop RPG world.\n\nIn roughly the year 2077, a swarm of meteorites stormed the Earth and caused total chaos and ruin. Tens of thousands of years of human civilization were laid to waste in just a few days, leaving little else on the Earth but ruin and wasteland. \n\nThese asteroids also carried a terrible virus called the Primer, which turns infected humans into Psychonaughts and infected plants into Psychovores. Psychovores are plants that have grown strange and alien, like something out of a horror movie, they've been transmuted into foul twisted killers. Psychonaights are humans who have been corrupted and mutated by the Primer. They've been given tremendous powers of various kinds at the cost of their very humanity, and now exist as something akin to magic zombies. \n\nBut humanity is remarkably persistant, and found a way to survive. Now, in the year 2567, several Cults of humanity have formed from the ashes of the Bygone world. There are the strange technology loving Chroniclers, who's goal it is to reactivate the Stream (something akin to the internet) and lift humanity out of this dark age of barbarism. There are the clever Scrappers, who dig and search through the ruins of the Bygone age for precious and lost artifacts and Technology. The savage Clans roam the wasteland, barbaric savages who have embraced the world's return to a primitive time. There is the organized Spitalians, who are a nation of facist militarized doctors hell bent on eradicating the Primer and curing the land and people of this terrible plague. There are several other cults besides, but I won't list them all here for fear of making this post 300 pages long XD.\n\nIf any of this has piqued your interest, then fantastic! I'd love to talk more and answer any questions I can about the world or the other cults or anything. If you'd like to talk about anything, feel free to hit me up in DMs and we can go from there.\n\nHope to see you soon!",

I\u2019ve been looking for something Fantasy based, and the idea of a Werewolf/SuperNatural Fantasy idea seemed quite appealing for me.\nI\u2019m looking for a long term, male partner, and I prefer to roleplay on discord.\nI am Literate and typically write...2-3+ paragraphs per post, though I\u2019m not super picky, just put effort in.\nI am NSFW friendly, and Romance friendly, in fact I\u2019d like the roleplay to be Romance-Action based.\n\nBasically, here is the idea:\nSociety isn\u2019t aware werewolves/vamps/witches exist, so basically, its like current day. Werewolves specifically, typically live in groups, or packs, often assumed to be a weird \u2018cult\u2019 though they\u2019re not entirely detached from Society. They live in small communities, usually containing 200-600 Werewolves, that still go into society, jobs, school, shopping and such. They look completely human and have great control over their power, and are able to shift as they please, though a shift is required at 12:00 am on a full moon. (When they shift they just go into a regular wolf form)\nAll werewolves have one, and only one \u201cTrue-Mate\u201d meaning there is another werewolf out there somewhere that is destined to be their mate. If they meet that said person, they\u2019ll automatically know that person is their mate, and its incredibly hard to fight, and nearly impossible to change. \nI was thinking we could make a plot on that idea, so if you\u2019re interested, please pm me!\nThank you~!\n",

            "selftext": "Hey there, pumpkin! Jack here, ya know, president of hyperion, that man with the Handsome face on all of the photos, or as you bandits probably know me, your worst friggin nightmare.\n\n I digress, I'm here offering up a role play! As you can probably tell, I enjoy playing Handsome Jack and would like to think of myself as pretty damn good at playing the character. After all, my real name is Jack, which will make your job much easier when you talk out of character.\n\n Now for the plot. I had an idea of an alternative ending to Borderlands Two. Instead of, [SPOILERS] Handsome Jack dying to the hands of those filthy bandits, they instead believe that dying is too good for him. So instead they hall the dying man back to Sanctuary. It is here where he's outfitted with a shock collar and forced to do manual labour for the citizens of Sanctuary. He would mainly be helping out with I.T. support, robotics and such. But I like the idea very much of a few of the Sanctuary females getting a little curious.\n\n Now it's up to you as to who you want to play. A horny teenager deciding to put Jack to good use, Gaige, A curious siren using Jack as a tool to find out more about her body, Maya, A slightly regretful Ex Wife, Moxxi and much much more. I'm even open to genderbent characters to be females. And don't worry, Jack will still be dominant and will be sure to let out his pent up frustration on the women in the bedroom.\n\n My Kik is, \"Handsome_Jack115\". We can discuss the specifics in private messages.\n\n \"Ciou, kiddos~\"",

We have a simple progression system that favors storytelling and no hard stats with no dice rolls- just writing and an array of robust means to customize your character and what they can do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe site takes place in an AU where the Saiyans survive and none of the canon characters exist; the story focuses entirely on the players and will be driven entirely by them. For example, right now, I am personally in the middle of putting together a plot that will shake up the universe by changing the current political situation on the Saiyan homeworld, Vegeta.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe would love if you checked us out and maybe hopped in our Discord to say \"hello\". We are a very friendly community who are passionate about storytelling and having fun with one another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[http://dragonballinfinity.boards.net/](http://dragonballinfinity.boards.net/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "\"Okay, let's do this one last time, probably. My name is Peter Parker, but most people probably know my super-powered and more charismatic alter ego, Spider-Man. I  doubt anyone would consider me superhero,material at first glance, but I guess nobody really chooses their fate. I just so happened to get nipped on the back of my hand by a funny spider on a school trip, and all of a sudden I'm- well, you know the rest. I've been shot at, stabbed, *actually* shot, thrown threw a few windows, off of the odd rooftop,and so much more. I've tussled with my best friend's dad,my mayor and even my Aunt's boss. My point being, I've been there and I've most certainly done that as Spidey, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. The rest of the world may have the Avengers, but somebody's gotta look out for New York.\" \n\nHi! I hope that little prompt piqued your interest. Obviously, I'm looking for an RP centered around the one and only Wall-Crawler. I'm very open to suggestuons in terms of the plot, supporting characters and all those bells and whistles; let's build a story together! \n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n-18+, and willing to experiment with some dark and edgier themes without them,overpowering the entire story.\n-A decent, literate writer capable of writing at 1-3 paragraphs on average, I don't do &lt;4 sentences and I don't do novellas either.\n-Someome willing to invest into building up a narrative over the long term.\n-A good understand of Spider-Man and the ensemble cast he frequently shares the screen and page with.\n-A relatively consistent and/or flexible schedule. For reference, I'm in the Eastern Standard time zone.\n\nBeyond these, I consider myself a very open minded individual. Whatever you brinf to the table, I'm excited to try! I look forward to hearing from you if Ive manged to strike your fancy. Happy role-playing!",

The inhabitants of Menara have applied for Federation Membership. While only warp capable for a few decades, their position on the border, resting right between Romulan and Klingon space, gives them a chance to be a unique strategic resource to the Federation, as well as a valued ally in the continuing efforts to preserve peace in the Alpha Quadrant.\n\nTo this end, Starfleet has sent us to not only review their application but ultimately review the Menaran admission to the Federation. But more than that, the Menaran government has made Starfleet aware of mysterious ruins on their first colony. Lacking the proper knowledge, technology, and resources to fully utilize these relics they've requested a joint operation in studying this newfound mystery.\n\nWhile this is surely a worthwhile endeavor for the Federation, I fear that Washington could be used elsewhere. With the closing of the Romulan and Klingon borders, and the bombing aboard Gagarin station, the Federation seemingly stands alone. Securing our own assets should be more important. But Starfleet command has other ideas, and only time will tell if our work here will be worthwhile...\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nThe Frontier Coalition is a new, heavy RP focused guild, looking to craft a new entry into the Star Trek Universe.\n\nDedicated to giving opportunities for character growth and character-driven roleplay, with a focus on advancement.

I have over five years of experience with roleplaying, and have written various short stories. I\u2019m a literate writer and I typically roleplay as if writing a novel. So detailed orientated and literate partners only please! \n\nNow, I usually prefer for another female partner that is comfortable playing male and female, but a male partner would suffice as a partner. I have both a Discord and Kik, and have other various options able to message on. Please remember that I am a student, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to reply every day or right away for that matter. \n\nNow, onto the themes. My themes are typically situated on gore, horror, true crime, or supernatural-based themes. I can do NSFW-themes, but I have limitations on those as well. My themes are not for the faint of heart, and there probably be more disturbing themes. Murder included. Furthermore, my characters are not exactly the best of people, and possess many flaws and insecurities. \n\nIf interested, please pm me or comment below, thanks! ",

I'm a huge Dragon Ball nerd and I enjoy many aspects of the show, so I wanted to find others who shared the passion I have! I was looking primarily for a 1-on-1 thing involving Canon characters, although seeing as I also have an OC I enjoy using I will also allow you to use an OC along with Cast characters!\n\n\n\nThe Role play itself will take place after the Broly Movie, unless you have not seen it. Otherwise it will be after the Tournament of Power. Please let me know if you have seen it or not, as it will help me avoid spoiling it!\n\n\nIf you have any questions or wish to do this, pm me and I'll send my Kik or Discord tag (if you want to participate) so we can further discuss this!",

However, before we begin here are some things you should know about me and what I'm looking for,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* \\*\\*I am located in the USA and would prefer that my partner also be from the USA.\\*\\* This is to avoid any time zone conflicts.\n\n\\* \\*\\*I am a detailed and literate writer who posts a minimum of 2 paragraphs per post in 3rd person.\\*\\* If you cannot mirror the amount of detail I put in, the length of my post, or your writing skills are subpar, I have a feeling the RP won't work out.\n\n\\* \\*\\*I am not interested in a \"normal\" or \"typical\" Pokemon journey.\\*\\* To be quite honest with you, I find these plots to be quite boring, and based on previous experience, die down very fast. For me, there has to be some driving force behind the plot not just, \"\\*Catch em' all\\*\"\n\n\\* \\*\\*I post 2+ a day\\*\\* \\*\\*and require that my partner do the same.\\*\\* Now of course I realize that life happens, however it would be nice if I were given a heads up.\n\n\\* \\*\\*I am most conferable with Gens 4 - 7 with Gen 5 being my favorite.\\*\\* Due to this, I may refuse to do an RP based in Gen 1-3 or Gen 8. However, I am open to original or ambiguous settings.\n\n\\* \\*\\*I prefer a more mature/\"realistic\" themes.\\*\\* Or in other words, I'm not interested in a, \"save all the Pokemon and become best friends with everyone\" vibe.\n\n\\* \\*\\*I'm not interested in nitpicking the game mechanics.\\*\\* This includes the 4 move rule.\n\n\\* \\*\\*I ask that we limit the trainer's parties to 3.\\*\\* This may be unpopular, but with I'm not a huge fan of having 14+ characters (2 trainers, 12 Pokemon, plus extras) and just two people.\n\n\\* \\*\\*All characters must be 21+.\\*\\* This is again to enforce the more \"mature\" theme\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for some general plot ideas. If you have any other ones though feel free to share! \\*\\*Keep in mind that I may be open to canon characters depending on who they are.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Champion x Champion\n\n\\* Champion x Team (insert name here) Leader\n\n\\* Gym Leader Rivals\n\n\\* Elite Four Rivals\n\n\\* Champion Rivals\n\n\\* \\*\\*Characters from other Fandoms in the Pokemon Universe anyone?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those of you who managed to make it through this wall of text, I thank you. If any of my ideas caught your eye and you think we would make good partners send me a DM. I look forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "Hiya, I have posted on here a few times but none have really stuck.\n\nI have another RP going but tbh I think my goal is 2 or 3 steady long-term role plays going. All semi-lit to to literate. So dont be afraid to PM me if interested.\n\nI would prefer to do Bumbleby but I LOVE Weiss too so if you have other ideas or would like to do a greater story with bumbleby just included that would be totally A-Okay as well. We can double up depending on needs, but that is stuff we can discuss in the PM's.\n\nAll you need to know now. Is I do not do NSFW really, I am down for dark or heavy themes but I wont like play out sexual scenes. It can be implied or stated that it happened. I'm just not comfortable with that sorry lol. However I am 20 and because I am down for the darker themes I would prefer a more mature partner.\nI think that's fair.\n\nAs for responses I am in Japan on an internship until August, I will give warnings if I will be inactive for a few days or something but I will always strive for at least 3 responses a day and would like the same in return. That being said. I understand life is life so dont feel bad if it's not possible to do every day. Just do ya best. \n\nAnyways. PM if interested I guess lol.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you if you are interested \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d\n\n",

            "selftext": "Located deep in southern Nevada's deserts is a friendly community known for its beautiful view of the stars. whispering mountains that speak words both horrifying and comforting, and the countless canyons and craters, origins unknown, surrounding it.\n\nThis community is rumored to be a hot spot for a plethora of paranormal phenomena and a slew of scientific secrets. They say that beings that have never been seen by the human eye, and will never, roam the night; that planes disappear into mysterious lights as they pass overhead; that time, sometimes, does not work in the way that it should; that shadow people co-exist with residents in corners of their home as they all pretend to sleep. \n\nBut to visit the close-knit desert town is a challenge, and to leave is near impossible. \n\nNo one actually knows how to get there. directions are always vague, mumbled ; like the individuals own tongue is forcing its way down their throat. Sometimes, the people wake up in the town with no recollection of how they\u2019ve gotten there; Just news that along with their presence came a new crater outside of town. \n\nThe sun is hot, the moon is beautiful...\n\nThis town is... ASTER CANYON.\n\n*inspired by the podcast welcome to night vale, the x-files, and the sims 2\u2019s strangetown, and similar media, ASTER CANYON is an adapted roleplay that focuses on character, relationship, and lore development.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/qFvubj3",

The CYOA will be included at the end of the post. A basic pitch is as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur two characters (who don't know each other), get pulled from another world (it can be the same world as each other, or different ones) by some mysterious super-being. This super being tells us that we'll be given this special weapon, called a soul weapon, and we are then sent through a village of Soul Smiths who forge this weapon for us (that's the CYOA). Afterward, we'll be sent to a magical world together, with our weapons, and we'll be free to do whatever we want. We'll be the only ones in the world with these \"Soul Weapons\" The RP will be what we do in that world. An exploration of the world and our characters, basically. We'll have equal part in shaping the world, too (as players, not characters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe NSFW was added because the option for romance between our two characters is open if wanted, but not actually required.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other questions or anything, or if you're interested, PM me and I'll be happy to talk!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe CYOA: [http://imgur.com/gallery/pzxORZU](http://imgur.com/gallery/pzxORZU)",

This means that I do my best to churn out some high quality replies for my partner. I'm currently on a search because I haven't anything going on except for gaming, and the roleplays that I've had are mostly dead, with partners not responding or simply ghosting me for whatever reason. I'd like to make sure that you've fully read this, so put your favorite song in the title of the PM. With that being said, I truly hope that you've been having a terrific day so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI use Discord and exclusively Discord to roleplay. I understand that you may be a fan of e-mail, or Google Hangouts or even Google Docs, but those things are just not platforms that I particularly enjoy. I like Discord because we can have things organized and easily accessible. Rather than using one app for OOC chat, and another for writing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a roleplayer, I write in third person, past tense. It's just my preferred method and it works fine for all scenarios that I've been in so far. I'm sorry, but if you write in first person, I just don't feel like we'll be a good match. I just personally can not stand it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut when it comes to themes, I like a lot of stuff. I'm heavy on realistic, dark and gritty themes. Something that envelops the characters and gives a feeling for them. I am, on the flip side, not very fond of over-the-top themes, most fantasy and sci-fi settings. I could, perhaps, be persuaded to do one, but it'd take a lot of effort. For each roleplay that I do, I make a completely new character, with their own goals, ambitions, merits and flaws alike. I expect the same of you, and I really don't like lazy inserts from one setting into another. Please, just don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also open to fandoms! But we'd have to put our own little twist on them. We can discuss which I like and which I dislike more when we get to talking, but I'm going to say flat out that I dislike superhero stuff. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a nice day, and shoot a message my way!",

That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

            "selftext": "I refuse to write a \"does anyone else?\" title, even when it's relevant. So I'll say here, *does anyone else have a world they've written and built but now doesn't like to roleplay in anymore?*\n\nI have a world of the sci-fi variety called *Stardust* that I've built up. It originally started as a setting born out of a roleplay, but those of us that created it kept it going as a worldbuilding project long after. All of the other participants have since dropped it but I keep working and tweaking at it. By this point, well over half the body of work is mine alone and I'm a little attached. Suffice to say, the project has become pretty massive over the years it's been developed. The written documentation is over 150 pages (none of it formatted for ease of reading) and the unwritten documentation - stuff discussed and decided but just never made it to written form at the time - is equally as plentiful, and gets bigger anytime a new question gets asked.\n\nThe sheer volume of the body of work, the immensity of the task to distill it down into something more digestible for an unfamiliar reader, and my personal attachment has led me to be pretty closed off about it in the roleplaying world. I'm afraid that people will get key relevant details wrong that I'll need to correct and that I then look like an ass for it. I'm hesitant to let other people back into a position to have significant effect on the lore of *Stardust*. The people I originally wrote it with have since become close friends and I trust them and their visions for this. But introducing new faces to it brings unknown variables.\n\nSo my purpose writing this - beyond taking a rare opportunity to speak my mind and vent - is to poll the crowd on if I'm alone in my worldbuilding stinginess or if there's other people who have works of some kind they are too hesitant to let back out into the roleplaying wilds.",

            "selftext": "Having a cute son can become an immediate chick magnet for a guy.  I\u2019m looking to play as a single dad and have a few different starters below for what hopefully becomes a long term romance roleplay. \n\nPlease note that in this roleplay I am NOT in any way looking to include a young child in any sexual activity.  It is simply a plot point.  I\u2019m not into any illegal underage acts.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ll be playing as a 27-29 year old guy with a son in the 3-5 range.  Below are a couple opening scenarios that I\u2019m hoping can lead into a long term roleplay.  As you\u2019ll see, some are more specific and detailed, while some are more open ended.\n\n*Family Friends*\nWe grew up on the same street, even though I\u2019m about 8 years older than you.  Our families got very close and when parents moved away I had established myself here so I stayed.  I\u2019ve got a son that I still bring by to see your parents off and they love babysitting or taking him to lunch.  Your boyfriend thinks that you have a thing for me, and that I want to get into your pants. \n\n*Sports League*\nWe meet playing in a long adult co ed basketball or softball league.  We could be on the same tram or competing teams.  You could be a regular or just filling in for a friend.  And our main initial convos can take place at the game or the bar afterwards where everyone goes.\n\n*The Beach*\nYou\u2019re at the beach with some friends when you see a little boy that looks familiar.  Upon second glance you realize it\u2019s your older sister\u2019s friend\u2019s son.  You decide to come over and say hi to him, and introduce yourself to me. (Also open to playing this out at the mall, bowling, or a carnival/county fair.)\n\n*Football on Sunday*\nI\u2019m at the sports bar with a few friends watching the games.  My 5 year old son is with us and he\u2019s got all his gear on too eating his chicken tenders and fries.  You\u2019re there with some friends? Rooting for the same teams as us or maybe the opposite?\n\n*Alumni*\nI\u2019m an alum of the university you go to.  You\u2019re volunteering to work an alumni event or reunion and we meet there.\n\n*Pumpkin Picking*\nYou and your college roommate/friend are in full basic white girl mode with your leggings and uggs taking selfies at the pumpkin patch.  Having some fun, I send him over to try and pick up a pumpkin that\u2019s clearly way to heavy for him and watch the humor that ensues.  Me and you (and your friend?) start talking and decide t hang out.\n\n*Daycare/Pre School*\nYou can be a teacher? Another parent? Perhaps an older sister that sometimes picks up and/or drops off?\n\nMessage me to start discussing details! I\u2019m looking for probably 1-3 paragraphs in roleplaying, possibly a bit more if setting up a new scene in it.\n",

I'd be playing two half brothers who don't know the other exists until fate draws them together, so doubling is a must! I average five paragraphs and would like a partner who can match this. We would be using Email/Docs for roleplaying. A mixture of dark themes and humor will ensue. \n\nRead the full ad here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZ2f8Se9FGSgaAm-PAPxs1jQumDusS0Sks_i1WpxirQ\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

So I guess the best place to start would be that I'm in the CST and am looking for someone close to the same. I don't expect you to be able to reply 24/7, but I would like to ask that you try to be available whenever possible. \n    Literacy would be the next stop. I personally would say I'm pretty proficient, but I know I'm far from perfect. All I expect is effort. We're here to enjoy ourselves after all! I tend to write a few paragraphs per reply if the situation permits, but sometimes a more casual approach does the job even better. Don't leave me hanging on the story and things should be smooth sailing!\n    Other than that, I'm down for any genre and romance if it has been built into the story. I've been hankering to do a postapoc story, but if that's not your speed feel free to shoot me some ideas. I've got kik and discord, though I'm new to discord so you might have to give me a crash course if you want to go that route. Thanks for your time, hope to hear from you soon!",

I tend to write a few paragraphs for most posts, however quicker events such as a long conversation may be shorter to not overwrite poi tless details and delay story progression. \n\n\n\n\nMy preferred settings are anything SciFi (I have had a craving for SciFi for a while) and Medieval-Fantasy (perhaps even a GoT inspired roleplay) \n\n\nSmut being involved is great and most dark settings are fine with me as well, although I may be a little sloppy roleplaying them to begin with. I would also ideally have a romance involved. \n\n\n\nFeel free to message me and we can discuss further. I use discord but don't mind using other programs/means.",

After portals opened all over the world, humans and animals alike began to transform into monsters not unlike the strange beasts that originally poured out from the alternate dimension. Wars were waged. Infrastructure collapsed. And when the other dimension went down, the resulting EMPs took out most of the world's technology.  Right now everything is approaching stability...\n\n...but it won't take much for it to all come crashing down.\n\n**//...Loading\u2026 //**\n\nThe majority of our play takes place on [Discord](https://discord.gg/n6dq7FN). We are also partnered with The Broken for our [Forums](http://brokenstoryline.com/forum)!\n\n\u25cf    Must be 18+ to join as we employ mature themes (violence and so forth). NSFW content is role-locked until a character is made and the players officially join.\n\n\u25cf    While we welcome writers anywhere from intermediate to advanced, players will be expected to regularly engage in para+. There are a few quickplay (one-line) rooms and events, but these are not the norm.\n\n\u25cf    Play-By-Post (mostly). Individuals post when time allows, with the opportunity for rapid Quickplay in events and certain segments of the server.\n\n\u25cf    Post-Apocalypse, with a focus on aesthetics and technology compatible with urban overgrowth, cyber-noir, and retro-futurism. (A lot of buzzwords, but think Bioshock and Fallout and you get the idea!)\n\n\u25cf    A variety of RP to include Slice of Life, Violence, Adventure, and overarching Arcs that keep the world-state changing and fresh!\n\n\u25cf    Hosted events, typically monthly.\n\n\u25cf    Defined races and lush setting with ever-expanding lore.

The game of course being trapped inside of it but killing monsters isn't the only way out. There's another way that that sick freak Kayaba didn't divulge. If you find the special ring of Eros the bosses and monsters change from creatures you kill to ones you have to fuck. But aside from collecting the lust energy from bosses and monsters you will need to collect the lust energy from other players be they female male or futanari. But nobody knows what sort of other powers the ring of Eros contains or what other abilities it gives the wearer. You'll have to find out if you dare. For the female players there's an item called Lilith's amulet that has the same abilities as the ring but also let's the wearer turn into a female version of any monster they defeat and allows them to grow a cock and tentacles if they want. \nI'm open with kinks by my limits are blood play scat vomit watersports extreme BDSM humiliation CBT.

Rather than in 2010 or so, this would be a bit in the future: 2022. \n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be in a killing game: To be honest, I\u2019d like to see what we can come up with. I\u2019m sporadic with my post length, it\u2019s usually about 3 sentences or more. I allow OCs as long as they aren\u2019t OP or Mary Sues. I\u2019d also like more of a good character: I love Despair, but I don\u2019t want this rp to be focusing on plunging humanity into eternal despair as our goal. \n\nPM me if you\u2019re interested, and we can probably work something out.",

I don't think anything on this is questionable, but my phone has a history of not letting me post to this specific subreddit. So I'm going to try again and I guess if my post is blocked again I'll try, and figure out what's wrong with it.\n\nHello there, I figure it's been long enough since I made an RP post, and decided to make another. I feel like every time I make one of these I'm just not clear enough, or I forget to add some piece that is really crucial. Maybe this will be the first time I get everything right?\n\nImportant stuff first;\n\n    I admit I can seem fussy. It's not a trait I'm proud of. I admit sometimes I let my emotions get the best of me. Believe it or not, when I'm behaving erratically I'm NOT doing it to be \"difficult\" with you. It's not like I don't have any good traits.\n\n    I'm usually not opinionated. Therefore if I actually disagree with you on something, as opposed to just going with it...I am not debating. I only speak up if I feel Really Strong on something. It's not me trying to debate or change your mind, I'm just letting it be known where I stand on the topic.\n\n    I don't like people having ideas for my OC. Seriously don't come to me like; So I'm playing a lizard king, and you're a human slave that I develop feelings for.\" I am really not into that.\n\n    I like to use original characters.\n\n    I double. Doubling means I play your crush, and you play mine.\n\n    I don't like having to explain things that don't need it. This happens a LOT in superhero RPs. People always want me to have some kind of scientific explanation for how my OC's powers work...so they can lecture me about how it doesn't make sense, and tell me their own scientifically superior idea. Not everything needs to be explained.\n\n    There's a lot of stuff I will do...but very few things I actually want. That's why for this list I will differentiate between the two.\n\nActually Want;\n\nAnything Super Hero related. It can be Marvel, DC, My Hero Academy, One Punch Man, an original.\n\nI recently acquired the remake of Resident Evil 2, so the Resident Evil series I'm general is on my mind.\n\nLately I've been feeling DBZ, and One Piece.\n\nWill do;\n\nWay too many Anime to list. If you want to RP an anime chances are I know of it. So feel free to ask.\n\nOriginal stuff though I am getting bored with EVERYONE asking me to do \"fantasy\" with them. I just prefer modern, to futuristic settings.\n\nAnyway that's all.",

            "selftext": "**DO NOT MESSAGE ME IF YOU DID NOT READ ALL OF THIS, I WILL KNOW IF YOU DID OR NOT**\n\n\nAd revisionnnnnnn.  I'm consistently available and would **prefer my partners are too, ghosting is a serious problem** and have been RPing for 12 years.  I'm here looking for action-adventure type fandom RPs with plenty of character interaction and development focus rather than JUST constant ego stroking fight scenes.  Environmental and interpersonal exploration is good too, throw some bits and pieces of slice of life into the mix and I'd say it's perfect.  I only play Female characters and I prefer that whoever approaches me plays one as well as I've had basically zero good experiences with male character players.  That is to also say if any romance occurs I prefer it be Female X Female.  I'd prefer that a partner that approaches me is 18+ in most cases and OOC gender doesn't matter as long as the character being played is Female.  I'm in the CST timezone of America and I tend to stay up all night and be asleep in the day.  Nocturnal sleep schedule and such so I work rather well with EU, Australia and other late night Americans.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs for fandoms themselves, some I am fine with both sides playing an OC or a partner playing a canon if one wishes to, though I'm honestly a bit picky in terms of OCs of some fandoms.  In a descending order will tell you which fandoms I currently have the most muse for at the moment and at the bottom are ones I usually do but would need something particularly good to really be up to put something together for.\n\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nSplatoon\n\nPokemon\n\nDragon Ball\n\nHunterxHunter\n\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid ~~(I suppose if one is up for playing a canon in that and shoehorning all sorts of stuff, sorta just something someone dragged me into trying once which applies as an option)~~\n\nMaplestory 2 based stuff maybe if one is up to it.\n\nLittle Witch Academia\n\nKingdom Hearts (Kinda iffy on this unless you come with a solid plan)\n\nThere are a few others but they're not ones I'm all too interested in playing alongside someone else's OC unfortunately so I'm leaving them out.  You're also free to suggest fandoms if they're anything like the ones listed above and if it tickles my fancy I can definitely give it a go.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Platforms**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only use Discord.\n\n\n\n**Age Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI usually prefer my partner being 18 or older given I'm 23 but in some cases I can make exceptions if I'm feeling it.\n\n\n\n**Character Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI prefer whoever I am writing with to play a Female character.  I've had zero good experiences with male ones and have just been put off from them entirely.  With that said I also only play Female characters.  I only play OCs myself but if the partner wants to they can play either a canon character or an OC, their choice as long as it's a female.  I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.  Basically if aiming for a romance I'd prefer the partner character being the one making advances and such.\n\n\n\n**Romance Junk since it was mentioned**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only do FxF but am fine regardless of if it's OCxOC or OCxCanon.  Makes no difference to me as long as the character itself is appealing.  I prefer it being slow burn/developing over the course of a play than immediately set up before even starting.  Won't do CanonxCanon though cause I'm garbage at playing Canon characters.\n\n\n\n**Post Length Stuff**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs long as you're detailed/descriptive and got good grammar it'll fine and stuff.   I'm a rather literate person and can easily put out multiple paragraphs if given enough to work with and I'd prefer that my partner is plenty literate as well while also giving me paragraph posts.  But I am rather flexible on this depending on a situation within a scene.  Exceptions and times I'd allow shorter than a single paragraph being when a situation within a scene becomes back and forth plain chatter and so on.\n\n\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done.  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Vaal  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Jada, I\u2019ve been roleplaying for a couple of years now and it\u2019s grown to be something that I really enjoy. I like roleplaying in groups as well as coming up with my own plots to create a story. Such as this one: \ud83d\udd3d\n\nIt\u2019s the year of 1920 or as most liked to call it \u201cThe roaring twenties\u201d America was filled with progression, wealth, and happiness whereas the less fortunate such as African Americans were living just the opposite of that. \n\nFelicity was a young woman, 21 years old to be more specific. Who lived in the down side of Manhattan, New York City. Her mother was a maid for one of the most aristocratic family in the city, thriving from their oil business every day in their life was spent lavishly. Between a husband, a wife and their three children. The Peterson (name can be changed) mansion was located in the upper side of Manhattan. One day when Felicity\u2019s mother suddenly grows ill, the young woman had no choice but to take her mothers job as a servant. \n\nUpon arriving at mansion Felicity was met with the family that her mother spoke about on a daily basis. What she always failed to mention was that they had a older son. He was about the same age as her maybe a little older, his demeanor and characteristics were cold and distant but Felicity couldn\u2019t help but be intrigued by him. \n\nSo as the title says this is going to be a interracial themed story which means that I\u2019m looking for someone to play a Caucasian male. Because of the era that this is set in, it will heavily be focused on the racial difference between them since this is a romantic roleplay there will be drama based around the fact that his parents won\u2019t approve of their love. \n\nAnd that is a small summary of the plot, there\u2019s obviously a lot more to it and I\u2019ll be glad to discuss everything. So if you\u2019re interested shoot me a message for my kik!\n\nI\u2019m not looking for a lot of requirements, I just want someone (females are okay as long as you can play the male character) who will be able to play their character the way I envision them. Someone who is literate, I\u2019m talking about 3-4 paragraphs with good grammar and I do prefer 3rd person. I also like to use reference pictures for my characters but if that\u2019s not the case for you then that\u2019s fine, just provide a small description of them please! \n",

I live in the EST time zone but I'm active often during the day and night due to an unpredictable sleep and work schedule. I'll respond as many times a day as possible. I rp in third person and prefer that my partner do the same. My post length depends on the scene and what my partner gives me, but will always more than two or three paragraphs. I dont expect as much in return, but don't one line. My preferred medium of rp is kik, but I will do PM here or discord if needed, message me for the contact info. \n\nIdea: Our two characters are part of a Spec Ops team that does frequent raids on weapons depots and drug operations over seas, and some within the states if a situation requires. One such raid went extremely well, but during it the family of a high powered crime boss/cartel head/leader of a terrorist organization loses his family, and finds out who was responsible. We can either start it during the event, or in the aftermath as the antagonist has begun hunting down every member of our characters team. (Not all of this is set in stone, and I am completely open discussing details with my partner to make it more our idea and world.) \n\nHopefully hear from you guys soon!!!\n\n",

            "selftext": "\"A lipstick lesbian is slang for a lesbian who exhibits a greater amount of feminine gender attributes relative to other gender expressions, such as wearing make-up, wearing dresses or skirts and having other characteristics associated with feminine women.\"\n\nSome people can't tell when a girl likes other girls at first glance. But that's fine, sometimes it's difficult. The stereotypical lesbian looks pretty trashy, admittedly. But there are those that take care of themselves, wear make up and perfume and don't drive trucks. Getting past that, the person themselves can act vastly different from what you'd expect.\n\nThis is the particular case of one girl who felt as though things around her love life would work themselves out, even though most of the people she associated with weren't exactly her type. Namely because they were guys that she knew through friends. She knew that she wasn't attracted to them, and was especially nice about it, and they left her alone about it. Until that one fateful day...\n\nBut that's getting ahead of things. At her school, she had a reputation of being nice to everyone and a fairly good student. When she caught wind of a rumor of a private school student coming to spend her last two years at her school, a public one. It wasn't a big deal to her, until she started at that school. The new girl, Cecil was her name, probably short for Cecilia, but no one ever asked. Her hair was long, wavy and jet black, decent sized body and a somewhat athletic body from snowboarding, an exotic sport in their little town where everyone knew everyone. She liked to wear short cut T-shirts, baggy jeans and sneakers, mostly just glad she didn't need to wear a uniform. \n\nOne day, Cecil came up to this girl in front of the school and tapped her on the shoulder. The sight of her sent this pour girl's heart aflutter, bringing along the butterflies in her stomach and the weakness in her knees. As a result, she couldn't answer the new girl's question, which resulted in her apologizing and moving to ask someone else. And these few things set in motion a turn of events she never could've expected in a million years.\n\n*So that's the prompt. The idea here is that your character is the girly girl that falls for my not quite so girly girl. I'd like for them to explore a lot of things together and I'm really hoping for this to be long term. As for your character, all I ask is that she be the girly girl I've explained, she can have any kind of personality, hobbies, what have you that you want. So yeah, if you're interested just send me your questions and stuff.*",

I want someone who will AND can match my posts, it's rather annoying to me when I type up paragraphs and get a three lined response in return. \n\nIf you can't write a paragraph, then I'm most likely not who you're looking for. \n\nI'm sorry if this is mean but that's been my problem lately, figured I would cut straight into the stuff I don't like before getting towards the fun stuff. \n\nAt least show me you're interested and can get creative. \n\nAnyway, for those that stuck around through my rant, Hello, again! \n\nI've been roleplaying for well over a decade now, well experienced with writing (non experienced writers are always welcome) and honestly it's become something I've come to enjoy. Keep in mind it's a hobby for me, I don't live and breathe it, live happens and sometimes I'm not able to reply right away. Sometimes it takes me a few days. Patience is required. \n\nNow with the plot, I've had this idea in my head for a long time now. (I only write in third person, sorry if that's an inconvenience) \n\nOur characters would be involved in an affair, whether one character is in a relationship or they both are is up for discussion! They'd have the same group of friends and that means they would hang out with the group a lot, but only the two of them have that secret in their heads. Replaying scenes from their nights meeting up in fancy hotel rooms or going on vacations together but tell their significant others they're on a business trip. \n\nThe sneaking around with the risk of being caught, maybe they do eventually by another friend, that leads to blackmail... the options are endless. \n\nI really, truly hope this strikes some interest in a few of you. Don't be shy! ",

            "selftext": "Like many stories and even in real life, there's always an alternate reality and the big \"what if?\". In Naruto: Affinity for Infinity, we asked ourselves a few \"what if\" questions; \n\n- What if all the Tailed Beasts were split into Yin and Yang like Kurama was?\n-What if the Uchiha were the main founders of Konoha instead of the Senju?\n-What if Rock Lee had beaten Gaara?!(Not really, but this is really one of the biggest What Ifs of Naruto ever.)\n\nAfter those questions and a few more Naruto related but totally unrelated question, we decided we should make a roleplay and put it into the hands of the players. With the villages just forming and the Tailed Beasts split into Yin and Yang, there is no certainty on what is to come. What is sure to come though is a lot of player driven ideas as well as some amazing server wide Arcs. So dont be shy, in this alternate Naruto world you will encounter unqiue shinobi, cool people OOC, custom clans and maybe even a custom village or two!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/m4HHwVy",

I'd love to do some stuff with OCs, putting them in all kinds of scenarios. I like things like arranged marriages, space pirates, modern magic, cryptids, age differences, found families, and people trying to make it in the world. I have a loose plot about a boarding house that's home to all kinds of people from werewolves to a fae and some regular humans thrown in. It would be awesome to populate it with someone else.\n\nPlease be okay with queer ships, trans and nb characters in general, because my OCs are never straight. Right now I am only really looking to write f/f (which ofc includes trans and nb characters). I'm also totally open to any ideas you have for how you'd like an rp to go!\n\nI rp and do ooc chat on discord, but can be convinced to go to email for the rp.\n\nIf you're interested, drop me a PM!

This is why I made a separate post, because it seems like most people are looking for experience. Overall, I'm mainly doing this because it sounds like a blast to write detailed and collaborative fiction with another person. Although I have never done this before, I am aware of a few of the basic RP 'rules' such as putting effort into your messages, avoiding Mary Sue characters, not taking total control of the plot, etc.  I am pretty much open to any kind of RP, but I'm personally more interested in an RP that's based on an original world we create or discuss rather than using a pre-existing one (fanfics aren't my thing, sorry!). I'm also open to using most platforms for the RP; I guess E-mail or Discord would work best, though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading!",

There is nothing worse than writing three or four paragraphs and only getting one in return. Now will my post always be over 2,000 words? Of course not! But as a rule of thumb be able to have quality and quantity. I don\u2019t care if a comma is out of place, if you have a run off sentence, if you use then instead of than. I\u2019m not a stickler for grammar and punctuation, as long as I can read it I\u2019m good. I am looking for someone to contribute to the story. I don\u2019t want to make all the decisions, it is a partnership after all. To be able to bounce ideas and develop a story together is one of the best aspects of a roleplay. I will be providing a writing sample. I ask that you be prepared to have one or to be honest on whether you can match mine.\nI love a good romance but I\u2019m not looking for instant romance and just jumping into bed with anyone. I am okay with pretty much anything and if I\u2019m uncomfortable with something I will tell you as I expect you would for me. I am however only interested in fxf romance. Please do not ask me to change my mind because I won\u2019t. Because I am fine with NSFW subject matter I need to have a partner who is over 18+ and would prefer 21+.\nNow for the good stuff, what type of roleplays that I would like to do. The genres that I having a craving for are: historical, modern and slice of life. I will also do supernatural and fantasy as well. I have several ideas and prompts we can get into further details once you get in touch with me.\n\nAll and all I\u2019m an approachable person and little shy but like to talk OOC and be friendly. Tell me a little about yourself when you send me a PM. You don\u2019t have to get all personally but anything you share I will share back! \n\nThanks, \n\nS",

            "selftext": "Hi there and thanks for taking the time to look at this ad!\n\nFirst of all, a little about me. I am an experienced (15+ years across various mediums), roleplayer. I enjoy writing and creating, with worldbuilding, character building and storytelling being me true passions. I\u2019m looking for a partner with the same sorts of interests to build a story, some characters and the world in which they live. I can play by Discord or Email, with no real preference for which. I typically try to post several times a week.\n\nI am principally looking for RP in Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic, Cyberpunk and Low-Fantasy settings. I have a few ideas and prompts available on request, and would welcome yours.\n\nI write in the third person, and I usually will do three decently sized paragraphs per post. I look for quality in a post; it doesn\u2019t have to be the best thing ever, but it does have to show some effort. That\u2019s all. I do ask that my partner be eighteen (18) or older. I am okay with NSFW elements in a story, but I don\u2019t want them to be the focus. I\u2019m not interested in a smut-based RP at all. Likewise, I am not interested in extreme violence or gore.\n\nAt the moment I am craving a specific relationship, one that can be best described as \"sexy but not sexual\". This is one where there could potentially be romantic and intimate themes (ie: NSFW), but no actual sex involved.\n\nAlso note that I only reply to messages sent by DM. Replies posted here will not be followed up on. It's a way to test if you're paying attention, among other things.",

            "selftext": "Hello there, I suck at this whole advertising and searching partners so I'll try to make this as quick as possible and if you have any questions I don't bite, message me.\n\n- I've been roleplaying for around 10 years, but only around 3 in English. So yeah, English isn't my first language and I may struggle sometimes with it, making my replies slower or I may just make mistakes from time to time (please, please, tell me so I can keep learning).\n\n- Ditch friendly. No, really, I won't get offended or something like that .w. And well, if we have already been roleplaying it could actually be nice of you if you tell me so I can search for another partner.\n\n- About being active, I'm usually open for OOC, but that I'm online talking to you doesn't mean I'm already writing a reply. I offer patience about posts and I want the same back. Roleplaying is a hobby for me, not a job.\n\n- I started roleplaying using both canons and OCs, and I love OCs. Making them and learning about my partner's OCs as they interact with mine and canon characters. So yeah, I'm also a fan of CanonxOc pairings, more than OcxOc or CanonxCanon (I still enjoy OcxOc though, CanonxCanon can be difficult because well, everyone has their tastes. And ship wars can get too intense for me but you can always try).\n\n- One liners. No, thank you, I try to give at least 1200 words (when I don't have too much to work with, 600 for the canon character I'm playing and 600 for my OC). I do prefer quality over quantity, but please, give me something to work with and move the story with me. We are like a team. Also, I prefer to share the rest of the cast like NPCs, playing them to move the story and not just divide them between us. In some scenarios I do like to divide them, for example if you want your OC to confront a villain or another character and you want me to play it so there can be more 'surprises' or 'suspense'? I suck at explaining, I'm sorry.\n\n- Oh, I said that I play a canon and an OC because doubling is kind of a must for me. I love to play my partner's crushes or just favorite characters they want to play against. That being said, some characters are harder for me to play since maybe I'm not so used to their type of personality, but I can always try and learn more about them. Ah! I usually double playing males since I'm more used to MxF pairings (in my side and in my partner's), just saying that I enjoy playing both males and females (and this doesn't mean I'm not open to MxM or FxF).\n\n- I like romance, slow burn and all of that. But I also like adventure and the main genre of the series. Give the drama, let's make them suffer (?).\n\n- I usually use Discord for OOC chat and RP through e-mail (preferred) but I can also RP by Discord. And yeah, I think I'm looking too serious but I do like to meme around OOC, I'm not the most serious person around.\n\n- Since I already had some problems, I do prefer, being myself +18, that my partner is +18. And that if you message me, please add triggerings (I'm not talking just about NSFW please, I know there are some topics people don't like to roleplay about and are SFW in theory).\n\nAnd now, what I'm searching for in the X-men universe. Important note by the way, I'm talking about the\u00a0movie universe, being more specific around Days of future past and Apocalypse universe and/or characters. I'm not opposed to AUs.\u00a0\n\nI'm searching for two specific characters this time,\u00a0Quicksilver\u00a0or\u00a0Nightcrawler\u00a0(no preference, I can even double with one of them if you want), to\u00a0play against them. And about\u00a0characters I'm more confident about playing them myself\u00a0(I'm not, again, opposed to try others), I think I can adapt to young Xavier, Quicksilver, Nightcrawler (as I said before), young Beast, and perhaps Angel and Wolverine (I've never tried them but it could be interesting).\n\nFinally, plots? I have two ideas that are more like starting points but I prefer to get to know my partner's preferences before brainstorming and so.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Once again reaching out for a new roleplay partner. Think you're up to the task? Read on!\n\nSo  like many fans of the Kingdom Hearts series, I've played Kingdom Hearts 3 and throughout my play through, I've discovered a craving for a roleplay set in the vast and vivid world of this game series. I have a rough idea  in mind, but I'd like some help to flesh it out and bring it to life.\n\nThe idea is simple; it involves a rare-pair, specifically Axel x Xion. I would play the part of Xion, but I need you to take on the role of everyone's favorite Flurry of Dancing Flames himself. If you've got what it takes to play him, and play him well - then we may get along. I'm mostly seeking adventure, and of course being a pairing story - romance. There's a lot of ideas to work with when it comes to Xion as a character, and I'm more than happy to discuss things. I'm also comfortable with NSFW should that come up at all, and if so I request that you be at least 18+, as I do not RP any NSFW with minors. \n\nHowever what I am looking for in a partner is a bit more detailed. As with my other posts I've made here, I reiterate that I only role-play on Discord.  So if you use any other method for RP then we probably won't  be  compatible from the get-go. I also will request a writing sample, partly  to see what your style is like, and also to see if you are a capable  writer. While I know there are great writers here, I've been  forced to be picky about partners, mainly due to the fact that most  either lack in  responses, or end up ghosting me after a time with no  explanation. If  you're going to leave, please be courteous enough to  state why, It will  save us both a lot of trouble.\n\nWhile  I  have no restrictions on post length or amount of replies given, I will  at least expect a paragraph to start off with! Also, I will expect  you  to be at least knowledgeable of the Kingdom Hearts series, and   preferably have played through all of the games prior to the release of   Kingdom Hearts 3 coming out soon. If you haven't played all of the games, I can point you toward plenty of locations that have lore to read up on, or assist you with answering questions as best as I can.\n\nIf   you've read through all of this and think you've got what it takes, send me a message with your Discord handle and we can discuss!",
