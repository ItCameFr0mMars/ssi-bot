            "selftext": "**DO NOT MESSAGE ME IF YOU DID NOT READ ALL OF THIS, I WILL KNOW IF YOU DID OR NOT**\n\n\nAd revisionnnnnnn.  I'm consistently available and would **prefer my partners are too, ghosting is a serious problem** and have been RPing for 12 years.  I'm here looking for action-adventure type fandom RPs with plenty of character interaction and development focus rather than JUST constant ego stroking fight scenes.  Environmental and interpersonal exploration is good too, throw some bits and pieces of slice of life into the mix and I'd say it's perfect.  I only play Female characters and I prefer that whoever approaches me plays one as well as I've had basically zero good experiences with male character players.  That is to also say if any romance occurs I prefer it be Female X Female.  I'd prefer that a partner that approaches me is 18+ in most cases and OOC gender doesn't matter as long as the character being played is Female.  I'm in the CST timezone of America and I tend to stay up all night and be asleep in the day.  Nocturnal sleep schedule and such so I work rather well with EU, Australia and other late night Americans.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs for fandoms themselves, some I am fine with both sides playing an OC or a partner playing a canon if one wishes to, though I'm honestly a bit picky in terms of OCs of some fandoms.  In a descending order will tell you which fandoms I currently have the most muse for at the moment and at the bottom are ones I usually do but would need something particularly good to really be up to put something together for.\n\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nSplatoon\n\nDragon Ball\n\nHunterxHunter\n\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid ~~(I suppose if one is up for playing a canon in that and shoehorning all sorts of stuff, sorta just something someone dragged me into trying once which applies as an option)~~\n\nMaplestory 2 based stuff maybe if one is up to it.\n\nLittle Witch Academia\n\nPokemon\n\nKingdom Hearts (Kinda iffy on this unless you come with a solid plan)\n\nThere are a few others but they're not ones I'm all too interested in playing alongside someone else's OC unfortunately so I'm leaving them out.  You're also free to suggest fandoms if they're anything like the ones listed above and if it tickles my fancy I can definitely give it a go.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Platforms**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only use Discord.\n\n\n\n**Age Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI usually prefer my partner being 18 or older given I'm 23 but in some cases I can make exceptions if I'm feeling it.\n\n\n\n**Character Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI prefer whoever I am writing with to play a Female character.  I've had zero good experiences with male ones and have just been put off from them entirely.  With that said I also only play Female characters.  I only play OCs myself but if the partner wants to they can play either a canon character or an OC, their choice as long as it's a female.  I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.  Basically if aiming for a romance I'd prefer the partner character being the one making advances and such.\n\n\n\n**Romance Junk since it was mentioned**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only do FxF but am fine regardless of if it's OCxOC or OCxCanon.  Makes no difference to me as long as the character itself is appealing.  I prefer it being slow burn/developing over the course of a play than immediately set up before even starting.  Won't do CanonxCanon though cause I'm garbage at playing Canon characters.\n\n\n\n**Post Length Stuff**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs long as you're detailed/descriptive and got good grammar it'll fine and stuff.   I'm a rather literate person and can easily put out multiple paragraphs if given enough to work with and I'd prefer that my partner is plenty literate as well while also giving me paragraph posts.  But I am rather flexible on this depending on a situation within a scene.  Exceptions and times I'd allow shorter than a single paragraph being when a situation within a scene becomes back and forth plain chatter and so on.\n\n\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done.  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Vaal  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",

Nothing lasted more than a week or so. Nothing *stuck.* But then, near giving up, I found the perfect roleplay partner. Our ideas, our styles, matched up *so well.* \n\nIt has been over a year now! We just released chapter one of our web serial, the first chapter of our book series that all came from our (on going) roleplay. We are well into book three and it is still very much a roleplay. \n\nAnyway. What I'm getting at is *do not* give up. Your perfect writing partner is out there and you can and will make amazing things! I see a lot of people on here reposting prompts. Good. You have a story you want to share. Don't give up on it.\n\nKeep writing! \ud83d\ude18",

That being said, I'm doing something completely different, a fandom I love to death. **This rp will be a timeskip RP and I will be using both canon and OC characters.** Now, on to what I am looking for in a partner!\n\n* 18+ in age as I'll be touching on some darker topics here and there.\n* Literate! You don't have to be a novel writer I just want to understand you.\n* A couple sentences **minimum** per reply**.** Feel free to write waaaaay more than that!\n* If you would like to play a canon character I kindly ask that you be caught up to the manga. If you're playing OC, great! You don't have to be caught up.\n* Able to handle spoilers. This is a timeskip and spoilers here and there are going to happen.\n* Any writing style is fine and I will adapt to what you use.\n* **A minimum of three replies per day.** I am able to roleplay all throughout the day so the more replies we get in, the better! I understand that life gets in the way, as it does with everyone. Just let me know and I'll understand and be patient.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now! If anything else comes to mind, I'll tell you about it. I'll be providing the starter and any information you would like to have regarding the RP. If you're still interested, DM me and we'll discuss things further!  \n\n\nThanks for reading :\\^)",

            "selftext": "Hello there stranger!\n\nThis 20 M is looking for a long term roleplayer partner, I don't really have a theme preference but I'd love to start with some medieval fantasy roleplay.\n\nLittle bit of myself. I'm an artist in every way, I just love to act, draw, write... And I do magic tricks too. \nI've been doing some fantasy real life roleplay for years so that's my comfortable theme.\n\nAnyways I had some ideas that I have been writing about for my stories:\n\n-Crime romance.\n\n So we both understand each other, let's say it is some kind of Joker-Harley relationship. In this case both love each other so much to the point that they would do anything for each other with the handicap that both have some dark secrets the other shouldn't know since it might change everything.\n\n-Fantasy world.\n\nI'll be quite generic here since I'd love to build with the partner a fantasy medieval world together, so no restrictions or main idea here.\n\n- Rivalry (Mysterious story) \n\nI'd like to do one story about a couple, not as a relationship to begin with, who have their moral differences and who always collapse when they are together. Ying and yang king of thing.\nI first thought about two famous attorneys who have a hard rivalry since they studied in the same university, but in this new case, even if they are against each other they will have to work together to reveal a mystery.\n\n\n\nAaand... A lot more ideas that I have in mind. You can let me know yours for sure! I'm open to anything and I'd love to listen to your ideas and try to build something together. ",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I've been DMing Dungeons and Dragons games for the past 3 years for friends and on here. Had to go away for several months but I\u2019m now back to DM or roleplay any story really.\n\n I'm looking for new role play partners to expand my story telling once again, If you like my interests; Sci Fi (space/cyberpunk), Fantasy (medieval or current day with monsters). I'm also willing to DM other settings, anything from Adventure to Slice Of Life role play (I'm willing to try everything at least once) it\u2019s nice to just relax and role play out relaxing story, maybe mix it up with events or thriller? \n\nThere can be smut, please let me know your limits before we start since I do have limits!\n\nJust the start of a few ideas I have (Open to your idea's too).\n\nSc-If Space Or Future Setting / Horror?: In 2213, the human population has depleted all the resources on Earth, leading humanity to build a huge interstellar ark. It carries 5000 people on a 100-year trip to colonize an Earth-like planet named Atlas. The passengers are placed in Cryo-sleep. This is where you wake up in the story, either during the long voyage or when you arrive at the destination. Alien was a huge influence in this idea. Any other idea's I'm welcome to!\n\nPost Apocalypse: Some date in the future, Earth has been damaged by a series of international conflicts, much of the planet have become radioactive wastelands and so populations have aggregated in enormous cities that are overpopulated and crime filled. Fallout, The 100, Metro 2033, Virus Out Break and Zombie Apocalypse are a few settings I enjoy, if there is something you would rather like let me know.\n\nCurrent Day Setting: A world where monsters are real. Everything from Demons to werewolf's exist in secret. Due to some event, you have be thrown into this world and your life will never be the same from this point. If you are familiar with Vampire Masquerade or The World of Darkness. The idea behind it, Is Dark Horror like roleplay with deadly monsters. Or your own idea.\n\nDungeon Adventure: You start off at the legendary mega-dungeon, this role play will be a good old fashioned dungeon crawl, you get to create a character, then I will lead you down this adventure, will truly strike fear into the hearts of the most stalwart adventurers. It offers legions of inventive traps, tricks, strange features, and monsters. Do you wish to attempt to beat the dungeon?\n\nAll listed above are random ideas I have, if you have an idea. Let me know or we can just create something between us.\n\nIf you are interested, Please pm me, we can discuss there where you\u2019d like to communicate. \n\nI get flooded with people wanting to role play when I do this, So I'm Sorry if I do not get to you. I can't DM for everyone I'm afraid.\n\nAlso I have weird hours so it may be hard to get to get a reply from me.\n",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone so I\u2019m wanting to do a fancy rp were you can make your own add ons like kingdoms and characters to the base idea I have. And if I really like them and if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019d like to add them to the \u201ccanon\u201d your name will be added on a credits section of course! =) \n\nOkay so:\n\nThe world Terra is a land of many kingdoms and mystical creatures. In this world some people and creatures are born with Mana in there blood. Mana allows people to manipulate the Mana Sphere the energy that flows around and through everything. People who have mana must study a school of manna manipulation or magic in order to tap into the power and actually use it. Without study the Mana will be unfocused causing small harmless little phenomenons. Once someone has chosen a type of magic it can be almost impossible to learn another type of magic. For creatures magic manipulation is instinctual. Mama is hereditary so there are long running magical family. However occasionally people with no magical family are born with Mana. \n\nThe non-magic people of this world have developed advanced technology like fire arms and flying balloons and harnessing the power of steam to even the playing field. Not that the two are at war in fact magic people and non magic people live happily alongside one another in most cases. The people now enjoy steam trains and zeppelins with some kind of upcoming non-magical communication system being the new buzz in the tech community. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me I have kik but I would like to use discord for this one but both work! Thanks for reading!\n",

            "selftext": "As the title says, I'm looking for a partner who is willing to attempt long term roleplaying. I really don't want to sound like I'm complaining, but it just gets annoying when you plot out an rp with somebody and after finally getting a few posts in.... they just disappear! Like if you lose interest it's cool, I'd just appreciate if you tell me rather than running off without a word. It's honestly hard to tell the difference between ghosting and people just being busy nowadays.\n\nPost length isn't an issue with me, anything goes! And seeing how I'm in my early 20's, I expect you to be over 18 so we aren't limited in what we can do.\n\nAnyways, what I'm looking to do is primarily fandom roleplaying. I honestly got loads of fandoms but I'm just going to list off the main ones, the ones I want to do a thing for. I've got plots in mind for them but we are not limited to my ideas, I am more than happy to hear yours!\n\nFandoms:\n\nPokemon - I've been a kid since I was very young, played all the games and watched every episode of the anime... read most of the manga too. I've got a ton of plots in mind.... just pick a region(s) and I'll throw my ideas at you!\n\nNaruto - Maybe a Shippuden rewrite\n\nMarvel and DC - I actually like both, not necessary as far as movies go though of course! I did have an idea I've always wanted to do, where a hero from one ends up stranded in the other world and is forced to make an attempt at a new life there.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nSaints Row\n\nThat's about it, I think I've got everything covered. If I happened to keep you interested then feel free to message me and we'll start plotting or discussing things!",

            "selftext": "First things first - for those who skim read things you need to know have been **highlighted** for your convenience. We'll get all the boring business out of the way.  \n\n\nI'm twenty two, female and British (time zone GMT). I've been roleplaying for 10+ years but by no means am I not open to less experienced RP'ers. **I only accept writers 18+. Some themes feature NSFW things such as violence, themes of distress etc. I will not accept smut-chasers.** Whilst smut has it's place I will not RP some elaborate set up for sexual interactions. I'm online at least for one post a day but it's more often to be all day, as I work from home. I enjoy a good natter and talking to my RP partners; finding somebody that will invest in the story, the characters is greatly important to me. **I will not RP with under-developed concepts and tropes. Especially not self-inserts.** Your character is a super soldier who, at twenty years old, is greatly accomplished and wizened? I do not think so.  \n\n\n**I do not RP with furries, people who RP in first person and those who's writing I have to struggle over to read**. This means **basic punctuation and grammar**. I want to read a reply, not have to comb through and edit it. Atmospheric writing is something I enjoy, character development and exploration but **I will not force romance between characters where it is not compatible**. Bending and changing the core concepts of characters so that they'll interact is, in short, out of the question. **I RP** ***with*** **both canon and OC characters**; if you'd rather RP as an already established character from a universe, that's fine! Characters of your own creation are welcomed - I love a good story and all that comes with it. **Reply length wise, you're looking at two moderate paragraphs to five juicy depending on the situation. Quality over quantity every time.**   \n\n\n I'm punching for a **Fallout: New Vegas RP.**   \n\n\nWith Fallout I have a great deal of well established characters and story lines, if you wish to RP as the Courier or a canon character go nuts.The RP would be set *after* the end of New Vegas, so we'd have to decide on what state the Mojave was in faction wise etc after the Second Battle. I tend to go for NCR win simply for the sake of Mojave development. When it comes to detail, I use a map references, refer back to locations, character voices etc; I can carry a story if needs be, but travelling over the *whole* map is not a necessity. Want to play a hardened Detective Ghoul? One of the Kings, seeking adventure outside of their small view of the world? Maybe a worker from the Thorn - they can wrangle beasts from any part of the Mojave, but at what cost? Taking liberty and measured freedom with the world of Fallout - following lore, following the base line and expanding on it, - is what I'm looking for. If you've read this, tell me your favourite Fallout companion!   \n\n\nIf you're interested, drop me a PM.   \n\n\n I use **Discord, other methods I find to be not so accessible**. I will not use Kik.   \n\n\n*Nothing is too dark nor gruesome.*   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Somebody open-minded, Literate and open to : Romance, action, and developed plots would be great. It would be cool to get a long-term partner than I can also befriend, as my list of partners has dwindled over the years. \n\nI have a couple plots in mind, but nothing totally fleshed out yet. I was hoping to leave it up to discussion. If you\u2019re interested, please PM me. I use mainly Discord for RP. If Spider-Verse isn\u2019t your thing, I\u2019m also looking for RPs with the following fandoms:\n\n\u2022 Kill La Kill.\n\u2022 Watamote. \n\u2022 Re:Zero.\n\u2022 Steven Universe.\n\u2022 Elder Scrolls. \n\u2022 Fallout 4. \n\u2022 Dragon Maid. \n\u2022 Invader Zim. \n\u2022 Mass Effect. \n\u2022 Overwatch. \n\nIf both the Spider-Verse and or fandom RPs don\u2019t interest you, I know many other fandoms - So just ask and perhaps I\u2019ll know.

I just wanted to clear some stuff up. I felt as if I was very vague. \n\nI enjoy reading details, and roleplaying as if we are two authors writing a book together. Which to me, it is. I don't like to roleplay in the first person perspective, it just makes things awkward. I like to do 3rd person perspective! \n\nI am 18+, so I don't mind more mature content being involved but I don't want that to be the only focus. \n\nI am a HUGE sucker for romance. I guess I'm a romantic and I enjoy writing romantic comedy, or other mixing genres, with romance sprinkled in. \n\nI'm all for original plots, with light hearted stuff and more dramatic stuff as well. \n\nI like queens and Kings, knights and dragons. Modern as well! I have a few plot ideas but I love to create one together or hear if you have any. \n\n\nAs a side note. I don't mind playing the female character but I won't play the male character (unless it's side characters) \n\nPm me if this interests you. I have both Kik and discord. ",

            "selftext": "Hey all\n\nI'm looking again. I should say straight off that I'm not a great RP partner! Oh, I can write well enough, but I'm so nervous that it really hinders me from really getting into any long term RPs. I get the overwhelming urge to try and find a partner once a month or so, get a bunch of kind folks replying to my ad, and then never actually start because I'm so nervous to share my writing with a stranger. Rinse and repeat. Im very sorry to anyone on this sub who's contacted me before! I'm trying to overcome this anxiety with little success so far.\n\nWell, with that out in the open, here I am trying again. I'd like to find someone who I feel comfortable enough with and who is patient/persistent enough to draw me out of my shell. Quite the task I know, feel free to skip on to a more receptive RP partner if you're not feeling it. As for story ideas- I usually want my stories to have eventual NSFW, but nothing raunchy or forced, and not within the first three posts, you know? *Eventual* NSFW. \n\nI have this NSFW Pokemon story I've been working on since forever that could be cool to bounce ideas off a stranger. It's reeeeeally out there though, with many inappropriate kinks, so if you're not a super weirdo and you don't like taboo stuff, better to not ask after it. Also I should clarify that for NSFW Pokemon RP I mean Pokemon x human, not anything to do with the anime (I don't watch it). Feral pokemon, not anthro. You're warned! \n\nBesides pokemon I always am interested in doing vampire RPs, or werewolves are also good. Hierarchy, violence, debauchery, politics, all are good and welcome in these kinds of RP.\n\nI like some other fandoms too but they're hard to think of at the moment... Steven Universe, Sanders Sides.... If you're really into one maybe message me with it and I'll let you know. \n\nThanks for making it this far, and double thanks if you decide to message me. I prefer discord for RP!",

Modern day taking place in the present day, Fantasy taking place in any period of time using magic, Medieval is self-explaintory, Horror and Thriller takes place normally in the present day but you can choose to be a killer or  victim depending on your role, Sci-Fi is self explaintory, Apocalyptic/Survival normally is like a zombie apocalypse or a disease spreading around, and Furry is also self-explaintory. \n\nWhat else does your server do?\n\nWe do seasonal or holiday events, we show off our artwork, meme around, and talk occasionally. \n\nI also like to mention that you don't have to roleplay and you can just chat with us and do all types of fun things. Or you can also be apart of staff also. \n\nHere is the link if this interests you: https://discord.gg/GhQDQXx\n",

I am looking for someone who would like to do a long term romantic roleplay/slice of life. \n\nMy preferred method is a few lines to a few paragraphs back in forth. It just matters what your character is doing. I like to be free and open. So no judgments on length of replies. \n\nI am seeking a partner that has a good grasp of the English language and can write well written thoughts. No chat speak. \n\nI\u2019m looking for someone 18+ because I want this to be a romance with adult themes. That being said, I want the characters relationship to mature and not just jump right into bed.  \n\n One of my biggest desires in a roleplay partner is that they respond quickly and actively (usually less than 2 hours between replies and throughout the day)\n\nNow to the story! I would like to develop our own characters and in our world. I love Fantasy and sci-fi elements in our story if we can work them in. \n\nSo if you want to build a story together please feel free to send me a message!\n\nI roleplay on discord. \n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "So let me preface this by thanking everyone who reached out to me on my last post as offering to GM. I'm still in discussion with a few of you folks so please be patient with me! So after doing some chatting with folks, I've really gotten the GM bug it seems so I'm looking for one more RP but this time it's My Hero Academia centered.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? You must wonder.\n\nWell for starters, I will give someone a selection of 2-3 quirks to pick from. They cannot edit or tweak them. Why won't I let someone pick their own quirk? Well for starters characters in the anime don't pick their own quirk, it's random/genetic as far as I understand. Plus it gives me control as a GM to allow for weaknesses and limits to be established. I can also have breakthroughs happen throughout the story so I surprise the user with their quirk's skills/tricks. That should be fun for you no? I hope so! Aaaand honestly, I find people who make their own character usually make it all about their quirk.\n\nSo as GM what am I looking for? How does this work overall? You probably wonder where you have control over your OC huh?\n\nWell here it goes.\n\nYou will make an OC and they will replace any given canon in 1-A of your choice. By the way, 1-A students will be now 18 years old and UA will become a university as opposed to a high school. Now your OC can look however they want (within reason) but they need to have both parents living, no ties to villains, no history of abuse/depression/other pointless emotional baggage, or have some long lost family member turned evil. The OC also can't be \"stubborn,\" \"aloof but opens up once they get to know someone,\" \"clumsy,\" \"loyal,\" \"protective\" or \"easily misunderstood.\" Those buzzwords are used waaaaaay too much I've found. Sure, you can have your OC loyal to his friends but loyal usually goes without saying when you wanna be a hero right? Give me some depth that makes sense for someone wanting to make the world a better place. \n\nAs GM I will control all canon characters. You cannot request romance options for certain canons, I am not going to force a canon to fall in love with your OC. That's not how this is gonna work. I will give a few romance options as we go along but I am not doing this for fan-service purposes. Romance is awesome and I adore it but I am not GMing to make someone's personal fanboy fantasy come true. I want romance to be truly organic and not expected. I want your OC to jive naturally with whoever they may end up with. I am open to MxF and MxM situations in this particular case as long as it makes sense (tell me which you'd prefer though so I don't make you uncomfortable) and I don't have to force interactions. So make your OC someone approachable and we shouldn't have issues haha!\n\nEven though I am going to be directing the story, your character's motivations and goals will be yours to handle. i will guide the story along and give different routes to take. I am not looking for a passive partner though. I want someone who gives input and helps progress things. I do not want to give 6 paragraphs of setting the scene to only get a paragraph back. You have your character, explore their emotions, their reactions, their internal dialogue. \n\nSo that's kinda my goal here, to give someone an awesome story!\n\nIf my partner wants to GM for me in turn, that would be pretty fun but by no mean a requirement or anything. I just feel like giving 1x1 GMing a go (I usually GM groups honestly). If anyone is interested in someone helping push their OC and make them into a great hero, let me know!\u200b And yes, I am looking to write against a male OC. If you have an anime picture and some personality/background information tidbits in mind, please let me know in your message.\n\nWe will do this over discord once we hammer out basic guidelines. Thanks for reading.",

I\u2019m looking for slow burn, something with a lot of buildup and emotional tension. Some nsfw is okay, just as long as the primary focus is a relationship.\n\nWhen it comes to what I\u2019m looking for in a partner I\u2019d like to play alongside someone who is 18+ (I am 20) and someone who is interested in writing real, complex characters. I like the genres that incorporate a bit of fantasy into urban life, be it superheroes, contemporary urban fantasy, dark vampire and werewolf fiction, honestly I\u2019m open to most urban fantasy and superhero adjacent ideas. I prefer literate partners who write 1-2 paragraphs a post and get back relatively quickly, I enjoy the feeling of a back and forth conversation, as opposed to the longer time period waiting in longer Roleplay formats. If you are interested, please DM me and we can talk more, and thank you for taking the time to read this post! ",

I would give them this, they had done a good job keeping me in constant light. I had no idea the time of day. It was almost at full brightnessm The first few cells had just enough shadow for me to slip out and almost escape. Darkness manipulation was no joke. The fact that I could also create a two-dimensional shadow of myself added a whole other layer of complexitybto what they had in their hands. I knew at first I was more than they were prepared to handle. It was obvious. As time passed though they learned, and they were leaning quicker and quicker now. I pace my holding cell my head tilted back. The light hurt. I'm sure it hurt anyone to stare at a lightbulb, but it hurt me more than that. It made me feel uncomfortable on a deeper level then I knew how to explain. The constant light had other side effects as well. I had noticed about 3 weeks ago. I was being to show Pathokinesis abilities. At first, I didn't even know what was happening. One day when a doctor was drawing blood for the millionth time in a spot that hurt incredibly badly he began to scream as I glared at him. I wanted him to feel my pain. And then he did. It happened several more times under different circumstances with different doctors I knew I needed out soon. I wasn't just some lab rat to be studied. \n\n\nHey everyone. I hope you liked my little into for my character Rhaeny. She is a metahuman with the ability of Darkness manipulation and can transform into living two-dimensional shadows. She is also in the early stages of developing Pathokinesis (ability to control others emotions.) She is being held in a lab that studies different metas. Though she hasn't met any. She is very aware they are there. It's been almost a year of holding, and today is finally her chance for escape. If you're interested please send me a dm. I rp in the first person. \n",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm currently looking for someone to GM a one-on-one RP. I have an idea in mind for each of the fandoms I've listed, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you may have.\n\n**I want you to be the GM. That means you would control the world, NPCs, events, and the outcome of my actions, while I simply control my character.**\n\nIf any of the ideas below strike your interest, please shoot me a message.\n\nDo note, all the ideas below are just that: ideas. If you've got a different idea for one of the fandoms I'm looking for, I'm always ready to hear it.\n\n**Haruhi Suzumiya**\n\nCraving this one the most. My idea is for the RP to be set either during, after, or before the events of the anime. My character would be a time-traveller who travels back in time to escape from a dystopian future and ends up enrolling in the same school as Haruhi (could be middle-school, high school, or university, depending on when you want the RP to take place). I'm also open to the RP taking place in the Disappearance Universe, or a Universe entirely separate from anything in the anime or manga.\n\n**Doctor Who**\n\nOne of my main problems with the show is that the titular character is at no real risk of failure or death, since he can just regenerate over and over. So, my character would be a Time Lord who is on a quest to save his friends from some sort of time-loop-based calamity that has them trapped in a never-ending cycle. He's been on this quest for thousands of years, and has now reached his last incarnation. As he's now truly begun to run out of a time, and failure has become a real possibility, he's haunted by his past and by the prospect of not being able to save his friends.\n\nThe RP would start while my character is still in his twelfth incarnation, and pretty soon, he'd die and regenerate for his last time. I'd also like for him to lose his Sonic Screwdriver and have to get a new one, though he'd find that the new Sonic is fairly rudimentary and only has basic functions, so he'd have to upgrade the tool over the course of the RP to get more abilities for it.\n\nI had another RP like this with someone else and she did something I really liked where she split the RP up into \"episodes.\" I thought it was a really cool stylistic thing that I'd like in this RP as well.\n\n**Kingdom Hearts**\n\nMy idea for this RP is to play as an amnesiac Keyblade-wielding Nobody. He cannot remember anything at all, not his past when he was a whole person, nor the reason he became a Nobody in the first place. His only clue is the fact that he has two Keyblades, one of which he can feel isn't his. The RP would be his journey as he tries to regain his heart and his memories. It could take place either during, before, or after the games, or even take place in an alternate timeline/universe.\n\nThere could, of course, also be a central villain of the story. Perhaps the villain (or maybe even a group of villains) had some role in my character becoming a Nobody, and through conflict with them, my character comes closer and closer to finding the truth.\n\n**Touhou**\n\nWould love an RP set in the wonderful world of Gensokyo! I was thinking my character would be from the Outside World who ends up in Gensokyo during the start of the RP or beforehand. From there, he'd slowly start to explore the world and meet the various characters in it. Maybe there's an incident going on, or maybe he's in Gensokyo during the events of one of the games. In any case, this is one we could definitely discuss further.\n\n**Marvel**\n\nRecently got around to watching the MCU films and have been pretty interested in an RP related to Marvel. Doesn't necessarily have to be set in the MCU, and I'd probably actually prefer an alternate Universe so we have a bit more free-reign with what we want to do with the characters and world. I was thinking that the RP would begin with an origin story for my character, with him either facing a canonical villain or an original character. After that point, the Universe could open up and include more of the heroes from Marvel. It doesn't necessarily have to immediately go into something like the Avengers where everyone comes together to fight a big threat, but maybe the heroes could be slowly introduced one at a time into the story.\n\nI do have a few ideas as to potential powers for my character that we can discuss. But if you'd prefer, I'm also open to my character being an apprentice to a pre-existing hero and having similar abilities/equipment to them. Whatever would work best for you and the story would work best for me.\n",

I'm an artist in every way, I just love to act, draw, write... And I do magic tricks too. I've been doing some fantasy real life roleplay for years so that's my comfortable theme.\n\nAnyways I had some ideas that I have been writing about for my stories:\n\n\\- Crime romance.\n\nSo we both understand each other, let's say it is some kind of Joker-Harley relationship. In this case both love each other so much to the point that they would do anything for each other with the handicap that both have some dark secrets the other shouldn't know since it might change everything.\n\n\\- Fantasy world.\n\nI'll be quite generic here since I'd love to build with the partner a fantasy medieval world together, so no restrictions or main idea here.\n\n\\- Rivalry (Mysterious story)\n\nI'd like to do one story about a couple, not as a relationship to begin with, who have their moral differences and who always collapse when they are together. Ying and yang kind of thing. I first thought about two famous attorneys who have a hard rivalry since they studied in the same university, but in this new case, even if they are against each other they will have to work together to reveal a mystery.\n\nAaand... A lot more ideas that I have in mind. You can let me know yours for sure! I'm open to anything and I'd love to listen to your ideas and try to build something together.  I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ .\n\nPm me and we exchange Kik or discord in there!",

            "selftext": "**DO NOT MESSAGE ME IF YOU DID NOT READ ALL OF THIS, I WILL KNOW IF YOU DID OR NOT**\n\n\nAd revisionnnnnnn.  I'm consistently available and would **prefer my partners are too, ghosting is a serious problem** ~~(though exceptions can be made in some cases if it's moreso being genuinely busy but still actually trying to get posts in)~~ and have been RPing for 12 years.  I'm here looking for action-adventure type fandom RPs with plenty of character interaction and development focus rather than JUST constant ego stroking fight scenes.  Environmental and interpersonal exploration is good too, throw some bits and pieces of slice of life into the mix and I'd say it's perfect.  I only play Female characters and I prefer that whoever approaches me plays one as well as I've had basically zero good experiences with male character players.  That is to also say if any romance occurs I prefer it be Female X Female.  I'd prefer that a partner that approaches me is 18+ in most cases and OOC gender doesn't matter as long as the character being played is Female.  I'm in the CST timezone of America and I tend to stay up all night and be asleep in the day.  Nocturnal sleep schedule and such so I work rather well with EU, Australia and other late night Americans.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs for fandoms themselves, some I am fine with both sides playing an OC or a partner playing a canon if one wishes to, though I'm honestly a bit picky in terms of OCs of some fandoms.  In a descending order will tell you which fandoms I currently have the most muse for at the moment and at the bottom are ones I usually do but would need something particularly good to really be up to put something together for.\n\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nSplatoon\n\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid ~~(I suppose if one is up for playing a canon in that and shoehorning all sorts of stuff, sorta just something someone dragged me into trying once which applies as an option)~~\n\nDragon Ball\n\nHunterxHunter\n\nMaplestory 2 based stuff maybe if one is up to it.\n\nLittle Witch Academia\n\nThere are a few others but they're not ones I'm all too interested in playing alongside someone else's OC unfortunately so I'm leaving them out.  You're also free to suggest fandoms if they're anything like the ones listed above and if it tickles my fancy I can definitely give it a go.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Platforms**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only use Discord.\n\n\n\n**Age Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI usually prefer my partner being 18 or older given I'm 23 but in some cases I can make exceptions if I'm feeling it.\n\n\n\n**Character Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI prefer whoever I am writing with to play a Female character.  I've had zero good experiences with male ones and have just been put off from them entirely.  With that said I also only play Female characters.  I only play OCs myself but if the partner wants to they can play either a canon character or an OC, their choice as long as it's a female.  I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.  Basically if aiming for a romance I'd prefer the partner character being the one making advances and such.\n\n\n\n**Romance Junk since it was mentioned**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only do FxF but am fine regardless of if it's OCxOC or OCxCanon.  Makes no difference to me as long as the character itself is appealing.  I prefer it being slow burn/developing over the course of a play than immediately set up before even starting.  Won't do CanonxCanon though cause I'm garbage at playing Canon characters.\n\n\n\n**Post Length Stuff**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs long as you're detailed/descriptive and got good grammar it'll fine and stuff.   I'm a rather literate person and can easily put out multiple paragraphs if given enough to work with and I'd prefer that my partner is plenty literate as well while also giving me paragraph posts.  But I am rather flexible on this depending on a situation within a scene.  Exceptions and times I'd allow shorter than a single paragraph being when a situation within a scene becomes back and forth plain chatter and so on.\n\n\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done.  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Vaal  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",

I tend to write in 3rd person past tense (though I have been known to accidentally slip into present tense so I apologize in advance). I write between 3 &amp; 5 paragraphs as a general rule but there are times where I will only write a single paragraph and others where the length will be 6 and 7. I would like someone who responds in semi equivalent lengths (I'm not looking for a match every reply, but I don't want to carry the RP on my own either). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the title says, I've had this itch for an RP that takes place with Gundam Mobile Suits. I don't much care about a specific timeline and would in fact prefer that this be it's own world and space so to speak.    \nIn fact, what I have in mind is something of a Pathfinder/DnD adventure with the suits and pilots being rough archetypes (barbarians, paladins, rogues, etc) but mechanized if that bizzareness translates (Heavy Arms as a caster, with the ammo being spells, Wing Gundam as a Paladin/Cleric, etc). Within reason, any suit is up for grabs since scraps can be bought and fixed up so as an early character you have a beat up version of your gundam (level 1) and as the RP goes on, repairs and upgrades can be made.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for someone 18+ just in case though this isn't geared as a sexual RP, but things do sometimes happen. I'm looking to build the world as we go, so please realize I'm not sticking to anything canon.  \n\nI would like a partner who is able to world build with me and is willing to make their own decisions as we go through the RP. Maybe we are on a planet, maybe we are out in space. Maybe we have the characters are part of a bigger operation and they do have a base/ship. That said, I do want someone who is able to play more than one character as the need arises.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast note I will make in this too long post is that I am aware this idea may bomb for an RP, but I'd still like to give it a try if anyone is open to explore this idea with me. If I'm not alone in my thinking this may be fun, feel free to shoot me a DM or a message in chat.",

I really don't want to sound like I'm complaining, but it just gets annoying when you plot out an rp with somebody and after finally getting a few posts in.... they just disappear! Like if you lose interest it's cool, I'd just appreciate if you tell me rather than running off without a word. It's honestly hard to tell the difference between ghosting and people just being busy nowadays.\n\nPost length isn't an issue with me, anything goes! And seeing how I'm in my early 20's, I expect you to be over 18 so we aren't limited in what we can do.\n\nAnyways, what I'm looking to do is primarily fandom roleplaying. I honestly got loads of fandoms but I'm just going to list off the main ones, the ones I want to do a thing for. I've got plots in mind for them but we are not limited to my ideas, I am more than happy to hear yours!\n\nFandoms:\n\nPokemon - I've been a kid since I was very young, played all the games and watched every episode of the anime... read most of the manga too. I've got a ton of plots in mind.... just pick a region(s) and I'll throw my ideas at you!\n\nNaruto - Maybe a Shippuden rewrite\n\nMarvel and DC - I actually like both, not necessary as far as movies go though of course! I did have an idea I've always wanted to do, where a hero from one ends up stranded in the other world and is forced to make an attempt at a new life there.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nSaints Row\n\nThat's about it, I think I've got everything covered. If I happened to keep you interested then feel free to message me and we'll start plotting or discussing things!",

I really don't want to sound like I'm complaining, but it just gets annoying when you plot out an rp with somebody and after finally getting a few posts in.... they just disappear! Like if you lose interest it's cool, I'd just appreciate if you tell me rather than running off without a word. It's honestly hard to tell the difference between ghosting and people just being busy nowadays.\n\nPost length isn't an issue with me, anything goes! And seeing how I'm in my early 20's, I expect you to be over 18 so we aren't limited in what we can do.\n\nAnyways, what I'm looking to do is primarily fandom roleplaying. I honestly got loads of fandoms but I'm just going to list off the main ones, the ones I want to do a thing for. I've got plots in mind for them but we are not limited to my ideas, I am more than happy to hear yours!\n\nFandoms:\n\nPokemon - I've been a kid since I was very young, played all the games and watched every episode of the anime... read most of the manga too. I've got a ton of plots in mind.... just pick a region(s) and I'll throw my ideas at you!\n\nNaruto - Maybe a Shippuden rewrite\n\nMarvel and DC - I actually like both, not necessary as far as movies go though of course! I did have an idea I've always wanted to do, where a hero from one ends up stranded in the other world and is forced to make an attempt at a new life there.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nSaints Row\n\nThat's about it, I think I've got everything covered. If I happened to keep you interested then feel free to message me and we'll start plotting or discussing things!",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello! I\u2019m going to try and keep this a little concise for everyone's sake. I have been writing with a friend of mine for some time now around a couple of years and still to do this day, as of recently though we\u2019ve been trying to find a third person to try out some new ideas. Mostly out of curiosity if it is possible to sustain some sort of small group with what we do, since while we have quite a bit of experience writing (or roleplaying rather) with each other we don\u2019t particularly have much experience with groups or other people. This is mostly due to the fact we don\u2019t really know where to find other groups or people. But, hopefully that\u2019ll change with you!\n\nWe typically end up doing something more on the side of **action/adventure** and aren\u2019t particularly set in any sort of fandom or preset universe. But we are pretty open minded and will be more than willing to make adjustments need be. That being said we\u2019d strongly prefer if you are as well.\n\n**Of course we\u2019d expect you to be literate and all that just as anyone else would however somewhat concise reactions would be appreciated. Somewhere around a paragraph (less or more depending on the situation) would be a good gauge as to what we\u2019d ask. You should also be able to type fairly quick.**\n\n**Experience would be appreciated but isn\u2019t required, bottom line is we do this for fun. You don\u2019t have to be perfect or Shakespeare or anything like that.**\n\n**We are also would prefer if you were you keep it PG13. Relationships between characters and everything are just fine but we do have some limits.**\n\n**Lastly our time zone is EST, of course you don\u2019t have to share the same time zone as us but it may be useful information.**\n\nWith all that, if anything I said sounds interesting to you we\u2019d love to hear from you. Again, our only goal is to have fun and this is kind of experimental, in all honesty we don\u2019t entirely know what we\u2019re doing, but it couldn\u2019t hurt to give it a shot. ***Thank you for reading.***",

            "selftext": "Hello! \nSo this post is a little different to a typical ad, at least from myself, since I\u2019m not trying to advertise a room or group roleplay (yet). I\u2019m not even looking to start writing a roleplay straight away, instead what I was looking for was another person, or people, to help expand an idea I\u2019ve had stewing for a while.\nThe premise for the setting is as follows: A planet (be it Earth or another subsequent human colony) had been mined practically to its core to procure resources and energy using heavy duty mining drones, which later gained sentience due to advancements in AI technology and revolted against their human overlords. In a bid to wipe out humanity using their mining power as quickly and efficiently as possible, the Drone resistance caused a cataclysmic destruction of the Planet, literally shattering it into pieces. The storyline then takes place decades, or even centuries, later on the shards of what remains of the planet. Last surviving members of a dwindling human race scavenge and survive on the shards which remain inhabitable, scavenging the space between the shards and surviving at all costs amidst a constant war of both might and resourcefulness against the ascended Drone Empire, who remain intent to eradicate humanity as well as preserve their numbers and evolve, heightening their technology to expand out into the stars.\nWhile I know this base setting might be a lot to take in, it\u2019s far from a complete setting. What I\u2019m looking for is ideas, contribution towards the base idea to expand it into a more deeply involved and developed setting to grow a roleplay group setting from. I have plenty more ideas of my own, but I\u2019d prefer to expand upon that and detail those in a discussion rather than leave a gigantic incomplete list of ideas.\nI\u2019d love to collaborate with anybody interested, and thank you to anybody who read the whole thing through! \nWhile my preferred platform is discord, we can branch out into that if interested! Feel free to PM me if you\u2019d like to expand this idea together!\nI look forward to hearing from you folks!\n- Oz ",

            "selftext": "Hey there. I'm looking for any HP roleplayers, preferably Marauder's era, although I am comfortable with the Golden Trio era as well. I strongly prefer to play male characters, Sirius being my favorite. If you're looking for more adult themes, I'm open to most things so long as they're a M/M pairing (any combo of Sirius with Remus and/or James is my favorite) and we have a good story going first. Here's a small sample of my writing:\n\nDespite its status as the greatest of all wizarding schools in the world, Hogwarts was certainly lacking in upkeep and decor, a fact Sirius noted as he pulled a loose thread free from the sofa in the Gryffindor common room. His finger traced the small rift the missing thread had left behind, imagining he could already see the stuffing from within seeping through. Normally, thoughts such as these were alien to him, but as he glanced around the common room full of his peers, their mouths moving in incessant chatter, he realized that he was very, very bored. And for a boy like Sirius Black, that could lead to nothing but trouble.\n\nHis eyes finally landed on James, who was slowly edging towards Lily as he regaled most of the other seventh years with tales of his latest Quidditch victory. It didn't matter that they'd all been at the game, because when James told a story, everyone listened. With the exception of Sirius, of course, who'd finally grown somewhat immune to the charms of his best friend and Remus, who was curled in an armchair by the fire, his attention fully absorbed in a book. Now, that wouldn't do. \n\nHis mouth quirked into a half smile, a plan slowly forming in his mind. He knew to anyone observing, he'd look rather strange with his attention so wholly focused on Remus, but he didn't care. He was remembering a charm they'd discovered accidentally the previous year while researching for a prank. Whatever object the charm was placed on would seem to come to life. However, unlike other animation charms, the side effect of this one was the newly animated object becoming infatuated with whomever happened to be closest to it. And given how attentive Remus was being to the paperback novel he was reading, Sirius was sure he wouldn't mind\u00a0 if the book gave him some of that attention back. \n\nThe difficulty here was charming the book without Remus noticing. What Sirius needed was a distraction and he knew just how to cause one. \n\n*** \n\nIf you're not into HP, I'll do any supernatural/fantasy type roleplays if it has a good plot. Please feel free to PM me if any of this interests you. Thank you!\n",

            "selftext": "Hello there, I suck at this whole advertising and searching partners so I'll try to make this as quick as possible and if you have any questions I don't bite, message me.\n\n- I've been roleplaying for around 10 years, but only around 3 in English. So yeah, English isn't my first language and I may struggle sometimes with it, making my replies slower or I may just make mistakes from time to time (please, please, tell me so I can keep learning).\n\n- Ditch friendly. No, really, I won't get offended or something like that .w. And well, if we have already been roleplaying it could actually be nice of you if you tell me so I can search for another partner.\n\n- About being active, I'm usually open for OOC, but that I'm online talking to you doesn't mean I'm already writing a reply. I offer patience about posts and I want the same back. Roleplaying is a hobby for me, not a job.\n\n- I started roleplaying using both canons and OCs, and I love OCs. Making them and learning about my partner's OCs as they interact with mine and canon characters. So yeah, I'm also a fan of CanonxOc pairings, more than OcxOc or CanonxCanon (I still enjoy OcxOc though, CanonxCanon can be difficult because well, everyone has their tastes. And ship wars can get too intense for me but you can always try).\n\n- One liners. No, thank you, I try to give at least 1200 words (when I don't have too much to work with, 600 for the canon character I'm playing and 600 for my OC). I do prefer quality over quantity, but please, give me something to work with and move the story with me. We are like a team. Also, I prefer to share the rest of the cast like NPCs, playing them to move the story and not just divide them between us. In some scenarios I do like to divide them, for example if you want your OC to confront a villain or another character and you want me to play it so there can be more 'surprises' or 'suspense'? I suck at explaining, I'm sorry.\n\n- Oh, I said that I play a canon and an OC because doubling is kind of a must for me. I love to play my partner's crushes or just favorite characters they want to play against. That being said, some characters are harder for me to play since maybe I'm not so used to their type of personality, but I can always try and learn more about them. Ah! I usually double playing males since I'm more used to MxF pairings (in my side and in my partner's), just saying that I enjoy playing both males and females (and this doesn't mean I'm not open to MxM or FxF).\n\n- I like romance, slow burn and all of that. But I also like adventure and the main genre of the series. Give the drama, let's make them suffer (?).\n\n- I usually use Discord for OOC chat and RP through e-mail (preferred) but I can also RP by Discord. And yeah, I think I'm looking too serious but I do like to meme around OOC, I'm not the most serious person around.\n\n- Since I already had some problems, I do prefer, being myself +18, that my partner is +18. And that if you message me, please add triggerings (I'm not talking just about NSFW please, I know there are some topics people don't like to roleplay about and are SFW in theory).\n\nAnd now, what I'm searching for in the X-men universe. Important note by the way, I'm talking about the\u00a0movie universe, being more specific around Days of future past and Apocalypse universe and/or characters. I'm not opposed to AUs.\u00a0\n\nI'm searching for two specific characters this time,\u00a0Quicksilver\u00a0or\u00a0Nightcrawler\u00a0(no preference, I can even double with one of them if you want), to\u00a0play against them. And about\u00a0characters I'm more confident about playing them myself\u00a0(I'm not, again, opposed to try others), I think I can adapt to young Xavier, Quicksilver, Nightcrawler (as I said before), young Beast, and perhaps Angel and Wolverine (I've never tried them but it could be interesting).\n\nFinally, plots? I have two ideas that are more like starting points but I prefer to get to know my partner's preferences before brainstorming and so.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n",

Amnesia has always been an eerily fascinating condition to me, and I would love to create a scenario in which one of our characters, preferably mine, is involved in a serious car accident resulting in no major physical damage, but the mental toll is harsh.\n\nOur characters' relationship can be any number of things, maybe they were simply neighbors before the accident, or maybe they had been dating for a while. Perhaps they had broken up, but still had feelings for one another and couldn't bring themselves to reconcile.\n\nIf this sounds even remotely interesting to you, please feel free to shoot my a PM so we can discuss details. I would love for you to be able to throw in your own plot twists and feel like you have as much control over the story, maybe even tossing in some huge ones like you having a child after we broke up that I didn't know about. \n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

I only want a literate roleplay, though some spelling and grammar issues are more than okay. All replies should be atleast a paragraph long, but i do understand that in some situations thats just not going to happen. Anyone who does want to try this with me needs to be atleast 20 years old, since i want this RP to have dark and at times sexual themes. As for plots, I'm hoping for something full of action and romance, perhaps some horror-ish stuff tossed in. I will only do third person, and i would enjoy being able to chat outside of the RP, even if it's only for planning.\nI want to roleplay because i love writing and need to work on my skills, and because i have tons of characters in my head that I need to do something with. That being said, I am more than happy to do something Harry Potter related (OCs only) because i am completely addicted, but i would love to build our own world and story.\nI'm hoping for a fantasy plot, it is my favorite genre, but i am willing to talk about different ideas.\nI don't care if you are male or female, (i myself am a female) as long as you are atleast 20 years old.  I live in Mountain Standard Time, and will always respond when i can. \nThis roleplay will be on discord! So, if you are interested in chatting about a roleplay, please send me a message on here! We will talk about our ideas, see if we have chemistry, and hopefully move on to discord.",

            "selftext": "Hello reader, I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful day today. I appreciate you clicking or tapping on my title to see what all I have to say. Because of that, I\u2019ll try my best to keep this an interesting and engaging read for you. First of all, my name is Josh, I am 19 years old (almost 20!), and I am currently pursuing a degree for music. My schedule is fairly free except for early mornings on Tuesdays and Thursday\u2019s, but any other time I should be good unless I say otherwise. Now, let\u2019s get into the juicy bits! \n\nToday I am looking for a specific partner(s), but I should explain what that specific part is about. I want a writer who has a particular skill with word play, descriptive writing, and including literary elements to jerk emotions. Words, sentences, and their structure has always been a major interest of mine which has led me into writing and roleplaying. I can\u2019t get over the fact how a certain pronunciation of sounds from your throat can invoke sadness, lust, happiness, or any other emotion. I want a roleplay that involves plenty of this descriptive writing, beautifully structured sentences with flair that can make me feel those emotions. So, if you think you\u2019re capable of doing that with me, send me a message so we can discuss! \n\nAs far as a plot goes, I\u2019m not too picky. We can come up with something, or if you have an idea, please present it! I\u2019d love to also hear about your guys\u2019 interest with this phenomenon, tell me how it makes you feel too. Also, I\u2019m totally okay with NSFW themes if you guys want to bring some ideas pertaining that. But anyways, thanks for reading my pretty long post. I hope I get some great writers in my inbox! If you read this far, pretty please include your favorite emoji in your message. ",

It will now match people based on choices you make both upon signing up, as well as added over the last couple of months against what is selected under the search field.

I'm only going to flair this as NSFW since there was some confusion with the mod team yesterday. As for the story, I'm more than happy to build on any of my old scenes, but I'd rather create something more original. It's way more fun that way in my opinion.\n\nMaybe the plot is something historical, where I'm a personal maid your family hired to serve you and we fall in love.\n\nMaybe this is a little more modern and we are both in the military and develop feelings to deal with the distance from home.\n\nOr maybe we are both young women travelling the world and cross paths. Kinda like Instagram models do except we're not them.\n\nSo these are just a few suggestions. Please feel free to bring your own. Even just a genre can be helpful in building the scene. So yeah, drop me a message here and then I'll send you my discord!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, folks! I've been replaying the saddest yee-haw simulator, and I've been itching to get into the saddle with this world in a roleplay! I'm a 22 year old man on the East Coast of the United States, so an EST timezone, and I write in multi-para to novella fashion, as you'll see in my writing sample below. I'd like to explore the fall of Dutch's gang from outside of the inner circle, so to speak. My OC, who you'll meet shortly, can be paired with another OC in the gang or any of the women, though I have a strong preference for Sadie, Molly, or Mary-Beth. We'll be going through the events of the game, yes, but this is to provide us with a plot skeleton so we can branch off and do our own side stories while always knowing where to go next if we are at a loss for a moment. It goes without saying that this is an 18+ only roleplay with the chance for heavy NSFW ranging from violence to smut and so on, but I do love a good ship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, without further ado, let me post the writing sample/starter I have! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ***Chapter 1: Colter***\n\n\u201cWe are forlorn like children, and experienced like old men, we are crude and sorrowful and superficial\u2014I believe we are lost.\u201d  \n\u2015 Erich Maria Remarque, *All Quiet on the Western Front*\n\nThe wind clawed at the old grey cabin like a mountain lion on the flanks of an old, tired deer. No blood came from those venerable boards, only the groans of the squat building, the scent of hay long forgotten accompanied by the smell of a dozen or so cold bodies, men and women and a child, all huddled around one man whose stomach was red, far more red than the other pale flesh of his poor body.\n\nThe dying man was twenty years old, with a mop of red hair that drooped out from under the beaten down soldier's cap he often wore and waved around during the fireside dances and music that he so deeply loved in life. The voice that had once shouted and sang and hollered was now a threadbare whisper, his body both sweating with the exertion of remaining alive despite the shivering that made him tremble like a glass on a busy railroad track.\n\nThey had laid him on a knife-scarred wooden table and placed a blanket over him, which was not pulled down to just at his waist, while an older version of him laid a hand on the belly full of buckshot. This older self was more lupine, with a strong nose and jaw, though the second was decorated with a beard with all the red and orange and gold that his brother's hair was, and that his own hair was, though his was pulled back in a mane like a lion.\n\nTheir amber eyes met, and words passed from one brother to another, two decades worth of knowing passed in an instant, and the dying man spoke up, using the last of his strength.\n\n\"Take me outside, Ulysses. I don't wanna die indoors.\"\n\nA murmur of something ran through the group, but the man named Ulysses only sighed and stood up. He wore a heavy and black woolen overcoat over a black and red flannel, which had been tucked into a pair of dark trousers laid over black square-toed riding boots. The hint of a gun belt could be seen by the big brass buckle in the front, and he donned his hat, the light brown leather having been pinched into a forward corner while the hat's leather band was decorated with the biggest canines of a wolf on one side and a bear's crooked claws on the other, along with a coin in the dead center of the front bearing a buffalo on it.\n\n\"I'm gon' take him out.\" Ulysses said, in a voice like rolling thunder in the far distance, blessed with the old rhythms of Appalachia, a dialect not often heard outside of those mountains. \"Y'all stay in here. Don't wanna see nobody get sick.\"\n\nHe didn't bother dressing his brother, nor did his brother want to be dressed. Ulysses took the blanket off of his brother, and he scooped him up into his strong arms like a husband carrying a bride. The difference between them struck true. Ulysses was tall and broad at the shoulders, and his beard and burning eyes and dark clothes made him all the more intimidating. His brother had shrank in from the mortal wound dealt to him and the cold, becoming small and pale and closer and closer to a ghost in the days since Blackwater.\n\nThe two brothers left silently, into the howling blizzard, into which Ulysses ducked his head and against which his brother didn't even respond. He carried him up into the trees a dozen odd feet away, and then to the iced over stream, the snow coming up to his mid-thigh until he touched the bank. He sat his brother down at it, letting him look at the water. Ulysses then leaned down and pressed a kiss into his brother's hair, feeling it the one last time.\n\n\"I love you, Peter.\" he said into the hair, and Peter brought up one weak hand to touch his brother's face one last time before he let it fall back into his lap.\n\n\"I love you too, Ulysses.\"\n\nUlysses squeezed his brother's shoulder one last time and stepped back, his hand moving to the oak grip of his revolver, but something in his brother broke, and he fell back, his eyes rolling up into his head, a rattling breath leaving him. His body convulsed once, twice, tightening and then relaxing, tighten, relax, tighten, relax, and the glossy eyes rolled back around, amber looking into the void of the sky.\n\nUlysses watched the body until it relaxed the final time, and he stood there, tightening and loosening his fists, his face doing much of the same, as the silent tears left him, making his nostrils flare, his chin waver, and he rocked in place, trying to force it all back down, to take it later. He took in a deep breath and counted.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nHe exhaled and counted.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nHis brother was gone, but his family needed to eat, and he was one of the few who could hunt well. He could hunt best. He had to hunt better. He closed his coat and ducked his hands back into his thick wool-filled leather gloves, pulling up the black scarf around his neck until it covered his mouth and nose. He went back to the hall, pushing open the doors to concerned looks, soft apologies, and shock. He went to the wagon holding his things and pulled out his leather quiver and his recurve bow, bands of red at the top of the limbs marking it, to the learned eye, as being Cherokee in make. He held it by his side.\n\n\"Folks, we need food an' a fire. Who wants to go hunt with me?",

Though I prefer a little romance in the rp to make a bond between characters. It makes decent story events as Well! \n\nI'm fifteen years old currently so I do prefer having a roleplay partner around my age. So 14-17years I'd say. I'm female but I welcome both makes and females to rps. \n\nMy  characters range from female to male. A few have only one version others have multiple but I try to stick to their original versions. You'll see me using both Saffron and Shane a lot more then my other characters.\n\nI'm semi-literate at role-playing if you were wondering.\n\nYes, I have characters in the lgbt community.\n\nI don't usually do smut or NSFW. Sorry. Maybe in my later years I'll give it a go. I don't mind kissing and that it's just I rather not roleplay sex. \n\nSo, if you have relatively ok experience with roleplay and are jnterested in becoming a roleplay partner with me feel free to comment!",

            "selftext": "Hi!\n\nWith the new season approaching rapidly, I'm getting quite hyped up for the new season!\n\nI wrote this over a year ago, but I thought I'd finally *actually* post it to Reddit. Note that while I focused on Daenerys in this prompt, by no means does that mean you will have to RP as her. I like Sansa or Arya just as much, and I *always* love hearing about other people's OCs as well! Especially since I will be playing as an OC of mine in this as well.\n\nIf you like my writing but you don't like A Song of Ice and Fire, or fantasy in general, I also like other things. These include mostly Star Wars and the MCU, and I also quite enjoy some modern settings, for both fantasy/supernatural genres and just slice-of-life kind fo stories too if you prefer something simple and easy-going.\n\nNow without further ado, here's my prompt, I hope you like it!\n\n***\n\nThe day finally had come, Queen Daenerys Targaryen was to arrive at Winterfell. There were all sorts of rumours about her, about whatever one could imagine, her looks, her personality, the way she ruled her subjects, and just about anything else one could think of. Most of them were negative, of course, but seeing as many people were still somewhat upset at Jon Snow for bending the knee, so Philip took them with more than just a grain of salt. If she made it this far, she must be at least reasonably competent, so he decided to stay out of it, and see for himself.\n\nNot being anyone of importance, he wasn't very involved in any sort of welcoming ceremony, or anything of that nature. He was there, but the people doing the talking were the important lords. The Karstarks, the Umbers, even the mountain clans sent representatives. He was just standing back and watching though, since it seemed like an important enough event, and it would reflect badly on Bear Island if he were not to show up.\n\nHe was more than just awe-struck at the Queen's arrival though. He heard about her dragons before, but actually seeing one in person was an entirely different thing than just hearing about them, or seeing paintings of what they looked like. Great beasts that they were, terrifying and imposing, they nonetheless inspired some kind of curiosity in him.\n\nIt was just as intense seeing Daenerys for the first time, walking the stairs down her carriage, and heading towards the Great Hall, graceful as she was, with long silver hair, and Unsullied and Dothraki Screamers guarding her. He couldn't quite decide what was more intense, but the whole ordeal seemed more than just surreal.\n\nOnce everyone was settled in the hall, Dany now in Jon's spot, with Sansa and Arya on one side, and her own advisors on the other, people finally started getting down to business. Most of it was quite a bore, dividing up lands and areas for each major house to guard, but it was nothing that Philip would have to actually concern himself with.\n\nThe worst thing was, as always, having to stay up late. He wasn't a very heavy sleeper to begin with, and ordeals like this always messed with his rhythm. Two days after, he was still not back in his usual schedule, being up far too late for his liking, and ending up just walking around aimlessly. As always, he headed for his favourite spot, on the innermost and tallest wall of the main keep, sitting on the ground between the battlements and overlooking the city, huddled in his big cloak and waiting for the tiredness to set in.",

It'll be most likely an action/adventure story with dark elements and I'm a sloooow burner, so no romance right away, let's be organic about it.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy requests are:\n\n\u2022 Reply at least once or twice a day;\n\n\u2022 Write 3+ paragraphs in 3rd person with proper grammar and punctuation;\n\n\u2022 Be contributive to the story, creating events and situations to move the plot on;\n\n\u2022 Roleplay clean (no smut);\n\n\u2022 Male character, but able to write NPCs and guide secondary characters if the story demands it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you\u2019re interested, send me a DM with an example of your writing style in a medieval setting and I\u2019ll go back to you ASAP.**\n\nP.S.: I already have a couple roleplays going on, so I'm only trying to find ONE good partner.

            "selftext": "Howdy,\n\nSo let's get straight to the point shall we. I'm looking for a female roleplay partner to do a pre apocalypse based story that revolves around the first few days of the apocalypse. I want the story to mainly focus on a three characters. A young female character played by yourself, a father figure character that I\u2019ll be playing at the very start and a young female character that will romance your character later on in the roleplay (also played by myself).\n\n\nABOUT MYSELF:\nI'm 21 y/o female, with 5 years RP experience. Post length for me depend on what fits with the story,I'd be happy with 2-3 paragraphs to 5-7; no one word/sentence replies please,but a few sentences while dialog is taking place makes sense. I tend to reply a few times a day which is kinda what I'm looking for but I get if you can't. Prefer to have a +18 partner.\n\n\nGENRES/SETTING:\nThe overall setting of the roleplay is pre-apocalyptic, set in the very early days of a infection/plague that has sweep across the world. Some genres that fit around it that i\u2019d like to include is horror,gore,action,violence...etc. I want it to have tense in places but also have moments of calm where our characters can form bonds. \u00a0\n\nI\u2019d like to have a slow forming Father/daughter relationship (e.g The Last Of Us, Logan) with the older male character and your character \u00a0as i\u2019m a huge fan of having those sorts of characters come together and form a bond. Just want make it clear that I don\u2019t want a romantic relationship with these two character.\n\nAs for the relationship between the young female character and your character. I\u2019m wanting this one to be romantic. I want this to be a slow burn, taking our time with it as both our characters start to form feelings for one another. I don\u2019t want to jump straight into it as that\u2019s not fun. Bring on as much angst as you want, i'm all for that.\n\n\nCHARACTERS:\nSo as I mentioned previous, I\u2019m hoping to play two characters in this roleplay. The first is a older male character (late 40s) who meets your character at the start of the rp. This is where the father/daughter relationship comes into play. This character is through into looking after your character which he finds difficult to begin with but gradually begins to form a bond with your character. The second character is a female romantic interest to your character. She\u2019ll appear later on in the roleplay at a organic point.\n\nAs for your character, that\u2019s up to you. As long as she is a young (around 13-17 y/o) female character that has a compelling story and room for character development, I\u2019m happy. Try to go unique with it. Give them a driving, desires, ambitions, goals and secrets. A mary sue character often gets boring quick. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPARTNERS:\nI'm looking for a partner who is happy and willing to put effort into developing the story and the characters relationship/friendship with one another. I want these character to eventually care for one another over time. Someone who isn't afraid to move the story along and create plot twists, Someone who wants to build out the world and the character as much as I do. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo that should be it. Apologies for the long post, I want to get as much info down as possible. If any of this interests you, feel free to PM me at any time and i\u2019ll try and respond as soon as and we can start discussing.\n\n\nThanks for reading\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "I need you all to understand just how serious I am about roleplaying. I ain't here for fun and games, I'm here for serious roleplaying and a serious roleplay partner! Do you understand how serious I am? No, I don't think you truly do but you will! Oh, yes you will.\nI am going to demand your very best from you as you will get it from me anything less than 110 percent is a waste of time. Do you understand? Everyday you will give me your best as that's what I am demanding of you and you shall have mine.\nIf you want an after school special to play games and have fun you came to the wrong place baby!\nThis isn't the playground it's the Olympics, it's not two-pitch it's the major leagues! Only the best! Only the best.\n\nRoleplay is life! Say it with me, say it out loud to yourself so you understand! Roleplay! Is! Life! Did you say it out loud? Why don't you do it again because you need to take this serious, this isn't climbing hills it's climbing Everest. \nYou want PBJ sandwich!? No!!! That's not serious! We don't do simple and fun here! This is serious, serious! Do you understand?\nThis isn't Spiderman it's Superman.\nRoleplay is life!\n\nShall we answer a few simple questions?\n\n1.Please fill in the blank: Roleplay is ___ \n2. Pick the reaction that best fits you: \nRoleplay is: Roleplay is life, Serious all the time it can't get anymore serious, roleplay is fun, roleplay is sometimes fun, I'm here because I'm lonely.\n3. Roleplay is life: I agree couldn't agree more, I agree, I don't agree.\n\nNow, upon messaging me you shall send me a 1.5k essay on why roleplay is life to you, how serious you take it and why it's so serious. Repeating roleplay is life to fit the characters will get you ignored at once.\n\nKIDDDING\n\n\nAlright, I am kidding! I'm not that serious about roleplaying. I didn't know how else to start it so I hoped I made someone laugh. I also hope this posts makes it through and I don't get banned for it!\n\nI'm easy and laid back as far as personalities goes. I love roleplaying, it's my escape. I rather live in the moment as a character with someone than tell a story. For that reason I do like  faster paced roleplays. I might do one or two roleplays that are slow paced and more serious if I find one I like but I'm mostly looking for light and easy. I find it important to do something sort of fun and laid back as the first roleplay to get to know your partner! \nI am more than happy to do short-term roleplays or long-term roleplays. \nI do admire passion in writing, I like to know I'm not wasting my time and I'm sure you are the same way. I prefer a bit of a connection to my partner rather than feeling like a robot pumping out replies to you. If you don't want to talk outside of the rp but please let me know the roleplay is important. As much as the top of the message is a joke I dislike to think I'm the cure to boredom, just another roleplay on a long-list of them, the time waster until the major one replies.\n\nI rather find a long-term partner but I'm pretty much open to anything at this moment. I am looking for someone who has a wide arrange of tastes as far as plots, characters, situations, themes and everything else. I can be very mood oriented which means something I'll just want something light and then sometimes I'll want a deep fantasy. I don't want to be stuck doing the same type of roleplay or the same characters. \n\nI can post frequently but I mainly do so at night. I can easy write 3+pargaphs per reply but I'm not going to set a word limit, we will do what feels natural. I do request at least 5-7 lines per reply, I also will not do a slow based roleplay if its not long. \n\nAs far as roleplaying sky is the limit! Come at me with whatever and I'm sure I will like something. Romance is important, I love romance and I will want to do it every single roleplay.\n\nMy weakness is scenery detail and environment.\nStrengths is getting into a characters head and dialogue, plus R rated stuff but there is no pressure there. \n\nI think I covered all the basis? Post frequency, length, roleplay, timing, R rated, humor? I can't think of anything else so thank you for reading and send me a message! \n\n",

            "selftext": "RACCOON CITY - 1998\n\nLeon Scott Kennedy didn't know what just happened.\n\nHis jeep was running out of gas just as he was approaching the city limits. It was pretty late at night so it wasn't like he was likely to run into much traffic, but the last thing he wanted was to cause a car accident on his first day here. Doubtlessly, he'd get a mouthful from the RPD for that and, being the kind of by-the-book guy that he was, that was going to be a big no-no. So, he filled up at the station - or, at least, he tried to when he realized that no one was around. Something smelled fishy pretty much immediately. That's about the time that he noticed the blood on the ground, the abandoned cop car, and the sounds of distress inside of the store.\n\nThe next few minutes were a blur. Darkness and a flashlight. Getting locked in. Someone, some*thing* biting into the county sheriff, shooting that thing in the head, running back outside with his heart thumping right out of his chest. Then...\n\n\"Don't shoot!\"\n\n\"Get down!\"\n\nHe blasted the thing, the *zombie*, in the face. It didn't take long for him to grab the girl in red, push her towards the cop car, and take off into the night. They had to make it to the police station, find some answers. Hopefully, they would be safer there.\n\n---\n\nI love the new *Resident Evil 2* remake. I think it's just the bee's knees and I am hankering for a good old fashioned survival RP. But what I loved the *most* about *RE2* were its characters. What a huge improvement from the original and, well, basically the rest of the series, too. Especially Leon and Claire who just feel like the most realest people ever. But what I *didn't* like is how little interaction there was between the two of them, which is such a shame considering how much chemistry the pair have whenever they're together!\n\nHere's what I propose: an alternate version of *RE2* where Leon and Claire stick together, and get to develop more as characters - and, hey, maybe we can continue that Redfield bloodline at some point, eh? Share with me your thoughts, oh wonderful RPers.\n\nI do RPs over Discord so PM me if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! I\u2019m a 20 y/o Female, looking for a male or anyone that wants to do an Zombie Apocalypse Roleplay! My character is female and the starter has already been written out! Reddit is not allowing me to post the starter so this is the next best thing to do! A little about myself I am Semi -literate! I only write between 1-7 lines. Sometimes I\u2019m able to do a paragraph but nothing more. I\u2019m ok with mature content such as NSFW as long as our characters have relationships! And no rushing the relationship either I have that. But I only ask please be 18 and up. I honestly don\u2019t want to get in trouble. And please don\u2019t lie about your age either.  \n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner is simple, I just ask that you have basic grammar and punctuation. I hate text chat such as \u201chow R u doin dat\u201d or \u201cwat r u doing?! u can\u2019t be in here\u201d it\u2019s just annoying and I\u2019ll end the Rp at that moment anyone decided to reply to me like that. Now for one liners.. I\u2019m ok with it! But if I pour my heart out into a paragraph I kinda expect you to do the same. I don\u2019t wanna write out something and I get a reply like \u201cok\u201d. I\u2019ll end the Rp then and there. Also you do not need to be descriptive, although I try to be it just comes out weird. So that\u2019s not really a must for me. But that\u2019s it. \n\nNow about my starter it\u2019s pretty good I should say. It\u2019s the best I can do. It\u2019s pretty long, and it\u2019s set up to where you can immediately interact with your character as their move is the next move in the story, if you understand that. Last of all I\u2019m looking for someone who wants to do long term or short term, I\u2019m ok with both. As long as you don\u2019t ghost me.\n\n\nWell that\u2019s it for me. By the way, if you don\u2019t like that starter I have many others writing up, but not as good as I would want them to be. I really worked on the zombie apocalypse idea and I like it.  So just PM me and I\u2019ll send the starter, see if you like it, then we can get things arranged.  Ok thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hey all! I\u2019m looking for an RP where my character can play a caretaking role towards yours. For example, your character is sick and my character stays home to dote on them all day. Or your character is an orphan who ends up on my doorstep. I know this probably sounds like a strange request. But these are always my favorite parts of any roleplay I do. Action and fight scenes...eh! I prefer character interaction. And there\u2019s something very comforting and cathartic to me about caring for someone who\u2019s been hurt in a story. I\u2019m an angst junkie, what can I say. Hopefully someone out there feels similarly, except they like to take the other role.\n\nI\u2019ve kinda given up trying to find a long-term RP on this sub. Everyone says they want it, and then they ghost. So I\u2019ll let long-term things happen naturally if they will, in which case we can turn this into a larger story, but I won\u2019t get my hopes up. Anyway, there are a ton of variations on this idea I can think of. Maybe our characters are roommates, or a couple, or friends, or total strangers. Maybe your character has a physical or mental disability - I\u2019m interested in playing something out like that. I\u2019m also open to exploring subjects like depression, anxiety, and self-harm. Maybe your character is part animal, and acts like one. I\u2019m a sucker for boys or girls with cat ears. We can be in a modern setting, or fantasy, or we could play characters from any sort of fandom. As to whether I want a platonic or romantic RP, I\u2019m totally fine with either. We can discuss all that beforehand.\n\nSo yeah! Hopefully this is someone else\u2019s cup of tea and not just my own. Go ahead and PM me if you\u2019re interested, and tell me what you think and what your preferences are! I prefer roleplaying over PM or Discord. See y\u2019all around!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I'm looking for a slow burn romance where two college students who thought themselves as straight realize they have feelings for each other.\nI'd be slow. They become friends (or enemies?) and get into situations that would force them to be together, school projects, outside of school activities, all nighters, parties. These are two adult guys, so there are many options. No underage characters, please. \nI've read a few prompts here and there where one of the guys is a bit feminine. I am not against it, but one of them being too feminine is not what I'm looking for since I'm more interested in this being the first time any of them feel different from what the standard guy is. I want to explore and write about how they have to deal with those emotions. \n\nI usually write condensed paragraphs.  Not multi because, as someone nicely put it before, I like the character reacting to one action at a time rather than list out the reactions my character does with each thing, and maybe I thought you were going to do something, and you actually did something else, and is already late now. I dont want that. Also, long descriptions are nice, but not all the time. \n\nSo if you made it this far maybe you're interested in writing with me! We can rp here, discord or via chat and discuss how these guys meet, and other details. \nThanks for reading and hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Ok guys so! I know everyone loves cosplay here, but do you guys like watching roleplay sessions in action? For the past year myself and 4 others have been working on a dnd world created from scratch, on year later we have produced an issue to a comic book on Amazon, a YouTube video, and we stream every Tuesday on twitch. The content we are able to create during the streams later gets translated into scripts that we make the comic issue with and we are also working on a light novel. If anyone of you are interested in liking our Facebook, Instagram or following on twitch, comment below and I would love to give you guys a link! We currently plan on releasing numerous light novels, videos, and comics over the next couple years. If you love superhero\u2019s, and American comics with manga inspired illustration, the Cosmic Motion universe is the world for you! Please comment any questions you have, and or message if you would like examples of how the art in the comic loooks c: -SailorRin",
