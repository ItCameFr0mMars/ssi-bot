I WILL NOT write anything sexual with a minor, or involving minors.**\n\nThis is my own spin on the classical \"person summons demon\". The main difference is that the demon is actually scary, will actually do evil stuff, and will gradually corrupt the summoner. She will do this by teaching him powerful magic, preying on his emotions, getting rid of his friends and enemies, things like that \u2013 think Palpatine and Anakin, except darker.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean she wouldn't eventually develop genuine feelings for him! I just really like gothic horror and impossible romance between characters with opposite goals/morals.\n\nI actually have a whole world built around for this, complete with Heaven, Hell, angels, rules of magic and so on! I just think it's more interesting if I offer a gradual immersion instead of dumping a wall of text with the whole cosmology (but do let me know if you're curious). \n\nThe easiest way is to have the warlock be a complete novice and have no idea what he's getting into. Perhaps he's a young and impressionable fan of the black metal scene and tries an occult ritual just for kicks. Maybe his family is super religious and frowns on his \"blasphemous ways\", so he secretly pledges himself to Satan just to spite them, not expecting anything to actually happen. \n\nOrrr maybe he's a career sceptic and has a YouTube channel \"debunking\" that kind of stuff, until it actually turns out to be real for once. So there's like a hundred ways to start this off without having to do the whole world building part all at once. Unless of course you really want to! In which case, I have no objections either :')\n\n---\n\nNow, before we get into writing \u2013 \n\nI'm usually pretty detailed, unless it would bog the pace (like in a dialogue-heavy scene). Either way, you won't get one-liners from me. English is not my first language, but I think I'm mostly fluent. Still, apologies in advance for any mistakes!\n\nI prefer 3rd person perspective, but it's not a hard rule.\n\nFinally, I have a baby and a full-time job. I won't be able to respond in real time, but I will try to post often and to make it count. \n\nI hope I can expect the same :)\n\nIf for any reason you want to quit, just let me know as soon as possible. Like \"I'm quitting.\" I don't need to know more, just not to expect further responses. I won't be sad/mad/anything. I realise RP is super dependent on partner chemistry, writer's block and meatspace stuff, so if you want to stop, that's that. Au revoir, c'est la vie. ",

I have the ability to reply at least once, if not more, in a day. Another thing -- I absolutely love OOC chatter and I try to communicate regularly even if we aren't writing back and forth.\n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the plot. Dialogue is generally shorter; however, I am not against writing three to four paragraphs if the moment in the plot calls for it. I will not write with anyone who uses first person.\n\nI will write any gender in any pairing. I am comfortable with writing NSFW themes but I ask that you are eighteen or older because I don't particularly like the idea of going to jail.\n\nMy plots will always include romance because I absolutely adore it and I will never tire of writing it. However, I am particularly fond of slowburn romance as frustrating as it can become! The genres I am searching for are post-apocalypse, dystopia, slice-of-life, and others. I don't shy away from the dark and gritty themes either. Throw me all the angst and pain. I absolutely love discussing plot and characters so I don't have any particular plots in mind as of now. It's something we should create to become our own.\n\nThe only three fandoms that I currently am interested in writing about are Harry Potter, Shameless, and The 100 -- but I don't play canon characters.\n\nOne plot that I currently am itching for is a long distance relationship that we can play out from the beginning to the end!\n\nI don't know if I missed anything. Chances are I did. However, if my post intrigues you, feel free to send me a little orange envelope! Try to intrigue me, too, please, where I feel more compelled to reply.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "a Medieval-Fantasy Roleplay I\u2019ve been working on for about five years now\u2014 building the lore, and everything that comes between. Finally, I feel that I am ready to share this with someone. Personally, at last being able to Roleplay this with someone warms my heart at the thought. \n\nI am aware that this plot is VERY long, and confusing- maybe intimidating for some. (Though I Hope not!) But he assured, I will explain every last detail to you; big or small. \nI hope you do enjoy the rather expansive read, and decide to contact me. \n\nBe aware that \u2018Athena\u2019 is just a placeholder name. Your character does not have to have that name. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u201cThe wool was pulled over our optics; our vision blurred- hazy, as we fumbled through that sempiternal millennium of\nwar. \nThen, there was lurid light, something to awake us from our trance of violence.\nWe lived in serene peace for a short while\u2014 but even the most vacuous, of the world\u2019s denizens, know that peace does not last for long.\nAlas, they came. \nThe threat that we had so ignorantly dismissed for too long...\u201d\n\n- Taken from \u2018Ragnar\u00f6k\u2019 a doomsday prophecy scripture, written by Elden Kalovitch, an illustrious Alraithian philosopher. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPlot\n\nThe year is 4A: 234, and an eerie, nefarious silence crosses the known world: setting heinous anticipation in the hearts of man- their faces turning pallid, their minds plagued. For something was amiss: where there is peace, there is plotting. \n\nThe known world is ruled by the \u2018Empire\u2019 a robust force of a plethora of races, that have amalgamated under one banner; despite the abundance of wars, ideology, and religious conflicts. \nTruly, the Empire has been the only hope for the known world, and people intend for it to continue to do so. \n\nTwo hundred years ago, there was a civil crisis in the Kingdom of Skorpain: a land renowned for its hardships, gargantuan pyramids, sempiternal deserts, and the Pharaoh.\nThe North &amp; South of the Illustrious Skorpain instigated a Civil War, over who should be the next Pharaoh, after Allendrias the Worthy, died without any children.\nThe South won, and moved in to massacre everyone who would call themselves \u201cNortherners\u201d.\nThe Empire intervened, and instead casted the Northerners to the \u201cIsles of Hias\u201d.\n\nHiasia was never colonized by any race, since it was told colossal beasts prowl the land, roam the sky, and hunt within the sea. \nSo, this was practically a death sentence. \nAfter fifty years of suffering, they finally stabilized themselves in this unforgiving, foreign land, and alas, they plotted their revenge. \nThey made deals with non-Imperial nations for siege weapons, and an army, until they were ready for their vengeance. \n\nEnter the Alraithians, a intricate, venerable race of humanoids, with cat-like features, and deft reflexes; despite being the weakest of races, they are the most stealthiest, and agile- but, above all else: they are the most wealthy. \nDespite the poorer Alraithian folk having a short conflict with the Empire, they have been the most steadfast race to the Imperial cause. \nThis is what made them the prime target for the Hiasian Usurpers, when they began their mainland annex.\n\nEmperor Gallius Ionik the second, was assassinated by his own wife: Eva Ionik, by an underworld assassin organization, that Hiasia paid for.\nAll those feigned years of love for a vault of gold...\nAlas, Hiasia begins their annex on the mainland, while the Empire\u2019s in tatters. \nThey storm every Royal palace, and slaughter the sovereign, until there is no one left in their way.\nThey now claim themselves the \u201cNew Empire\u201d. \n\nAthena, the Princess of Alraith barely escapes the Alraithian royal palace with her life; with a handful of royal sworn swords. \nThe smouldering wreck of the palace sends ember dancing into thick air; an infernal fire ravages the Captial City- now, the land is but a bloodbath of flesh, and steel. \nFire rears its head through every window. \nAn Ex-Imperial Officer, Re\u2019Dian Sethren, the exiled son of a venerable foreign Lord meets her on the road, and promises to help her. \n\nSo, the two mount an escapade to hunt what they have lost; while the foreign Usurpers ravage the land, and nefarious, eldritch forces wait in the shadows, for nigh is the time of madness and disdain.\n\n\n",

I will be happy keeping timelines up to date and stories as detailed as we have developed them, to avoid repeats or paradoxes in our timelines. Message me if you want to develop this world with me and we can begin talking (most likely on discord) about our ideas.\n\nExamples of worlds we could build :\n\n\\- Medieval/Magic filled realm (like Skyrim or Game of Thrones)\n\n\\- Futuristic sci-fi, either building a more futuristic world (like Cyberpunk 2099 or Blade Runner) or developing many stories and lore throughout space (Like Star Trek or Star Wars)\n\n\\- Modern world parallel to our own, weird, wacky and wonderful things can occur (like Rick and Morty or Family Guy)\n\n\\- A mix between worlds, such as a sci-fi western (like Firefly), developing two genres into one world\n\nAbout me :\n\nI'm 16, and love to go in-depth with lore and stories. I'm English and can work with someone from America or Australia, although the progress of the world maybe shortened a little, due to the extent of the time difference between the countries.

I tend to write in large chunks, unless it is unneeded (e.g. Short dialogue or Adding small details to an already vast story line). Please message me as swiftly as possible if your interested.",

But the idea of the story intrigued me and so i would like to try out my luck here!\n\nThe year would be 1943, the outskirts of German occupied Paris. American and British Bombers fly over on their way towards Germany,constantly harassed by fighters. On the ground civilians go about their day, as the fight in the sky up ahead ends, people relax a bit more. \n\nYour charchter could be whoever you want, a French resistance fighter? A civilian or a combat nurse? Whatever you feel would fit you the best. As the main focus of the roleplay will be the interaction between our charchters and the romance that will follow, it's up to you. I would play a German Officer coming back from the eastern front. Devastated by the destruction seen and thus sent to France for a bit more calm tasks. \n\nAnother is where the officer tries to feed intelligence of the atrocities to the allies through your charchter. Torn between his heart and what he knows to be right. This right now is my favourite as it usually ends up far more intresting. \n\n\n\nI hope you like the idea, for this roleplay I would like someone who's detailed and can help push a story forward without having me drag the entire story :) \nI hope to hear from you! \n\nI am available on kik and on Discord!",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I am currently making a cyberpunk roleplay which takes place in Europe. At the moment we are looking for more roleplayers and possible admins to hopefully expand our small community :D\n\nThe year is 2689. After the First Mutagen War which began during the latter stages of the 25th century and ran until the early 26th century, mankind had lost its title as the apex predator of the world. Its been almost 50 years since then, and humanity is ready to fight back. We've already established a safe zone in the heart of the United States and have begun to enter into Europe.\n\nWe are looking for experienced roleplayers capable of producing a usual amount of at least one paragraph (3+ sentences). We include a GM and dice-based system and are open to help those not accustomed to it, so please don't think you're under qualified. We would like that those joining are mature enough to experience adult-esque subjects.\n\n\n{&gt; A detailed world\n\n{&gt; An occupation system - you decide the path your character takes\n\n{&gt; An ever-growing world set in a post-apocalyptic Europe\n\n{&gt; A huge array of weapons, armor, and items\n\n{&gt; A unique combat system\n\n{&gt; A lore website\n\n\nPlease message me with a short introduction of yourself and your discord username if you're interested in joining :)",

The plain featureless walls are empty except for a light switch and a light blue steel door in one  of them. The dim light is coming from a single round lamp at the ceiling about three meters above you. The room has no distinct smell and the sheets and blanket of the bed in wich you just woke up are as white and dull as the walls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs your brain starts to analyze the situation you come to a rather disturbing conclusion: You have no idea where you are or how you got here. Your last memories are weak and seem far away, as if a lot of time has passed since. Confused and with raising panic you look around and stop, staring at the tattoo on the back of your right hand. It reads '534' and you have never seen it before...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd with that the new plot starts :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts a mystery scifi survival and I will  not reveal much more than that. What happened to your character, why and how did you end up in that place, you will need to find that out in the play. A warning in advance: You decisions have consequences and your character can die should you make the wrong ones. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few things you might want to know:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The play is 18+ only, the world is not without dangers for mind and body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- You can make your own character (must be 18+, nothing supernatural), including the last memories you have about your life before the blackout. You last memories are from the year 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am in the CET timezone, I have no problem if you come from a different timezone but keep in mind that it might limit our interaction time window.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Platforms for the play are KIK, Reddit messages or Discord. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-There is no minimum or maximum in response length, write what you feel is necessary to meet the needs of the situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you have an amazing day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreetings",

Other DC characters are welcome as well too. Basically any DC character that has affiliations to Batman and or Gotham. I\u2019m looking to expand things further with my Batman RP group. It is OC friendly as well, and I basically have everything about the group written out in a Google document. Now, before I let people in I just make sure they are fit for their role and are literate role-players. So, feel free to respond on this post if you\u2019re interested, plz! And we\u2019ll chat further on a PM, so I can give whoever is interested, my Discord tag. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested in checking out how things look, here's a link of my document of my Batman group (**Note:** A canon character list of available characters is on there too):\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14yJtdQKpJL0KFsm5lwSDKvOdBFMagmcUu4W1CX07lJk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14yJtdQKpJL0KFsm5lwSDKvOdBFMagmcUu4W1CX07lJk/edit?usp=sharing)",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have been searching feverishly for a roleplay centered around the Walking Dead, specifically around an OC x Negan pairing. I have played Negan many times and have been wanting to try something new - such as where I get to play my OC and my partner takes on the maniacal Negan. \n\nAbout Me:\n\nI prefer to RP over Discord. I enjoy making servers for my one on one role plays and will bug you OOC with memes, playlists, plotting on the like.\n\nI am a multi para.  RPer. I am descriptive. And I have no issues with writing in first or third person. In addition, I am more than happy to take on multiple characters whenever needed. I ask that my partner is capable of the same.\n\nIf you are interested please be able to play the role of Negan brilliantly. Get to know his character and such. This will be a slow burn romance/ dysfunctional love roleplay with all of the gore and violence that TWD is known for. This means the roleplay will be NSFW.\n\nI look forward to chatting with you!",

            "selftext": "**The once mighty planet of Hyperion is dead, destroyed by the nuclear holocausts which have dwindled away to legends. The husk of the planet lives on as a shadow of its former majesty, inhabited by the last remnants of its people. They are divided into petty, tyrannical kingdoms, ruled by fear, superstition and poverty. In the wastelands strange, fearsome beasts roam and lurk, preying on the vestiges of the dead planet's population. Deep in the scorched southern deserts, rumours of a stronghold of psychic mutants filter along the caravan routes, the rumours state that they plot the conquest of the planet. \n\nFeared and loathed more than even the beasts of the wastelands are the wizards of the science cults. Men who collect the scientific artifacts of the dead civilisation which once made Hyperion its home. The legends of the nuclear holocausts say that it was the scientists who created the terrible weapons which ravaged the planet and created the living hell they now endured. The people of this dead world believe that the wizards will bring about yet another holocaust though no warlord on the face of the planet is willing to challenge the science cults. \n\nThe planet is on the brink of collapse but some retell the old legends, they say that one will come to unite the planet and lead it into a new golden age. Are these merely fairytales or are they prophecy?**\n\nHello, so I've laid out the general premise of the setting above. This is a bit different in that it's a mix of a sword and sorcery fantasy setting and a futuristic science fiction setting with some post-apocalypse thrown in for good measure. This is a completely original world, I've drawn inspiration from a number of quite different sources and brought them all together into what I hope is an interesting and unique setting. \n\nI've done a bit of work already on setting up the world, I've got a few ideas worked out. The inspirations come from various places, such as Conan the Barbarian (the books more than the films), Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series as well as general ancient history. The world is filled with city states, similar to ancient Greece, each having their own culture and practices. There are also various races of mutants, some are advanced others are more savage. The wizards of the science cults have uncovered a lot of the advanced technology of the ancient civilisation, they can't replicate it but they can use it.\n\nMy character will be one who believes he is the saviour figure for the planet, he's been convinced of this by the science cults who are using him for their own cause. The story will follow his attempt to unite the planet and the conflicts he faces along the way. I'm happy for anyone interested to come up with their own ideas of who their character is, preferably they would be someone with some measure of power (for example the princess of one of the city states). \n\nI usually write 3-5 paragraphs with more or less depending on the situation. I write in third person, past tense and would prefer you do the same. This story is going to be dark and gritty so I'm looking for someone who is willing to write adult scenes (sexual scenes, violence). I only write over **email** so that's the medium I will be using as I find Discord to be limiting when it comes to writing (it's amazing how many people miss this part). I'm also open to writing stories in an episodic format, where we write a section of the story and then have a time jump to another part or even do prequel stories etc.\n\nPM me if you're interested and we can discuss further and exchange emails.",

The two genres that I'd like to play in are:\n\nMedieval Fantasy: I've got heaps of plots and characters for this one so instead of typing them all out just message me and I can pick a character and plot that will make sense for who you want to play. I don't mind if we play in an original world that we can work together to create or if we base it off an existing fandom eg. Game of Thrones, Dragon Age, Lord of the Rings and heaps more.\n\nPost apocalyptic: whether it be zombies, plagues, disasters or nuclear war, I'd love to try out a post apocalyptic roleplay with someone, this is one I've never tried before so I'd love to give it a go. Existing fandoms with OCs or Canon characters are great eg. Fallout or Walking Dead.\n\nAlthough these are the main genres I'm looking for right now I'm up for pretty much anything so please throw me a message (Try and say something a bit more interesting than \"Hey\" or \"Roleplay?\") and we can work something out.\n",

I prefer it when people are creative and don't ask me for the plot  beforehand and instead develop the roleplay in the very moment of its  writing. Time-wise you should be available every other day (naturally,  the more frequent the better) though it's less a strict requirement than  a wish to keep the flow going.\n\n**What can  I offer?**\n\nI have about 10 years of experience with all kinds of  roleplays, in terms of language I can offer English and German.\n\n**What settings do I RP in?** \n\nI basically have three favourites:\n\n1. A historical medieval setting in which I am a female mercenary\n2. A medium-fantasy medieval setting in which I am the chief diplomat of a matriarchic empire (The Archangel)\n3. A realistic post-modern setting in which I am a police officer, optionally special forces.\n4. Naturally you can choose your own character's roles in each setting, and you can suggest your own additions or alternatives.\n\n**How would I want the RP-Style to be?**\n\nPersonally  I prefer to type emotes without any special markings and spoken text in direct quotes, spoken texts of \"NPCs\" in single-apostrophe. I dont mind  if you prefer a different style, as long as it's distinguishable.\n\nIn  terms of paragraph length I prefer rather short but descriptive sentences. When entering a new setting (a new room for example), longer  paragraphs may be appropriate but bloated 200-Words essays disrupt the  flow in my opinion.\n\nNSFW content is principially possible, for as long as it is congruent with the rest of the roleplay and appropriate.\n\nI hope I did this post right again :)\n\nI'm looking forward to your DMs,\n\nElena\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPost Scriptum: Last time the post got a lof of downvotes, but nobody cared to describe what bothered them about my post. If you're one of the downvoters this time, let me know what potential improvement I could make to it in the comments, please.",

I'm looking for a partner to play any canon character from DC, Marvel, Image, Valiant, IDW, or Dark Horse. I am capable of roleplaying the following characters: Invincible, Tempest, Red Robin, Timothy Hunter, Robin, Ninjak, Hawk, Marko, Spider-Man, Shazam, Batman Beyond, Red Hood, Casey Jones, Black Adam, Hellboy, John Constantine, Jason Blood/Etrigan, Swamp Thing, Nightwing, Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, Superboy, Bane, Deathstroke, Captain Cold, Deadshot, Atom, Mister Miracle, Kyle Rayner, Beast Boy, Ted Kord, Zachary Zatara, Jaime Reyes, and a few others. The characters listed offer a broad range for genres and scenarios. \n\nNow let's go onto the boring rules part of the post. I ask that my partner be very literate and able to write quite a bit. I absolutely love having a bunch of details. I also ask that you be open to any NSFW themes. I do enjoy not having limits to the roleplay experience since it allows me to fully involve myself in my character's role. I hope I don't sound too demanding!\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message. I look forward to exploring some comic book worlds! ",

The plane rattled and jumped like it was in a huge washing machine. She grabbed the seat handle closing her eyes tight as the stewardess kept saying everything would be fine. Jaxon was on the plane heading to Hawaii for the first vacation he's had in years. He was a hard working businessman that just didn't have time for much. He was on the phone handling business like he promised himself he wouldn't do when the plane begin to shake.

The tail end was gone and Katherine and Jaxon were sent flying from the plane still in their seats. They thankfully were low enough that the impact to the ocean wasn't hard enough to kill them. They were sinking quick as Katherine fought hard to get her seat belt undone. Part of the seat had been bent and impaled in her leg. As she struggled the piece of metal in her leg moved causing her to scream out losing oxygen quickly.

            "selftext": "Hi..... as you can see i am kinda new to roleplaying. i have been doing it for a few months with a few partners but i wasn't the best partner for them. i try to be descriptive but i am not really the best at it. my target is 1 paragraph per reply but i have found this quite difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni just want to try a simple high fantasy roleplay. i have a few prompts but i'd be happy to hear some from. you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. you are a bounty hunter hardened by combat and adventure. your travels brings you to a town on the outskirts of the 'ancient woods' a beautiful forest with a terrible curse. nobody quite knows what it is but the elf bartender in the \"thirsty lizard\" seems to know a lot more than the rest about this mysterious forest.\n\nhere you can choose between the elven bartender or the adventurer. the forrest has drawn the adventurer to the town but i om a okay if we don't go down that path and make our own world\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. (skyrim based.) you are a adventurer traveling with a khajit caravan. one day you are ambushed by members of the thieves guild. the khajit are quickly dispatched and you are on your knees unable to fight any longer. behind you you hear a feminine voice. it has some echo and sounds divine it takes you a moment to realise but you are listening to nocturnal herself. deadric patron to thieves \"Greeting mortal. your adventures have proven yourself worthy to become a member of my guild.\" the thieves stand in aw as their god is speaking to them \"Now you have one choice to make. join my guild or leave and be hunted down for the rest of your miserable live.\" the leader of the group (the other RP'er) holds his sword to your throat and says \"Well. pick wisely\" in a deep gravely voice\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmore will be added soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nas you can see i can try but my talents are limited at best. i like to RP in discord with a group chat with just us two in it and a meta direct chat where we can discuss the rp and just talk normally to keep the rp itself 'clean.' i have no requirements other then you put some effort in. i don't like responses like \"i follow your lead\" that just feels lazy to me. if you do something like that at least describe it some more like \"I follow your lead but i keep my distance. i haven't really gotten to trust you yet and don't want to get hurt\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni hope to hear from you soon :)",

            "selftext": "I want to role play so bad it hurts. If anyone else feels this way please, god, please contact me.\n\nI will warn you of some things first. As you can probably tell, I am very dramatic. This trait is very apparent in my personality and bleeds over into my writing. If you\u2019re the type of person who wants everything to be scientifically accurate I am not the person for you as I may kill a character off from a stab wound... in the arm. I can\u2019t help it, I love making my characters suffer. I am also very fluffy. I will play already established characters, but they will be fluffy, sad versions of them that just want to be loved. Another thing is I am not the best writer. You already know this having read this whole mess of a post. I will, however, do my best to build a world that we can understand and appreciate.\n\nI believe I covered all the bases there so moving on! As I stated before, I can play some already established characters. On the other hand, I have been craving a love story between Loki and one of my OC\u2019s. If you\u2019re interested in this let me know. Otherwise, here\u2019s some things I\u2019ll do. \n\n(I\u2019ll put the character first then I\u2019ll write CC. This means character of choice. It can be an OC, another established character, whatever.)\n\nLokixCC\nTonyxCC\nBrucexCC\nPeterParkerxCC\n\nIt\u2019s a short list, I know, but it\u2019s the best I can do. If you\u2019re interested in playing one of these characters, or any others, opposite my OC I\u2019d love that!!!\n\nAnyways, I\u2019ll stop rambling on and end this horrificly long post. If you are interested, dm me and I\u2019ll tell you everything you need to know from there. \n\nLove, Fiona",

I even cosplayed [Wonder Woman](https://i.imgur.com/pSSL4Hf.jpg), [Zatanna](https://i.imgur.com/8qB4LGU.jpg), and [Supergirl](https://i.imgur.com/4WGOUfB.jpg) (and more at cons). Of course I love the cartoons, the movies, and the shows I got to watch like Supergirl. \n\nI'm okay with most genres so we can discuss what story to roleplay. Personally I prefer them to play out like you would see in the actual show/episode with some structure.\n\nSo yeah, if you're female looking for someone who's been a fangirl for almost everything DC and can roleplay as multiple characters including male characters, I'm your partner, jaja!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "Hello reddit. I've been working on yet another ADULT fantasy medievalish setting, but this one has more of an accent on its unique world, magic, politics, and the nsfw part. This is a story based rp where you will have to read a bunch of lore and make a character before you join, but we did try to keep the important stuff as light as possible. The server is still fresh, and so we're pulling ideas for interesting factions and/or locations to add in. Please do not join if you are not considered an adult in your country, and please DO join if you are interested in participating in the early stages of this rp discord server!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the pitch : *Lush, a magocracy established in the eye of what the council named 'The mist'. A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense fog, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Since they float in the endless void of The Mist, most of the Magocracy's conflicts are born internally amongst guilds. Lush's government system is comprised of a council overseen by the Arcane Sovereign. While every major policy must go by the city's supreme ruler, internal affairs are usually taken care of by the area's ruling guild(s).*\n\nIf you are interested, here's the invite link: Perma link: [https://discord.gg/ugXtMYq](https://discord.gg/ugXtMYq)",

            "selftext": "## The Antium Empire\n\nAntium is a medieval fantasy roleplaying server set in a land ridden with conflict. A land forcefully taken over by a former military general has left the kingdom and it's towns in a state of disarray. Corruption and crime riddle the land both on the surface and beneath it. Even where it seems peaceful, deep within the roots of every nation corruption runs deep. Set in this world, its' to your character to pick what they wish to do. A land full of opportunity, whether to take advantage of the many in need, or to provide them with the help so desperately seek.\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What is Antium?\n\nSo, let's break down to what Antium itself really is! Antium is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is The Antium Empire. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more! \u00a0\n\n## What makes it unique?\n\nSo, what exactly makes us different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, we run off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Antium's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Antium is. This server is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What are the 'requirements'?\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to! \u00a0\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\nAntium is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community of players within the Discord. While new and small, we hope to build up a playerbase that will allow for the best experience and a large diversity among the characters. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj](https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj)",

            "selftext": "Hi there! So, I've been trying for a while to find people to RP some oc/canon stuff with me in the fandoms I'm in, with little to no luck thus far. I get it, that's not everyone's thing, but that isn't going to stop me from trying! My major interest right now is BNHA/MHA, and I would love to find someone who meets the desires I'll be listing below. Please read all points before messaging me, and I hope none of this sounds too demanding. &lt;3\n\n**ABOUT ME:**\n\n23F, married, 10+ years of writing experience both solo, 1x1, and groups. I'm looking for someone to play canon characters to my OC's, and vice versa to keep things fair. EST is my timezone, I am available pretty much all day every day from 11am to 11pm, either online fully or at least on my phone.\n\n**MY WANTS:**\n\n\\-gender doesn't matter, but I am looking for **someone to play male characters to my OC's**. I will play both male and female canon characters.\n\n\\-someone to rp any of the following characters: **Iida, Todoroki, Aizawa (for an adult oc), Tokoyami, Shinso.**\n\n\\-someone who is **willing to play multiple characters for my multiple ocs** (i will do the same for you ofc, so long as the character you want is a character i'm comfortable playing)\n\n \\-similar or the same timezone to avoid never being able to chat or do replies back and forth\n\n\\-**18+ writers only, smut not required** in the slightest but I am not comfortable writing with or talking to minors.\n\n\\-I would appreciate it if you could **provide a sample of your writing*****!*** It doesn't need to be new, something copy-and-pasted or a link to something is fine. **I will do the same**. This is just so I know we'll write well together.\n\n\\-someone who is **open to plotting, aus, angst, fluff, the works*****!*** I have very few hard limits, but I would rather discuss that in private.\n\n**MY DO-NOT-WANTS:**\n\n\\-**villain rpers**. I'm sorry but I have no interest in any of the villain characters. They are of course welcome to show up for plots. **I will not RP villains either**, as I don't think I would do any of them justice.\n\n\\-**bakugou**. I respect people's decision to like him, but I personally do not and **have no interest in writing with him or as him.**\n\n\\-**smut right off the bat**. I am open to it, but **I need time to get comfortable with you first**, and even then, it might not happen.\n\n\\-canon/canon stuff. I just don't have any ships atm.\n\n\\-only oc/oc stuff. **I am open to writing our oc's together**, but I am looking for oc/canon. **If you don't want to play a canon character, please do not message me.**\n\nI believe that's all! Please message me if you are interested, I swear I don't bite, I just don't want there to be any confusion. ***PLUS ULTRA!***",

Then, years later as adults, they meet again; but time is cruel, and who knows what they'd be to each other by then.\n\nThis can be an original setting we create ourselves, or it can be set in Skyrim or Dragon Age.\n\nMy character is a young girl called Clover. When she meets yours, she'll be eleven years old and passing through your hamlet/village/city/town. She's with a group of around ten others. They have an unsavoury look about them. But, well, as long as they're paying with real coin and make no true trouble\u2026\n\nThe adventure I'm proposing the two characters end up going on is that they find a creature in the woods. A creature they've both been taught is horribly dangerous, but they find it hurt and weakened. They end up helping it against their better judgement. The result is a secret much bigger than either of them can control, especially when said creature regains its health and begins seemingly preying on locals. Whether it is the creature or something else, I'm happy to discuss.\n\nEventually this results in a monster hunter being called in. I think the end to the childhood adventure should result in the two gaining massively different perspectives on it all. One child believes that the creature deserves to die for the people it's hurt, and regrets their naivete in nursing it back to health. The other is sympathetic to the creature, maybe believing that something's instinctual nature shouldn't be punished/believing the deaths had different causes/simply being an inconsolable child that only sees the hunter murdering something they love.\n\nMaybe, as adults, they meet again and one's a monster hunter while the other is trying to defend a creature.\n\nI'm also planning on there being rising tensions between the home of your character and Clover\u2019s people, which will eventually culminate into a big part of how she and you are wrenched apart. I can be more specific or leave it vague if you like surprises!\n\nAnyways, if this has interested you, please send me a message! I'd prefer you're literate, write 3+ paragraphs and don't mind slowish replies. I'm 17. Sorry if I've made any mistakes, writing on my phone.",

Honestly, I'd love to roleplay something really angsty with a romantic subplot! We can work on the exact premise together, I would be open to writing mostly anything.\n\nAs for the character I'd like to play: she is not an OC, but a minor character from an obscure video game whose personality and story I've mostly written myself.

            "selftext": "Hey since it's the weekend (or was, I meant to post this way earlier :P) I wanted to drop in here and do a quick ad to hopefully grab a partner for some free time roleplaying! This is going to be a lot less lengthy than my usual ads because unlike most weekends I don't really have a specific idea to advertise for so I thought I'd just list a mix of things I can do, say a little about them and my preferences, and then see if anyone wants in?\n\nSo all of these things will include F/F in some way, shape, or form because I am a total dork for it. If there is romance that is my main preference for it but if not I still enjoy playing with female characters because it reflects a lot of my taste.\n\nI can do:  \nAnime Roleplays: My favorites being magic-girl themed, battle-themed, or high fantasy themed. Some series I enjoy that are like this are Cutey Honey, Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Panty and Stocking, Precure, and many more. Canonical roleplaying is not required but all of those are good bases for an RP and contain a lot of things I'm interested in roleplaying so including similar themes and genres such as these in any thing we do would make me very happy!\n\nSuperhero Roleplays: I am mostly limited to DC canon for this. That or completely original settings. I either like taking on canons and arranging interesting new pairings and scenarios with then expanding outward or just building upon the general superhero vibe in our own preferred way.\n\nAction/Drama Roleplays: Either canon or OC based, I am quite the sucker for seeking self-indulgent thrills in any type of roleplay. This means if you have some absurd unadulterated action roleplay, intense fight or deal, suspenseful, or melodramatic scenario to throw our characters into I'll be all for it even if it's shallow. Total junkie for that sort of stuff.\n\nVideo Game Roleplays: This one is limited to series I can confidently play multiple characters from or can make OC's. This would include stuff like Overwatch, Borderlands, Megaman, Disgae, Tomb Raider, and maybe some other things I could think of.\n\nThere is plenty more I'm interested in but I want to keep it brief tonight. Pretty much everything I mentioned I don't have too mandatory of a plot type for which means I open to a lot of variations of these ideas. I am just putting some stuff out there and am curious what we might be able do with it. I am super up for discussion just keep in mind my preferences and I'm all ears! Would prefer to do this on Discord if possible. Hope to RP with some of ya!",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI'll try and keep this short. If you have any additional questions, go ahead and contact me. :)\n\n**Time Zone:**\n\nI'm in the CET timezone, and since I'd like to do rapid-fire sessions whenever possible (in addition to replying when we get around to it), someone who can work with afternoons/evenings in my timezone would be great. It's not important where you're from - it's important when you're available!\n\n**Content:**\n\nRomance and resulting NSFW scenes should be possible, but not the absolute centre of the RP.\n\nApart from that, I enjoy modern and sci-fi scenarios with some kind of a story attached to it, not just slice of life or romance. Action, thriller, horror, conspiracies - whatever floats your boat.\n\nI don't shy away from sad, creepy, horrible, heavy and gory content - but I do need some sort of humour and 'light' stuff in there, too. Would be great if we could strike a balance.\n\nI exclusively play in third person and am comfortable with anything between 1-3 paragraphs.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nInterweaving storylines and multiple characters are a must. I don't do \"mains,\" I don't do one-couple RPs. I'm trying to build a world that houses different characters who aren't just stereotypes - characters with their own strengths, weaknesses, flaws and quirks. Not all my men are testosterone-fuelled builders driving trucks - and not all my women are underwear models.\n\nI'd greatly prefer if you were okay playing different genders and orientations (bonus points if 'male' and 'female' aren't the only genders you know, but that's optional). I like exploring almost anything there is, trying out different dynamics and conflicts.\n\n**OOC interaction:**\n\nI like talking about the RP and about each other. If you're just in it for the RP, that's perfectly fine. I do want you to be honest with me, though. If you don't like something, if I made you uncomfortable, if something's the matter - please talk to me. Communication is key.\n\nIn your PM, please convince me that you actually read the post. I don't want to come off as an ass, but I won't reply to messages like: \"hi wanna play.\" A certain degree of literacy and active interest would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading this far. I'm looking forward to your message!",

Only looking for partners 18 and up as I do enjoy me some NSFW themes and scenes in my roleplays.  Semi-lit to Lit, really as long as I understand what you're saying and you're helping to move the plot forward, I'm happy.\n\nNow, onto the good stuff!  As the title says, I'm interested in doing a roleplay based off of the anime The Seven Deadly Sins!  Just started watching Season 3 and I forgot how much I love the series.  Specifically, I'm looking for a Merlin to my Escanor, as I love the dynamic between the pair of them.  I'm actually down to have it take place before the Sins were accused of staging a Coup, set during the anime itself, or even during the ten year skip.  Of course, I'm also willing to hear any ideas that you may have!\n\nThank you for your time, hopefully you have a wonderful day and I look forward to hearing from you all!",

I'm consistently available and would **prefer my partners are too, ghosting is a serious problem** ~~(though exceptions can be made in some cases if it's moreso being genuinely busy but still actually trying to get posts in)~~ and have been RPing for 12 years.  I'm here looking for action-adventure type fandom RPs with plenty of character interaction and development focus rather than JUST constant ego stroking fight scenes.  Environmental and interpersonal exploration is good too, throw some bits and pieces of slice of life into the mix and I'd say it's perfect.  I only play Female characters and I prefer that whoever approaches me plays one as well as I've had basically zero good experiences with male character players.  That is to also say if any romance occurs I prefer it be Female X Female.  I'd prefer that a partner that approaches me is 18+ in most cases and OOC gender doesn't matter as long as the character being played is Female.  I'm in the CST timezone of America and I tend to stay up all night and be asleep in the day.  Nocturnal sleep schedule and such so I work rather well with EU, Australia and other late night Americans.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs for fandoms themselves, some I am fine with both sides playing an OC or a partner playing a canon if one wishes to, though I'm honestly a bit picky in terms of OCs of some fandoms.  In a descending order will tell you which fandoms I currently have the most muse for at the moment and at the bottom are ones I usually do but would need something particularly good to really be up to put something together for.\n\n\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid ~~(I suppose if one is up for playing as a canon in that and shoehorning all sorts of stuff, sorta just something someone dragged me into trying once which applies as an option)~~\n\nSplatoon\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nLittle Witch Academia\n\nDragon Ball\n\nMaplestory 2 based stuff maybe if one is up to it.\n\nHunterxHunter\n\n\n\nThere are a few others but they're not ones I'm all too interested in playing alongside someone else's OC unfortunately so I'm leaving them out.  You're also free to suggest fandoms if they're anything like the ones listed above and if it tickles my fancy I can definitely give it a go.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Platforms**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only use Discord.\n\n\n\n**Age Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI usually prefer my partner being 18 or older given I'm 23 but in some cases I can make exceptions if I'm feeling it.\n\n\n\n**Character Preferences**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI prefer whoever I am writing with to play a Female character.  I've had zero good experiences with male ones and have just been put off from them entirely.  With that said I also only play Female characters.  I only play OCs myself but if the partner wants to they can play either a canon character or an OC, their choice as long as it's a female.  I'd also prefer the personalities of the two characters being played to typically contrast. So given I USUALLY play the more low energy types I'd prefer a partner's character to at least have a bit of a spring to their step  ~~or maybe a BIT lewd-ish but not too much and not pushing it too much before the character chemistry really takes off~~ and able to make them feel and express more than the usual stone faced exterior one way or another.  Basically if aiming for a romance I'd prefer the partner character being the one making advances and such.\n\n\n\n**Romance Junk since it was mentioned**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI only do FxF but am fine regardless of if it's OCxOC or OCxCanon.  Makes no difference to me as long as the character itself is appealing.  I prefer it being slow burn/developing over the course of a play than immediately set up before even starting.  Won't do CanonxCanon though cause I'm garbage at playing Canon characters.\n\n\n\n**Post Length Stuff**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs long as you're detailed/descriptive and got good grammar it'll fine and stuff.   I'm a rather literate person and can easily put out multiple paragraphs if given enough to work with and I'd prefer that my partner is plenty literate as well while also giving me paragraph posts.  But I am rather flexible on this depending on a situation within a scene.  Exceptions and times I'd allow shorter than a single paragraph being when a situation within a scene becomes back and forth plain chatter and so on.\n\n\n\nAnyway, if all of that works for you, feel free to leave a PM and we'll see what can be done.  Code word to show you read ALL of this is: Vaal  ~~Also send your message in a PM to my inbox, not the Reddit Messenger, that thing is garbage that occasionally eats messages and holds off on sending them for hours at a time~~",

Thank you for taking a look! \n\nSo i'll cut to the chase since the title's kinda vague; This'll be a fantasy setting where humans are predominant but hybrids do exist, however they're incredibly rare, looked down upon, often persecuted and chased away from wherever they may go. \n\nI'll be one such hybrid, part human and part dragon with traits from both. A young woman at first glance, except for the horns atop her head and the wings on her back, the tail lower down...\n\nYou on the other hand? Despite the title you don't have to be a hunter! But regardless you'd be a human who comes across me wounded and unconscious in a forest, and for one reason or another you take me somewhere safe to recover. Things will move on from there!\n\nI'd prefer 18+ people for this since i'd like to include some darker themes and potentially NSFW moments between our characters down the line, but it's not a big problem if you aren't.\n\nI prefer to play on discord, and I tend to write 1-3 paragraphs.

            "selftext": "Hi all! My name is Belle. I\u2019m 22 and I\u2019ve been roleplaying since I was about twelve or thirteen - I actually started on Neopets back in the day and floated around from site to site before finding reddit about a year ago. Sadly I\u2019ve lost most of my partners as of recently so I\u2019m on the search for more.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for at the moment is something long-term and in third person. I prefer paragraph to multi-paragraph responses. Competence with grammar is necessary. That all being said, I care more about creativity and us both loving the roleplay we\u2019re creating together though! Throw out ideas, tell me what you like and don\u2019t like. I\u2019m honestly super flexible and easy to get along with.\n\nIt should also be said that I\u2019m looking for a partner that will be okay with me not being a super fast replier. I try to reply every day, but sometimes life just doesn\u2019t work that way. Most days I will be able to reply every day though, if not multiple times a day. I\u2019m just putting this up as caution for in case that does happen.\n\nAs for genres, a lot of what I\u2019m interested in is either original ideas or fandoms. \n\n**If you\u2019re interested in fandoms know that I want us to ONLY play OC characters. These fandoms include;**\n\n* Persona 5\n\n* Boku no Hero Academia\n\n* RWBY\n\n* Miraculous Ladybug (this would be the only one I\u2019m willing to do canon with, and even then I\u2019d prefer Felix and Brigette from the original concept)\n\nFor original ideas I had a couple of concepts. If you had anything in mind as well I would love to hear your ideas as well.\n\n**Idea one**\nCliche, anime-like idea where your character gets sucked into a fantasy video game, finding out that he\u2019s the \u2018chosen one\u2019. Now he has to save this world and get back to his own world with the help of a girl who looks strangely like the one on the video game cover. (We could totally flip the characters on this as well if you\u2019d rather I play the \u2018chosen one\u2019 and you her loyal companion.)\n\n**Idea two**\nThis one isn\u2019t a super fleshed out idea but I would LOVE to do a modern Beauty and the Beast. \n\n**Idea three**\nYour character was trained to be an assassin, successfully being placed as the princess\u2019 body guard with that job. However, when the palace is under attack you end up saving her and even helping her escape. Now they\u2019re both being hunted down.\n\nIf you have any ideas you\u2019ve been itching to try honestly feel free to send me them. I\u2019ve been craving some medieval fantasy, modern fantasy, and just about any slow-building romance.\n\nHoping to hear from you all~.",

An unbelievably huge frigate plowed the ocean waved apart as it made headway through the cold ocean, powered by sails.\n\nThis ship had two magic spotlights on the nose. the two spotters using them to scan for anything peculiar, be it a threat, floating treasure, or a poor creature drifting at sea.\n\n\"Captain!\" The left spotter shouts, pointing at a floating figure in the sea. \"Drifter!\"\n\nA massive aquatic dragon anthro practically sprints out from behind the wheel, first mate taking the controls in the captains absence. The captain walked along the railing, eying the water as they pass the castaway. With little need for words or thought, he gets down to his wimming trunks, and dives into the water.\n\nThrough the rough seas, he swam to the castaway. The dragon cap'n pulled the drifter off of the barrel they clung to. The dragon used his powerful tail to jet them through the water. It was enough speed to catch up to the ship. He climbed up the side, and laid the castaway on the deck. \"Are you.. okay?\" The dragon asked, lightly patting the castaways face.The spotters were standing around and watching.\n\n(dm me with your discord tag if you'd like to be the castaway, and explore all the wonders on this ship.)",

            "selftext": "Ryan moved through the woods as quietly as he could. He was thirsty, hungry, tired, but most of all, scared almost out of his wits. He hadn't slept more than a handful of minutes since escaping the fire that engulfed his home two days ago. He tried to defend it to the best of his ability, and lost it because of that. The man who had tried to get in had been beaten away, and had thrown a gas bomb at it in retribution. Ryan just hope the fucker had died in the process.\n\nThe outbreak that had cause the dead to rise reached the tipping point three weeks earlier. There had been rumours for months, with most of it being written off as crazy, tinfoil hat nonsense. Things quickly changed, however, when the living dead started to rise in the major cities. Still, no one wanted to believe it, until it was too late.\n\nThere were stories that people in rural areas had things better under control. They were better armed, it was said, stereotypical redneck gun culture. Given what happened at home, Ryan figured the country couldn't be much worse.\n\nHe reached a clearing, and saw a cabin. \"Doesn't fuckin' look creepy at all,\" he muttered to himself. Maybe it was a hunting cabin, or a recluse lived there. No smoke came from the chimney. He could see no driveway. It seemed truly cut off. He approached it slowly, in case anyone was watching, with his arms in the air. He was in his early forties, just over six feet, and a little drawn, given the rationing he'd had to do. His beard had a few days growth, and his hair was chopped in a bad, self-given haircut. A run in with a zombie in which his hair had been snagged taught him early on that it was a detriment. He was poorly dressed, just worn sneakers, a torn t-shirt, and faded jeans. He'd have announced himself, if he weren't afraid of attracting attention from the dead.\n\nNo gunshot or shouts came as he reached the porch, and he knocked quietly on the door. He saw a padlock on it, securing it from the outside. Chances were that no one as in there. He tried a window, lifting it with some effort, and crawled in. \"Hello? Anyone in here? I'm not gonna hurt you, but I got a gun to defend myself with!\" It was true. He had a handgun tucked into the back of his belt. No bullets, but still a gun. There was still no noise, so he closed the window, and went to find the kitchen, hoping for some supplies.\n\n((Hello there. I'm looking for a partner to help explore a new, dead world with. It's NSFW due to the violence and gore the characters will discover and experience, and who doesn't enjoy a good sex scene to blow off some steam with? Because of that, I need you to be over 18. I don't have many limits, but my two main ones are that I don't like people writing my character's actions and words for me. I can write for myself. Also, I'm not a fan of giant, bimbo-esque body parts. I write in the third-person, past tense style. I don't mind if you write first- and present, though. I also write 1-3 paragraphs per post. I'd like the same. Any more than that, and one player isn't able to give their input so well. If you're a male on your side of the screen, but play female, that's alright with me. \nIf you're interested, hit me up.))",

            "selftext": "I'd like to talk to people more over Discord, so I'll keep it short and simple! I'm really just a fan of realistic stuff. I can do modern or medieval, but no sci-fi, no end of the world, no futuristic, no dragons and mermaids and ogres. I like romance, as the title says, lots of drama, maybe some action? or adventure? Depends on the roleplay! I am open to playing all kinds of characters! (But no FxF) I can play male, female, gay, straight... You name it. There is going to be some stuff I won't do, but just ask and I'll let you know! \n\n\n\n\n\nI like to write as much as I can, but it doesn't always have to be something ten posts long. Haha. NO TEXT TALK. If you can put effort into writing a long, detailed response for a roleplay, you can afford to spell words out when chatting. I'm fine with things like... (Lol, LMAO, OMG...) but I will have little patience for people who say (R, ur, u, y, k... So on and so forth) Hope to talk to you soon! (And please leave your Discord tag in your message! It'll make it easy on me. XD) I'm in eastern time! If that matters. It's just past 11pm for me, so I won't be awake much longer, but I will send out friend requests and all when I wake up!\n\n\n\n\n\nI've had these two ideas that I've either planned with someone and then it ended because of a lack of responding/lack of detail/lack of effort, or that I've done a few times, but I would like to do again and see where it leads. I don't mind playing Muse A or B in either, but I'd like to have a mix of both rather than having to play the same character in each idea too many times. (When you message me, please let me know if you liked either idea, and which Muse you would prefer to play, or if you don't have a preference.) Keep in mind, we don't have to do either of these! I am completely open to planning something together.\n\n\n\n\n\nIDEA 1) Mafia Boss x Someone not affiliated with the Mafia (Modern day)\n\n\n\n\n\nMuse A is a mafia boss (or member of high status in the mafia), looking for some time away from the work and just to relax. They are by themselves at a bar drinking when they notice Muse B (or muse B notices them). The two of them get talking and things spark. Muse A knows that they can't take anything past a one night stand, but they are still looking to relax and the two of them head to a hotel/motel to get a room for the night. (Before or after they have started/finished with a bit of smexy fun time), An Assassin breaks into the room, trying to make an attempt on Muse A's life. Muse A takes out the assassin, being injured in the process, but Muse B is now a witness to the assassination attempt, and to Muse A killing that assassin. No matter what, Muse A cannot let Muse B leave and return to their old life. Muse A must take Muse B with them when they leave. (It can go in so many directions from there! I am open to suggestions/edits people may have in mind!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDEA 2) King x A Servant (Medieval, or modern with a a medieval idea behind it)\n\n\n\n\n\nMuse A is a servant to a Lord that owns quite a bit of land and power. (How they came to work for them is to be discussed) However, the Lord treats Muse A very poorly. Both physically and mentally hurting them whether it's degrading words, beatings, or giving them little food to eat. After working for them for a time, the Lord receives an unexpected visit from Muse B, the King ruling over the area as a whole. Though the Lord may or may not try to hide their behavior toward Muse A, the King soon comes to realize how they are being treated. They remove the Lord from power, and should Muse A wish, takes them back to the capital, and to live in the castle to work for Muse B instead, obviously being treated in a far different manner from what they were used to with the old Lord. (Again, this is open to where it may lead, and I'd love to hear any and all ideas!)",

I have about 1 or 2 good roleplays at any point, but I\u2019d really appreciate having a few more so I don\u2019t get too bored.\n\nIn terms of what I roleplay, I really enjoy fantasy elements in the roleplay and this usually takes the form of medieval fantasy. But I also enjoy roleplays like sci-fi, western, or anything else really. Although I enjoy fantasy elements I\u2019m really ok for any kind of roleplay as long as it\u2019s fun!\n\nI roleplay in the third person and tend to type quite a bit. Depending on the roleplay, the partner, and the scene it can differ quite a bit, but generally I enjoy having environmental and emotional detail put into every post. I find it hard to stay interested in a roleplay where I\u2019m doing double the work, so sorry to those people!\n\nAgain I\u2019m ok with NSFW themes, but it has to make sense and involve the right character. Like if I make a sultry, bombastic character then it makes sense to have more NSFW posts and themes.

Fire, ground , water, wind and void. \n\nOriginally there was only fire, ground, water, and wind but after a scientific breakthrough the people on the home planet of Thyra took to the heavens. The families quickly colonized their own planets. Fire and wind had an alliance, as did ground and water. They had arranged marriages as peace offerings.\n\nFire is military focused.\nGround is nature focused. \nWater is exploration focused. \nWind is economically focused.\nVoid looks to colonize everything and assimilate everyone else into void.\n\nWhen the houses took to the stars they came across some strange beacons. Once they activated them these strange portals opened. They seemed to go to another dimension that was dark and looked like hell without all the fire and brimstone. Unlikely alliances were created and all the houses banded together during the first Void War.\n\nThey repelled the void thanks to a genius general from Fire named Brigharm. He found a way to use the beacons to send the void back to where they came from. Sadly he died a few hundred years ago and the void have since come back. \n\nThis time however, the houses believe they are strong enough to not ally. There are people who think they should but it\u2019s a huge political debate right now.\n\nThe houses have hated each other since the beginning of time and would now, since they have become extremists, rather see everyone dead than Another alliance. \n\n\nWe will be playing princes and princesses, kings and queens. We can have intense debates and combat against the void. I can also draw and send art to show you what our characters look like and what different things look like. There will be combat, romance, smut, action and drama. I hope you join me for this RP. ",

We can discuss the roleplay more in chat, but I'm excited to try it! My friend tried to introduce me to it blind, by simply offering a prompt and not telling me anything about what was going on, but I just started watching the anime, and am pretty excited to see what we could do!\n\nHaving just finished watching the first season I'm excited to try and hop in and do something!\n\nAs for our characters, I'm certainly hoping to develop our own. A bit of talking and discussion on both the Reg and Riko equivalents. We wouldn't be making them carbon copies, by any means. I'm hoping to develop a pair of characters and a world around them, inside the one already developed, of course. I'm also looking for someone to hopefully able to play multiple characters, I can do so too!\n\nI'm also looking for someone fairly literate, who can guide scenes as well as lead when the need arises. I don't want to GM the whole time. My posting length is fairly alright, and usually ranges between 2-3 paragraphs, if my partner keeps that up (It's hard to write a lot when you aren't given much, ya dig?).  \nI hope that my small rambling, and tad overeagerness aren't enough to dissuade you from chatting with me. I hope to write something good with you!\n\nI hope to hear from you soon!",

When he turned to look around, for the first time since he started wandering through the endless forest. What he saw was extremely peculiar.. it was a red dragon. It had been hurt, most likely fallen down from a hill. He walked over to it, sweat dropping from his body. His heart was racing. His vision was fuzzy...\n\nHe walked up to the dragon, and it roared with anger, and to protect itself. It started to walk towards Kito, fire coming out of its nostrils, and then it stopped. Kito had his hand on its head. The dragon had completely calmed down, as it laid down, he looked at its paw (or foot idk) and through the extremely small amount of knowledge he had about healing, he still managed to help the dragon. The dragon allowed him to sit on it's back, and it walked over to its cave. The dragon was alone, which was unusual for the dragons in this world. It laid down in the cave, and started speaking like a human.\n\n\n**10 years later**\n\n\nThe dragon had taught Kito the way of the fire dragons. Fire dragons are the most rare types of dragons. Kito had learned the Fire dragon magic. This magic was powerful enough to kill a dragon, but the dragon that taught him everything had gotten sick, and eventually died. When a few other dragons, a rock dragon, a water dragon and a wind dragon strolled by, they looked at Kito, crying beside the corpse of the dead fire dragon. The other dragons ran towards their pack, and declared Kito the first dragon slayer, but he was not the last...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[everyone will have a different element. OCS can be discussed in the group chat, and this is set in the medieval times]",

The year is [REDACTED]. Citadel was originally built to be a safe haven for those who live in poverty and those who struggled to get by in normal society, but when funding transferred elsewhere, the city became a place for two more sinister purposes. The first being to confine those who don't fit into the more civilised areas. The second is to be a government test site for new... Projects...  There is no law enforcement here. It is a place where if someone wrongs you, you burn their goddamn house down and kill their dog. This is a place for the liars, the cheaters and the clinically insane, because everyone knows the old phrase 'Out of sight, Out of mind'. The City is split up into three sectors, Each has different locations and exciting individuals to meet and probably end up being stabbed by. Welcome to Citadel and remember Don't feed the animals\"\nAnyways, If that sounds at all interesting to you, I'll drop a discord invite in here to skip the hassle and let you get straight in, I'll see out there.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/NXUT7Qs",

            "selftext": " Hey there, folks! I've been replaying the saddest yee-haw simulator, and I've been itching to get into the saddle with this world in a roleplay! I'm a 22 year old man on the East Coast of the United States, so an EST timezone, and I write in multi-para to novella fashion, as you'll see in my writing sample below. I'd like to explore the fall of Dutch's gang from outside of the inner circle, so to speak. My OC, who you'll meet shortly, can be paired with another OC in the gang or any of the women, though I have a strong preference for Sadie, Molly, or Mary-Beth. We'll be going through the events of the game, yes, but this is to provide us with a plot skeleton so we can branch off and do our own side stories while always knowing where to go next if we are at a loss for a moment. It goes without saying that this is an 18+ only roleplay with the chance for heavy NSFW ranging from violence to smut and so on, but I do love a good ship.  \n\n\nAlso, I am pumped for the release of Metro: Exodus and would love to do a Metro roleplay with OCs or any other character you might want to play! It's such a rich and beautiful world that I want to explore it so, so badly. \n\nSo, without further ado, let me post the writing sample/starter I have!\n\n***Chapter 1: Colter***\n\n\u201cWe are forlorn like children, and experienced like old men, we are crude and sorrowful and superficial\u2014I believe we are lost.\u201d  \n\u2015 Erich Maria Remarque, *All Quiet on the Western Front*\n\nThe wind clawed at the old grey cabin like a mountain lion on the flanks of an old, tired deer. No blood came from those venerable boards, only the groans of the squat building, the scent of hay long forgotten accompanied by the smell of a dozen or so cold bodies, men and women and a child, all huddled around one man whose stomach was red, far more red than the other pale flesh of his poor body.\n\nThe dying man was twenty years old, with a mop of red hair that drooped out from under the beaten down soldier's cap he often wore and waved around during the fireside dances and music that he so deeply loved in life. The voice that had once shouted and sang and hollered was now a threadbare whisper, his body both sweating with the exertion of remaining alive despite the shivering that made him tremble like a glass on a busy railroad track.\n\nThey had laid him on a knife-scarred wooden table and placed a blanket over him, which was not pulled down to just at his waist, while an older version of him laid a hand on the belly full of buckshot. This older self was more lupine, with a strong nose and jaw, though the second was decorated with a beard with all the red and orange and gold that his brother's hair was, and that his own hair was, though his was pulled back in a mane like a lion.\n\nTheir amber eyes met, and words passed from one brother to another, two decades worth of knowing passed in an instant, and the dying man spoke up, using the last of his strength.\n\n\"Take me outside, Ulysses. I don't wanna die indoors.\"\n\nA murmur of something ran through the group, but the man named Ulysses only sighed and stood up. He wore a heavy and black woolen overcoat over a black and red flannel, which had been tucked into a pair of dark trousers laid over black square-toed riding boots. The hint of a gun belt could be seen by the big brass buckle in the front, and he donned his hat, the light brown leather having been pinched into a forward corner while the hat's leather band was decorated with the biggest canines of a wolf on one side and a bear's crooked claws on the other, along with a coin in the dead center of the front bearing a buffalo on it.\n\n\"I'm gon' take him out.\" Ulysses said, in a voice like rolling thunder in the far distance, blessed with the old rhythms of Appalachia, a dialect not often heard outside of those mountains. \"Y'all stay in here. Don't wanna see nobody get sick.\"\n\nHe didn't bother dressing his brother, nor did his brother want to be dressed. Ulysses took the blanket off of his brother, and he scooped him up into his strong arms like a husband carrying a bride. The difference between them struck true. Ulysses was tall and broad at the shoulders, and his beard and burning eyes and dark clothes made him all the more intimidating. His brother had shrank in from the mortal wound dealt to him and the cold, becoming small and pale and closer and closer to a ghost in the days since Blackwater.\n\nThe two brothers left silently, into the howling blizzard, into which Ulysses ducked his head and against which his brother didn't even respond. He carried him up into the trees a dozen odd feet away, and then to the iced over stream, the snow coming up to his mid-thigh until he touched the bank. He sat his brother down at it, letting him look at the water. Ulysses then leaned down and pressed a kiss into his brother's hair, feeling it the one last time.\n\n\"I love you, Peter.\" he said into the hair, and Peter brought up one weak hand to touch his brother's face one last time before he let it fall back into his lap.\n\n\"I love you too, Ulysses.\"\n\nUlysses squeezed his brother's shoulder one last time and stepped back, his hand moving to the oak grip of his revolver, but something in his brother broke, and he fell back, his eyes rolling up into his head, a rattling breath leaving him. His body convulsed once, twice, tightening and then relaxing, tighten, relax, tighten, relax, and the glossy eyes rolled back around, amber looking into the void of the sky.\n\nUlysses watched the body until it relaxed the final time, and he stood there, tightening and loosening his fists, his face doing much of the same, as the silent tears left him, making his nostrils flare, his chin waver, and he rocked in place, trying to force it all back down, to take it later. He took in a deep breath and counted.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nHe exhaled and counted.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nHis brother was gone, but his family needed to eat, and he was one of the few who could hunt well. He could hunt best. He had to hunt better. He closed his coat and ducked his hands back into his thick wool-filled leather gloves, pulling up the black scarf around his neck until it covered his mouth and nose. He went back to the hall, pushing open the doors to concerned looks, soft apologies, and shock. He went to the wagon holding his things and pulled out his leather quiver and his recurve bow, bands of red at the top of the limbs marking it, to the learned eye, as being Cherokee in make. He held it by his side.\n\n\"Folks, we need food an' a fire. Who wants to go hunt with me?",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, thanks for checking out the post. I've got a few different settings that I've been craving which I'll detail below. Firstly though, I figure I should mention that I'm only looking for people who are 18 or older due to the fact that I would like to explore the NSFW aspects of a budding relationship. That being said, I very much want there to be a proper story involved too. In addition to that prerequisite, please be at least semi-literate. Timezone doesn't matter.\n\nAnyway with that out of the way, feel free to check out the settings I had in mind.\n\n\n**Sci-fi**\n\nPacific Rim AU - Pretty much what it says, though involving young cadets (17-21) in training to pilot the mechs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIntergalactic War - Basically a romance between freshly enlisted pilots (still young adult, 18-22ish) during a giant war raging in the background.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Fantasy**\n\nQuest - Two young men, one from either side of a raging conflict (perhaps different races too), are forced together in order to save their people from a worse enemy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPrince and the Thief - Pretty much what it sounds like. Thief breaks into the palace, Thief catches him, all the good things in life ensue. There could be political intrigue in this one too, whatever we think fits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nModern Fantasy - Basically think fantasy races and magic but in the modern world. Perhaps two men from different races that are normally racist to each other end up forced together in the middle of a gang war in some sprawling metropolis. We can figure this one out together tbh.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ending Note:** Anyway those are just some of the ideas I had. Id be happy to explore your ideas too, especially any involving a post apocalyptic setting. Just a one thing first: I love world building, so please be willing to work with me on crafting this world for the both of us to RP in.\n\nIf that sounds good to you, drop me a message here on reddit introducing yourself and I'll be happy to give you my discord so we can work things out!\n\nCheers!\n",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

And rightly so.\n\nUnfortunately, not everything makes it past the threshold of good. \n\nFor example; I watched Suicide Squad the other day. It's not a masterpiece of cinema by any standards. I have a pretty soft opinion on most comic book movies and even by my standards it's not great. \n\nBut there are glimmers of a good movie inside. Mainly because of the characters involved. One character that has always interested me and couldn't have been handled more incorrectly by the writers and actress happens to be Enchantress. \n\nSuper interesting concept, super interesting design, really flat performance and role in the film. \n\nI want to delve into a character study. Dual identities and chaos versus order interest me a great deal. \n\nObviously she's not a very popular character, and she's not the only person I'd be looking to play around with. We can delve in to specifics more one on one. The villains are always the best part of the story, and I've got plenty baddies mastered. \n\nBut I'm very inspired right now to do a proper rendition of Suicide Squad so I guess I'm just looking for someone who's also invested in potential enough to do it with. We'll have fun along the way, I guarantee it. \n\nIf your fancy is tickled by anything I've said here, feel free to message me! ",

But the idea of the story intrigued me and so i would like to try out my luck here!\n\nThe year would be 1943, the outskirts of German occupied Paris. American and British Bombers fly over on their way towards Germany,constantly harassed by fighters. On the ground civilians go about their day, as the fight in the sky up ahead ends, people relax a bit more. \n\nYour charchter could be whoever you want, a French resistance fighter? A civilian or a combat nurse? Whatever you feel would fit you the best. As the main focus of the roleplay will be the interaction between our charchters and the romance that will follow, it's up to you. I would play a German Officer coming back from the eastern front. Devastated by the destruction seen and thus sent to France for a bit more calm tasks. \n\nAnother is where the officer tries to feed intelligence of the atrocities to the allies through your charchter. Torn between his heart and what he knows to be right. \n\nI hope you like the idea, for this roleplay I would like someone who's detailed and can help push a story forward without having me drag the entire story :) \nI hope to hear from you! \n\nI am available on kik and on Discord!",

As for smut, I enjoy it when it helps the story along etc. I don't mind doing FTB if you prefer this! (I also don't mind trying something other than Fantasy or SciFi, let me know any suggestions you have)\n\nI usually write a few paragraphs or on occasion a thousand or so words. It all depends on what is happening really.\n\nI've been looking for a while now but sadly have been ghosted or had no replies. So I am making another post to try again. A little about me. I am 21 and from Scotland, so my timezone is GMT. I am at college full time, but apart from that, I am free to reply quite a lot of the day. I also stay up late so I am fine roleplaying with any American timezones. I would also like to get to know my roleplay partner a little, but this isn't essential if you don't want to.\n\nFeel free to comment or drop me a message and I'll reply as quickly as I can.

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit!\n\nI hope I'm not the only one that would like to try a roleplay that focuses far more on the story than the smut side of things.\n\nBefore the roleplay starts I have to say I very heavily disagree with this charchters I'd play and it does not represent me or my views. But the idea of the story intrigued me and so i would like to try out my luck here!\n\nThe year would be 1943, the outskirts of German occupied Paris. American and British Bombers fly over on their way towards Germany,constantly harassed by fighters. On the ground civilians go about their day, as the fight in the sky up ahead ends, people relax a bit more. \n\nYour charchter could be whoever you want, a French resistance fighter? A civilian or a combat nurse? Whatever you feel would fit you the best. As the main focus of the roleplay will be the interaction between our charchters and the romance that will follow, it's up to you. I would play a German Officer coming back from the eastern front. Devastated by the destruction seen and thus sent to France for a bit more calm tasks. \n\nAnother is where the officer tries to feed intelligence of the atrocities to the allies through your charchter. Torn between his heart and what he knows to be right. This right now is my favourite as it usually ends up far more intresting.\n\nI hope you like the idea, for this roleplay I would like someone who's detailed and can help push a story forward without having me drag the entire story :) \nI hope to hear from you! \n\nI am available on kik and on Discord!",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019ve got two ideas. Ok so the first one takes place on the planet of Xerian, very similar to Earth. \nDrake Greens-Orphaned boy brought by the leader of Xerian and now forced to create his own military team\nAlex-A nice, patient dude who joins the team\nJackson-A smart, sort of blunt guy who joins the team\nEthan-An aggressive guy who really only joined to get away from his parents\nThey have more dimensions than that, they\u2019ve all got flaws and fears the whole nine yards. If you\u2019ve got an OC you think would be good to join the team that\u2019s be awesome. There\u2019s also a thing about Xerian, everyone gets one power, except Drake and that\u2019s why everyone\u2019s scared of him cause no one knows how he got the other two\nThe second idea is this:\nSebastian Goff\u2019s is a boy who got taken by three aliens that take on humans that killed their previous bodies. But no one killed their humans so they went to their only relative who wasn\u2019t a law enforcer. You can put an OC in here however you best see fit but he basically becomes a masked vigilante. PM me if you\u2019re interested!",

            "selftext": " \n\nI started my RP journey on WoW of all places when I was about 15, so it's fair to say I've been doing this a while (in my 20s now). I'm by no means a pro and I've only ever done long paragraphs/text only RP with one other person but it was almost constant over the years, until about a year ago. I don't feel very confident doing a 1 on 1 RP session with a new person so I'm looking for a group situation where I'll feel more comfortable, and if I end up clicking with someone I could be more open to the 1 on 1 stuff.\n\nI'm open to pretty much any setting, I can adapt and am flexable in this regard - though I only play female characters. However I suppose playing a guy would be a new challenge so I'm not totally opposed to that either. I'm mostly a goody goody in real life so I prefer playing a somewhat neutrally evil character, but who is very open to character development. I played a \"lawful neutral\" character for a majority of my time roleplaying, and only the last time I RP'd did I write someone quite evil, yet I felt it was my best character and story yet. Naturally if any chemistry happens between my character and another, it'll be pretty problematic. My characters don't usually have experience with healthy relationships of any kind so they can react in all kinds of unhealthy ways! Therefore I think the only types of groups I'd join would be 18+ as violence and *very* bad behaviours would be afoot. I have experience in pretty much only writing third person but if it's required I can do my best to change it.\n\nIf anyone who reads this is a member of such a group and thinks I would be a welcome addition, I'd love a DM. If you have any questions etc feel free to ask. I have a story I worked on (and am hoping to work on again some point this year) on Archive of Our Own if you need a sample of something - but it does get NSFW in later chapters so just a warning there, not that I expect anyone to read that much if they do ask for it. Like I said, I'm by no means a professional, but I really do enjoy it and all the crazy plot twists creative minds can think of when they get together. I'd love to get back into it and branch out.",

I\u2019d like to get right to it, and then if you have questions I can answer over DM.\n\nSo what I\u2019m looking for is someone who will play monster girls similar to some anime renditions along side a human male. \nI have a few scenarios in mind we could discuss depending on the kind of monster(s) you\u2019re interested in playing as, or we could come up with something totally from scratch.\n\nAs far as themes go, this can include anything you\u2019re interested in. I don\u2019t have limits on how dark or gory it gets, so if you have deep dark desires then bows the time to release them. Similarly, if you\u2019d rather it be light hearted and cute, I will enjoy it just the same.\n\nPlease also let me know if you\u2019re okay with Smut in the roleplay when you message me, I don\u2019t want to assume either way, and while I do enjoy it, I don\u2019t mind roleplaying without it either, so not a deal breaker. \n\nI prefer to use Discord, but if you want to use something else then let me know and I\u2019ll see if it\u2019s convenient enough to suit me.\n\nThanks for reading and considering!

I'll keep it brief here because I'll no doubt reveal more when we RP!\n\n**So that means EU timezones?**\n\nIdeally yes. I'm happy to work with others but it's about how much our times cross and allow us to roleplay. Generally speaking i'm free most of the time, especially on weekends.\n\n**Enough faff, what about the roleplay?**\n\nSo what I want is long running story. I want something that is two people doing things. Are they heroes on an adventure? Criminals escaping the law? Explorers establishing a planetary colony? Soldiers in the Roman Army? Any of the above!\n\n*That's a bit vague*, I hear you saying. And you're right! I want our RP to be collaborative. I want it to be a long term combined story. Any good writer will tell you that the best stories focus on development. That's usually character development, and should be in this case. The RP should be about our characters and how they evolve together.\n\n**Okay that's still too vague, settings?**\n\nAny really. I'll list some favourites below;\n\n* Star Trek/Star Wars\n* Modern\n* Historical\n* Futuristic\n* Lovecraftian\n* Lots of game ones! Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, Fallout\n* My own homemade fantasy world used in my D&amp;D sessions and novel writing. Does that sound exciting? It bloody well should! ^^It ^^isn't.\n\n**You actually any good at RP? Can you spell proper n stuff?**\n\nI like to think so! Been RPing for close to 2 decades in some form of another at this point. I write novels for fun with a view to publish as a career, so I can write. I can weave a web of a world for us to crawl across, or you can take me for a ride in your ideas.\n\n**So... do I fit the bill? What do you want?**\n\nI want someone who is good at heart and is reasonable with English. If you are European, and your English is passable, that's 10/10 in my book. We'll practise it together! I have a preference for the female persuasion, because for me RP is escapism but I'm honestly happy either way.\n\n**What about dirty stuff? Violence? Swear words?**\n\nYeah to all the above. I'm pretty open. I want my character to evolve with yours. \n\n**So how do I get in touch?**\n\nPoke me here or in private and I'll give you my discord and we'll go from there.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you all!",

I'm also only interested in someone willing/able to roleplay via email, and prefer someone who uses hangouts so we can chat OOC between posts. I average 1-2 posts a day if we're not on the same schedule. If we're both around at the same time I can manage far more than that. My average post ranges from 3 detailed, lengthy paragraphs to a thousand or more words, depending entirely on my partner and the scene in question. I only write 3rd person, past tense and you must do the same. Your grammar must be decent. I don't mind the occasional typo, but if I read through a post and don't understand what you're saying at all, I'm probably not going to be interested in writing with you. \n\nAll that out of the way, I promise I'm not super picky and most want to find a partner I can connect with both as another writer and as someone I can share creative endeavors with. Bonus points if you're someone I can talk books, shows, video games, movies, etc with!\n\nNow for the fun stuff...\n\nI recently finished reading the All Souls Trilogy (the books the BBC show A Discovery of Witches is based on), and it's left me really craving a contemporary fantasy/supernatural story. It does not have to be set in that world, but I would like to borrow some aspects of the lore from those books (mostly the approach to species and magic). I'd love to tell a story about an unlikely couple having to deal with the fallout of two mismatched people falling for each other while also figuring out how to be a couple just between the two of them. \n\nBig bonuses if you play your character as the more type-A and aggressive personality type.

Or is it just a sort of \u201cdeath energy\u201d similar to that of the Amethyst Winds of Death from the Warhammer universe? \n\n I understand that necrotic energy acts as a sort artificial energy to replace the energy of the soul which is absent in a dead individual/creature, which is how it all  works. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering would being exposed to it cause you to rot away, and be pushed closer to death? Or would it simply dear away at your soul, as it seems to be an energy which is the antithesis of the energy of the soul- the energy of life? \n\n",

            "selftext": "So once again I'm reaching out to find a roleplay partner for a specific roleplay. Specifically a rare-pair in the world of Kingdom Hearts: Axel x Xion. I would be playing the part of Xion, but if you think you've got what it takes - you'll be playing Axel, got it memorized? ;) \n\nTo make it simple, I only roleplay on Discord. No other mediums. So right off the bat, if you don't use Discord we won't be compatible. I will also be asking for a writing sample. both to see how good your writing is (I'm picky about my partners), and to see how well you play this character. I'd vastly prefer someone who has played the Kingdom Hearts series, particularly including the recently released Kingdom Hearts 3.  \n\nAs far as writing goes, I roleplay mainly in third-person, paragraph style. So I expect my partner to do the same as well as have a good grasp of grammar and the like. I'm no grammar Nazi, but I don't want to see a ton of misspellings and/or chat speak in my roleplay, please and thank you. Keep that to OOC. \n\nIf we turn out to be compatible RP partners, expect a lot of OOC chat, fangirling, picture sharing - basically a new friend! I love to make new friends out of my RP partners :) I'm also fairly active throughout the day, excluding my work hours, so I can reply pretty frequently too when I have the chance, multiple posts a day if I'm really in an RP mood! I'd love a partner who can do the same in return, but I totally understand that life often comes first. \n\nSo, if you think you've got what it takes - send me a message with your Discord handle and I'll add you there to discuss more!   \n",

The plot I had in mind was of an Andalite team getting stranded on an alien world, with their leader wounded, and his young second in command trying to lead the survivors to a safe place to call for help. All the time, they have to evade Yeerk forces searching for them. \n\nIn terms of style, I normally write in third person, and while I don\u2019t expect everyone to do the same, I find it easier to use. I\u2019m not a stickler for grammar, as long as I\u2019m able to follow your posts, with like like proper punctuation, sentence structure, etc. As for romance, I\u2019m open to one evolving naturally in the story, but smut would have to be discussed, as I do have limits.\n\nAs for frequency, I don\u2019t expect that your devices are part of you and always on, people (myself included) have lives and commitments, and that\u2019s perfectly understandable. I think at least a few posts a week, if possible, would be acceptable, barring life interfering. I can use either Kik or Discord, although I prefer Discord.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you\u2019re interested, and we can talk ideas.",

            "selftext": "Chris sat at his kitchen counter eating away at his breakfast, picking at it and reading the news on a tablet, he didn't know why but when he hit obituaries and saw a few names he knew he felt his stomach drop into his stomach. He saw the names of his best friends, he remembered the last time he could remember them being together. Riding in his truck, playing music and being crazy...and now they both were dead. He saw that they were victims of drug overdoses and he never knew for a second that they were using. Throwing on clothes as fast as he could he rushed from his home to see the families of his friends, they didn't like him on account that he was a nondesirable but he didn't care. He had to know why, he had to know when...he had to ask questions that he didn't know to ask.\nAfter being screamed at and beaten up by families of his friends he stumbled himself home; where he waited for the funeral, a funeral which he waited for everyone else to leave before he paid his respectable and cried all the tears he had left. Months went by where he began to fall off the rails of his life, he lost his home, he lost his dog, he lost everything. Now living under a bridge on a busy highway, he went Day to day going through trash bins for food, money and loose change. He panhandled for change on the highway but rarely ever gotten anything. Six months, six months he did this, six months of dead depression and agonizing emotional anguish. He prepared to take his own life when he heard a woman's voice call out to him as he was lookong over a very tall bridge and hard landing that would greet him when he jumped.\nThe woman was just a stranger to him, someone who wanted to believe there was something good in everyone and everything in the world, at the moment he did t see it...but days turned to weeks...weeks turned into months...months turned into a year. She helped him through the hell he lived and showed him love...and now he wanted to show her how much she truly means to him.\n\nSo if you read this far and you are interested my user is \nMaxy_Waxy418 )\n\nI'm aware of my profile picture, I don't like to use my real face.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'll keep this short and sweet. I'm looking for a partner tor roleplay over email, and OOC talking would also happen through this venue. The plot I'm looking for is simple: Character A (yours) is a famous actor, and never had a hard time getting the girls he wants. Character B (mine) is just your regular girl next door (she can either work for him or know him casually from some place other than his work). When A falls for B, he believes she'll be just as easy as every other girl. But he's sorely mistaken, as she's not going to make this easy on him at all, mostly because she really likes her life and doesn't want a famous boyfriend.\n\nI write in 3rd person past tense, and like at least a couple paragraphs. I can reply daily or every other day, save any problem like me being sick, and I'd like a partner who can reply at least once a week.\n\nHit me up through a PM if interested! Thanks for reading!",
