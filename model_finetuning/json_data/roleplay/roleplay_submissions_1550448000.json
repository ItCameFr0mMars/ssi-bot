            "selftext": "So I had this fairly important plottage going on with one of our group members and they seemed to be into it at first. Gradually their answers got shorter and shorter and I could tell that they were losing interest in the plot. They never gave me any suggestions of their own, which annoyed me because this was supposed to be an important plot for both of the characters involved. \n\nThen they suddenly hit me with \"Okay, let me get back to you in an hour or so\" aaaand they never did. They are constantly online, talking in the group chat normally (although I did notice that they kind of ignore every single comment I make). This whole ordeal happened a few days ago. \n\nI'm okay if the plot no longer interests them, but why not just say so? Should I ask them again about it? I don't want to appear that I'm nagging for plots or that I'm desperate, I'm just bummed that they felt that they could not be open with me. \n\nWhen it comes to roleplay, ghosting seems to be incredibly common. Why can't we just be honest with each other? Especially in a group RP where you have to hang around the person you just ghosted, it's so awkward!",

            "selftext": "***Hi! Name's Minty, I'm a fantasy and fandom roleplayer and I would love to get an rp for my OCs!*** \n\n***My style is 3rd-person, literate, 1 paragraph with a small tendency to one line, but I will do my best to match you if you want a more detailed style.***\n\n***I have five girls with starters to choose from:*** \n\n*Marie of the Autumn Forest:*\n\nMarie was around 3 foot tall, with fluffy tree-brown hair and leaf-amber eyes. Her wings seemed to be made of leaves arranged as butterfly wings, and her dress was delicately sewn, looking as if it had been made of with marigold petals and spider silk. Due to her Grandmother on her Mother's side being a succubus, her aura was calming but very subtlely seductive, making her all the nicer to be around even without her bubbly and eternally kind personality. After being exiled from her home for being too friendly with her people's enemies, she now spent her days flying around exploring, helping injured animals and wishing for a friend to stay with. She really was dreadfully lonely as she travelled the forests and mountainous foothills that surrounded her once-home. On this day, she was calmly asleep on a thick tree branch, her leg dangling down from the canopy as she snored softly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Elophandrai \\[sorceress\\]:*\n\nElophandrai was rather a soft and gentle sort of Sorceress. She didn't agree with the views of her Academy of Magics, and as such was rather shunned. So she left, and made her way deep in the mountains, building her castle up above the clouds that collected around the highest peak. Her skin was pale, and her frame was delicate and light enough to allow her the power of flight, though her form was 7 feet in height, tall enough to seem somewhat Elvish. Though she was indeed human, her craft has lead her body to be misshapen, her arms extended to almost the ground, allowing her gowns to work as wings, and allowing her the strength to pick up anything she wishes to. Though she doesn't often leave her castle, today she found herself in need of some food and potion ingredients, so she had flown down to the forested foothills of her mountain to forage quietly for a while. Her shimmering blue gown and platinum blonde hair looked very out of place as she reached up for mistletoe berries in the large oaks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Grental {bookseller}:*\n\nGrental 'Tally' Longclaw was a half-dwarf bookseller in the town. The green-haired woman had runaway from home with a crate of books and a bag of high quality gems to settle in a cottage near the center of town from which she could sell her books from every day she wished to open the door and let people in. Which happened to be most days, now she thought about it, but she didn't really care about that. At that morning, the short and stocky teen was getting ready in her favourite green dress with it's white apron to go and open up the shop for the day, before settling inside with a plate of fruit in front of her so she could eat and read before the first customer of the day showed up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Rentelina {mouse-girl}:*\n\n'Oh crumbs!' squeaked Rentelina softly as she ran through the corridor she'd found herself in. She checked behind her to see if she was losing her pursuers and squeaked in fear to see them closer than ever. She looked around as she ran for somewhere she could hide, clutching the stolen bread to her chest. She gasped as she found her target, a slightly open window she could easily scramble through but that would be too small for those following her. She took the escape and dived through, rolling as she arrived at the other side, squeaking as she bumped against your legs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Iriste {Willow Nymph}:*\n\nDown a lesser-known stream from the Clouded Peaks, there was a secret place that was long sought after by adventurers and acolytes alike. This place was known as the Twilight Glade, as it was said to be in a pocket of reality separate from the outside world where it was always lit just past sundown. This beautiful place, a medium sized lake carved out by an enchanted waterfall with several layers of dense forest between it and their connection with the outside world, was well protected from the influence of those who would do it harm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, that did mean that it was a rather boring place for a young Willow Nymph to be stuck. The green-haired, silver skinned young creature swum and sang and created, her home tree was covered in the trinkets she'd made from feathers and fur and claws and teeth and whatever else would be left behind or washed downstream to her. She was most of all lonely though. She loved the animals that were around, but there were no other truly sentient creatures to spark her interest. Her sage-green eyes were often sad and laced with tears, though she didn't truly understand why. She was happy here after all, wasn't she?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***((PS: Sorry for the long post))***",

            "selftext": "Hello, there. I'm looking for someone who likes roleplays that feature interesting characterisation and dialogue. I really like romantic stuff, at least that's what I'm in the mood for these days. Light-hearted drama as well as themes of desire and temptation are things I enjoy.\n\nI usually roleplay in first person and post 1-3 paragraphs, more if appropriate. I could be convinced to roleplay in third person, though, if it's very important to my partner. \n\nUsually I play more traditionally masculine characters but I'm versatile. I try to remain consistent with my characters in the context of the story so fleshing out ideas beforehand is pretty important to me. I don't mean we plan everything ahead of time, just that we're both going to be on the same page with regards to development of the plots and the characters. \n\nI'd prefer longterm arrangements but I'm not exactly opposed to playing a series of short scenes within the same continuity. Of course, I'm down to start something fresh if the roleplay we're engaged in becomes boring/stale. \n\nI'm not overly picky when it comes to themes and settings. I actually prefer things that take me a bit of my comfort zone as well. \n\nHit me up if you're interested in playing. I'm always up for meeting new, interesting people. ",

            "selftext": "Good morning!\n\nWhile my account is new to Reddit, I do not consider myself new to role-playing. My first role-playing experience was based in the Star Wars universe (with original characters) and took place twelve (12) years ago through the medium of snail mail. Wow! Typing that out made me feel SUPER old!\n\nWhy do I come to Reddit now? While I had a large number of role-playing partners in the past, that number has slowly dwindled throughout the years. While some role-players have completed their stories, others have simply vanished. Hence, once again, I am extending my feelers. I am looking for a literate long-term role-playing partner, whether Male or Female, who have an interest in deep world building and even deeper plot development.\n\nA few scenarios that I had in mind:\n\n* **A Kingdom Divided**. \n   * A civilization is divided due to rising tensions between races, magic v. non-magic, etc.\n* **A Kinship Separated**. \n   * Two friends are separated in their youth, however, a *connection* or *bond* slowly brings them together.\n   * In my mind, this would start off as two (2) distinct role-plays based in one (1) singular world. Once our main characters met, or were reunited, the role-plays would merge. How will this connection or bond impact the two while separated and/or together?\n* **A Discovery.**\n   * Two acquaintances stumble upon a discovery that allows travel between various dimensions and realities.\n   * In my mind, this would start off as a Slice of Life role-play but the device would allow them to enter a Fantasy-based, Science Fiction-based, Steam Punk-based, etc. version of their own world. What will they do with the abilities they discover between various dimensions and realities?\n* **Other.** \n   * I am open to suggestion ~~and promise that I don't bite.~~\n\nIf any of this piques your interest, hit me up and swamp me with orange envelopes!\n\nI hope to hear from you soon!",

Some edge I guess.\nLmao, also don\u2019t ghost.

            "selftext": "# Introduction and Rules\n\nHello everyone! I am a 27 year old woman living in Canada, and I have been roleplaying for the better part of 17 years. I have a few roleplay preferences. **First**, I like about 1-3 paragraphs per post, and prefer quality over quantity. In the heat of fervant replies, posts may become shorter, but should be no less descriptive. **Secondly**, I am not strict about how frequently you post, but I prefer a few times per week. I live a very busy life (full time school, part time job, and two part time volunteer positions atop a social life). I cannot post every day. My favourite way to play is to schedule certain \"online\" times with my partner which allows us to reply to each other live, but this is not necessary and not always feasible. **Third**, age is important to me. I am 27, and my partners must always be over the age of 18, with no exceptions. **Fourth**, respect is key in our engagement. I will respect your boundaries, and you will respect mine, and we will consider these boundaries as subject to change at any time. **Fifth,** and finally, we are both here to have fun. If we lost interest, or stop having fun, let's discuss it. Open communication is absolutely key to success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Story\n\nThis roleplay will center around two characters. Two protagonists. Plus, a cast of NPCs we can either share or play individually. Are you a rejected knight, and am I a hidden Queen? Are you a travelling bard, and am I the thief caught in a trap? Are you a military captain, and am I your prisoner? Am you a humble carpenter, thrust with the responsibility of a beached mermaid? I want this story to primarily focus on our character's realtionship, while the plot will be a way to push them into unusual scenarios to challenge and change that relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am open to two-way world building, but I'd like to keep things relatively simple. I have a magic system in mind based on race-specific or nation-specific magic traits, coupled with a \"dark magic\" built on soul/body harvesting. We can really go wild with that part! I would like our characters to share a common goal. Maybe one character must deliver a package by a certain time, or must find a missing relative, or must restore a royal child to power? Whatever their goal is, let's work it out together!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to reply to this post or message me!",

I encourage you to do what you feel your character would do, even if you think it might displease me. \n\nWhile I am looking for primarily female RPers atm, above the age of 18, I will happily hear anyone who messages me out. The worst I can say is no, right? So go ahead, hit me up. \n\nBut do keep in mind this: i\u2019m a very passionate person when it comes to my writing and RP, and I put a lot of work in for each Partner. Nothing depresses me more on a constant basis, is when I get ghosted. All I ask, is we communicate, because even if we end up stopping, at least now I don\u2019t feel like it was wasted.\n\nWith all of the above kept in mind, don\u2019t hesitate to message me.

But from time to time, when I've been in discussions with partners (either we have started something or haven't gotten something off the ground yet) I've gotten some strange vibes after a while. I'm not sure if it's a gut feeling or something else but say there's a disagreement or maybe just a simple misunderstanding or even how they carry themselves through text, I get a little bothered. It's tough to really be 100% clear on the internet without going to say, voice chat or something so I know not everything is easily presented and digested for many reasons.\n\nI think my question is, has anyone ever been chatting with a partner or a potential partner and ended up having a communication error that throws you off your game? You either try to fix the issue or let it slide, but something about them now feels...off. Like you're not sure if you're on the same page anymore or if the vibe of conversation/story feels somehow skewed all of a sudden?\n\nI've had a few people seem compatible at first but once we get rolling, we have different means of communicating and expectations. Or maybe they make a small comment or critique and somehow you're unable to meet in the middle again. Has anyone ever felt this way or am I going nuts? (I could very well be nuts haha) Has anyone ever stopped a story because they felt their partner wasn't someone they could communicate well or did you somehow make it work? \n\nAnd does anyone know what I mean by 'vibe'? xD\n\n",

            "selftext": "The idea is essentially that you were taken captive by a bandit group, to be either ransomed (if you look like someone who might have a family or be of importance) or to be used as sadistic entertainment. Your time in captivity can be either the main plot or the 'prologue', depending on what you fancy. \n\nIf it's the main plot, in comes my character, Sovaesi. She's a dark elf, working for the camp as a healer and mage. Her morals seem unclear but she takes care of you, patching up your wounds and seeming hesitant to speak to you much. She rarely lingers at the camp and seems like she has somewhere else to be. I'll be playing a few other characters here too.\n\nIf it's the prologue (I imagine we can briefly write out what happens or just chat about it), my character is a young child who helps you escape. When you're free, you send a mercenary group to destroy the bandit nest. My character hides and lives, and realises what must have happened and what she caused. Traumatised, she spends her years hating you, hating those mercenaries and set on revenge.\n\nCould possibly meet on the cart in the beginning of the game and go through Helgen together, not realising who the other is.\n\nIf you're interested, PM!

            "selftext": "Nothing felt better than the cool breeze of sea air mixed with the sun gently beating down on your skin, as you and your crew sailed the Caribbean Ocean. After taking in a deep breath, a smile spread across your lips, and you turned the wheel of the Scarlet Rose, your famous pirate ship. You were one of the most deadly and successful pirates on the seas. Your crew was fearless, and they were loyal as dogs. No army had managed to stop you, nor any rivalling pirates. Not all pirates, anyway. \n\nCannons boomed, and the sound of wood breaking followed. Gunshots went off and swords clashed, but it was evident that the opposing ship was losing. You smirked, watching as your crew killed of the opposing pirates, and the captain was brought fourth. Just as the last enemy pirate was killed, the captain was shouting at him. Something about making sure they didn\u2019t go below deck. Was he hiding more riches below deck? Rubies? Diamonds? Gold? Your eyes lit up with excitement. You left your crew to toss the captain overboard as you adventured below deck of the opposing ship. It was slowly starting to flood due to the holes at the bottom, but you weren\u2019t worried. Directly ahead of you, there was a man chained to the wall. He looked half asleep, but the battle had clearly woken him up. Questions started to fill your mind. It wasn\u2019t unusual for pirates to keep prisoners. You had lots over the past. But why was that captain so adamant on making sure you never found this man? \n\nOnce he realised you were there, you gave him a slight grin. Curiosity took the better of you, and you called your men down. Before the man could even say anything, you got your men to knock him out, and you took him on board your own ship, keeping him in the prisoners quarters. \n\nThe day after, you came down to find the man awake, leaning against the bars. You gave him a sweet smile, with malicious intent behind it. You wanted to know why he was being held prisoner, but he wouldn\u2019t give answers. He would just smirk at you and say something witty or stupid. Or both. Most of the time, it was stupid though. So, you just left him. There was no point bothering anyway. You let your crew do what they wanted with him. \n\nA few days later, most of your crew was below deck. Loud noises were being made, and you frowned. You ordered your first mate to take the wheel, and you made your way below deck. Your crew were yelling and cheering, gathered in a circle. In the middle of the circle, the prisoner and one of your crew were brawling it out, and your crew was losing. You raised an eyebrow, suddenly interested. It was rare that your crew would lose something like this. But, as captain, you couldn\u2019t let it go on. You suddenly barked at them, and they all stopped just as your crew member fell to the floor, bruised and bloody. You looked directly at the prisoner, and he grinned. \n\n\u201cHe started it\u201d\n\nSomething about that childish behaviour made your smile, and you called him above deck. This man might be interesting to have on board. \n______________________________________\n\nHey there! Thanks for reading. I hope this prompt interested you. If you couldn\u2019t guess, this is a pirate themed rp. The base premise of this is that my character (the prisoner) has valuable information about a treasure. A treasure so valuable that the Spanish monarchy were looking for it too. Your character, the captain, and mine work together and go out in search of the loot, battling armies and other pirates. If you want, we can even add supernatural/fantasy elements, like the kraken, ghosts and whatnot. That\u2019s optional. \n\nSmut is also optional, however I would like a developing romance regardless. \n\nOne more thing - I am still a student, so I won\u2019t be on 24/7. Please understand that I can get busy, and I will put other things ahead of our rp. I can guarantee I will reply more than once a day, though. \n\nWith that said, shoot me a message if this interests you! If I get lots of replies, I might have to stop taking partners, as it simply gets too overwhelming. Hope to see you soon! ",

It's me again, for the um-teenth time, with Another plot i'm dying to try out with someone!\u00a0\n\nFor some info about me: check this link out !\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--Lk1MEdGkj-MjE5fLu04bSua5V55c5Nu7llWvVkN\\_M/edit?usp=sharing\n\nBasically, I'm thinking about two rivaling kingdoms, we'll call them A and B for simplicity's sake, possibly on the brink of war at this point. A has made it clear that they aren't looking for peace, while B is trying their best to make some sort of arrangement to settle down tensions. The King(ruler of A) has given his eldest son a job: infiltrate B and bring him back the head of the Queen(ruler of B). The son agrees steadfastly, aching to find his father at peace once again, and desperate to prove himself. However, once he infiltrates as one of Queen's workers, he meets the Queen's son, who takes an immediate liking to this new worker. The Prince of A is simply trying to do a job, now this runt's getting in the way? It'd be better to just off him as well as his mother, but that would raise too much of a suspicion. That, and the Prince never seems to leave his side.\u00a0(Basically, I just think it would be really cool to dive into something with a lot of betrayal in it. Betrayal of family, pretending to be someone you're not, the constant fear of getting figured out, I think it'd have a lot of tension, but a\u00a0*lot*\u00a0of room for a forbidden love kind of scenario)\u00a0TL:DR: rivaling kingdoms, betrayal, m/m, onesided hate to love.\u00a0 \n\nAnyway! If you're interested, send me a message with the info I ask for in my plot, and if I think we'll click, I'll let you know! Thanks so much! ",

I picture this taking in a medieval type setting. \n\nI'd like to have like 3 noble born males as marriage options aka romance options.  (I'd be open to one of these having darker motives for wanting to marry her. Like if he plans to kill the king - her father.) \n\nI also think it would be cute if she had a bodyguard (he could be older) that she has feelings for. \n\nI'd love a female (friendship) handmaid. (I'd be open to the handmaid having feelings for the princess.) \n\nI'd also be open to the idea if her step mother (current queen) tries to make her marry her step brother. \n\nWe can keep the princess as her castle/home or we can send her off someplace a bit foreign. I could see the queen (step mother) trying to send her off to another country (etc) to 'get rid of her.\u2019 \n\nI write in third person about 5-7 sentences. I have decent availability most the week. I'd like to focus on romance/characters. I like some build up and tension. \n\nFor example: if she and her guard have mutual feelings they might kiss and let a little close but her guard wouldn't want to deflower her to ruin her potential marriages / rumors. \n\nPlease message me if you'd be open to GMing. I am excited. \n\n",

            "selftext": " Hello reddit. I've been working on yet another ADULT fantasy medievalish setting, but this one has more of an accent on its unique world, magic, politics, and the nsfw part. This is a story based rp where you will have to read a bunch of lore and make a character before you join, but we did try to keep the important stuff as light as possible. The server is still fresh, and in need of interesting characters to populate its multiple factions. Please do not join if you are not considered an adult in your country, and please DO join if you are interested in some mature, para to multi-para rp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the pitch : *Lush, a magocracy established in the eye of what the council named 'The mist'. A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense fog, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Since they float in the endless void of The Mist, most of the Magocracy's conflicts are born internally amongst guilds. Lush's government system is comprised of a council overseen by the Arcane Sovereign. While every major policy must go by the city's supreme ruler, internal affairs are usually taken care of by the area's ruling guild(s).*\n\nIf you are interested, here's the invite link: Perma link: [https://discord.gg/ugXtMYq](https://discord.gg/ugXtMYq)",

            "selftext": " \n\nHi! I\u2019m Gambit. I\u2019m twenty one years old and based out of the east coast of the US. This post continues my search for long term role play partners. First let me tell you a little about myself so that we aren\u2019t strangers. I have been role playing since I was fifteen years old when I played Dungeons and Dragons for the first time. Ever since then I have been completely obsessed with world building and crafting large stories containing multiple characters. That actually has turned potential partners away from me because not everyone is comfortable playing multiple characters. That\u2019s fine and I understand that which is why I would never ask my partner to do more than they are comfortable. I used to be a game master so jumping from character is second nature to me and I enjoy it.\n\nWhat I am looking for is someone is open minded and creative when it comes to writing. The ideal person would be a fan of world building and multiple genres so that we have options when it comes to picking a potential plot. The preferred writing length would be one to two paragraphs and be in third person past tense. As for the age of my partners I must ask that you be 18+ years old as I am twenty one. I would feel more comfortable with a partner either closer to my age or older because my role plays tend to be dark with adult themes. Which brings me to my next topic which is NSFW elements which my role plays tend to include. However that doesn\u2019t mean they are smut filled as they aren\u2019t I mean NSFW in the way of violent themes and things along that lines. I am completely fine with there being no smut however I do like to have romance as a slow burning underlying theme. That being said I am comfortable with smut but I would prefer if we also focused on the other aspects of a relationship and the different forms of intimacy.\n\nI have the most experience writing fantasy both high and low usually with a dark atmosphere. Another genre that I enjoy would be vigilante stories that take place in a custom built alternate DC universe. If none of those grab you I am also open to Cyberpunk, Sci fi, and Apocalyptic stories. When it comes to fandoms I am open to most video game, tv, and movie fandoms with a couple of conditions. Those conditions are that I can play an OC, the story takes place in a alternate timeline within the same universe, and we don\u2019t adhere to strictly to the canon. These conditions exist to let maintain some semblance of narrative freedom while playing within someone else\u2019s creation.\n\nIf you made it this far thank you for caring enough to read it all and I hope you have a great day. Thank you all for your time and I hope to hear from you all real soon. If you are interested in potentially being partners please direct message me here on reddit.\n\nPS: I also have plenty of writing samples if any of you are into that kind of thing.",

As for adult content, I enjoy it when it helps the story along etc. (I also don't mind trying something other than Fantasy or SciFi, let me know any suggestions you have)\n\n\nI usually write a few paragraphs or on occasion a thousand or so words. It all depends on what is happening really.\n\n\nI've been looking for a while now but sadly have been ghosted or had no replies. I am 21 and from Scotland, so my timezone is GMT. I am at college full time, but apart from that, I am free to reply quite a lot of the day. I also stay up late so I am fine roleplaying with any American timezones. I would also like to get to know my roleplay partner a little, but this isn't essential if you don't want to.\n\n\nFeel free to comment or drop me a message and I'll reply as quickly as I can. I would prefer discord to roleplay but again, I can try another medium that you prefer, just let me know.",

And now I'm in this predicament where I'm super craving Avatar but it seems like the fandom almost died out. So here I am Reddit. I've come to bargain.\n\nMy name is Munchlars, or Munch for short. I'm a 21 year old male from The Netherlands whose currently stressed to the bone because he's being way too late with doing his exams. I'm looking for someone (no really, anyone) whose willing to RP this with me. I don't mind what character you want me to play, nor do I mind which character you will play. I do have experience playing Zuko and Mako though.\n\nAll I ask of you is that you're friendly and that literacy labels aren't your thing. I'm Dutch, my English wont be superb. I can easily churn out a 1000 word reply though. Although my preferred length sits around 3/400 words.\n\nIf you're interested in any means. Please feel free to contact me via the PMs with any plots or pairings you'd like to do. I'll try my best answering asap.\n\nalso I promise I'm more serious than what this thread makes me look like.

            "selftext": "Hello, all! It's your friendly neighborhood Eso, here! I've noticed a distinct lack of monsters in here, and was hoping that someone out there would be interested in playing someone a little less human. Now, as far as specifics goes, I leave that entirely to you. Slimes? Go for it. Spider people? Hell yeah. Dryads? Kiiiinda human-y, but sure! Sky's pretty much the limit here. I don't want to type up a long, drawn out plot here, because things like that are so much more fun to plan with a partner than to go ahead and have a set plot in mind. So, if you're interested just shoot me a message with the monster you're interested in playin' in my PMs. Now for my rules real quick:\n\n18+ required, 21+ preferred.\n\nI only use Discord, it's the best way to keep things all organized and stuff!\n\nI have some hard boundaries, and I require to respect them and I'll respect yours.\n\nNo one-liners, please. It's just lazy! I'm a multi-paragraph writer!\n\nPlease don't ghost, it's just rude.\n\nBill and Ted rules: Be excellent to each other! I like to pal around and brainstorm with my partners.\n\nSmut's fine, but I don't want it to be the central focus. I'm not opposed to drawn-out scenes, but I don't want the porking to be the central theme.\n\nMost importantly: Have a great time and make something cool together!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd, to reiterate, hit me with the monster you're wantin' to play and, just so I know you read this whole thing, the phrase \"Pineapple Palace\" in the subject line of your PM. I really hope to hear from you wonderful folks, soon. Until then: Take it easy, my friends.",

            "selftext": "Hello! So this may be a little different from other posts here, but my husband and I (25, 24) have really been enjoying 1x1 Star Wars themed RP lately and we're looking for someone to join us. We've both been heavily involved in online RP communities for several years (in fact, it's how we first met!) and our friends tend to be people we\u2019ve met online.\n\nWe're looking for someone to join us for some long-term RP, but we also enjoy having online friends just to chat with in between posts. We\u2019re more or less nolifers with a flexible schedule. We\u2019re pretty laid back, and of course feel free to message me with any questions you may have. All we ask is that you be communicative and have a decent understanding of Star Wars lore - You don\u2019t have to know everything about it, but just enough to be comfortable with the universe. We play OC\u2019s only, and we actually already have a very fleshed out world full of side characters and a developed setting, ideal for anyone who wants to write up a character and jump right into some good RP. (Of course, everything is still collaboration and your main character will be a main focus of the plot. I only mean to say that we won\u2019t need to spend hours planning and brainstorming- we\u2019re ready to start integrating your character just as soon as you are!)\n\nI should also say now that we are definitely looking for romance RP with strong adult themes. It may seem strange, but the idea of another woman in our roleplay has actually been on our minds for a while. Not in a 'both girls fawn over mr amazing dude and end up sisterwives' kind of way, but more like three people who just fit together and form a fun relationship where they all equally enjoy each other's company. We enjoy writing that is centered on strong characters that can make the most of a good plot and setting. Romance RP and dirty RP wouldn\u2019t mean half as much if the characters weren\u2019t well-established and meaningful.\n\nOur RP style is something of a mix between go-with-the-flow character development, and pseudo-GMing. Lately I\u2019ve found I enjoy playing side characters, villains, and environmental stuff and I think it helps things from becoming stagnant. I also really enjoy tailoring subplots around specific characters and coming up with plot arcs and nemeses for the main characters to deal with, of course with plenty of time for the characters to get to know each other. \n\nWe're silly and crass and much more lighthearted than this post probably makes us sound. We tend to like fantasy and sci fi (Game of Thrones swords line our living room walls and I have a stack of Star Wars RPG rulebooks). We are video game-playing homebodies who love nerdy stuff and are in general pretty easygoing and unapologetically flirtatious. PM me with your discord info or feel free to ask questions about me and my husband and I\u2019ll be happy to answer!\n",

The old rules are still in place, just to a lesser extent (with one exception: no fusions allowed under any circumstances). Gems fed up with Homeworld's old ways have defected and fled to earth, creating tons of spotty rebel groups. However, among all this; Era 3's ongoing peace, Earth's growing population of Gems... a plague is rising out of the ashes.

            "selftext": "Greetings, my name is Sven and I'm here on behalf of the moderating team of /r/MasksRP to let you all know that we're open and active, and definitely looking for more players to join our ranks! We have no real requirements to join other than \"Read the sidebar/Discord and follow the sub rules\", and we don\u2019t get nitpick-y on writing style or posting format (after all, we see roleplay as something that should be fun and joyful, not an English class). We also don\u2019t mind if you\u2019re a beginning roleplayer or an experienced one - we can help you learn the basics if need be and questions are always welcome if you have them!\n\nWe also have an OOC subreddit [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mRFAFBV) for those wanting a more social experience along the side (also open to any questions, if you have them). Generally, this will be an easier and quicker way to communicate with our members of the sub and us moderators\u2026 who are generally on for most of the day and even at night due to our staff being dotted around the globe!\n\nSome helpful little Q&amp;A for questions you may or may not have: \n \n**\u201cIs there a resource where I can look up and read canon lore for your sub?\u201d**\n\n*Why, yes! We\u2019ve created a handy [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EYvflKQBPB2VQRTQbZVygz0-XGrskfGeHG2FLCgn-wU/edit?usp=sharing) that outlines the story and setting for our sub.*\n\n\n**\u201cI\u2019m new to RPing battles and have only really done social RP\u2026 do you have any guidelines on RPing fights?\u201d**\n \n *Yes! To ensure compliance with the sub rules and fairness towards all members, combat roleplay must be actively moderated by our staff.*\n \n**\"What feel or theme does the server have?\"**\n\n *This is largely dependent on you and your style of RP! Many people are content with cute and cuddly slice-of-life that is sometimes complemented by super-powered action or use the chaos caused by powers as a vehicle for romance or drama, but others live for the gritty, dangerous combat we have! Most characters - though super-powered - are merely flesh and blood, and goes down as quick as the average man. Thus, most utilize every edge in combat that they can get for themselves to maximize the odds of success, which has turned our combat to a high-stakes, high-rewards speed-chess that never fails to create suspense!\n \n**\u201cOkay, so\u2026 I got started on creating a character! I\u2019m not sure about powers to choose, though\u2026\u201d**\n \n*If you have any questions and aren\u2019t sure about something, feel free to drop by our Discord Server or mod message us on anything (from character names, character brainstorming ideas, events on the sub, etc)! Seriously, we don\u2019t mind answering any inquiries.* :)\n\nAgain - if you\u2019d like to join, we\u2019d love to have you!\n\n~The /r/MasksRP Mod Team\n",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am still on the hunt for a good roleplay. I haven't really touched roleplay in a while but I'm itching to get some of all of my muse and writing cravings out. I've been roleplaying for about as long as I've been able to use a computer (probably over 15 years or so) and I'm pretty laid back regarding replies and my expectations to a partner. We all make mistakes now and then, but as long as your writing is coherent, I really don't mind. Usually my replies are about 150-300 words long but I can easily do longer replies, however, you should expect the roleplay to be a bit slower paced with longer replies from me. I'm not the kind of partner who will pull your hairs to give me a reply every tenth minute, I just want to have fun and not feel like roleplay is a chore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so anyways, enough blabbering. I have been playing too much Metro Exodus lately and I'm DYING for an apocalypse themed roleplay. If you have a group server that is apocalypse themed (not a fandom or based on but original settings only!) I'm willing to look into it but I'm mainly looking for 1x1 partners on Discord. My only requirement for roleplay partners is that you MUST be above 18 because I do want to explore darker themes and explicit ships. Oh, and speaking of ships, I'm down for all of them. I have a male character that I really want to write but I also have an idea for a voodoo queen like character and I'm sure we can plot something cool either way.

We take the reality of everyday life and combine it with mythology to make it more fun and exciting. Things like going to school, having a job, or even Trick-or-Treating can go awry when monsters or other beings threaten to destroy the town.\n\nOur canon originates from Rick Riordan\u2019s Percy Jackson and the Olympian books, but Haven is a completely new part of that universe. If you haven\u2019t read the books, or aren\u2019t familiar with Greek mythology, that\u2019s okay! We have plenty of information in our wiki/posts and links to the Riordan wiki to help guide you. \n\nCome check us out at r/HalfBloodHaven! If you have any questions, drop a comment or join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/pupjmhd) and we will try and answer them in a timely manner. \n",

The basic plan for my character is to be a spy.   They'll either spy on their gang for the cops, or spy on another gang for their gang depending on what direction you want the rp to go.\n\nI prefer my partners to be 18+.

I want the roleplay to be emotional and raw. People usually expect the roleplay to be a little sappy when I say it like that, but honestly, I want it to be about their personal journeys. I\u2019m not saying that it won\u2019t be a little sappy at times, but I also want it to be sad when our characters struggle, fail and make mistakes.  I want our characters to experience highs and lows because we\u2019re playing out lives of characters that are real to us. They don\u2019t always succeed in whatever they want to accomplish because they\u2019re only human.  I want to see how they walk through their lives together. I want to be able to experience moments in their life that allow us to cry, laugh, smile, cheer and truly feel for these characters on a personal level. I want this roleplay to be a character drama and a slice of life romance that truly grabs my heart and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\n**Plot &amp; Setting**\n\nI don\u2019t have a fixed plot or setting that I want to try since I\u2019d like to be able to discuss it with my partner. I do have a lot of ideas though, but it\u2019s really all up for discussion.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThis is definitely something I think my partner and I should spend a lot of time on. I want to make sure our characters have great chemistry. They should have an interesting dynamic, and they should be able to build off each other. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll always get along. Fighting, arguing and going through hardships is what makes things fun. I want to have a good balance. I do want them to feel like real people after all. I would prefer to play with an older female character.\n\n**Closing Notes**\n\nI believe half the fun is a good roleplaying partner. Being able to talk and enjoy each other\u2019s company is a great part of roleplaying. It\u2019s cooperative storytelling, and that\u2019s what I love about it. Plus, it helps build friendships, so I\u2019m definitely up to chat, discuss the roleplay and simply just spend time together as we fanboy/fangirl about our characters. I hope you don't mind being friends!\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far and you\u2019re interested in roleplaying with me, please, send me a message! I\u2019m excited to go on this journey with you.\n",

Either the animated movie or comics, it doesn\u2019t matter. Really I\u2019m looking for someone to play Diana. I adore the dark, gritty and murderous Wonder Woman!\n\nI myself would either be playing as Barry Allen, or Grifter, or someone else who was a key in humanity\u2019s last stand to try and fix the timeline. We can discuss other possibilities as I am open to playing several different characters, those two just come to mind first.\n\nNow as for plot, it would be a bit different. Barry _doesn\u2019t_ fix the timeline and Diana and her army of Amazon warriors comes out on top of the world. I\u2019m thinking either Grifter survives and Barry dies, or the opposite and are solely left on Earth to try and right the wrong. \n\nGrifter would have a much more violent approach and try to find a way to annihilate the Amazon threat, while Barry would still try and fix the timeline. \n\nThis would be extremely dark, grey, violent and explore various mature themes. There doesn\u2019t have to be smut, really, but that\u2019s entirely up to you!\n\nThis can be short or long term, doesn\u2019t matter much to me! I\u2019m simply looking for an adequate partner for the night.~ I write in PM\u2019s (this can be somewhat of an exception) and in third person (this is not). \n\nI hope to hear from some of you.~ Thanks for reading!

I've been roleplaying for a few years; I had to take a break this past year due to my schedule, and I don't really have a good group to write with anymore. It's been hard trying to find a group of literate roleplayers, and if anyone is a part of one that wouldn't mind accepting a new player, please PM me. If, after a bit of chatting, I seem alright, I wouldn't mind sharing my discord.\n\nI'm more interested in fantastic settings, whether that be medieval fantasy, a modern superpowered settings, or whatever. If your group is currently RPing a particular setting (DC, Marvel, Avatar, JoJo), just let me know. I like a fair bit of settings, but I'm not knowledgeable in them all. Also, feel free to ask me for a writing sample if your group has pretty good standards.\n\nThat's about it. I'm hoping to meet a good group through this, so don't be shy about messaging me!\n\nArrivederci",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

I like to stick to the canon of the show/manga. Obviously a timeskip is not canon but when referencing past events, I'd like everything to be canon.** Now, on to what I am looking for in a partner!\n\n* 18+ in age as I'll be touching on some darker topics here and there.\n* Literate! You don't have to be a novel writer I just want to understand you.\n* A couple sentences **minimum** per reply. Feel free to write waaaaay more than that!\n* If you would like to play a canon character I kindly ask that you be caught up to the manga. If you're playing OC, great! You don't have to be caught up.\n* Able to handle spoilers. This is a timeskip and spoilers here and there are going to happen.\n* Any writing style is fine and I will adapt to what you use.\n* **A minimum of three replies per day.** I am able to roleplay all throughout the day so the more replies we get in, the better! I understand that life gets in the way, as it does with everyone. Just let me know and I'll understand and be patient.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now! If anything else comes to mind, I'll tell you about it. I'll be providing the starter and any information you would like to have regarding the RP. If you're still interested, DM me and we'll discuss things further!\n\nThanks for reading :\\^)",

            "selftext": "Long, long ago, when the land of Alterria was young, there was chaos. Men were naught but beasts, and they treated eachother as such. There was no love, no camaraderie, no cooperation; only survival and might. The strongest warrior in this age long past was known as the King of Blades. It was said that he carried with him not one blade, but hundreds. He wore them like armor, his whole body was a terrifying menagerie of death-dealing instruments crafted by only the most skilled of bladesmiths. He wore the Crown of Knives, a device that seemed to give him supernatural mastery over the blades on his body. He was a whirlwind of steel and death. The King of Blades conquered all he encountered, defeated every foe. He came to rule Alterria. He was a benevolent king, but not a merciful one. His people loved and feared him like the Gods themselves. Through the strange magic of the Crown of Knives, he lived for three centuries... But one day, was finally felled in combat by an ambitious young warrior. This warrior became the Second King of Blades, and ruled the land of Alterria in his stead, taking the Crown of Knives for his own and in turn becoming warped by its magics. Many centuries have passed, and we now find ourselves in what it known as the Eighteenth Age, ruled by the Tenth King of Blades-- a cruel, mad king. He rejects the title of the Tenth King of Blades, instead demanding he be called something else entirely; the Last King. Many have tried and failed to remove the Last King from power, but on the battlefield he is death itself. His blades are the wind, they sever and decimate all who meet his eye. He has ruled already for four centuries, and all the land is under his grasp. He studies the magic of the crown, learns its secrets. He wishes to be its final scholar-- an ascendant who will inherit all creation through its strength. And yet, even in these darkest of times... The embers of hope still shine.\n\n---\n\nHello! I'm looking for someone to play out an RP in this original fantasy world of mine over Discord. I play in 3rd person, and am looking for an active and descriptive partner to undertake the task of dethroning the Last King with me! I'm open to all sorts of things regarding plots, characters, and worldbuilding, and am hoping to make contact with someone as enthusiastic about these things as I am. If you have an original fantasy setting of your own, or are interested in writing fantasy within an existing fandom universe, I'd love to hear what you have to say as well. Please send me a message if you're interested-- thank you!",

            "selftext": "I haven't posted in a while, so I'm back again with a few more ideas that I would like to RP. I'm looking for a long term roleplay partner. I've had very little luck finding anyone who wants to RP through email, and maybe this post too will fall flat. I'm pretty set on email though as I no longer have a Discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A little about me**: I am 33 years old and as the post title implies, I am a male. I started RPing when I was about 12 or so and have been RPing off and on since then. Like most that age, I grew up in chat rooms where everything was more or less 'turn based'.\n\nI enjoy fantasy settings as a general rule because I have always liked the \"it could be possible\" aspect of it. However, I'm not opposed to sci-fi, and post apocalyptic settings and have ideas for them (I'm just less familiar with them).\n\nI tend to write in 3rd person but to the chagrin of many, I vary between past and present tense. I usually to write between 2 &amp; 4 paragraphs per post (I don't like going much past that since it's easy to dictate other peoples characters actions/control them and I am very against that). I am comfortable playing both male and female characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I'm looking for**: I am looking for a partner who replies in 2 - 4 paragraphs, writes in 3rd person and is okay with my slipping between past and present tense in that person. Additionally, please respect not controlling my main character and I'll do the same (I'm less sensitive about it when it comes to 'NPCs' that don't stick around). I want someone who also likes world building and will contribute to it. Just communicate with me and we can likely do great things. Lastly, please be 18+ since as with most RPs, there are things that tend to shift to adult themes and I need you to be an adult (I am old enough to be parents of some here).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RP Ideas**:  \n\n***Sci-Fi:*** *Living on a remote planet, one of the last of their race defends against the invading beings from another planet. Out alone one night on patrol, they are ambushed by opposing enemy forces. However, the story only starts there as those who ambushed them are looking to find a way for there to be peace. Now these two opposing sides of a coin must figure out how to do that without getting caught.* (I know that this one is a little bit played out, but I think it would be fun. Again, mxf, fxf, mxm, etc are all acceptable here. I am open to playing either side of the conflict. I'm not opposed to including magic in this world, but it would need to be decided upon before hand.)\n\n***Post-Apocalyptic:*** (Insert disaster of your choice) *has ended life as we have all known it. Now, running across each other in the wild, we must decide if we can trust each other and work to survive, or if the other is looking to betray at the first opportunity.* (mxm, mxf, fxf, etc are again welcome. This one is basic and the least fleshed out, so maybe we can work on it together).  \n\n***Fantasy:*** *The world is in chaos, the ruling parties spread throughout the planet are being assassinated, one by one. The murders all seem to be done by the same person/party. What was once a peaceful world with every race getting along is now on the verge of an all out world war. The temporary rulers are vying for the strongest of the planet's fighters with everyone offering to pay for the services of those with the skills. Mages of various types are being brought on along with assassins and every other type of adventurer are being hired. Assassins are scoping out opposing forces to find who's responsible, mages are fortifying defenses, raising (undead) armies, trying to make weapons, fighters and knights are training everyone they can to fight, even if there is no chance they survive the ordeal.* (With this one, we would play as either the hirelings of a ruler (race can be decided). We would be using our skills to do whatever is needed of us. Alternatively, we can be a pair of temporary rulers trying to organize everyone, to find out what's really going on, to not get killed ourselves. There is a lot of room for this RP to go in many directions and as such, I don't want to narrow things down too much).  \n\n***Random RP that doesn't fit:*** *Robots flit across the sky, their pilots in the cockpit as they try to avoid blasts of magical energy from mages on the ground. In the field, there are dwarves working to build mechanical suits to turn one man into a walking wall, the suit being constructed looking more like an elephant than anything else. Across the field, humans are learning from elves how to move through the trees, both wearing exoskeletal armor suits to augment their skills.* (This one is pretty loose, but I like the idea of mixing genres and truly everything being more or less game. It can be post-apoc, pre-apoc, just a fantasy 'slice of life', or nearly anything else.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:** If any of this appeals to you, shoot me a message and we can discuss which one appeals to you and work on building a scene before we exchange emails and get started. I look forward to hearing from anyone interested. Cheers.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello Reddit! I\u2019m a eastern us based role player who is twenty one years old. I have about six years of role playing experience. I am just looking to get back out into the community and try to get back into writing. Recently my life got a bit chaotic and I had a lot of speed bumps which made maintaining a creative outlet difficult but such is life a sweet sorrow. In terms of what I am looking for is just some fun casual role play that can fuel my creativity and increase my literary skill. I am not looking for the best of the best as I know personally that I am a imperfect human with many a flaw. Truth be told I just want an active long term partner who I can tell many different stories with.  They don\u2019t have to be the most skilled I would just ask that they communicate and be interested in working together as a team to create unique and interesting stories. I\u2019m not a stickler for tons of rules nor do I have some unrealistic expectations for the people I write with I just ask that they be interested and a generally nice person. When it comes to the length I would prefer it comes down to what my partner enjoys I can churn out a paragraph or just as easily do three or four. I am also comfortable writing from all points of view but my personal favorite is third person as it helps me get into the mindset of the character better.\n\nWhen it comes to genres my favorites are by far fantasy both high and low but I am a sucker for dark and grim themed fantasy. Another personal favorite would be superhero stories as I love getting into the toll and trauma it takes on the hero\u2019s psyche. Most of my role plays tend to be very character focused and involves focusing on how certain events and relationships affect and change them over time. However I am not close minded when it comes to setting so if you have an idea please feel free to inbox me as I would love to hear them. When it comes to romance in my role plays I prefer the relationship not be the main focus as I love a good slow burning love. When it comes to NSFW I prefer that it be meaningful to the plot and character development and would prefer it not overshadow the other types of intimacy in the story. I like it in a more secondary theme that is affected by the main arc over time. I have the most experience with Male and Female pairings however if the right story grabs me I would be willing to try others. \n\nI should probably stop talking now before I scare you off. If you are interested in trying this partnership out or even just discussing the details please don\u2019t hesitate to inbox me. I work from home so I am almost always around my desktop so I will try to get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you so much for your time and have a wonderful day! Hope to hear from you all soon.",

The roleplay is set in a primitive dystopian city with a pretty flexible plot.\n\n\\-The site we're roleplaying on is kinda crude, so if that's an issue for you, you've been warned.\n\n\\-This roleplay will deal with some darker themes, since the city the roleplay takes place in is a patriarchal and classist society with bouts of plague, so younger users or folks who would rather not delve into topics such as death and situations like forced marriages should be cautioned. I intend to moderate in a way where bad things do happen, but nothing will be too graphic, and potentially triggering situations have some sort of warning ahead of time.\n\n\\-This run through will take place on a different site. It's a small roleplaying site and pretty easy to use, but it's not very polished yet.\n\n\\-There's a lot of information on what the society and the world is like, so I'd prefer people who are patient enough to read and adapt their characters to fit in the world.\n\n\\-This roleplay doesn't require a huge time commitment. One post a day minimum, and if you have conflicts, chances are I'll be lenient.\n\n\\- If something really isn't working for you or if you think something needs to be added, I'm open to new ideas.\n\n**Message me if you're interested and I'll direct you to the site where we'll be playing!

With that being said, I have gotten into roleplaying really heavy in the past 6 months and I am thoroughly enjoying it. I tend to be a literal and descriptive roleplayer, focused on capturing emotions, feelings and ambiance of the environment to make a scene enjoyable for us both. I use 3rd person for writing in the past tense but I am flexible to switch to a rapid-fire style if the scene calls for it and depending upon our availability (So far I have not met anyone that was online at the same time to attempt this, but it could be fun!).\n\nThe setting below can take place anywhere in the world and is open to mutual world-building.\n\nPrompt:\nMy character is surviving day-to-day foraging for supplies in different parts of the town. They have lost their entire family amd friends due to this recent outbreak which the world thought was just a norovirus outbreak, but the pathogen wreaked havoc on humanity rather quickly wiping out cities in a matter of a few days. My character is immune to the virus via airborne methods of infection, however the immune system can be easily overhwhelmed and give out if infected via a bite.\n\nYour character would also be in a similar situation as well living life day-to-day. Somehow they meet and band up together (open for discussion). I am more interested in playing out the story from the perspective of our characters and the complex situations they will be involved in (Warring surviving factions, zombie horde attacks, adding new members to the unit - men, women, children which we will be doubling up and playing, etc.)\n\nAs you can tell this will be quite a long-term roleplay so I am searching for a partner who has the time and commitment to carry out our unique story. I am even fine with few sentence type responses to keep progressing the story faster, not interested in novella style of writing.\n\nPlease DM me directly if you are interested.",

            "selftext": "TL;DR - 3rd person only please, Discord only, romance is the main theme and can have other themes also, can do \u201crapid fire\u201d replies or long and descriptive replies since it\u2019ll depend on your replies, my time zone is PST, send a good PM rather than a short one with \u201cHey,\u201d and we preferably can be friends too.\n\n\nHello once again, Reddit! Frost here in search of one more partner! Had a few people depart/cancel for personal reasons or compatibility reasons, so I\u2019m available for one more partner and hopefully even a friend. This is going to be a long post, so please bear with me! \n\nA little bit about me to begin with. I\u2019m 24 years old and reside in California, USA (PST). I only do 3rd person since 1st person can result in weak responses in my opinion. The replies I make will depend on yourself. I prefer doing  \u201crapid-fire\u201d replies which keep replies at a few sentence to a small paragraph many times a day. I *love* making long replies, which range from 3-5 paragraphs. In my opinion, too long of a reply creates slow progress for the story. Writing long paragraphs are something awesome because they create a deep story. From the characters thoughts and past, to their intentions and beyond. However, short replies are cool too, though they\u2019re not as detailed and immersive. \n\nIf replies are slow, then of course it would consist of paragraphs to give that detail. I understand we all have things to do and lives, so I know that role playing isn\u2019t a priority for some. I usually only play male characters, but can sometimes play female characters as well if the need arises or if more characters join the roster to increase the story\u2019s depth and longevity. \n\nI\u2019d honestly say in a fairly relaxed guy so I do want to be friends as well during the role plays, and maybe even afterwards. It can be something as small as how the day was and getting to know each there, or to becoming friends, chat about hobbies and such. I understand it\u2019s not something for everybody, so it\u2019s optional, though preferred, of course!\n\nIn terms of role play genre, theme, etc, I\u2019m very broad and open to many things. The few exceptions would be specific fandoms. I have little knowledge on many fandoms, such as Harry Potter/Naruto/Overwatch and other popular ones on here, but not enough to do a solid RP on. However! That doesn\u2019t stop me from doing them, it just won\u2019t be as good. I\u2019m mostly good at OCs since that leaves it to the minds creativity.\n\nMy biggest thing for the role play theme is romance, *but* it doesn\u2019t have to be the only theme. I also like adventure and action. Drama could and should be mixed in as well! It makes the story more rich and intriguing, rather than something boring that will fade out within a few replies. I can also do fantasy and science fiction. Once again, I\u2019m quite broad on themes.\n\nI have a couple of ideas that we can get started on. I\u2019m also open to ideas if you\u2019d like to share!\n\n1) Workplace/college/friends romance. This one is perhaps one that generally lasts the longest. The gist of it is one of the characters end up falling for the other either at work, school, through friends, or at a simple encounter at an event or something. It\u2019s quite self explanatory to say the least. \n\n2) Pregnancy. Your character finds out she\u2019s pregnant from her boyfriend, but when he hears the news, he isn\u2019t so thrilled and decided to leave her life immediately. Our characters meet somewhere and talk a little bit. They talk more and eventually fall for another after a few weeks. She then decided to tell him of her pregnancy, but will he take the news well compared to her ex boyfriend? \n\n3) Missions. Both characters work for a company that goes out to exterminate threats. Rogue alien monsters, dangerous humans, etc. Our characters would be partners. Romance can be mixed in as well, but again not required since this one focuses on action. God-Modding is okay in this one.\n\n4) A science fiction/ fantasy adventure. Our characters could be friends going on a hike, or something among those lines, and finds a portal to another world/universe. They go inside and are at a whole different place. They adapt and try to live amongst other alien species or just plants. This one can have romance, but it doesn\u2019t have to. \n\n5) Your idea! Please put it in the PM. \n\nI will be providing a sample of one of my long replies, short replies will simply have less detail. This is to add another check on the list for any possible compatibility. \n\n\nIt was a fresh sight seeing all the employees leaving out the room all around the same time. [REDACTED] was looking out of the window and seeing them leave, looking for any sight of [REDACTED]. He didn\u2019t see her, perhaps she left with them. A feeling of sorrow came to him, but quickly vanished once the knock on the door occurred. His eyes quickly glanced to the door and saw [REDACTED] come in. Of course he would smile and make it obvious he was happy to see her. \n\nShe looked terrible, yet beautiful at the same time. Butterflies once again lightly fluttered inside of his belly. He was always happy to see her.. Well, given he didn\u2019t know why he noticed she seemed more glum so he felt the need to be there for her. He was always a good listener, which was probably one of his greatest attributes. Sometimes, that\u2019s all that some people need: a good listener. One that showed genuine care and interest of their problems, rather than just not making eye contact like a jerk and pretending to listen. No, he would care and be there for her.\n\n[REDACTED] nodded at her statement and quickly went over to get a chair so she can sit down if she wanted. He maneuvers it over to his other smaller desk area and motioned for her to sit. \u201cIt did worry me. I care about you and want to make sure you\u2019re okay. If there\u2019s anything I can do to help, just ask. I\u2019m here for you and want to ensure you\u2019re okay. Sometimes a little talk does the trick, or venting works too. Either way, my services are available to you. And my day is going okay so far. Stupid calls here and there and it would be better once I know you\u2019ll feel better soon. Is there something on your mind? Whatever you wish to talk about, it\u2019ll be off the record and be kept just between us.\u201d His voice sounded caring and concerned. He got another bottle of water from his bag. Two, actually, one for [REDACTED] and one for him. He handed it to her and took a nice swig of his.\n\n\n\nIf you read this in entirely, I thank you as it allows you to know me better to see if we would be compatible. It\u2019s quite an efficient way to check rather than simply wasting time to find compatibility within each other and canceling the role play within a couple of questions to each other or within a few replies of a role play. It can get annoying being ghosted. When it comes to sending me a PM, I will not reply to a \u201cHey.\u201d Or a \u201cI liked your ideas.\u201d I\u2019d rather have a PM that highlights one of my ideas and why you liked it, or simply saying your idea goes good as well. \n\nI\u2019m looking for only one person at the moment. \n\nOnce again I thank you for your time to read this, or the TL;DR,  and I hope you have a good rest of your day. \n\n\n~Frost",

Technology was advancing in leaps and bounds, and all beings mythical and human lived in unity. However, in 2102, that peace was shattered as the world's leaders began to grow greedy causing a war to engulf the realm. With the all the evil, greed, and death scattering atop of the surface, there was a greater evil that lurked below the earth's crust awaiting the day she could seek her revenge and claim her reign. Unleashing an apocalypse of 7 days that so many had thought was inevitable, with mass armies of cursed souls from hell itself lead by the most malicious Sorceress of the Asgardian realm and her lieutenants.\n\n     There were billions of causalities to count by the end of the 7 days, almost all civilians who had lived in the former population centers. The capitals were decimated, leaving them empty and isolated, irradiated for years to come. Rural areas were more fortunate but were still ravaged by the  inevitable fall of society to madness. However upon the end of the 7th day, a Golden Hearted Sorceress created a realm created solely on the imagination of the many books she had read. As an escape for the remaining citizens from the apocalypse she sent them back in time to the early 1900s in a realm with the name of Caerleon. \n\n     It is now the year 1920 and all the citizens of Caerleon are thriving. It is filled with talking animals, mythical creatures, and human beings,  including wars between the Lun\u00e8 Federation, the realms Mafia and the CPD.

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Ironheart, though if you are reading this you may soon know me simply as the Game Master. For the last 2 or so years I have been contructing in detail a fantasy world for both role play and story telling purposes, and,after finally writing a description of this world that I feel does it some justice, I have decided to launch a discord server in which anyone who finds my work interesting can forge their on long term story with their own character and other rpers, as well as make friends and just have an intresting time all together. The world description is below:\n\nMora| How we came to be.\n\nMora was once a dark and desolate place completely void of life. Then one day from the darkness of space fell a blue star. This star impacted with our world and the energy that gave it its blue hue fused with Mora's surface and all the elements within it. The living energy then assumed a physical form, using its power over the elements to meticulously create itself a body. It then became her, the crafter, and as the crafter with her powers would bring our world life and beauty. She would create plants, then creatures and finally she would create us, the dolls. The first four of our kind were born from her physical body and called the Elementals: Phyra, Isma, Proten, and Ignitis. Each represented an aspect of the Crafters personality and possessed a portion of her power, each controlling one of the elements she had fused with, the crafter herself remaining the sole holder of energy. After the Elementals came the more common dolls, born of pod and seed rather then from the crafter herself. At first they remained near the place of their creation, building up a grand city that still stands today. We call it the Origin. After a while however, as their numbers grew they began to move out farther into world were they used their own powers to build new settlements in all directions outward of the Origin but not leaving the island it was built upon for thousands of years. They lived in such peace and prosperity that the island became known as the Oasis and here each doll lived eternally. The peace was not to last however. Unknown to the crafter and her creations, down just below Mora's surface a being had been slowly coming awake since the crafter's descendants and now it made itself known. Enraged by the presence of unwanted guest, the being who we'd name Notin breached the surface and sent up his dark minions who possessed the bodies of living things and used them against us. Valiantly those early dolls took up arms and alongside the Elementals and the crafter held against the threat from the shadows, but Notin\u2019s power was overwhelming and settlement after settlement fell. Thousands of our precursors were lost and the Crafter, with all her compassion and love for her creations chose to sacrifice her physical form to save all life on Mora. Once again pure energy and one with the world she closed the breeches and trapped Notin and his minions below, preventing them from reinforcing their topside comrades and giving us the reprieve we needed to beat the shadows of destruction back and retake our island. After that first big victory, under the guidance of the Elementals, now the wisest and oldest amongst us, we began to expand rapidly so that we could not be so easily overwhelmed again. For the first time we sailed from the Oasis and settled in unfamiliar foreign lands. We established new settlements and restructured our society to be more efficient, assuring our continued existence. The Authority and its caste system was put in place by the Elementals,and the 1st Arbiter, a doll of pure heart and mind was created to head it and govern us and under her and it we began making new dolls and using the process of strand weaving to manipulate their traits, allowing them to better fit into their caste and better fulfill their roles. Once again Doll kind began to thrive, though our war with the remnants of notins cut off forces, left on the surface when the breeches closed, would continue and still continues thousands of years later. Now a days we have managed to come to a point were most us no longer have to fear for our lives on a daily basis. That said, today doll kind is divided more than ever before. The cities outside of the Oasis and their appointed rulers, the Dons, have become largely independent. Without the Crafter we have also lost our ability to live eternally, and even the mighty Elementals have passed as a result in the years since. This mortality has caused newer generations to seek out the endless lives our ancestor had and some have gone as far as to let their minds be taken in Notins grasp in exchange for power and eternal life. He continues to manipulate the minds of dolls from his realm and we continue to lose cities and towns to treachery and deceit from within. Infighting has also become a problem. Some Dons let their egos outgrow their domains and clash with other of their caste, leading to strife and even war between Dolls. \u00a0Their are also those who don't wish to fulfill their duty to their kind and leave the cities were they are born to lead lives of solitude and sometimes crime in the wilds. However the most recent Arbiter, the fifth to rule, has been the most zealous in her efforts to restore unity under the Authority. She has employed symbols like the Eye of the Authority to instil a sense of dread in our enemies and security in our citizens. She has enforced our new and old laws alike with an attitude of ruthlessness and mercilessness. She directs and coordinates our armies with precision and she does not tolerate the arrogance that some dons have allowed themselves to develop. Still, in spite of her efforts, cities on the frontier line continue to fall and the umbral forces continue to come up with new beast and weapons they use to crack city walls and massacre innocent dolls or take over their bodies and use them against us. However things are,we will continue to fight and we will continue to protect our home and civilization until the the last doll is broken.\n\nIf you are interested here is the Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/dJAvQgR\n\nAnd if you'd like to join the greater community being built, we've got Amino and Kim as well!: \nhttp://aminoapps.com/invite/EX2ZFN00OR\n# RpMora\n\n(We need lots of peeps, so please dont hesitate to up vote us below!)",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello reddit! My name is Gambit and I am twenty one years old. I am a roleplayer with about seven years worth of experience and have recently begun working from home. That being said I am looking for new active and committed partners who would like to do a superhero romance role play. I would prefer to do it on Discord and I would prefer that my partner be 18+ as I tend to enjoy more dark and gritty superhero settings. I like it to feel visceral and dangerous a true hellscape which is in desperate need of a hero. \n\nMy time zone is EST and I am usually on Discord all day so I will respond multiple times per day but I don\u2019t expect that from a partner. My preferred pairing would be MxF as I have the most experience with that style. I would prefer to write in a third person past tense style and will match my partners post length. I have a list of original heroes and villains that we can use but I am not opposed to using well known characters as well. I will be playing as my OC and would prefer my partner be an OC as well because it feels less restrictive that way. I am comfortable setting it in the DC universe but I don\u2019t want to follow the canon to the letter as I like to have my narrative freedom. \n\nMy ideal partner would be responsive both in character and out. They would be friendly and understanding with open communication between us. They would like to plan arcs for characters together and not shy away from the collaborative process. If you would like to discuss this more in detail please message me. I have included a sample of the type of stories I liked to tell below. Thank you for your time! Hope to hear from you soon!\n\nWriting Sample\n\nThe Kennedy\u2019s limo arrived and they were swarmed by the reporters who had arrived early to get the best view of the speech. As they stepped out they waved and declined to comment until the ceremony. They were focused on speaking with the kids who would be living in the new facility. The kids all rushed up to them and began to beg the two for a sneak peek of their new home to which they said yes. The staff chased after the kids who had rushed to explore the fancy new building filled with toys and all types of stuff. Alexander laughed as he looked at the pure joy on their face. Today was a good day. \n\nWhen it was time for the speech Alexander and his sister took their places on the stage as the children\u2019s joy could be heard out of the orphanage windows. The sound of the children's happiness set a cheerful tone for the ceremony. He walked up to the microphone and took a deep breath. \n\n\u201cI want to thank everyone for coming here today. This was a project that was near and dear to my heart for many reasons. As all of you know my sister and I lost both of our parents two years ago in a mugging gone wrong. That was an incredibly difficult time for the both of us so we can only imagine how difficult it must be for a child to grow up without a family. That\u2019s why it was important for us to rebuild this orphanage in their honor so that their spirits may live on and watch over the children of Midway like they watched over us. This is my greatest achievement since I have been back and I am glad that the children approve.\u201d\n\nHe stopped and let their laughter fill the air. The crowd laughed and clapped. \n\n\u201cI hope that this orphanage can serve as a symbol of hope to the city of Midway for their future. Most importantly though I hope it serves as a reminder to this city\u2019s children that they are important and they are not worthless. I pray that this place becomes a safe haven for children where they can play and feel safe while they grow and wait to find the perfect family. Kennedy Industries remains dedicated to building more shelters, clinics, and housing for low income families. I personally pledge to continue working everyday to make this city not just a safer place but to be the beacon of hope that it\u2019s people and the world needs. I hope that you all will make the same pledge because together we can create a brighter and safer Midway. Thank you.\u201d\n\nAlexander was stood smiling at the podium alongside his sister who clapped along with the crowd. The screens behind Alexander glitched out and a man in a grotesque mask appeared on the screen. In a heavily creepy modulated voice he addressed the audience. \u201cPrisoners of Midway. You have been observed and judged by forces greater than you could comprehend. This city has been found guilty and tainted with such sin that there is no salvation. The man in front of you is a pretender nothing more than a false messiah and you are all sheep. Nobody can save your city or your families because you do not deserve to be saved. You all worship false idols like the man who stands before you now and Arsenal the city\u2019s self proclaimed guardian. These two insignificant fools have only survived because I allowed them too however today that ends. After months of preparation I am ready to cleanse this city of it\u2019s true disease all of you. Let the purging commence!\u201d The man\u2019s signal cut out as the crowds began to panic.\n\nAlexander opened his mouth to speak. A sound resembling a crack of thunder rang out through the tense air. Alexander crumpled to the ground as Alexandra rushed to his side. She held him in her lap as he bled heavily. Within seconds the orphanage exploded sending debris and flames into the air. That was followed by numerous explosions ringing out all across the city.",

            "selftext": " Hi   there! Cruel here back at it again with yet another terrible idea.  I've been reading up on some Manhwa and a few in particular with a  relatively  similar plot really got me interested in a setting akin to  it. The two  in question, if you're curious are: [I belong to house Castielo](https://www.tappytoon.com/series/ibhcastielo/1) , [Who made me a princess?](https://www.tappytoon.com/series/whoprincess/1) and [Daughter of the Emperor](https://www.tappytoon.com/series/daughterofemp/1).   And as always a little disclaimer: I am 24 years old, LGBTQA+ Friendly   and work on JST Timezones but due to personal reasons I tend to be  awake  at more western friendly hours.\n\nThe  premise of these stories is that a Girl born from a commoner Mother   and a royal/noble Father is taken into the Father's custody after the   Mother departs/passes. Leaving the daughter to suddenly become a   noble/princess who has to suddenly get used to the new treatment,   etiquette of court and the relationship with her new father and family   members. The child slowly grows up and the older she gets the more   political drama comes into play. A secret heir, the daughter, is  revealed at a coming of age ball and this sets different factions into   motion to try and get the girl to be a puppet to their respective  schemes. Attempted marriage arrangements, assassination and so much more can be used in the story!\n\nSo  I would  LOVE to play a setting similar to this, in which I'd take on  the role  of the Girl in question. While also taking care of a bunch of  side  characters, a scenario like this has a lot of characters and while  I'd  be grateful to someone who would be a GM for this story I wouldn't   force anyone into such a role and will gladly take on   Suitors/Maids/Knights/Rivals and so forth  to evenly distribute the   weight of the plot. I would ask that my writing partner would take up   either the Father or Caregiver (a servant or trusted aide of the father)  as main role while also joining in on the side characters.\n\nI  am looking to play this out on Discord or Google Docs, mayhaps a  combination of the two to actively engage in conceptualization and  discussing on where to go next with the story. It CAN involve darker themes but we can also keep it light hearted and fluffy if preferred. \n\nIf this interests you please shoot me a private message, don't reply to this post. And thank you for your time!",

            "selftext": "Hey, /r/roleplay!\n\nI'm looking for someone to play an original Harry Potter roleplay with using (preferably) original characters. I actually enjoy playing against canon characters from the series, but I can't play canons myself. I'm open to playing a variety of situations and settings within the Potterverse, but the scenarios I'm most eager to play would definitely involve Hogwarts as a setting and (probably) student characters.\n\nIf you feel like you'd be interested in this, please hit me up with a message letting me know what kind of RP you'd wanna try! I'm down to play over reddit PMs, Discord, and possibly other platforms if I vibe with you. Peace!",

            "selftext": "My name is Valentine. I'm male and 21 and I quite enjoy playing around with anime ideas I like. Particularly at the moment Naruto is my main interest yet I have some more I quite enjoy if asked, including but not limited to Medaka Box, Hunter X Hunter, Bleach, Dragon Ball, My Hero Acadamia, Gantz, and Overlord, with ideas in mind for most. I will share three ideas from three anime, the most popular to draw in the most people.\n\nI'll start with Naruto. This will either be set post the Chunin exams in part one or in our own seperate timeline at our discretion, where or characters have been hand picked by our village's Kage for a secret mission and are teamed up. While I personally prefer the Cloud and Mist villages to be the subject of this one, we can freely choose between any.\n\nThe second is Bleach. In this idea, the setting will be after the TYBW and if you only watched the anime, I would suggest reading the manga. So after the events of the series new shinigami are needed, we will be new recruits working together to stem the tide of hollows created by the lack of shinigami to counter them.\n\nThe third and final idea is my personal favorite of my Dragon Ball ideas. Being loosely based off of Xenoverse and Dragon Ball Heroes as one of us as an elite Time Patrol member and the other as a student to them. We can vary the reasons as to why, an idea being the immense power of the teacher and potential of the student.\n\nThe possibilities with this idea abound and I would love a creative and intelligent partner to complete any of these ideas or propose ones along the same lines, perhaps add variety or plotlines to what I have in mind.\n\nPlease message me privately to discuss ideas. Thank you very much for reading and I look forward for the responses I may receive. My ideas for the other animes are mostly unformed and would appreciate input. If you would kindly name your favorite anime character in your first message, I would appreciate it.\nI have a kik and a discord with no preference between either.",

I\u2019m back and I got a romance plot for anyone who is interested! \n\nSo it\u2019s biased in modern times, (maybe slightly in the future) and all kinds of fantastic creatures living along side humans and thrive. Due to social norms, its heavily frowned upon to be in a interracial relationship, and having half breeds heavily discouraged. \n\nThe plot would start after a major party(collage or anything ) our characters wake up in bed together and proceed to panic, as we would from two separate races. Normally that wouldn\u2019t be so bad, just chock it up as a one night stand and never see each other again, however the female in the group finds out that she\u2019s pregnant.\n\nFrom there we would grow in to a blossoming couple, dealing with the forbidden nature of our new lives. \n\nIt\u2019s a rough idea, so we can discuss what ever details you\u2019d like ! Just message me if your interested.\n\nOh and there maybe some Nsfw so please 18+",

The vision I have is that of a dystopian future, where the human race had to abandon earth long ago because we destroyed it. Now a tyrannical government controls the new planet, but there\u2019s a rebel government gaining strength and fighting back. \n\nThere would be lots of battles fought on land, in the air, on the water and in space. Other than that basic framework I have very little idea of the final product. \n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\u2022Ability to create or already have a Fandom Account\n\u2022Ability to be in a Discord Server \n\u2022Creative Mind to flesh out the universe \n\nLeave a comment below if you\u2019re interested!",

            "selftext": "Hi  there! Cruel here back at it again with yet another terrible idea. I've been reading up on some Manhwa and a few in particular with a relatively  similar plot really got me interested in a setting akin to it. The two  in question, if you're curious are: [I belong to house Castielo](https://www.tappytoon.com/series/ibhcastielo/1) , [Who made me a princess?](https://www.tappytoon.com/series/whoprincess/1) and [Daughter of the Emperor](https://www.tappytoon.com/series/daughterofemp/1).  And as always a little disclaimer: I am 24 years old, LGBTQA+ Friendly  and work on JST Timezones but due to personal reasons I tend to be awake  at more western friendly hours.\n\nThe premise of these stories is that a Girl born from a commoner Mother  and a royal/noble Father is taken into the Father's custody after the  Mother departs/passes. Leaving the daughter to suddenly become a  noble/princess who has to suddenly get used to the new treatment,  etiquette of court and the relationship with her new father and family  members. The child slowly grows up and the older she gets the more  political drama comes into play. A secret heir, the daughter, is revealed at a coming of age ball and this sets different factions into  motion to try and get the girl to be a puppet to their respective schemes. Attempted marriage arrangements, kidnapping and so much more can be used in the story!\n\nSo  I would LOVE to play a setting similar to this, in which I'd take on  the role of the Girl in question. While also taking care of a bunch of  side characters, a scenario like this has a lot of characters and while  I'd be grateful to someone who would be a GM for this story I wouldn't  force anyone into such a role and will gladly take on  Suitors/Maids/Knights/Rivals and so forth  to evenly distribute the  weight of the plot. I would ask that my writing partner would take up  either the Father or Caregiver (a servant or trusted aide of the father)  as main role while also joining in on the side characters.\n\nI am looking to play this out on Discord or Google Docs, mayhaps a combination of the two to actively engage in conceptualization and discussing on where to go next with the story. \n\nIf this interests you please shoot me a private message, don't reply to this post. And thank you for your time!",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are Dany, Margaery, Sansa, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: Mary Jane Watson, Black Cat, She-Hulk, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp, Mystique and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, Wonder Woman. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, Vetra, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, Rey, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Cassie, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

            "selftext": "Hello, thanks for stopping by!\n\nMy idea is rather simple: Ever played Eador? No? Well, it is a game where you play as a sort-of-deity building up your world from smaller fragments and gather followers, knowledge and power that way. The rest of the setting is rather standard high fantasy fare (but is nonetheless lacking no charm or originality, and is very expansive!)\n\nI'd like to play as one such god in a similar setting, starting from rather humble beginnings and working my way up through the celestial powers through wit &amp; charm. To do this I need a GM willing to RP with me, one who enjoys a player willing to test their creative limits and loves to work on worlds.\n\nMy post style adapts, sometimes I post longer posts sometimes they are shorter, at times you will see me acting linearly and seemingly at random I'd travel to the other end of the galaxy looking for something odd. Rest assured though that I am an ahead thinker (most of the time anyway) and will very often have a plan.\n\nIf you like this idea send me a PM and we can talk more about it. Specially true if you're already thinking you can give the gods exotic shapes, as we're more likely to be a match in that case. \n\nAlso note that we *might* be able to work a more traditional arrangement (with you playing another deity alongside mine), but we would need to be a good match for this to happen.\n\nFinally, thanks for reading my post, polite regards to you.",

I roleplay through email and reply daily or every other day. I'm good about communicating if there's something going on, like me being sick or unable to post for a while, and I'm ditch-friendly, just tell me if you don't want it anymore, and I'll drop the rp, no questions asked.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a partner who is okay with roleplaying through email (plotting can be done through PMs if it's better for you) and replies at least once per week. Decent grammar and at least a couple paragraphs are highly desirable.\n\nThe plot: I'll keep this open, since I like plotting things out with my partner. I'm basically looking to write a queen or princess who's taken captive after her land is invaded and taken over by an invading group or nation, and given to the group's leader as part of his share on everything they've gotten. I'd like her to be given either as a wife or concubine, and for them to slowly develop mutual respect and affection, due to both the way she conducts herself and the way he tries to honor her as a person while still wanting her to do her assigned duties.\n\nNote: I'm more of a 'clean'/safe for work roleplayer, sorry if that's a deal breaker. Just to make it clear, I'm looking for a partner to write the male invader/leader. Thanks in advance for reading and drop me a PM if interested!",

To combat this, the virtual prison was designed. It is a   warehouse of containment pods, filled with prisoners. They are   submerged in liquid before being hooked up to a machine of tubes and   wires, taking their mind to the prison. So, while they\u2019re bodies are   stored away, they are still in prison in their minds.\n\nThe   virtual prison takes pride in making all the inmates feel like they\u2019re   really imprisoned, but because they don\u2019t want to dehumanize them, the  prison does have its own entertainment places and other normal places   from society like salons and places to eat. Here, inmates can interact   during their free time, get a bite to eat, or just watch some tv   imported straight from real life!\n\nThough,   rules are still enforced. If an inmate acts out, the guards will come   and contain them. With or without force. If an accident somehow occurs,   just know that if you die in the virtual prison, you don\u2019t wake up in   the real world either.\n\nSo, please enjoy your stay at the virtual prison! Make some new friends, try some new food and remember\u2026 Don\u2019t act out of line.\n\nIf   you are interested, Dm me please! I will give you a link to the  discord  server! Everyone is welcome, most OCs are welcome as well. All  rules  are on the server and you can ask questions on there was well.",

            "selftext": "Choria is a small village outside of the kingdom of Vasileio in a medieval era. Due to a threat of revolution, the kingdom has become politically unstable and the towns and villages under their protection have been left to fend for themselves. Because of this many of the towns have become lawless lands and are full of bandits and other dangerous threats. Choria is one such village. It is a village of civil unrest hidden away within a valley of erotic fantasies and adventure. The order is loosely held together by the nobles of the valley however even they have become rather lawless. Slaves, servants, commoners, and nobles alike find adventure and pleasure in Choria however recently the village has become more unstable as a group of bandits has made it's home nearby and occasionally raids the village kidnapping people as they see fit for whatever they see fit. It has nobles and commoners both on edge. Some have come to this village seeking adventure, some romance, some simply seek to unwind, while others seek more carnal passions and desires. The choice is entirely up to you.\n\nHere you will have the option to:\n&gt; Partake in a variety of both sfw and nsfw roleplay activities \n\n&gt; Mature server 18+\n\n&gt; Choose a social standing for your character from the following list:\nNoble\nSlave\nServant\nand Commoner\n\n&gt; Meet friendly people and chat without worry of innocent ears\n\n&gt;Contribute to the growth of the server by offering suggestions or shaping lore\n\n&gt;Lots of custom emotes\n\n&gt;A chance to influence future emotes by posting the file for it in suggestions\nand potentially more to come\n\nhttps://discord.gg/wsz9KNn",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm looking for some very casual rp partners that like long term rps, and several of them. I personally have burnout periods where I just can't find the motivation to emote for a good while, so I figure that might as well be at the top of the list as a heads up. \n\nI'm not really looking for a group rp at all, in fact, I'd prefer it if we were to make our own. I would prefer to think of this as a way to build a RP partnership, something that will last for a long while. \n\nI don't expect perfection by any means. I myself am far from perfect, my writing is flawed, and my plots can sometimes become a bit daunting at times simply due to being drawn out a ways. What I do ask for, however, is mature RP. I don't wan't there to be a whole bunch of \"u\" in place of you and things like that, and I don't want it to be completely sex focused. I prefer sex RP events be few and far in between with the sole purpose to be story progression or character development. \n\nI love fantasy, but I've never found myself being able to get into the whole staple of D&amp;D. I prefer creating my own creatures and such, or RPing certain fandoms like DC Superheroes, Fallout, Skyrim, etc.\n\nIf any of you are interested, please do not be afraid to DM me!",

            "selftext": "**H'lo and welcome** to my spontaneous and potentially unorganized rambling RP request. I almost never peak out of my cave in search of new people to lure into my chaotic creative writings, but I'm bored and in search of fresh faces and new material. So...here I am. Wooo.\n\n**Let's get some me-things out of the way** first, because it might be of some importance to those of you with certain preferences. I am an adult. A super-adult. Not because I can summon lightning or toss a car at my rude neighbor, but because I have a full-time job and pay too many bills to count [ok I could count, but it's depressing, you know?] and think about things like 'I should really buy more broccoli instead of pizza' and 'I should probably start working on a retirement plan because who knows if I'll get any social security in a few decades' on a regular basis. I would strongly prefer my writing partner to also be adultish. 18+, if you please. I work the night shift, and it makes an ordinary life exceptionally difficult to maintain, but depending on where you live, that could work in your favor. I'm in the -5 time zone, aka eastern US. The good news is I have 4 days off per week since my shifts are stupidly long. The bad news is, I also have homework [because apparently school never ends?!], so I'm not available the full night when I am off. I have been RPing for ~16 years and have dabbled in fandoms as well as completely original content. My characters have ranged widely between species, ages, genders, dispositions, blah blah... I like variety. That being said, I tend to prefer playing the supernatural, and...usually female, but I have plenty of male characters as well. I even have one that swaps back and forth between genders, because why the heck not? I have played bad guys, good guys, insufferably complex shades of gray guys, good guys that become bad guys, zen guys that don't believe in good vs bad, you name it.\n\n**Now, here's some of my preferences:** like I mentioned already, please be 18+. If you are someone who has a lot of free time and is antsy for several replies every day, you will probably get frustrated with me. As much as I love to RP, I have pesky responsibilities, and my availability isn't always predictable. So, please be patient. I tend to get bored of the more slice-of-life and easygoing plots. Not everything can be dramatic and chaotic and exciting of course, but I need a nice balance to stay interested. Be willing to shake things up. On a related note, I love me some NSFW content. PWP and extravagant gore are not what I'm looking for, but if given a good reason to incorporate a NSFW scene into the story, I will happily own it like a pig in the mud and make no apologies. Very few subjects are taboo for me. I like intensity, emotional conflicts that build character development, plot twists, epic chaos, adventure...and also some silliness. I have Discord, but am flexible if you prefer something else. If there's a specific plot you have in mind that you're itching to try out, I'm all ears. If you want to build something together, I'm also all ears. If you just wanna chat for a while and try to figure something out, then okidoke. Lastly, I need someone with decent grammar and who does more than simply responds; I need someone who can throw their own spice into the mix and help push things forward. You don't have to give me several paragraphs [you can, if you want], but I don't want short little diddies that are like 1-3 sentences, you know?\n\n**Favorite Fandoms**\n\n* Naruto\n* Skyrim/Elder Scrolls\n* Fallout\n* Harry Potter\n* Dragon Age\n* X-Men/Marvel Universe\n\n\nPlease note I am only interested in original characters, if you do request a fandom with me.\n\nFor original content, I admit I've never been super interested in medieval fantasy. Yes I know, that probably sounds weird given that I love Skyrim/Elders Scrolls. I can't make sense of it either. Nevertheless, I strongly prefer a more modern fantasy setting, buuuut...I will hear you out either way.\nAlso, there is an extremely small chance I'll be interested in whatever group RP you have going on, so don't waste your time throwing me an invite.\n\n**Throw me a PM** if it tickles your fancy. Tell me your thoughts, preferences, suggestions, deepest darkest secret, ask me questions, complain about the weather, I don't care...\n",

            "selftext": "In the year 2020, the world burned. Nuclear strikes from Russia, The United States, China, and every other nuclear capable nation glassed half the planet and left the other half to die. Millions of ton of nuclear ash were launched into the atmosphere, plunging the world from heat and fire to a frozen wasteland in a matter of months. Summers rarely see temperatures high enough for liquid water and winters bring frostbite and famine to those unprepared but still, of course, humanity survives.  \n\n\n2046, a small city named Hearthport, on the edge of what used to be Seattle, sits. It's population is small but the people do comparatively well for themselves on account of the thriving ice fishing farms, the trade routes offered by icebreaker ships, and the massive heating tower complex in the center of the city. They sleep in rooms warm enough to not see their own breath and eat enough to stay alive. In these times that's all someone can really ask for.  \n\n\nYesterday though, that heating complex failed in the night and with it took the lives of nearly a dozen people who froze in their sleep because of it. Citizens always have back-up generators and extra blankets at the ready but those things can only last for so long, especially with the approaching winter. To add to these woes, the piece needed to repair the tower is rare and expensive. An insulated fusion core, harnessing the power of the atom to create energy, can not be made without anything except the most advanced machinery and well trained engineers and so a new one must be found, somehow. Somewhere out in the world has to be another fusion core and it's our only chance to survive the coming winter.  \n\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nHello and I hope my little run-down caught your interest. I was hoping to do a bit of an adventure in this frozen world full of peril, danger, and maybe even a bit of romance. You've got to stay warm on those cold nights somehow anyways.  \n\n\n\\-3rd person past tense  \n\n\n\\-18+ only (nsfw topics may come up from time to time, it's a brutal world)  \n\n\n\\-I only use Discord to RP\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I don't expect massive responses every day but as long as we can keep somewhat active I'm happy  \n\n\nIf you'd like to ask some questions or roleplay what I've got don't hesitate to message me with your Discord ID and we can chat there!

Non-shifting humans are dwindling in population, and have been pushed to a far corner of the continent, and are rarely seen leaving the small area, for fear of death. Whether those who leave are at a high risk of being mauled, turned, or otherwise, though a small portion of humans have made a living beyond the protective walls and technology of the Compound, the human's haven.

Beyond the wall, hyper-intelligent animals call themselves the companions of Vir, and every stage of were-shift can be found at any time, many of the Vir choosing to live their entire lives as animals or half-shifted mixes of human and animal.*\n\n\\---\n\nThe Feral Lands is a discord group for roleplay for werewolves/werebears/werecats/whatever you'd like that's looking for new, active members!

The setting has established locations, lore, and plot points for you to use, or you can make your own! We have a world map, factions RPers can join and create, and plots between them for you to play with! We're going to be hosting RP events in the future, which move the plot of the world forward and allow players to jump in and RP with each other, or a narrator!\n\nThere are a few restrictions on character types (for example, we don't allow weredragons and other high-fantasy creatures, and any hybrid creatures are very limited. We also try to keep things like coat colors semi-natural, though markings and splashes of color are allowed!), but for the most part, what kind of character you play is unrestricted and up to you. We're LGBT+ friendly, and active every day!\n\nWe have the option for both group RP anyone can jump into, or private threads can that only be posted in by the people who wanted the thread made. So if 1 on 1 is your more style, you can arrange to start one with anyone there, or jump into the ongoing group RP!\n\nWe have no requirements for activity, number of characters, post length or lit level, so RPers of all kinds can join in! We don't force replies or have time limits on when you need to, but we do allow posters to be skipped in group RPs if they don't reply after 7 days.\u00a0\n\nPop in and say hi! We'd love to have you\\~  \n[https://discord.gg/KEUdqR7](https://discord.gg/KEUdqR7)  \n\n\n[The World Map (large image!)](https://imgur.com/d8gBOFz)  \n",

Though MaeBea is the only pairing I'm interested in rping for it.\n\n**Mass Effect**\\- There is too much to say about ME and I'd be down for getting something together with cannon characters or OCs. Down for most pairings in ME but I'd love to do some M/M pairings with the alien races.\n\n**Bioshock(1-2)**\\- I love Rapture as a setting and the story of the city is interesting to me. I'd love to do something with Big Daddy and/or Big Sister characters.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and please feel free to ask me anything.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'm Duke, I'm a 21 y/o college student in the US, and I've been RPing for a little over several years now. I've been turned off from RP after a few bad experiences in groups, but after nearly a year off I've decided to jump back into the deep end. I'm looking for other literate novella/multi-paragraph style RPers to join me in a Star Wars story I'm writing. I already have a character, and there are prinarily two stories in his life that I'm looking to write out with a partner (possibly three but I'm still working on the last one) and hopefully someone who likes to chat OOC and be friends, and is also 18+ in case of mature themes. This RP is however for those who consider themselves talented writers in 3rd person and are looking for others like them, the biggest requirement is that you have a knowlage and understanding of the Star Wars universe and lore. You of course don't need to know everything but at least enough to write the story.\n\nBoth stories take place soon after the rise of the Empire.\n\n**First prompt** (Looking for male or female partner, or both)\nYou are a child of the planet Cantonica in the city of Canto Bight, and as you had been long abandoned, you did as most others your age had in order to survive. You went to work. Forced into child labor because of your circumstances, rather than steal and cheat your way through life you managed to find a job working as a gardener at the Governor's household. You were raised by the stories of the Jedi, as there were some in the galaxy who still dared to whisper their name, and as such you were filled with a hopefulness that maybe one day you could become one, and perhaps get off this rock and work towards peace in the galaxy, just like the ones in your stories had worked to protect so long ago. Of course that's all they were, stories that people told to try and motivate others to keep working.\n\nThat was until a day came that you were walking down the beach late at night to clear your head, when you stop to look up at the moons and the stars. A smile crosses your face when you think you see a shooting star streaking across the sky, that is until you realize that it's not a star, but a ship burning up on reentry into the atmosphere and is coming straight towards you. You run to get out of the way only for it to sail over your head and crash into the trees behind you. A thought comes to your mind, and that is to scavenge the wreck and take anything valuable you can find and sell it for yourself.\n\nYou rush over and as the flames start to die down, the door opens and blows away the smoke. As you peer inside, you're amazed to see that someone is still alive in there, and something on their belt catches your eye... are those, laser swords?! With mixed emotions you rush to pull the man out of the wreckage as you hear sirens and speeders down the beach, and manage to hide long enough to see the wreck suddenly surrounded by Stormtroopers who start to search the area.\n\nYou have to do something, you can't just leave the guy here. With all your might, you manage to drag him deeper into the forest, to a hideout that you and some other kids you consider friends usually hang out, mostly just a bunch of the other kids who were left to fend for themselves. One of the ones who answer the door is a girl named Jess (name can be changed depending on player preference), who is considered the 'older sister' of the group. She managed to get medical training, and after a bit of convincing, agreed to take him in and tend to his wounds.\n\nYou make sure to hide his lightsabers so they don't know he is a Jedi, and end up getting scared and turning him over. After awhile though, with Jess playing nurse to their injured patients, the majority of the group starts to think he is more trouble than he's worth, after all he is just another mouth to feed. Over the next few days, you and Jess manage to convince the rest of the group to leave him alone, at least until he wakes up.\n\nDuring that time, you sneak out late at night with one of the lightsabers, and pulling it out manage to turn it on, the violet blade bursting forth in front of your eyes. After a moment of amazement, the blade suddenly shuts off and goes flying from your hand, back to the palm of your heavy breathing, and frustrated jedi friend standing behind you. He tells you to forget he even exists, and quickly you start working to convince him that he is to weak to leave yet, and after awhile of your constant yapping he reluctantly agrees.\n\nHe starts helping out around the hideout, and now realizing your dream could be a reality you spend as much of your time with him as possible, bugging him and talking to him almost constantly. After awhile you wake up in the middle of the night and notice he's gone, only to look outside and see that he's leaving towards the city. Silently you follow after him, and when he buys a ticket on a ship off the planet, you stow away after him.\n\nAnd so begins your adventure...\n\n(This story is to play the role of a padawan or aspiring jedi. For anyone interested in the next story, Jess is also a reoccurring character that you can play before going into the second RP.)\n\n**Second prompt** (Looking for female partner)\nAs a child on Cantonica you were given a shit hand growing up, but you managed to push past it and worked towards a better life as a nurse at a young age, and because of your good heart decided to give back to the other kids, and started taking care of them when they got sick, and soon everyone came to love and look up to you. Then one day, one of the kids brought in a man who was really beat up... reluctantly you healed and took care of him, but during that time couldn't help but think he was really handsome and mature. You never would have guessed that he was a jedi until one day a battle erupted at the space port, and he was forced to fight his way off the planet.\n\nAfter that day, life only got harder... the Empire came in force and declared martial law, punishing the city unjustly for 'harboring' a fugitive of the empire. Since that day, your eyes were opened to the true horidness of the Empire, and it inspired you to join the rebellion. Your life wasn't an easy one, and you grew a lot tougher because of it, eventually ending up as the head doctor for a rebel base on a forest planet in the outer rim.\n\nAs you work, tending to your patients like any other day, suddenly the alarm sounds. The first thought going through your mind is that you're under attack, but instead when you open the door you see people rushing out to the blast doors as you can hear them start to open, each person chattering and having these strange looks on their faces, the most common phrase you can pick out amongst the conversation is... \"Hope.\"\n\nYou recieve a call on your communicator to join the acting commander of the base in the ship bay, she has new patients and they take priority. As she is rushed out, she sees a ship burning and covered in blaster fire, and as the doors to the ship open a young kid is rolled out dressed in a rebel uniform with his arm laying next to, not attached to his body. As you go to tend to him the commander stops you, as instead another man is rolled out after him in much more serious condition, covered in blaster wounds. The soldier standing next to him is holding something... are those, lightsabers?!\n\nYou start to take care of him, and get a strange feeling of dejavu as your hands cup his familiar face as he lays on your operating table. You've met this man before, a long time ago in a star system far away. He was the jedi from when you were younger! \n\nYou are charged with his well being, and when he wakes up he is detained by the command, who pleads with him to join their cause, to which he vigorously refuses. He still is however not permitted to leave, and thus becomes a prisoner of the rebel alliance. In your time taking care of him, it sparked something in you that he has to take responsibility for the life you now found yourself in. That because of you taking care of him the first time, caused your home to be decimated by the Empire and any future you might of had there destroyed.\n\nYou spend your time doting on him, however reluctant you may be to do so, and through your conversations learn why he is so opposed to joining the war effort. Your conflicting opinions weigh on each other, but your perseverance eventually wittles away the cold shell that he had built around his heart, getting him to believe that maybe he can make a difference again.\n\n(This story is to play the roll of the doctor and love interest of the character, who after so many years of fighting eventually finds someone to make him whole again.)\n\n**Third possible prompt** (Looking for male or female partner)\n\n(This story takes place before/during the clone wars)\n\nYou are the padawan to a jedi master, a day comes where your master feels great pain, you ask what is wrong and soon discover that a dear friend of his had been killed, leaving behind a padawan of his own. Honor driven, your master also takes him on temporarily as a padawan until he is assigned a new master or until he endures the trials to become a fully fledged jedi knight. Together, the two of you go on adventures and missions throughout the galaxy, maintaining peace where it is necessary.\n\nLater in life the two of you are now jedi knights, and by now the clone wars have begun to unfold. Together the two of you fight until you each become generals in the war effort, having your own ships and platoons once the clones come into play, until the day comes that your dear friend chooses to leave the jedi order and pursue his own path...\n\n(This story prompt is the shortest and least developed, and thus is the most open to build on both sides.)\n\nHopefully you've managed to make it all the way down here! If you have, and any of these ideas interest you, please send me a DM and tell me a bit about yourself, and which idea you might want to write about! I hope to hear from you, and if nothing else...\n\nMay the force be with you.",
