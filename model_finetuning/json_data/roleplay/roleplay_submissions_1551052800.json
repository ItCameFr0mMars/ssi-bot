            "selftext": "Hello there my friends!\nI just wanted to discuss something very serious and important for this subreddit. Finding a good partner is not easy i know and it\u2019s not because there are no good writers it\u2019s just there are too many variables that could ruin it for you. The only thing i hate about this subreddit and I really hate it is how alot of the time it feels unwelcoming. \n\nI have been roleplaying for almost a year and because english is not my first language im only even starting to feel im getting good enough to throw out 2-3 paragraph responses but its still hard. So i will leave it to your imagination how things feel for someone new and i have been there trust me. \n\nThe thing that makes this worse is no one is even willing to point out the mistakes let alone give an advice. Sometimes you act like you are some superior life form just because you know where you can put the comma and then start ghosting immediately. Everyone has potential to be better and learn even in terms of story building and telling no one is just good from the start.\n\nIm not gonna tell you that you should force yourself to roleplay with those people if you don\u2019t want to. But can we please stop things in a better way than just straight out ignoring all messages? Saying im sorry im not interested is better than ghosting. Telling the person you are not interested with a reason is even better. Telling the person you are not interested with the reasoning and things he/she could do to improve is the best. \n\nI know this might be selfish talk for alot of you literature nerds who want Shakespeare himself to write with you but in the end it\u2019s for the better to everyone here to keep more and more people interested until they eventually become good writers.\n\nOfcourse everything i said applies to good story telling too not just good English. And thank you for sticking around with my ramblings. i just wanted to get it out there.",

Me, being nice and not currently busy, says yes.\n\nWe start, they\u2019re non-literate, which I\u2019m okay with, and then they request I use a canon character, which I don\u2019t usually mind being, but it\u2019s the reason that made me a little iffy.\n\nThey said that me being my male OC \u2018ruins the story of their character\u2019 with theirs being the \u2018most powerful and only male gem in all of Homeworld\u2019 which is already a huge red flag, I know. I didn\u2019t want to seem rude, though, so I simply agreed to be the canon character.\n\nWe begin our roleplay, and everything is going okay, but their character is essentially perfect in every way, completely ignoring the facts from the actual show about the Diamonds and such. They apparently have won multiple gem wars singlehandedly, and comes up with instant solutions to every problem in the rp, as well. Plus, they won\u2019t shut up about their edgy past. \n\nI don\u2019t really want to be mean to them or start an argument, but I don\u2019t want to continue this roleplay and I dread receiving any more replies from them, as it feels like a chore. They\u2019ve completely sucked the fun out of the roleplay for me.\n\nI\u2019ve dug myself into a hole, I know, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to say I don\u2019t want to rp with them anymore. Do ghost them? Pretend I\u2019m dead (seems like the better option at this point lmao)? If you\u2019re experienced in this sort of thing, please help.  ",

With a thriving populous, a economy, active trade with nations, and expanding all around their borders, it seems like nothing could go wrong. For all of it's good qualities however, there is unrest, with many evil groups in play in order to break apart and take control of this great nation...\n\nSplits in the senate cause tension and unrest between those with traditionalist values and reformists who strive to remake Daxusia in their vision.Conflicts between noble houses increases unrest tenfold, as many come from roots of the common man, while other wish to keep a hierarchy and retain a pure nobility.A sudden marriage followed by a illegitimate child causes many to be worried, with fears of outsiders taking over.Divisions in class causes anger and fear between those from no noble standing, and from those that came from the highest..May the gods save Daxusia.\n\nFeaturing:\n\n\\- Documents and information for different things.In the server, there are many different channels that describe how Daxusia works. One channel describes culture, and the different gods that a person could worship. Another channel contains a document that explains the military in detail, including structure, weaponry, and formation.\n\n\\- A variety of roles to choose from.In the server, a variety of different jobs are available for someone to pick! Whether it could be a senator, making their mark within the Daxusian Senate. The option to play a person of nobility is also presented, where you can start off gradually unnoticed by many, until before long you become a great influence in the nation than you were before. Alternatively, the militaristic option is available as well, with soldiers and officers dealing with expanding and defending the great empire.\n\n\\- A Changing World.Every so often, the storyline of the server is expanded upon, with events being set up in order to add more flavor to the world around us, and to allow character development, set up for future scenarios, or even completely change the server!\n",

            "selftext": "Welcome to the Virtual Prison. The year is 3086, prisons became too much of a hassle for people as they would fill with people and begin to take up too much space. To combat this, the virtual prison was designed. It  is a warehouse of containment pods, filled with prisoners. They are submerged in liquid before being hooked up to a machine of tubes and wires, taking their mind to the prison. So, while they\u2019re bodies are stored away, they are still in prison in their minds.\n\nThe virtual prison takes pride in making all the inmates feel like  they\u2019re really imprisoned, but because they don\u2019t want to dehumanize  them, the prison does have its own entertainment places and other  normal places from society like salons and places to eat. Here, inmates can interact during their free time, get a bite to eat, or just watch some tv imported straight from real life!\n\nThough, rules are still enforced. If an inmate acts out, the guards will come and contain them. With or without force. If an accident somehow  occurs, just know that if you die in the virtual prison, you don\u2019t  wake up in   the real world either.\n\nSo, please enjoy your stay at the virtual prison! Make some new friends, try some new food and remember\u2026 Don\u2019t act out of line.\n\nIf you are interested, Dm me please! I will give you a link to the discord  server! Everyone is welcome, most OCs are welcome as well. All rules  are on the server and you can ask questions on there was well.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHey there! Thanks for reading! I am an adult male in my 20s who has been roleplaying for about a decade now, and I'm looking for a literate, adult partner who wants to do a long-term, GMed roleplay in an original superhero world! My ideal roleplays are long-term, complex, with a cast of characters. I like stories that contain a little bit of everything. Action, drama, suspense, mystery, romance, comedy, whatever! \n\nI've done a little world building in my head for a superhero world that I've been dying to play in. With me as the GM, I would guide you through this world full of superheroes, supervillains, and all sorts of fun stuff. You would play as a new entrant into the super scene. Someone who develops powers just as the story begins. Do you become a hero? A villain? Straddle that grey area and use powers for personal gain? That's all up to you! You take whichever path you want, and I'll play the world around you as it reacts to your decisions.\n\nMy preferred platform for roleplaying is Discord. I anticipate this roleplay being long-term, with a large cast, and I find that Discord is the best for keeping track of those sorts of things. I would also prefer any partners to be over 18, just so we're covered in case adult content appears in the story. It's something I'm certainly open to and enjoy, but it's not my major focus for this roleplay. I also enjoy OOC chat, both talking about the roleplay and world building together, and just talking about life. None of that's necessary, of course, if you're strictly business, but I'm open to it.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd love to hear from you! Being that GMing is a lot of work, I may not be able to roleplay with all of you, but I'll do my best to delete this or otherwise indicate when I'm not looking for partners. So if you see this and it says \"Still-looking\", then shoot me a message and we'll talk about getting something set up! Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello friend!\n\nI\u2019d love to find someone for a long term role play involving a hunter tracking down and killing the terrors that go bump in the night (werewolves, vampires, ghosts, demons). I\u2019m hoping that this would be done with me playing the monster and you playing a hunter/huntress or both of us playing hunters tacking down these beasts together.  The two hunters works better if you prefer there to be some level of romance or romantic interest playing out in a sub plot. If there isn\u2019t really much of a need for romance, then story could just be about the beautiful marriage between your character\u2019s wooden stake and the heart of my vampire. \n\nI\u2019ll continue to use a vampire as my example. I believe it\u2019s probably the most common and different monster amongst the different stories. Hopefully there will be some level of collaboration between the two of us about what type of vampire I\u2019d play. Vampires have a wide array of weaknesses and strengths through the copious numbers of stories. Depending on the level of darkness we\u2019d both like to see played out makes the type of vampire important. It could be a vampire that splashes a handful of glitter in his face before leaving the house every morning or a horrendous beast hiding away in his caverns waiting to feed. Can he turn into a bat, reign the fires of hell down from the heaves, burn into a fine dust in contact with direct sunlight, or requires to get permission before entering a room? There are quite a few different possibilities for a monster that goes under the same name as his brethren from other stories. \n\nAs for me and what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019m a male in my late 20s and I prefer to play in the third person. I can do the first, but I find the third to be a more enjoyable experience. Discord or Reddit private messages would be my first choice for communication. E-mail is perfectly fine too. I\u2019d just prefer to not use something that is strictly mobile. \n\nI\u2019m hoping to find someone that puts some effort into their replies. I was never an English major and I don\u2019t expect you to be. At least use a few periods and capital letters though. Write like you\u2019re trying to put forth your best effort and I\u2019ll be perfectly happy with whatever you churn out. Ideally I\u2019d like to try and shoot for somewhere in the 2-4 paragraphs per response. I have an example of my own writing in my profile if you\u2019d like an example of my story telling. \n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey! I\u2019m glad this post caught your attention, and I hope you like the idea! Before I get to that, I want to say a little about myself:\n\nI\u2019m a college student, and I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about 7-8 years. I usually roleplay in 3rd person, but depending on what you/the group decides, I am not entirely opposed to switching over to 1st person roleplay. I\u2019ve done a *wide* variety of roleplay, but as of recently I have a specific itch I\u2019ve been trying to scratch! \n\nThe idea is as follows:\n\nOur story takes place in a vivid, diverse world, filled with an abundance of life and different civilizations. I\u2019ll flesh out the details of the backstory on the discord server (or in pm\u2019s, if you\u2019d like), but for brevity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll give the basic overlay. Basically, Imperia, the most powerful empire in the region, has just fallen as the result of an incredibly idealistic, \u201cagainst all odds\u201d, democratic revolution, sending shockwaves throughout the world. Some nearby kingdoms view this power vacuum as an opportunity to expand their hegemony and become the new world superpower, while others view this revolution as grounds for measured, incremental reforms to ease any calls for revolutionary change within their own borders. \n\nHowever, the fall of Imperia also meant the fall of the Swordmages, an order of magical spellblades who fought against an unknown, primal evil locked deep away in the uncharted edges of the world. As the new Republic seeks to navigate the political complexities that come with governing a country, and seek to establish order in the face of violence, anarchy, and general instability, can they survive both the dark evil powers of an unknown magic AND the greedy, imperialist motivations of their royal neighbors?\n\nNow, as for what I\u2019m looking for:\n\nI have a few roles I would like filled - these roles come with a VERY vague backstory that offers a lot of creative room, and sometimes even an optional reference picture or two should you need it/don\u2019t feel like looking for a different one. Basically, I\u2019m going to list out a few roles/names (all names can be changed, too). It is up to YOU, to pick which character seems most interesting however, and to choose who the character is in terms of personality, how their motivations manifest themselves, the details of their backstory, etc. Without further ado, here are the characters I\u2019d like!\n\n\u2022Aadya Salif (remember, all names can easily be changed if you don\u2019t like them): the MOST important character!! she\u2019s the love interest to my own character, and also has probably the most creative space when it comes to who she is. All that matters is that she, along with my character, founded a small village/safe haven/sanctuary thing far away to shelter those from war. During the revolution, the sanctuary was destroyed because of some larger conspiracy/attack that will become revealed at a later time. Somehow, Aadya ends up hundreds, thousands of miles away from the wreckage, but alive. Both my character and Aadya think the other is dead, as all they know is that the sanctuary is destroyed. on top of everything else going on, they have to somehow make it back to one another.\n\nLysander Achilles - The great general and living legend of the revolution, probably one of the greatest warriors alive. he\u2019s accomplished incredible feats during the revolutionary war, and has become synonymous with the invincible rage of the younger generation and revolutionary movement.\n\nLanaver Melisande - the last and greatest of the Swordmages, he alone knows the threat that is coming and must choose to either work with unlikely allies to defeat it, or take his chances alone\n\nOliver Caarvalis - renowned philosopher and warrior monk, the greatest martial artist alive. a former member of the sanctuary, must struggle to rebuild his life/find meaning in a world torn apart by violence. he can either work with my character, or aadya, depending where he is, to try to rebuild the sanctuary/save the world \n\nAja Nadeau - the deadliest killer on the planet, probably (ignoring the evil, dark threat that is), Aja was the personal killer for the royal family. in a desperate duel throughout the royal palace, Lysander is barely able to kill her. Except, she is resurrected, coming back as a vampire. With her newfound vampiric strength, she\u2019s probably unstoppable and seeking vengeance. Very deadly.\n\nThese are the characters I have in mind, so far! While a lot of them are vital, feel free to also approach me with your own specific ideas! Like I said, I\u2019m trying to offer as much creative freedom as possible, while still maintaining the general vision I have in mind for the roleplay. \n\nThat being said, I know that was a lot to read, and I thank you!! If you made it this far, feel free to dm me WITH:\n\n\u2022which role/character interests you the most\n\u2022your favorite ice cream flavor \n\nand I\u2019ll be happy to add you on discord!!\n\nThanks again, really appreciate it, and hope to see you soon!!",

            "selftext": "Hello fellow denizens of r/Roleplay! I am a 28-year-old husband to an amazing wife, and the father of a little boy who just had his first birthday! Despite a busy schedule with my wonderful family, I am often stuck at work (I job I despise, really) with a lot of free time on my hands. So, during work hours I enjoy roleplay and chatter to pass the time and ease the soul-crushing drain of my workplace! If you care to know about my hobbies, I tend to write fiction, play video games, watch/listen to all sorts of shows/podcasts, play airsoft, and take random online courses to learn new things! Anyway, let's get to the stuff relevant to roleplay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following is what you can expect from me as a roleplaying partner:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Active** \\- I will be present with strong consistency on weekdays from 7:45 AM - 3:30 PM EST. Outside of these times I might only check posts occasionally. Weekends are tough for me given how busy I am, but at requested I will make an appearance if only to drop one post. That said, if I am super into what we are doing, I may make some time to post after my listed hours.\n* **Friendship** \\- OOC, you and I can chatter as much as you want! I fully support friendship with my roleplay partners.\n* **Quality** \\- On average I post anywhere from 3-5 paragraphs. This can vary significantly based on the situation and that which I am provided in my partner's post. I can furnish a writing sample for potential partners upon request.\n* **Collaboration** \\- Do you have ideas that are similar to what is listed below? Do you have a plot you'd like to run by me because it may be a good fit for our shared interests? Would you like to see certain canonical things bent or changed in your favorite fandom? Feel free to tell me! I greatly enjoy collaboration, and I love finding compromise. My foremost goal is that we both enjoy the RP we've built together.\n* **Flexibility** \\-  I can double (though I don't always enjoy it), and I can play most genders and orientations, so feel free to make a request. I strongly prefer to play male characters and play them in MxF pairings, but please do not let this deter you. Good writing is made of all combinations and must always be considered.\n* **Understanding** \\- Life happens! I will always attempt to warn you of an impending disappearance or hiatus. If I lose interest or find our writing incompatible, you will be informed.\n* **Mature** \\- I have been roleplaying for over seventeen years and as such I've had a lot of time to make my mistakes and learn from them. No topic or content is taboo in my book. Good writing comes from variety and flavor; sometimes taboo is a good spice!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that you know a bit about what you can expect from me, allow me to list what I expect/prefer in my partners:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Activity** \\- I don't expect you to be around as frequently as I am, but I would enjoy at least a post a day Monday through Friday.\n* **Quality** \\- I firmly believe that the length of a post is not indicative of it's quality. That said, I doubt one or two lines will provide the necessary amount of plot advancement or detail I need to make my own quality post. I don't expect a Steven King novel from my partner every day, but please leave me something to work with! Please note that as we start out, I may request a writing sample from you due to some recent issues with writing compatibility (I'm not looking for the next George R. R. Martin, I promise!)\n* **Maturity** \\- I would ask that all of my partners be eighteen years of age or older. Playing outside my age range can be difficult as it is, I've made it as open as I feel I reasonably can. Please respect this expectation.\n* **Flexibility** \\- I would appreciate a partner who is willing to play canon characters with original characters. In return, I am willing to double if it is what you require.\n* **Understanding** \\- As mentioned above: life happens. If you need to take a leave of absence or simply do not enjoy our roleplay, let me know! There won't be any hard feelings because enjoyment for both of us is important. If we can't work something out, we can go our separate ways.\n* **Detail** \\- As much as I hope you include detail in your writing, I also expect that you know how to pay *attention* to them. From what I have read, people often just skip to the bottom of these without reading through the expectations section. If you have actually gone through all of this, please put the italicized word from this section (the \"Detail\" section) in your message to me. Thank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Note**: As mentioned above, I require that potential roleplay partners provide a writing sample upon request. Writing incompatibility is problematic for me, and should we be incompatible as partners I would prefer to save us both time and effort. If you are unwilling to submit a sample when it is requested, I will not be able to carry on with our partnership. Also, as an additional side note, please be aware that I am not fond of photographic face claims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of fandoms I would be interested in roleplaying in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Ace Combat Zero/4/5/6/\n* Bakemonogatari\n* Bloodborne\n* Boku No Hero Academia (My Hero Academia)\n* Borderlands 1/2\n* Dark Souls III\n* Dead Space 1/2/3\n* The Division\n* Dragon Age: Inquisition\n* Exalted (Tabletop RPG)\n* Fire Emblem Awakening\n* Fire Emblem Fates\n* Fire Emblem Heroes\n* Future Diaries\n* God of War (2018)\n* Halo Series\n* Horizon Zero Dawn\n* IT\n* League of Legends (And LoL AU's!)\n* Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Hyrule Warriors\n* Left 4 Dead\n* Mass Effect Series\n* Metal Gear Solid Series\n* Metro 2033/Last Light\n* Neon Genesis Evangelion\n* NieR: Automata\n* Overwatch\n* Resident Evil Series\n* RWBY\n* Scott Pilgrim Versus The World (Comic)\n* Titanfall 2\n* Valkyria Chronicles 1&amp;4\n* Warframe\n* Warhammer 40k\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not least, let's chat a bit about original settings and plots! I am interested in just about any genre and/or setting, but my favorites are: *medieval fantasy*, *science fiction*, *science fantasy*, and *modern fantasy*. If I had to put something at the bottom of my list, it would be *slice of life*. While I am *open* to slice of life roleplay, it takes a really good idea to interest me. In any case, I have plenty of original ideas floating around. Rather than post them here, however, I would rather see what interests we share and go from there! Working together with my partner to come up with something we both like is one of my favorite parts of roleplay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, that's all from me. Thank you so much for reading, and I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "This will be geared more towards trying to find a good long-term partner rather than a roleplay itself. I hope to give you everything you need to make an educated choice if I would fit as a good partner.\n\nA little bit about me: I started roleplaying when I was way too young being taken advantage of by someone way too old. I loved it at the time and I didn't even realize what was happening but I was falling in love with writing, being different characters in different situations, living different lives in different places. I spent way too much time writing the clich\u00e9 boring old smut plots that everyone seems to hate (I know don't judge me) Since then I have evolved, learned and gained better taste. I do not regret what I used to do as it helped me become who I am today and if I may say so I've never heard a complaint on the r rated theme. I will state off the bad I do enjoy r rated themes I'm not pushing, demanding, or asking for them.\n\nI started off roleplaying in a quick-firing sort of way and it spoiled me. I have a harder time trying to do the forum sort of reply when you can style but I do my best. I love getting into the roleplay and hyped in the moment, experiencing it like reading a book or watching a movie. It's such an addicting experience and I find during in the forum style I don't get as pulled into it. I'm open to whatever at the moment I'm not demanding quick-firing but I'm also not willing to take those who are so busy they can only reply once a week, not to sound too demanding.\n\nI've always appreciated time and how important it is. We should all value our time which is why I always look for mature partners with good communication. Unless you completely hate my writing there is absolutely nothing we can't work out together and I mean it, I'm as easy going as they come. I dislike those who can't speak their minds and explain what is wrong and why. I know not everyone has a firm understanding of themselves and I feel like I'm able to explain myself (in most situations) very well and articulate but someone likewise would be nice. We are mature adults I can handle negative feedback as long as it's done with a little class.\n\nIt's also important for me to not be the side roleplay, the one you reply to when you are waiting for the big main to reply. I'm not going to be that guy, I refuse it. If you are looking to just fill your roleplays up please keep looking. I love when a partner appreciates what I wrote, easiest way to hook me into a story or make me smile is just letting me know you enjoyed the previous reply. Perhaps I'm a little needy? Ha.\n\nI can post as much as you, I tend to post at least a paragraph each and every response I do not do shorter than that. I've done post that's been well over the 1k word mark but I'm not setting a requirement. As much as I love long replies they have to be a really good story! I'm sure we can find a medium sweet spot. \n\nI'm looking for someone who likes a fair share of different themes, relationships, experiences, plots, etc. I don't want to be stuck doing the same old play or the same old character. I absolutely love romance and its a major theme in all my plays. I've done my fair share of simple romantic roleplays and I do love them. \n\nIf you want simple slice of life roleplays I'm your guy, if you want longer, deeper with a rich story and vast world I'm still your guy. I like romance in anyway I can get my hands onto it. Romance must be a theme as long as the roleplay has that I'm completely open to whatever it is we do. Long-term, short-term it's all good! You will never get stuck doing the same thing with me.\n\nI feel like I'm good at build up, dialogue and getting into a character's mind and feeling who they are. I'm not as good at fantasy settings (willing to do them) Nor am I great at grammar, you probably notice me using the wrong word hear ;) and there it will happen. I do my best, if you haven't had a major issue with this message then you shouldn't have a problem in a roleplay. I'm human and I tend to live in the moment, I do not obsesses for hours over my replies making it 100 percent perfect. \n\nIt seems like I'm either really well liked or ghosted really quick, or liked for a week and ghosted? I'm not sure why but there it is. I'm hoping to make it past the week point with someone (crosses fingers) I do feel like I don't push for replies, if I haven't heard from you I will ask, especially if we just started talking but I don't hound. I'm mature and I understand everyone has lives and such. \n\nAs of right now I'm pretty open with what to do I have no aches or urges so talk to me and maybe we can stir something up together. I would love to find a partner for a simple romance plots. I'm in my comfort zone when it comes to modern, romance, slice of life, character building but I'm more than happy to step outside my comfort zone with you. If you have a problem with something please speak up.\n\nWe can work the rest out in private! I hope to hear from someone! Lets create some love. \n\n\n\n",

I really want to \"make my own part\" for lack of a better less embarrassing term. \n\nThe only road block in my path is... Well, I can't seem to write a protagonist that I'm happy with. Plenty of wonderful sounding ideas for villains, both minor and major, Bros to team up with and even some overarching plots that I feel are rather unique even by JoJo standards. \n\nAnyways I'm looking to shack up with people that love Jim Jim audacious escapades as much as I do. I can make most anything work outside of that honestly. \n\nIf you want to give it a go then PM me and at some point next week we can start up the trial period that consists of the intro to one of my favorite story ideas.

            "selftext": "My name is Valentine. I'm male and 21 and I quite enjoy playing around with fantasy roleplay. It is my favorite genre in fiction, most simply put. So over the years I have been roleplaying, I have come upon some ideas that do well, I will give a brief summary of each. If an idea interests you, or you see possibility in one, I hope to talk to you. I prefer to do third person but I can do first, I'm very open schedule wise and flexibility wise, so talking about issues on either should be addressed directly if we have any.\n\nThe Prince's War.\nThere is yet another war ravaging Cenaria. Being the mixed culture, trading hub and center of the continent leaves one's nation open to attacks. The Godking of Khalidor to the North, where the cold, mountainous lands produce minerals and glorious flowers to support their trade with others, a culture the other developed countries view as barbaric, and a misogynist leader, seven princes set to kill each other to take the throne... what could go wrong? You will be playing as a 'spoil' of war, taken to be a servant in the great castle to serve one of these princes.\nThis story has dark themes, magic plays a large part and political issues as well, so be warned if this idea interests you.\n\nThe Heir and their Guardian.\nYou just wanted to help your people. The entire empire of Tharizdun, the continent of Pharsee long ago united as one has begun to crumble. Enemies to civilizations appear in each country below your ill father's reign, your mother dead mere months ago and with no way to help in court you do what you think is best. Against the advice of everyone you know, even your companion, you flee to help the people yourself, only your ally at your side. Your bodyguard, your truest friend and fiercest protector.\nThis idea is based on a D&amp;D setting I have been designing and I made quite of bit of backstory to build up the world and it's state of affairs to build up the setting. You don't need to know D&amp;D to choose this idea, of course.\n\nA God and His Aide.\nThe universe was built in a flash, and you were at my side to witness my creation. Your entire being was afloat outside, a spirit wandering the planes until I found and picked you out of your languid existence. Being a god has it's issues and being less than omnipotent is impractical to each over a full, living universe especially with a council full of High Gods who far outdate myself, rating my performance and considering my actions.\nI know this idea seems a bit wild, but I hope some people pick this one. It's the most unformed idea currently listed and I would be more than hapoy to explore what I could do with this.\n\nPlease message me privately to discuss ideas. Thank you very much for reading and I look forward for the responses I may receive. My ideas for the other are mostly unfinished and would appreciate input. If you would kindly name your favorite dessert in your first message, I would appreciate it.\nI would much prefer to roleplay on Discord.",

When it comes down to roleplay and post length I don\u2019t except paragraphs just enough for me to bounce off, otherwise the roleplay would fall flat.\n\nIf this sounds like your cup of tea please send me a message, or if this prompt has interested you at all, please just send a message.\n\n",

My reddit may look barren, but I have been role-playing on and off for over a decade now! I'm 29, female, in the Eastern time zone in the US. I work in a retail setting, so my availability varies, but I am always transparent with when I'll be around and when I'll be busy. \n\n\n\nI'm looking for a partner who will being playing male opposite my female character. Your own gender doesn't matter to me, so long as you're a cool person :) I am also looking for someone who is 21+, because of adult themes as well as just just chatting outside story, I like to be able to relate to my partners. Not that it is impossible with people 18-21, but it is a hurdle. That being said, I won't automatically deny anyone 18-20, but I am strict on 18+. Do not contact me if you are not 18 or older. Adult themes almost certainly will be present, and I'm not gonna play that game with minors. Finally, I roleplay on discord. It is simple to use, can be used in both mobile and desktop, and you can cultivate channels to keep chat, story, and references all in one place! You can message me here on reddit and if we pair up well we can exchange that information later. \n\n\n\nOkay, on to the fun part! What am I looking for you might ask? Well, I am open to many ideas! I want some semblance of romance in the story, I'm a sucker for it and I'm not even sorry. But setting and the relationship between our characters is more open!\n\n\n\n~Medieval - Fantasy or not\n~Modern - Fantasy or not, though I generally lean towards not\n~Future - Definitely my third choice for the 3 time periods, but if you have a good idea for a plot I'm listening!\n\n\n\nActual pairings can be discussed privately, but I have and am open to many ideas, just shoot me a message! \n\n\n\nOn top of that, the romance doesn't have to be the only, or even the main focus of the plot, so long as it is present! I'm certainly open to ideas, so message me, and let's start a conversation!\n\n\n\nP.s. If this looks like garbage I apologize, I'm posting from the mobile app and I'm unsure if the formatting will translate... \ud83e\udd1e",

This village was aptly dubbed: Amegakure, the Village Hidden in the Rain. As war raged on between these surrounding nations during the First Shinobi World War, Amegakure defended itself admirably, and accepted hundreds of war refugees. Once the war came to a close and the Tailed Beasts were divvied up between nations, the world was in a state of depression. Everyone had to recover from the brutalities war put upon themselves and their enemies.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this time, Amegakure found prosperity. The refugees made homes there, importing their families from villages afar. The seemingly instinctive nature for innovation and ingenuity had already formed, with advancements in ninjutsu and technology coming along every year. As rumors began infecting the rest of the shinobi world, men and women from all over couldn't help but see for themselves.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next decade, Amegakure rapidly matured. Its population tripled every year, causing mass expansion of the village itself. The amount of innovation in all forms continued, giving Amegakure things such as: universal electricity, home phones, and basic television. The idea of \"The Amegakure Dream\" naturally birthed, meaning anyone could come and make a name for themselves in the world's most exciting city.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, Amegakure has become the pinnacle of culture, wealth, and prosperity. Some major clans have headquarters within the city, and many nationalities, or clans, have formed areas familiar to home. A large criminal company, named Iryoku, has imbedded itself in the city's nightlife and corrupted many village officials. There has been no better time than **now** to become a shinobi and make a name for yourself, will you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://discord.gg/Hnd7KV](https://discord.gg/Hnd7KV)",

If you're interested in playing Muse B, please let me know! \n\nMuse A is the child of wealthy man living in a seaside town; they\u2019ve always been afraid of the sea, yet oddly fascinated by it. When Muse A was a child, the ship they were sailing on was attacked by pirates and they were barely able to escape. Although the lure of the sea has always been there, Muse A has since refused to ever board another ship. Several years after their brush with pirates, in the dead of night, a suspicious ship sets anchor a little ways away from shore. Pirates make landfall and begin to pillage and plunder the town. The militia stationed in the town are quick to react and a fierce battle breaks out. With the perfect distraction created, the captain of the ship, Muse B, heads for the most opulent-looking manor.   \n\n\nMuse B breaks in to Muse A\u2019s home and begins to raid Muse A\u2019s late mother\u2019s jewelry. In an attempt to stop Muse B, Muse A steals one of their father\u2019s swords and holds the pirate at sword point. Since Muse A has never had any kind of training, they are easily overpowered by Muse B. Upon taking a closer look at Muse A, Muse B decides that they are worth far more than any bejeweled trinkets. So Muse B offers a proposition; in exchange for ending the bloodshed and leaving port, Muse A must come aboard Muse B\u2019s ship as a captive. Muse A is terrified, but they are kind-hearted and wish to protect their town, so they reluctantly agree. So now Muse A must face their fears and leave their life behind. How will they fare and what will their relationship be like with Muse B? ",

It's worth millions for a simple painting of city filled with fairies, orcs, elves, goblins, humans, much like your world but with a steampunk like twist and a freezing cold winter. Nothing too spectacular. Right? There must be a reason it's worth so much. But before you could question anything it's too late and the moment you get near you the canvas find yourself being pulled towards the painting by an odd force. Before anything else happens everything fades to black. Soon you awake to a cold cave, nothing like the one you were in, similar confused looking people like yourself with you. You are all in a cell with handcuffs made of bronze, aka an anti magic material. The cave was filled with pipes and metal, the scent of oil was overwhelming. It suddenly dawns on you that you are inside the painting. And something doesn't feel right about this world. ",

I have been RPing for 17 years now (Since the time of the Yahoo Instant Messenger RPs!...before they got rid of the user rooms).\u00a0\n\nI have been searching for someone who can Roleplay as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. But heres the catch. I use an Original Character...but fear not! I don't make Mary Sue characters and I have been working on a full bio for my OC that I use just for the Dragonball franchise. It would be post Frieza Saga and go off in an Alternate Universe (no Trunks and the androids will probably come but it'll end up different) and it WILL be a romance! With action and adventure. Fights will be slightly included but if it gets too long we can time skip and try to figure out who is the winner between the characters.. Any more questions about this don't be afraid to ask me!\n\nNow, Rules... I am pretty lienient when it comes to Roleplays. Some literacy is a MUST. Of course we all make grammar mistakes (I know I make quite a bit as I look at myself typing this out lol). I do Semi paragraph to multi paragraph replies and starting posts as well full of detail. I would hope and wish that someone out there would be willing to do the same. also, this is in 3rd person. This will be romance like I have stated..but if you need to do a time skip through the lovey dovey bits please dont hesitate to tell me and we can time skip. Also...please DO NOT GOD MOD. its annoying.. Also...PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I know real life gets in the way and I'm understanding of that (trust me I work 40 hours a week I understand lol) I LOVE fast repliers they make me really happy trust me. If you get uninterested please just let me know I wont be mad I promise. also..PLOTTING. I love to plot out an idea that you might have or I might have before installing it into the RP. also about my OC I can tell you alot more about her if you are interested and I can even supply artwork of her as well.\n\nWell that seems to be the lot of it! I think I remembered everything...I hope I remembered everything lol. But please if you are interested hit me up with a PM or comment here and please don't be shy to ask me questions! I am always happy to answer any questions regarding everything I'm looking for. I hope I hear from someone!! Thanks!\n",

I\u2019d say the only real \u201chuman\u201d element is that the pack would speak to each other as if they were human, I don\u2019t envision any magic, mutations, odd colours, wings, ect.\n\nIve always found the pack life compelling, the social hierarchy, the combat scenes, even the characters finding of a mate (No sex scenes though, just the essence of a relationship in this atmosphere)\n\nBe nice to sit down with a few people to discuss a simple story arc for the pack, or even a one on one is fine too. I prefer to play female.\n\nRequirements; \n- Will still have mature themes, so would be seeking 18+ members.\n- Discord is fine. Google Docs is fine. Both is fine. Happy to adjust to what works best.\n- Good spelling and grammar, ect.\n\nPM me :3\n\nAD x",

It was recently created, so there\u2019s not much to the server just yet as there\u2019s little people, but we hope to expand that by making this post! Our plot is still in development and our roleplay just barely started, but with the addition of a few people the server can kickoff once more. \n\nSo far, the current canon characters are:\nPeter Parker\nPeter Quill\nThor\nand Hope van Dyne\n\nOCs are allowed, but with the small amount of canon characters they are preferred over OCs as of right now. \n\nWe hope you\u2019ll stop by and enjoy our small group, and possibly make it bigger.

            "selftext": "In the kingdom of Igrathea, there exists a prophecy held sacred by its people. It is the prophecy of Ophelemet, an ancient God that is dead to the rest of the world. It is said that Ophelemet was the only God to ever live among the humans, having descended from the heavens to be worshiped by them but instead finding himself in awe of the creatures he once sought to preside over. The God fought for the humans in the land that would become Igrathea-- his actions helped turn this land into a prosperous kingdom. He provided the people with rain and bountiful harvests, drove off invaders, built homes for the people, and created an era of lasting peace for the Igratheans. According to legend, Ophelemet never returned to the heavens to be with his divine family-- he even married a mortal woman and had a child with her. Ophelemet loved the people of Igrathea, and the people of Igrathea loved him. \n\nThey asked for the God to serve as their ruler and king, but he refused-- he wished not to rule over the people as a God. The people continued to ask him again and again, begging and begging for him to serve as their God-King. After a long time, Ophemelet finally agreed... With a single stipulation. If he were to role, he would give up his Godhood and rule as a mortal. If he and his people would not live in equal social roles, he wanted them to at least live as equal creatures. Creatures of flesh and bone, creatures with expiration dates. The people of Igrathea were anxious of this idea-- if their God gave up that which protected their kingdom and allowed it to prosper, what if the kingdom failed. The soon-to-be-mortal God assured them, however, that Igrathea was not a wonderful kingdom because he watched over it-- he watched over it because it was a wonderful kingdom. This eased the minds of the people, but they still feared for an emergency requiring the strength of a God. Ophemelet decided to leave a measure in place in case of such an emergency. Using his divine gifts, he emptied out all that made him a supreme and holy being out into an ordinary chalice, and he locked the chalice away deep in hiding. No Igrathean but him knew where the chalice hid.\n\n\"When trouble will come to Igrathea befitting the strength of the God, Ophemelet,\" he decreed. \"A child of my blood will be born blind. Only this child will be able to see the path to the chalice, and only one trusted other is to accompany them on their path. He who drinks from the chalice will assume the divinity that I have discarded.\"\n\nAnd so, King Ophemelet ruled as Igrathea's king until he expired, as all mortals do. Igrathea knew only peace under his rule, and enjoyed centuries of further prosperity afterwards... Six centuries after King Ophemelet's death, his bloodline still rules Igrathea today... And twenty years prior to today, the next heir to the kingdom was born. A beautiful baby with foggy eyes of gray-- a sparkling pair of eyes that dazzled all who saw them, but could not see a thing.\n\nThere is unease over Igrathea-- the people know that their peaceful times will soon come to an end without the chalice's power. When the blind noble was born, the task of training their escort to the chalice began... Trained from childhood for no purpose other than to help the noble reach the chalice so that they may drink from it, ascending to the Godhood of their ancestor and defending the kingdom. Today, their journey begins...\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nHey, thanks for reading all that! I'm looking for a partner who writes in 3rd person and in generally in 1-3+ paragraphs per response who writes over Discord (preferably!) to write this with. I'm fine with being the escort or the noble in the prompt, or even changing certain things about it up depending on what you might want to do with it! If this is a prompt that interests you, please shoot me a message so we can plan something out!! Thanks!",

I am all about quality over quantity, so not actual post length but I do enjoy getting something I can work with lol. Limits should be discussed beforehand if we are so interested, please! I can at least work with about two to three posts a day, although I do work full time and then some, so do bear that in mind.\n\n\n\nOkay! So fandom time. I figure we can discuss characters as we decide where we wanna go. Here are just some examples:\n\n\n\nMCU\n\n\n\nHarry Potter\n\n\n\nStar Trek TOS\n\n\n\nInception\n\n\n\nBatman\n\n\n\nWatchmen\n\n\n\nI know theres more but that's all I can think of top of my head. I also would be open to hear any original plots, though I tend toward modern supernatural/superhero. Anyway send me a message and we will see what we can figure out! Thanks (:",

Let me share a little about us!\n\n**Our stories...**\n\nWe cover a wide range of stories, mostly fantasy based. However, sci-fi and post-apocalyptic would also be of interest.\n\nCurrently we have a free form causal roleplay where almost anything goes, as long as it fits reasonably into the story. But, we also host intricate, long term stories as well. We're currently hosting a dragon riders roleplay called \"Dragon Children\", a magical political drama.\n\nAs a side note, I'm more than happy to catch people up to speed on any stories they're interested in. Or, if you have your own ideas we do take story pitches!\n\n**Our rules...**\n\nWe ask that our members be mature and respectful. Because of this, we prefer 18+ players. However exceptions can be made, especially since we do not allow explicit sexual content in our stories. We also ask that our members be available to post at minimum once a week. More rules can be found on our Discord server.\n\nIf you're interested feel free to shoot me a message! I'm usually tethered to my phone, so my responses will be pretty quick!",

Planets are colonized, space travel is the norm, etc. I can see it being an adventure/thriller, but it would also go off in a pretty dark direction. I want to explore themes like body horror, transhumanism, and so on. There would also be a romance angle. I've never done a sci-fi RP before, so hopefully someone with more experience could help me with the worldbuilding. Just to clarify, I'm female but am playing a male role. I'm seeking either a female partner or a guy who can write female characters well, either is fine with me. My preferred chat platform is discord. Please send me a pm if you're interested, and I'd love to tell you more.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! Thanks for reading! I am an adult male in my 20s who has been roleplaying for about a decade now, and I'm looking for a literate, adult partner who wants to do a long-term, GMed roleplay in an original superhero world! My ideal roleplays are long-term, complex, with a cast of characters. I like stories that contain a little bit of everything. Action, drama, suspense, mystery, romance, comedy, whatever!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've done a little world building in my head for a superhero world that I've been dying to play in. With me as the GM, I would guide you through this world full of superheroes, supervillains, and all sorts of fun stuff. You would play as a new entrant into the super scene. Someone who develops powers just as the story begins. Do you become a hero? A villain? Straddle that grey area and use powers for personal gain? That's all up to you! You take whichever path you want, and I'll play the world around you as it reacts to your decisions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy preferred platform for roleplaying is Discord. I anticipate this roleplay being long-term, with a large cast, and I find that Discord is the best for keeping track of those sorts of things. I would also prefer any partners to be over 18, just so we're covered in case adult content appears in the story. It's something I'm certainly open to and enjoy, but it's not my major focus for this roleplay. I also enjoy OOC chat, both talking about the roleplay and world building together, and just talking about life. None of that's necessary, of course, if you're strictly business, but I'm open to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested, I'd love to hear from you! Being that GMing is a lot of work, I may not be able to roleplay with all of you, but I'll do my best to delete this or otherwise indicate when I'm not looking for partners. So if you see this and it says \"Still-looking\", then shoot me a message and we'll talk about getting something set up! Hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! Thought I'd try a new idea today, a little something I've been thinking up. So to those who are familiar or partially familiar with the SCP Foundation: I'm interested in an NSFW roleplay. It'll be NSFW for a couple of reasons, given the nature of the SCP Foundation, there will almost certainly be death and dark plots. But \"fun times\" and happy moments in the story too! I'd love for this to be long term, with a nice little world built up with multiple characters and plotlines between them. \n\nThere are a few different scenarios we could try out here. Or if you have any to add on, feel free to!\n\n1- SCP/human. Involving one of the non harmful SCPs like 105. Perhaps between the SCP and a scientist, MTF member, or guard. Perhaps a fellow SCP!\n\n2- Doctor/MTF. Involving a doctor designated to an MTF team and has to patch us up, whilst falling in love with a member of the team. Added worry bonus that the MTF member may be KIA. \n\n3- MTF/MTF. Speaks for itself, falling in love on the job. Saving eachother's butts. Maybe we're the only surviving members of the team and have no idea if we'll make it out?\n\n4- Scientist/Scientist. Again, falling in love on the job but less risky. More calm than working on an MTF. But has its perks.\n\n5- O5. Hell, thrown in the deep end. O5 with anything. Since they're mysterious yet command a lot of respect. It'd be difficult to find love as an O5. But not impossible. \n\nJust to clarify. There will be \"fun times\" and stuff, but it isn't going to dominate the story. Before the \"fun times\" actually start. Character buildup would be great, as well as some development in the plot too. If you're interested in any of these, or have ideas of your own. Hit me up!",

I've roleplayed anime-based, fantasy, romance, medieval, slice of life plus more. I'm open to a lot of ideas and would love to brainstorm on plots or ideas. I do work during the weekdays, however, so my responses will be somewhat delayed.\n\nI do like to write in 3rd person and I do enjoy lengthy posts. I'm not asking for a novel, just would prefer responses that are not one liners. \n\nHere are just a few fandoms that I like just for references:\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nMass Effect + Dragon Age\n\nSupernatural\n\nUmbrella Academy\n\nOverwatch\n\nMarvel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested, please PM me! Like I mentioned, I'm open to just about anything. :) ",

Do note that it will not be hyper realistic and there will be super human feats to add some flare. Now then here is the rp idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are a Person beginning to take an interest in boxing. You have watched a few fights....and then a few more and more until you fell involve with the sport. As you love fighting and the thrill of blood in your mouth and your fists vibrating upon impact it seems like the sport is for you. So you head to the best boxing gym in town, simply to give it a look. This is where you meet my character. A 23-year-old man who some say is on his way to becoming middleweight champion in boxing. He is currently ranked number 5 in the world and is working towards the middleweight championship of the world. You see him box using a punching bag and are amazing. After he's done you go and talk to him, asking if he could teach you. He agrees after some convincing and you join the gym. The rest is for the rp!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you would like to rp please MSG me on Reddit and I can give ya my discord!",

It doesn\u2019t have to be specific to the films, it could just be everyday, Bucky or 1940\u2019s Bucky. Rewatching the films got me thinking about my huuuugge crush on the character (girls always fall for the villains). \n\nOther info: I\u2019m Ivany, I\u2019ve been role playing for 6 years I think, and I\u2019m always up to compromise. I do prefer discord but I\u2019ve also got kik, so I hope to hear from anyone interested soon!!! ",

While I like things generally light hearted, I understand the value of having darker moments, and I don't dissuade from darker themes as long as they don't alter the story atmosphere permanently.\n\nI'd like our world to be custom, large in scope and full of many characters that we both can play, so I'm hoping you are alright with a little bit of world building to start. It doesn't have to be anything too detailed, but enough for us to build on.\n\nSometimes people ask me to clarify what I mean by pseudo-realistic, so I'll get that out of the way here. By pseudo-realistic, I mean something like Harry Potter, where there are magic elements, but it takes place in an otherwise ordinary world. These sorts of worlds are really appealing to me because I like the idea of hidden knowledge, secrets, and dynamics between the regular world and the more magical one.\n\nAs for fantasy related worlds, I really love adventuring, fantasy politics, and magic with rigid rules.\n\n",

            "selftext": "**Good morning,**  \n\nI am looking for someone to take part in some multi para role-play with me. I am currently only looking for male characters but you are IRL is not as important. I do a variety of genres but my favorites are:\n\n* Gritty Low Magic Fantasy\n* Gritty Sci Fi, lower tech ala Firefly \n* Horror\n* Non Zombie Post Apoc preferably an alien invasion\n* Mashing up Modern and Fantasy, think BPRD style\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat you can expect from me is well written posts with lots of substance, dialogue, and inner turmoil with a fair amount of character growth. I excel in playing characters who start out flawed but improve through experience and interaction with your characters. I tend to post around once a day but keep in mind, I am a parent, work a full time job, and also come home to do a second full time job. Sometimes things get crazy and I love to travel as well. All the same, I will at least give you a warm and happy Good Morning everyday! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I expect from you is to be an easy going lover of writing and plotting who brings some complex characters to the table and takes an active hand in the plot. My ideas are ALWAYS open to alteration so I am happy to hear your takes on my concepts. Throw ideas my way all you want, I am always happy to hear them. Someone who is mature, preferably mid twenties plus if possible, and understands role-play and real life are not the same thing. Respect my life, I will respect yours. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I role-play on is Google Docs, Gmail, or Discord. Strong preference for Google Docs but I can be flexible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thoughts on Fandoms are .....sorry folks, am only looking for OC's at the moment. Talking about your fandoms is A-OK but I would prefer to steer away from canon this time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do provide writing samples on request but I do not require that of my partner. If you want to share them, go ahead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My ideas!:**\n\n*Fantasy Horror Idea:* Our characters are part of a mercenary bands besieging the same town, a small rural town that is being destroyed by our conflict. During a rainy and dark night, it seems a third opponent has come in the form of the ground itself seeking to swallow up the town and everyone on it. Our only hope to survive this horrible opponent is rocky high ground but can we do it, how many of our people can we save in the process? Is there any hope of escaping the murky darkness beneath. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sci fi Idea:* Two prisoners escape a prison planet in a stolen ship, likely they had no plan to escape together but that is how it happened. Once on the ship, they realize the ship contains a very precious cargo, they become wanted by far more than just the government that imprisoned them. Basically, the ship is a new super weapon itself, how will two scrubby little jailbirds react to freedom and incredible power? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Modern Fantasy Mashup:* Your character is an ordinary cop, quite good at their job perhaps. Then the strangest request comes in to help a department with a unique case. This is no ordinary murder case as it becomes quickly revealed that maybe we didn't make up all those boogeymen and fantasy tales. A whole society exists of such creatures right beneath our noses and their cops need a murderer apprehended before this truth gets out. Yeah, I know fantasy cop drama is a bit of a stretch but I have to try. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thank you for Reading! Did you do something to your hair, you look great!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "The Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme. Every character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\n[***http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction***](http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction)  \n[***https://discord.gg/cb5n63C***](https://discord.gg/cb5n63C)",

Any thing NSFW with a writer who is a minor will be faded to black, not written out.\n\nI write in very few fandoms, as I prefer to write my own story. I am a Southerner at heart, so it should go without saying that anything involving the West or cowboys is on my list. Sci-Fi is a genre I enjoy, simply for the options it allows. Historical fantasy, SOL, action and drama, adventure, take your pick really. I write most genres, but there are a few I just dont enjoy. Feel free to ask me, the worst I'll say is no.

Ever seen that weird mix of bullying and flirting? I want to play around it, especially writing on the receiving hand of it. There are some scenarios in which we could try it;\n\n1. A very classic \"Highschool bully\" kind of setting. Something along the lines of a proud girl who picks on or used to make fun of another character. Perhaps they could be older by now? Who know~\n\nThis one is oddly specific. \n2. Imagine a high fantasy world. There would be one character (yours) who had been promised something by a blacksmith for a favor. I'm thinking something important. That blacksmith is no longer in the world and has given his shop to his now fully grown up kid! For that setting to work, we'd need your character to be of a race that ages well.\n\nYou are free to bring your ideas! I'd like to discuss more about that strange tension I wanna play around, I want to explain it better.\n\nAnyways, I can't wait to hear from you! Let's meet on Discord, if you'd like ~\n\nP.S.: I usually write males and like writing with females if possible. ",

I have written pretty much every genre under the sun, but I lean heavily towards: Medieval/Modern/SciFi Fantasy and Post Apocalyptic. I have dabbled in vanilla modern and enjoyed it, however I really am drawn to writing in a genre that poses challenges for the character's survival. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Preferences:** I do not have a preference for my writing partner's gender, but I do prefer their main character to be male as I prefer my main's to be female. When it comes to style, I stick to past-tense, third person. Post-Length can get quite long for me, multiple paragraphs, in the beginning, though I do not expect the same from a partner. Typically by the time there is a rhythm between the characters they shorten to one paragraph. When it comes to the length of the actual roleplay, I have rps that have gone on for 15+ years. I am long-term committed for sure! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Romance:** I like having romance underlying the main plot however I do not write \"smut\" any longer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also would love to become friends with my writing partners! I would love to chat and get to know you, as well as have you get to know me.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love to use Proboards for the place to write, however I am flexible. I have recently tried Discord and my only complaint is it limits length. ",

I would like it if you are 18+ as the role play will likely contain sexual content, but that will NOT be the focus of the roleplay. I'm not too picky about message length, as long as it's enough information to work with and I would prefer it if you are fairly literate, some spelling errors here and there is fine as I mess up sometimes too. I have the best access to Kik and Discord, but am willing to talk about other platforms.\n\nMy role ideas are more on the basic side, Teacher &amp; Student, College Roomates, or two best friends that end up together, but I do enjoy the fantasy genre as well ex. Deity &amp; Commoner/Soldier, Human &amp; Monster etc. Basically, I'm open to just about anything.\n\nIf you have any questions or would like to talk further, feel free to message me :)",

            "selftext": "The first snowfall of the season was quite a strong one, covering the frozen forest with a layer of white fluff. Sparkling flurries fell faster as the winds picked up. For the most part, the forest was empty... except for a man trudging through the nasty winter storm.\n\nLindo, the soldier sent to start the fight against an unknown evil was caught in the thick of the storm in the forest. His metal armor clashed and clanged with creeks here and there as it began to freeze over. His breathing became sharp as he took his two last steps before falling to his knees, the armor on the verge of being frozen solid from the hours of walking through the snowstorm. \n\n\"Is this why they sent me... to get rid of me? I'll just be another soldier lost in his travels.\" He told himself as he felt the frostbite eat away at his tips, the rest of the body to follow. \n\n\"I cant... I mustn't...\" In a last attempt to find a place for refuge during the storm, he reached back with his weak hands and pulled his sword out. He stabbed it into the ground to pull himself up with the support he had. Even with his optimism, it would take a miracle to save him from the storm, or else he will be frozen there in the forest until someone found him and either looted him or burried him.\n\n_______________\n\nHey everyone, Chris here!\n\nI was thinking I write up a little prompt based of a Fantasy setting and a snowfall (Mainly because it is really snowy where i am right now and I was effectively snowed in at work). I then made it a little crazy with my character, the handsome Elf soldier named Lindo being close to death. \n\nSomehow someway, a beauty will come and save him. Is it a simple traveler that is better equiped for the cold? How about an cute Elf that lives out in the forest? Maybe a mage that is able to heat the two of them up enough before getting to a cave? The choice is yours and we can definately discuss it if you have more ideas.\n\nId love for this RP to be a nice mix between a burning romance and an action adventure story against this unknown evil. The frozen forest is just where we will start and we can definately discuss what this evil is, be it a creeping infection/ corruption of the Land or a Dark Lord Emerging.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in incorporating some NSFW or smut into our RP with the romance. It wouldnt just be for the sake of doing it but it would make sense with the tension building and stuff.\n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red or orange envalope and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! And as always, all my other prompts are open to RPing too so you can just go through my post history! Thanks for reading!\n\n-Chris",

My literature isn't the greatest but I hope it's good enough. \nAnyways, this RP is about a demi-God who started taking two of the strongest men of the town as a tribute for himself, every ten years. Those who are taken are used as servants for the demi-God.\nWe can role play as the ones who are taken, \nor try to retrieve them from demi-God.\nWe can discuss and change stuff if you're interested.\nThe story can have mature content, but it's not necessary.\nI could reply with replies from 3 sentences to 3 paragraphs+.\nPlease PM for further information.\n",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello reddit. I've been working on yet another ADULT fantasy medievalish setting, but this one has more of an accent on its unique world, magic, politics, and the nsfw part. This is a story based rp where you will have to read a bunch of lore and make a character before you join, but we did try to keep the important stuff as light as possible. The server is ever growing, we always need more interesting characters and literate players. Please do not join if you are not considered an adult in your country, and please DO join if you are interested in some mature, para to multi-para rp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the pitch : *Lush, a magocracy established in the eye of what the council named 'The mist'. A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense fog, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Since they float in the endless void of The Mist, most of the Magocracy's conflicts are born internally amongst guilds. Lush's government system is comprised of a council overseen by the Arcane Sovereign. While every major policy must go by the city's supreme ruler, internal affairs are usually taken care of by the area's ruling guild(s).*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, here's the invite link: Perma link: [https://discord.gg/ugXtMYq](https://discord.gg/ugXtMYq)",

I prefer Discord but I can roleplay on other platforms if requested. \n\nI have a few general settings that I would like to roleplay with, however nothing concrete or extensive. I enjoy crafting a story that we can both enjoy so all of my ideas are fully open to criticism and changes of course.\n\nSome of the settings that I have had a craving for recently are as follows.\n\n \u2022 SciFi - Anything futuristic, whether that be more realistic Dystopian futures or adventurous interplanetary traveling and adventuring.\n\n \u2022 Fantasy Medieval - Anything from low fantasy to high fantasy. I especially enjoy anything that uses races from WoW or any RPG settings such as DnD or Pathfinder. I also enjoy Game of Thrones way too much and would love to do something in the same universe or similar.\n\n \u2022 Westworld - I am currently watching Westworld and would be interested in roleplaying a setting which is similar. I enjoy how the show handles advanced AI and emotions, but I won't say too much in case I spoil anything.\n\n- Warcraft - Anything around Wow or Warcraft I have been dying to play. \n\nPlease feel free to message me if anything here interests you or you have an idea you would like to share with me, even if it's not on the list above.

            "selftext": "* I give about three to five paragraphs. I'm looking for someone who enjoys a lengthy post (and doesn't mind waiting because life happens). I play females and males. Doubling is ideal. \n* I want us to use canon characters. In some special circumstances, I'll deal with OCs but it's a very rare occurrence and does require us to both double as a canon and an OC and to make sure we're not overly favorable towards just our OC. That's not fair. If you wanna know which canons I play, just ask but also let me know which ones you can do so it's easy to find common pairs we can do. I am very nitpicky against OCs so if you're sensitive or stubborn regarding your character, best not to show me them. I'm gonna be blunt when giving feedback. So I would prefer all canons because it's easier and more fun for myself as a writer to plot for known characters. \n* I stick to third person, past tense. It's important for me to distinguish myself from who I write as and I hope my partner can respect that and not confuse the two.\n* I will say Reddit is my first choice, followed by Discord, followed by Google Docs and lastly, email. I do not use kik or skype.\n* It's important we keep in touch to plot and stay on the same page. My partner should be happy and eager to post and that means voicing what we both want to happen. I love chatting with my partners. I also like knowing if any delay is gonna happen, if you need to wait a couple weeks, that's cool. I'm a patient person. I try to stay chill but please try not to keep me on the hook for too long. Generally speaking if we need a break, I'm fine as long as I'm not kept in the dark about it.\n* Mature content is okay with me but I don't like it creeping into the RP frequently. My focus is on storytelling, not ripping off one another's clothes or seeing who can create the music epic combat scenes. Also any characters who might be under 18 will be aged up to be 18 for romantic plots. I'd also love it if partners were also over 18 too. \n* Finally, the general tone of my RPs tend to be light and focused on slice of life stuff. I don't need tons of action or dramatics happening all the time because it's just going to drain my motivation to post. To me writing is about escape and life is too dramatic to have it being written about as well.\n\n**Fandoms I can do:** ask about others, maybe I know it? :3\n\n* Naruto\n* Harry Potter\n* The Hunger Games\n* Yokai Watch\n* Death Note\n* Game of Thrones\n* Fruits Basket\n* Fire Emblem Fates\n* My Hero Academia\n* Little Witch Academia\n* Yu Yu Hakusho\n* Star Trek\n* Final Space\n* Doctor Who\n* Dragon Ball Z\n* The Good Place\n* The Big Bang Theory\n* The Avengers and their other movies\n* X-Men First Class, Logan's Logan's, etc.\n* Defenders, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist\n* Dragon Age Inquistion\n* Your Lie in April\n* Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\n* Broadchurch\n* The Decoy Bride\n* Parks and Rec\n* DuckTales\n* Dot Hack\n* Inuyasha",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nFor a little about me, I\u2019m a 20 year-old pre-law student attending university in the PNW. I\u2019m a professional bass player, amateur stand-up comedian, and aspiring writer. I enjoy ping pong, smash bros, DnD, Call of Cthulhu, and other nerdy things. Lord of the Rings first piqued my interest in worldbuilding, but things like Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide, Cowboy Bebop, and Space Dandy really opened my mind to the possibilities of Science Fiction.\n\nNow for the important bit, **The Universe:**\n\nWithin the next century or two, human nature will get the better of us as the world outlaws executions. However, in a world of vast technology, prisoners are not so easily locked in cages. To alleviate this problem, the completely noble-intentioned Orpheus Company came up with a solution: a private, cage-free prison planet at the far end of the galaxy: Eurydice. Here, the worst Earth has to offer is given a second, if slim, chance at another life... as far from Earth as possible.\n\nEurydice hasn\u2019t always been the idyllic graveyard it is today. Once, it was the site of a Soviet colony launched in the 2050s, shortly after the advent of the weak-medium Alcubierre Drives. After the decade long journey, the colony ship landed only to lose contact with the Kremlin within the following year. As technology continued to improve, it was later confirmed that although there were traces of the colony\u2019s constructions, they were without human life.\n\nThis project originally started as me building a realistic alien ecosystem for a Call of Cthulhu campaign, and has since developed into this form after over a year of casual worldbuilding and writing. Through this, I want your help to explore my own world, and hopefully be surprised along the way.\n\n**The Scenario:**\n\nAs the worst criminals Earth has to offer, all of you either modern-day equivalents of death row inmates and particularly difficult lifers (with the occasional 3-strike rule on account of light fraud), you\u2019re the most recent arrivals on Eurydice, a private prison planet that\u2019s been running for the better part of a decade. Here, you\u2019ll square-off against the elements, native flora and fauna, and the planet\u2019s inhabitants: both alien and indigenous. On your journey of survival, you might even find the cause of the colony\u2019s untimely disappearance.\n\nYour goals are your own, whether it\u2019s to survive, thrive, or even find a way back home, but you can\u2019t do it alone. With a strong group, your victory against this alien world isn\u2019t guaranteed, but it\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll have to take in order to make it through the day.\n\n**What I\u2019m looking for:**\n\nI\u2019m looking for a few people, no more than five, to DM me with character ideas that fit this world, as well as just a quick description about you. More formal character building will happen later in a discord I\u2019ll set up, but in the meantime I just want to know what you\u2019re about before \u201caccepting\u201d you.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to \u201capply,\u201d please be ready to commit to responding at least once every couple of days to the RP proper barring irl issues.\n\nAs a side note, the world concepts and inhabitants are all pretty cemented in place. Don\u2019t join expecting to do worldbuilding, but more group storytelling mediated by me.\n\n**What you can expect from me:**\n\nI\u2019m a veteran GM/DM who\u2019s looking to work on his writing. My job, in my mind, is to lay the foundation and set the scene for you all, while giving you some unique characters to interact with.\n\nI have a relatively hands-off style, and that\u2019s essentially, \u201cIf you can reasonably do it, you do it.\u201d Lets say you have what you need to build a spear. Describe what you do and congrats, you have a spear. You\u2019re facing off against a lone bird-wolf with the aforementioned spear? Tell us how the fight goes, and barring you throwing it against a tree and it exploding in a shower of gore, I\u2019ll probably applaud you. Any interactions with other RPers I encourage you to discuss it beforehand. Obviously, no hijacking other RPers or non-fodder. When in doubt, talk it out.\n\nHairier situations we can discuss before coming to a joint conclusion. Say you\u2019re surrounded by a *pack* of bird-wolves and the RPer that\u2019s tamed them? We\u2019ll talk about it, however, at the end of the day, I have the final say. And don\u2019t take that as, \u201cThis guy\u2019s trying to kill our characters,\u201d I\u2019m very fair and lenient, but there needs to be a standard, and that standard is going to be me.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading, and feel free to comment any comments, questions, or concerns before DMing me your ideas!",

            "selftext": "Hello reader, I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful day today. I appreciate you clicking or tapping on my title to see what all I have to say. Because of that, I\u2019ll try my best to keep this an interesting and engaging read for you. First of all, my name is Josh, I am 19 years old (almost 20!), and I am currently pursuing a degree for music. My schedule is fairly free except for early mornings on Tuesdays and Thursday\u2019s, but any other time I should be good unless I say otherwise. Now, let\u2019s get into the juicy bits! \n\nToday I am looking for a specific partner(s), but I should explain what that specific part is about. I want a writer who has a particular skill with word play, descriptive writing, and including literary elements to jerk emotions. Words, sentences, and their structure has always been a major interest of mine which has led me into writing and roleplaying. I can\u2019t get over the fact how a certain pronunciation of sounds from your throat can invoke sadness, lust, happiness, or any other emotion. I want a roleplay that involves plenty of this descriptive writing, beautifully structured sentences with flair that can make me feel those emotions. So, if you think you\u2019re capable of doing that with me, send me a message so we can discuss! \n\nAs far as a plot goes, I\u2019m not too picky. We can come up with something, or if you have an idea, please present it! I\u2019d love to also hear about your guys\u2019 interest with this phenomenon, tell me how it makes you feel too. Also, I\u2019m totally okay with NSFW themes if you guys want to bring some ideas pertaining that. But anyways, thanks for reading my pretty long post. I hope I get some great writers in my inbox! If you read this far, pretty please include your favorite emoji in your message. ",

I recently revived my forum, BRACKISH, which is a completely original world set hundreds of years in the future. The earth is flooded, society has collapsed, and life is about surviving and having a good time while you do. The setting is open and our handful of members are hungry for plots - anything from romance to adventure.\n\nAbout the site: I'm a literate player, but this site is open to newbies and veterans alike. \"Faceclaims/playbys\" are optional. Most of us are in PST. It's a very laid-back atmosphere, and you can generally expect replies within a day or two. \n\nIf you're interested, go ahead and drop me a PM or start poking around the site! I try to keep it light on lore so players can spin their own stories, but let me know if you have any questions. If there's a specific plotline or character you've been kicking around that fits into this world, I'd be happy to plot that with you, design a new character to play with yours, etc.",

            "selftext": "###*\"Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge\" -George S. Patton.*\n\n**The year was 2091.** The people of the lonely planet Earth had averted nuclear armageddon by peace treaties and new technology. With the deterant removed from the stage, one of the world's military superpowers decided that a new era would begin, and they would be the ones to pave its way on a highway of blood. They set their wits and resources to work, and reignited the fires of industry and technology in preparation for their glorious conquest. They were soon thought nigh unkillable; they were gods of war amongst mortals. The stars and stripes were forgotten, and before long, the banner of the eagle and swords flew over battlefields accross the planet, followed by shouts of its nation's new battle cry: \"ONE LAND! ONE PEOPLE! ONE VOICE!\"\n\n**The year was 2108.** The first planet wide celebration of Unification Day is underway. The people rejoiced; a new sun rose on their planetwide empire, the world was won and the conquest was done. The Terran Republic now held the power to persue any destiny it wished. They chose to set their best and brightest minds toward the stars, and began to rekindle their ages old drive that allowed their ancestors to set foot on the moon. Lunar and Martian colonies soon followed, as did advancements accross the scientific board; in medicine, industry, prosperity, the scientific minds that once built awe inspiring machines of war that brought the entire world to its knees now set themselves the task of making their new empire the best it could be.\n\n**The year was 2170.** A strange phenomenon was witnessed through the eyes of the Argus Array, and was quickly identified as an incomming fleet of alien ships. Since almost the beginning of their recorded history, the people of earth had dreamed of this day, and the Terran Republic was no different. They were well prepared to welcome their new visitors with open arms and glad hearts, but their visitors had other ideas. Hellbent on enslaving these primitive hairless monkeys, the new invaders brought their own might to bare against their targets. The Terran Republic once again dusted off their weapons and let fly their banners of war, and defended themselves with tooth and claw. \n\n**The year was 2185.** The \"primitive hairless monkeys\" had fought well, they had done their warlike ancestors proud. Although their invaders had six times their numbers and many times their level of technology, the humans had something no artificial technology could hope to match: warrior hearts and minds. Their ancient histories and stories told of great leaders and military conquests; Ghengis khan, Adolf Hitler, Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and many more. They were a species of warriors, soldiers, generals, and their invaders fell as wheat to the reaper's blade. They preserved the technology they aquired from their now conquered adversaries, and learned from what they found. They improved many things, and finially solved the problem of interstellar travel, enabling them to make their grand debut onto the interstellar stage. The lonely Terran system was lonely no more.\n\n**The year was 2217.** The Terran Republic had joined the space age along with the other alien peoples of the galaxy. They found that their bodies were largely inferior to those of the others in many ways, and their own system had little in the way of valuable resources. But one thing made the other alien peoples regard them as very valuable allies indeed: their warrior spirit and soldier's cunning. They too had wars, conflicts, battles, and sought clever and powerful allies to aid them. When the aliens beheld the military might of the Terran Republic, they were glad to trade what they could to enlist these proud fighters as their allies. It soon became known that when either side of a conflict managed to secure the favor of the Terran Republic, the battle was as good as won. Of course, the warrior race was not perfect, but the had earned their title well.\n\n**The year is 2298.** The stage is set, and there is much to be seen and done. What part will you play in this new age of humanity? Will you be a battle hardened soldier, hoping to climb the ranks and one day hold the lofty title of High General? Will you be a Terran senator, negotiating and debating on which side to favor in the latest conflict in which your people's aid has been asked? Will you be another race entirely? Watching the Terran Republic from afar and perhaps plotting to take them down? The choice is yours, I am but the humble worldcrafter and story writer. I have set the pieces on the board, and now it is you who will make your move.\n\nXXXXX\n\nWhew, that was a lot huh? If you've managed to read all of that, then you've earned yourself a nice big Terran Republic salute, my friend! \n\nAs I said, I'm just the humble writer and GM, so I'll he running the world around you and what you hope to accomplish in the story. I'm a rather detailed writer, and all my posts make a good effort to be nice and long (not quite as long as this obviously XD), so I'll get along quite well with someone else who's advanced in writing and likes good, well thought out responses.\n\nMy fingers are getting sore fron typing so long, so I'll cut it short here. If this idea sparked your interest, please feel free to messege me! And just so I know you've really read this far and not just skimmed the post, please include the word \"Strawberries\" in your messege somewhere, it helps me keep track of who's messeging me about what.\n\nLike I said, feel free to messege me if this idea sparks your interest. I hope to see you soon!",

So it makes sense why I'd like to have this story set in a 30s noire mood but in a fictional and fantasy-lovecraftian setting. \n\nWe'll be exploring the dark catacombs of Edge Water, journeying to shrouded islands, stumbling upon strange anomalies, exploring Plague Ships, and much more.\n\nWe can discuss what strengths, weaknesses, skills, abilities our characters have. You could be a magician, a sorceress, a detective, etc. with a wealthy or working class background.\n\nI'm fine with or without romance, so we can definitely discuss that. \n\nI'm **not into gross-out gore horror** as I prefer restraint, if you're wondering :P\n\nSo yeah, if you're interested, feel free to reply/PM me and I'll do my best to entertain you with a mystery-filled noir fantasy adventure :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "With everyone\u2019s favourite manga on a break this week, it\u2019s just impossible to get your weekly dose of the One Piece world\u2026 Or is it?\n\n#StrawHatRPG: An Open World Roleplay Community\n\nWelcome to StrawHatRPG, the **oldest ongoing One Piece Roleplay Subreddit**. We are an alternate universe set in the rules of the One Piece World but without any of the canon characters, entirely new locations and a few familiar ones. The new storyline has just started and we have a huge active player base at the moment, so it\u2019s a great time for you to join us!\n\nWe\u2019ve started a new adventure in the One Piece world, and have had some scuffles with the Marines in the North Blue. Hurtling towards Reverse Mountain, we've also crossed swords against some of the most powerful pirates in the North Blue. And now we\u2019ve finally crossed the threshold!  Over and across Reverse Mountain and into the Grand Line! As the players emerge at the Twin Capes, it's the perfect opportunity for you to make a new start! A spark ignites a blazing flame in the hearts of the next era of Pirates. Come join us on a brand new adventure and immerse yourself in the stunning world of One Piece!\n\n***\n\nOur goal here at the sub is to be a story-driven, pseudo-linear RPG. Similar to the One Piece Manga, we continually journey forward from island to island. The island is completely open-world, meaning you can go where you like. This means you can explore, investigate, rabble-rouse, pick fights, get drunk, lay on the beach, train, or anything else you can think of! There will be events that players can participate in, or simply do their own thing, making up their own mini-story. Besides this, each island will also have a main story, open to all of the players.\n\nWe encourage **creativity and individualism**, and will try and help facilitate that as much as we can (while keeping in mind the themes, and tone of One Piece, and the sub). Players have various different options to customise their characters such as **Custom Devil fruits**, Abilities like **Diable Jambe or Asura** that are unique to their character etc. Players can also choose to **play as any race** from the world of One Piece or they can even combine races to get the best of both worlds! In fact, players can even make up and moderate their own mini-island stories!\n\nIf all of these seem daunting, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve simplified the rules into easily digestible docs so that anyone can easily get started. Between our experienced mod team and **super friendly and helpful community**, you won\u2019t have any trouble finding all the help you need. We\u2019ve also taken into account all the feedback we\u2019ve received and constructed **Brand New and Improved Systems**. \n\n***\n\nCome on over to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/qc4hRv7) to talk with other players, get advice from the mods, talk about the sub, or just talk! Everyone is friendly and loves to talk about any subject imaginable! It's a great place to just connect to other One Piece fans, if nothing else!\n \nWell what are you waiting for?[Dive right in into the adventure of your lifetime!](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrawHatRPG/comments/9niqk0/welcome_and_guidelines/)\n",

They believe God used his own seed to plant a lone tree at the equator of Erdegroz, and the tree had grown to such a massive size that it can be seen extending off the planet from outer space. That tree is the Tree of Life. While its existence is undeniable, scientists and several varying religious groups have argued since the dawn of humans if it were the work of some higher power. Apples large enough to create their own orbit grow here. It is said one bite from this fruit will grant godhood. Since the tree is heavily guarded by powerful beasts and deadly monsters, no one had even managed to get near the tree. That is until a large group of people risked their lives millions of years ago; all for the sake of extracting sap from the tree\u2019s roots. They were successful- and brought it back to civilization. Some say they were punished by eternity in Hell for their sins, but regardless they\u2019d managed to spread the sap; and severely diluted offspring of the Tree of Life had sprouted here and there. The apples grown from these trees, unlike the original, are only slightly bigger than an average apple. However, it is said anyone who eats one will be granted great powers.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2022Magic-esque elements \n\n\u2022Flexible with OCs and if something doesn\u2019t work with the RP, our admin will talk it out with you or lend some advice \n\n\u2022This RP is a WIP, it\u2019s started rather recently, and we\u2019re happy to take suggestions or plot ideas!\n\n\u2022RP isn\u2019t strict length-wise, but we are looking for more literate writers!\n\n\u2022general chat and art channel- we\u2019re not just roleplay robots, we like to goof off and chit chat as well! \n\n\u2022Feel free to message me for any further details, answers to questions, or if you\u2019d be interested in checking out the server!\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Welcome, my freaks and geeks! I was randomly in the mood for an RP featuring two of many creatures: Vampires and werewolves! I'm a big horror nerd, especially for classic horror monsters (Creature from the Black Lagoon is prehistoric bae). I don't think I've messed with many horror RPs though, which is SUPER weird for me though, so why not post one!\n\nMy idea can be done during any time, from the Stone Age to the modern day to even the future, so we can go for whatever you like! Basically, vampires/werewolves would be working in the darkness, consuming without drawing attention. They would think themselves the only supernatural creatures of their kind but one of their members would be in for a big surprise when, while tracking prey, a different supernatural creature (Can be vamp/werewolf or something else) gets them first! The two species meet up after this 'first contact' and would be fighting for the rights of ownership of human prey. Would there be negotiations or war? \n\nWhere would your character/characters fit in themselves? Would they have been the one to make first contact? Or only find out about the other race/races along with everyone else? Would they be a gentle soul unable to fight their urges or a bloodhungry monster without a care for life? Whatever you prefer, I would love it!\n\nThis idea is a little based off of the World of Darkness/White Wolf RPGs. You don't need to know them and I can explain anything and everything if I put them in but just a little thing! I saw some WoD posts on here a few times so that's pretty neat!\n\nWe don't have to follow my idea either (as vague and incomplete as it is). We could be travelers cursed with our diseases, one 'teacher' who transformed the other into a beast of the night and even monster hunters or diplomats. Whatever floats your boat!\n\nAnyways, that's about it. A little short and strange, I know, but trying my best! I hope to see some people soon and have a wonderful day and (especially) night!",

            "selftext": "\nI'd like to talk to people more over Discord, so I'll keep it short and simple! I'm really just a fan of realistic stuff. I can do modern or medieval, but no sci-fi, no end of the world, no futuristic, no dragons and mermaids and ogres. I like romance, lots of drama, maybe some action? or maybe adventure? Depends on the roleplay! I am open to playing all kinds of characters! (But no FxF) I can play male, female, gay, straight... You name it. There is going to be some stuff I won't do, but just ask and I'll let you know!\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't currently have any ideas because the two I had before I have found some good partners to roleplay those with. I'd love to hear your ideas, or perhaps we could just come up with something together, the old fashioned way!\n\n\n\n\n\nI like to write as much as I can, but it doesn't always have to be something ten posts long. Haha. That being said, I'm not going to roleplay with someone who only gives me about three lines or text for a response. I very often hit the 2000 character limit on Discord, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a reference on how much I write. I can cross the 2000 character limits, once, twice, even three times for a response depending on what I have to go off of. Yes, I understand that sometimes the characters are just talking so the responses won't be as long, but I would expect them to pick up length as we moved on to other scenes instead of staying at dialogue length.\n\n\n\n\n\nNO TEXT TALK. If you can put effort into writing a long, detailed response for a roleplay, you can afford to spell words out when chatting. I'm fine with things like... (Lol, LMAO, OMG...) but I will have little patience for people who say (R, ur, u, y, k... So on and so forth)\n\n\n\n\n\nHope to talk to you soon! (And please leave your Discord tag in your message! It'll make it easy on me since I just can't hold good conversations on Reddit. XD) I'm in eastern time! If that matters. XD",

However, the plot has not been finalized as we would like to exchange ideas. \n\nThank you for reading and considering us! \n\nI\u2019m a bit confused on the rules of this subreddit still so I\u2019m just gonna say you can PM me on through Reddit for our Discord.

That means I am very busy: there will be days when my brain will be fried and served with pickles. This introduction seems a bit repetitive, I know, but it is as accurate as can be right now. Still, I have recently eased into a much more efficient daily routine, allowing me to write a little more. I looking for more writing buddies who understand that I am no longer able to deliver novella type posts. For me, a writer can describe feelings and actions in a few words, and this is what I seek right now. Meaningful but laid back realism, having fun, being able to relax.\n\nPlease be at least over 18, because mature themes will surely arise: not as a form of compulsion, but as an organic part of the story.\n\nAdult women are what I am looking to play at the moment, in MxF relationships. Romance and Drama are vital for me, as moving, evolving character studies of some sort. I am not interested in Anime or Furry, sorry about that.\n\nCurrent Cravings:   \n\n\n1.Marvel Cinematic Universe. I got into it very recently and would love to learn and explore various ideas and AUs. I would love to play against Loki, Thor, Dr. Strange, and Iron Man, though the list is not exhaustive.  \n\n\n2. The Phantom of the Opera: Movie, musical or book.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHit me up with ideas, plots, cravings, pairings you might have in mind. I have nothing set in stone and enjoy the planning phase of a story the most. :)\n\nThanks for reading all this and I hope to hear from you soon!",

All that I ask is your grammar/spelling is decent, you don't god-mode, no one liners (give me enough to respond to), and don't just rely on me to keep the RP interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaven't seen the latest films in the franchise and The Cursed Child was so sucky I threw it across the room, but I'm feeling nostalgic for a roleplay in the Harry Potter universe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we're portraying Hogwarts students, they must be in seventh year if you want to get smutty. Even then, I prefer softcore or fading to black and I like developed flawed relationships that don't happen instantly. I write characters of all genders and sexuality. I can write multiple characters and enjoy writing like it's almost a scripted show, where we change scenes and character perspectives and all their plots intertwine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have started doodling, and will probably draw our characters at some point, since I dislike using faceclaims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't RPed in a long time, and have never written any of these characters, but a few that come to mind with very brief descriptions are: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGwilla Grailgrip: a Gryffindor female half-goblin, quarter witch quarter veela whose father runs a goblin pawn shop and she wishes to become a renown Wandmaker which is taboo among her family because goblins hoard treasures, not give them to others. She is also a Seeker for her house team, which caused controversy because her goblin blood gives her an advantage catching the snitch since it's made of gold. She loves Quidditch so much however she agrees to play blindfolded. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer adoptive human wizard brother in the same year, Osiris, a Slytherin and Head Boy who was found by Gwilla's father in a cursed Egyptian tomb as a baby. He's descended from black magicians from the Far East but black magic in ancient times was different. He's quite gifted at Divination though not a Seer and hopes to use his knowledge of astrology to manipulate the elite of wizarding society. He inherited a flying magic carpet from his long lost ancestors and also has a pocket telescope called the Horus Scope where when peering at a person through the lens he instantly knows their astrological signs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLorelei Lakes: A Ravenclaw witch who comes from a long line of druids, hags and sea witches. She discovers on her boat ride in her first year that she's the Lady of the Lake of Hogwarts which involves her keeping the veil of Avalon concealed and ensuring that the 'sleeping dragon' (who is actually the Pagan god Pan) remain bewitched under the black lake or else the muggle and magical world merge into one and chaotic magic shall unleash like medieval times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeath Hedgecliff: A Hufflepuff male muggleborn who was attacked by a centaur camping in the woods as a child and is blinded in his right eye, has a mangled left leg, and an amputated right arm. As a result of his injuries, he's determined to become a Healer and Alchemist and brew a universal panacea/elixir of life. The Ministry has given him permission to use a staff rather than a wand which also serves as a cane. He's secretly studying how to forge a runic prosthetic arm for himself made of alchemical gold, and he's also known as the school stoner/drug dealer because he brews psychedelic-like potions/herbs which help soothe his pain and just get other students buzzed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessage me with the character you're most interested in (Gwilla and Osiris always will interact even if one is a side character), if you'd like me to play multiple, or all four. I will RP over email, gmail, googledocs, or discord though I have to download the latter.",

            "selftext": "Welcome reader! Thank you for clicking on this thread!  \nA bit of Backstory on the project, and about myself before we get started.  \nMy name is Harry, I used to work on building roleplay servers in a variety of games, weather it be physically building the world, designing it, or helping with creating the world on a discord.  I often found myself helping to write the server lore.  \nHowever as many of you may know, writing lore without many writers is rather difficult, and taxing on the mind.  \nThis is why I am here today.\n\n  \nFor those who haven't heard about it, I will give a brief summary on Hytale.\n\nHytale is an open world sandbox game releasing later this year. The game itself supports races, models, animations, everything needed to create a player driven, roleplaying experience. To say the game has a massive audience is an understatement. What this project is, is more or less a multiplayer server within that game.   \n   \nThe project itself has plenty of coders, and builders. It has a very dedicated staff, with very flexible owners. All we need are writers which as you can imagine are hard to find these days.   \n\n\nWe are looking to write a in depth history for a world which has been left to rebuild from its ruins. Players start on equal footing, all looking to begin Kingdoms, Towns, Cities, even guilds of their own. Everything about the project is player driven, players are even given the option to start empires, or siege other kingdoms as they see fit within the story. We are simply creating the history, the world, and the tools in which to let a community mold the world into their own. The playerbase may never even go to war. We are just creating everything they will need for any given scenario.   \n\n\nLore wise the backstory at the time of this being written is barely touched upon, giving writers plenty of freedom in which to design the world with the rest of the Writing team. We are hoping to finish the lore before the launch of the game. We have 3 writers currently, all of which are well experienced, we are simply looking to increase those numbers.   \n\n\n Again this takes place in a medieval fantasy setting, if you have any questions let me know. The staff team communicates via discord. We can't take too many writers, but we do wish to gain at least a few with this post.   \n\n\nThank you for your time, if you're interested leave a comment bellow and I will get back to you as soon as realistically possible. Cheers.",

I don't have a concrete plot to follow as much as I have a setup and how your character acts can change h9w it progresses.\n\nFantasy happens to be my favorite genre, so a medieval fantasy setting is preffered if you don't like my idea but enjoy my writing style. I am more than willing to try new ideas. Below is the start to this roleplay that I havd written.\n\nSeven days ago, the city she was in was attacked by an army from the north. The defeat was crushing, the city used as an example of their might as they swept over the country. Six days ago, certain women were captured andwere gathered and separated from the rest of the survivors, then so were a couple other people. The next six days were torture, being pushed northward in a steady march, the weather growing colder and clouded. Today, in the late evening it started raining, one that would become a storm. Just before the sun set, the group of caught slaves sight of the castle, nestled in the mountains, the range seeming to curve backwards, flaring out behind the castle like wings. It would have been beautiful, had the group not been so exhausted and worn down. As they were pushed indoors, the warmth was wondrous but didn't fix the chill yet, soaked into their bones as it was. Steel to their backs, guards on all sides, forced to their knees as he walked in. And Valentine was a sight to behold. He was tall, powerful looking, muscles accented by my alabaster skin, a white cape and black pants contrasting as his black hair and white skin, and making him look more imposing as he strode in confidently, standing over her. The man had a face that was a mask of judgement, unflinching as he towered over you. He took her chin in hand, forcing her eyes to his most interesting feature, how own pair. They were blood red pools, with gold flecks shimmering throughout darkly.\n\"What was your profession before this?\" The prince spoke clearly and cleanly, voice resonating throughout the room.\n\nPlease DM me, I am open to discussing this or other ideas.",

            "selftext": "**Notes:** This is based on Yokai Watch the game/anime. If you don't know if it, that's fine. I presented this in a new way for newcomers to understand. I will also be playing one of the two campers (she will probably be an avid cook or photographer) as well as a spirit who will feed information to both our characters as we go along. So don't worry if you don't know the source material! :)\n\nAlso, this will be done over discord. There will be romance between my character and my partner's. I generally want someone who can give about 4 paragraphs on average. Adult themes are probably going to happen eventually. But at the heart of this, is a lot of slice of life fluff where our characters help people (much like small scale quests) and meet new spirits/yokai. \n\n- - -\n\nThe group formed in the first year of high school. Everyone offered something different to the group. One could cook, another could find the best films to watch on weekends, and another one of them could offer the best fashion advice. Needless to say, the group of six was very close-knit but that bond was beginning to break as university began to loom overhead. Some would stay local, others would move away to a bigger city like Tokyo or Osaka. Heck, one of them was even thinking of going aboard to America or the UK. Change was in the air. But so was a hint of delicious, undetectable mystery.\n\nThe group decided to camp up on Mt. Wildwood as the last big adventure they'd all go on before they started new adventures on their own. As fate would have it, only two managed to come through. They got along well enough and were eager to camp even if it was just the two of them. They hiked all the way up, trucking along the stone steps, past the small shrine and back towards the slow moving stream. The pair set up their tent and decided to check around before making a fire. The air was rather cold. Though the winters in Springdale never had snow, they did offer a mighty chill to anyone outside.\n\nOne of them stumbled upon a small wooden box by the riverbank and they two opened it to reveal two plain watches. The pair put them on and went about making their fire as night descended upon the forest surrounding them. As they went to bed, they began to reminisce about how nice life had been over the years and how things were going to change, for better or worse. Suddenly a loud tremor struck the earth and both rose from their tent to see...Nothing? One of them flipped a light on their watch, hoping to see something but the lens shimmered and instead, revealed a large, 10 foot tall demon coming down from the mountain. Was this some nightmare? Surely nothing more.\n\nBut as the loud stomping grew closer, they two realized this was not a dream and this large demonic creature was armed and very dangerous. Aaaand coming right for them! So the two ran off, leaving everything behind as they scrambled to make it down the hill or find someplace to hide. The two friends finally hurried down, out of breath and ducked behind the bushes near their old elementary school. So many questions had been raised. The two decided they needed to figure out what was going on with the demon and the watches played a major role. So they decided to head off to the only watch shop in the city. It seems their adventure was closer than they thought!",

I am currently playing through Metro Exodus now, and having played through Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light a dozen times over, I am very knowledgable, and in love with the Metro universe. The dark charm of the world, and the mystery and conspiracy within the stories, just keep me coming back, and I've longed for the opportunity to roleplay within this universe for some time now. I have general ideas for plots and such, but I would love to collaborate with a interested fan of the series, and make something great. Hell, if I get enough replies to this post, maybe I'll make it a proper group, but that is just a thought, not what this post is intended for. If you are interested in joining me in post apocalyptic Moscow, shoot me a dm with a but about yourself, your Metro knowledge, and your preferred platform for roleplay. I hope to hear from all of you Metro fans, and make a fantastic story in the amazing world of Metro ",

            "selftext": "Trying this again. I'm  looking for a girl who would be interested in exploring a world and a  relationship. This would take place in a world taken from classic  D&amp;D, although it's okay if you don't know the game very well.\n\nI  want to have a husband and wife adventuring team who travel the world,  exploring both it and each other, saving the world and deepening their  relationship at the same time. I've done this kind of thing before, but  it's usually focused on the romantic build-up towards the relationship.  This time, I want to have the marriage as a given (or at least, not focus too heavily on the meeting and courting phases) and focus on questions  like, what would adventuring be like if your spouse was always by your  side? How would you approach things differently? What would be easier,  and what would be harder? How would adventuring affect your  relationship?\n\nNSFW themes and scenes are  an integral part of this (although not the main focus), so you must be  18+. I'm also only open to pairing my male character with your female.  I'd also like someone who is fairly open to experimentation, although we  can discuss the limits in private. I will say that I expect this to be  rather violent (given that it's based on D&amp;D), so you should be comfortable roleplaying a fight to the death.\n\nI  use Discord pretty much exclusively these days. I also very much enjoy  getting to know my partner out of character, so if you want to be  friends outside of the roleplay that's a big plus for me.  My schedule  varies a lot so I may be available at any time, but my preferred hours  are usually in the evenings (PST). I don't have a post length  requirement, but my preference is to keep the story moving while  providing all the relevant details. Longer posts are generally better,  but if there isn't enough to say to fill a paragraph, I'm okay with a  sentence or two. I'm also flexible with 1st or 3rd, present or past.\n\nAnyway,  if this sounds interesting, send me a message and we can exchange our  Discord handles and figure something out! I hope to hear from you soon.",

I'm a guy in his early 20's and hoping to look for someone that roleplay's as a female or possible a futa.\n\nMy writing style ranges from around casual to about 1-2 paragraphs. Most of the time I'm fine with a few one liners here or there. Most of the plots i have in mind are NSFW so the person that does participate needs to be 18+!\n\nI have a few plots that we could try out but if there is some you want to do then we can try them.(I mostly do stuff with fantasy, medieval, slice of life or maybe something sci-fi related.\n\nIf you qant to roleplay then just send a message and. I hope to have a fun time with you!\n",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Ironheart, though if you are reading this you may soon know me simply as the Game Master. For the last 2 or so years I have been contructing in detail a fantasy world for both role play and story telling purposes, and,after finally writing a description of this world that I feel does it some justice, I have decided to launch a discord server in which anyone who finds my work interesting can forge their on long term story with their own character and other rpers, as well as make friends and just have an intresting time all together. The world description is below:\n\nMora| How we came to be.\n\nMora was once a dark and desolate place completely void of life. Then one day from the darkness of space fell a blue star. This star impacted with our world and the energy that gave it its blue hue fused with Mora's surface and all the elements within it. The living energy then assumed a physical form, using its power over the elements to meticulously create itself a body. It then became her, the crafter, and as the crafter with her powers would bring our world life and beauty. She would create plants, then creatures and finally she would create us, the dolls. The first four of our kind were born from her physical body and called the Elementals: Phyra, Isma, Proten, and Ignitis. Each represented an aspect of the Crafters personality and possessed a portion of her power, each controlling one of the elements she had fused with, the crafter herself remaining the sole holder of energy. After the Elementals came the more common dolls, born of pod and seed rather then from the crafter herself. At first they remained near the place of their creation, building up a grand city that still stands today. We call it the Origin. After a while however, as their numbers grew they began to move out farther into world were they used their own powers to build new settlements in all directions outward of the Origin but not leaving the island it was built upon for thousands of years. They lived in such peace and prosperity that the island became known as the Oasis and here each doll lived eternally. The peace was not to last however. Unknown to the crafter and her creations, down just below Mora's surface a being had been slowly coming awake since the crafter's descendants and now it made itself known. Enraged by the presence of unwanted guest, the being who we'd name Notin breached the surface and sent up his dark minions who possessed the bodies of living things and used them against us. Valiantly those early dolls took up arms and alongside the Elementals and the crafter held against the threat from the shadows, but Notin\u2019s power was overwhelming and settlement after settlement fell. Thousands of our precursors were lost and the Crafter, with all her compassion and love for her creations chose to sacrifice her physical form to save all life on Mora. Once again pure energy and one with the world she closed the breeches and trapped Notin and his minions below, preventing them from reinforcing their topside comrades and giving us the reprieve we needed to beat the shadows of destruction back and retake our island. After that first big victory, under the guidance of the Elementals, now the wisest and oldest amongst us, we began to expand rapidly so that we could not be so easily overwhelmed again. For the first time we sailed from the Oasis and settled in unfamiliar foreign lands. We established new settlements and restructured our society to be more efficient, assuring our continued existence. The Authority and its caste system was put in place by the Elementals,and the 1st Arbiter, a doll of pure heart and mind was created to head it and govern us and under her and it we began making new dolls and using the process of strand weaving to manipulate their traits, allowing them to better fit into their caste and better fulfill their roles. Once again Doll kind began to thrive, though our war with the remnants of notins cut off forces, left on the surface when the breeches closed, would continue and still continues thousands of years later. Now a days we have managed to come to a point were most us no longer have to fear for our lives on a daily basis. That said, today doll kind is divided more than ever before. The cities outside of the Oasis and their appointed rulers, the Dons, have become largely independent. Without the Crafter we have also lost our ability to live eternally, and even the mighty Elementals have passed as a result in the years since. This mortality has caused newer generations to seek out the endless lives our ancestor had and some have gone as far as to let their minds be taken in Notins grasp in exchange for power and eternal life. He continues to manipulate the minds of dolls from his realm and we continue to lose cities and towns to treachery and deceit from within. Infighting has also become a problem. Some Dons let their egos outgrow their domains and clash with other of their caste, leading to strife and even war between Dolls. \u00a0Their are also those who don't wish to fulfill their duty to their kind and leave the cities were they are born to lead lives of solitude and sometimes crime in the wilds. However the most recent Arbiter, the fifth to rule, has been the most zealous in her efforts to restore unity under the Authority. She has employed symbols like the Eye of the Authority to instil a sense of dread in our enemies and security in our citizens. She has enforced our new and old laws alike with an attitude of ruthlessness and mercilessness. She directs and coordinates our armies with precision and she does not tolerate the arrogance that some dons have allowed themselves to develop. Still, in spite of her efforts, cities on the frontier line continue to fall and the umbral forces continue to come up with new beast and weapons they use to crack city walls and massacre innocent dolls or take over their bodies and use them against us. However things are,we will continue to fight and we will continue to protect our home and civilization until the the last doll is broken.\n\nIf you are interested here is the Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/dJAvQgR\n\nAnd if you'd like to join the greater community being built, we've got Amino and Kim as well!: \nhttp://aminoapps.com/invite/EX2ZFN00OR\n# RpMora\n\n(We need lots of peeps, so please dont hesitate to up vote us below!)",

            "selftext": "Okay, this is something a lot different from what I normally do. I would like to do a science-fiction/cyberpunk RP. It would partly take place in space. Planets are colonized, space travel is the norm, etc. I can see it being an adventure/thriller, but it would also go off in a pretty dark direction. I want to explore themes like body horror, transhumanism, and so on. There would also be a romance angle. I've never done a sci-fi RP before, so hopefully someone with more experience could help me with the worldbuilding. Just to clarify, I'm female but am playing a male role. I'm seeking either a female partner or a guy who can write female characters well, either is fine with me. My preferred chat platform is discord. Please send me a pm if you're interested, and I'd love to tell you more.",
