            "selftext": "My name is Valentine. I'm male and 21 and I quite enjoy playing around with fantasy roleplay. It is my favorite genre in fiction, most simply put. So over the years I have been roleplaying, I have come upon some ideas that do well, I will give a brief summary of each. If an idea interests you, or you see possibility in one, I hope to talk to you. I prefer to do third person but I can do first, I'm very open schedule wise and flexibility wise, so talking about issues on either should be addressed directly if we have any.\n\nThe Prince's War.\nThere is yet another war ravaging Cenaria. Being the mixed culture, trading hub and center of the continent leaves one's nation open to attacks. The Godking of Khalidor to the North, where the cold, mountainous lands produce minerals and glorious flowers to support their trade with others, a culture the other developed countries view as barbaric, and a misogynist leader, seven princes set to kill each other to take the throne... what could go wrong? You will be playing as a 'spoil' of war, taken to be a servant in the great castle to serve one of these princes.\nThis story has dark themes, magic plays a large part and political issues as well, so be warned if this idea interests you.\n\nThe Heir and their Guardian.\nYou just wanted to help your people. The entire empire of Tharizdun, the continent of Pharsee long ago united as one has begun to crumble. Enemies to civilizations appear in each country below your ill father's reign, your mother dead mere months ago and with no way to help in court you do what you think is best. Against the advice of everyone you know, even your companion, you flee to help the people yourself, only your ally at your side. Your bodyguard, your truest friend and fiercest protector.\nThis idea is based on a D&amp;D setting I have been designing and I made quite of bit of backstory to build up the world and it's state of affairs to build up the setting. You don't need to know D&amp;D to choose this idea, of course.\n\nA God and His Aide.\nThe universe was built in a flash, and you were at my side to witness my creation. Your entire being was afloat outside, a spirit wandering the planes until I found and picked you out of your languid existence. Being a god has it's issues and being less than omnipotent is impractical to each over a full, living universe especially with a council full of High Gods who far outdate myself, rating my performance and considering my actions.\nI know this idea seems a bit wild, but I hope some people pick this one. It's the most unformed idea currently listed and I would be more than happy to explore what I could do with this.\n\nDragon Rider.\nYour character has recently inherited the throne and to best do your job, at the young age that you have been forced to take the seat of power, a dragon has been gifted to you. A mysterious wizard appeared to give the egg to you, the day of your father's death.\nSince then, it has been months into a war, a full on assault on the country of yours. Side by side with your dragon, you must save your country. Is this divine providence? A sinister plot by your enemies? Or simple coincidence? Are dragons despised and feared in Cymbeline or revered and praised? Let's answer these questions.\n\nPlease message me privately to discuss ideas. Thank you very much for reading and I look forward for the responses I may receive. My ideas for the other are mostly unfinished and would appreciate input. If you would kindly name your favorite dessert in your first message, I would appreciate it.\nI would much prefer to roleplay on Discord.",

            "selftext": "**!! Please, 18+ only as I\u2019m uncomfortable writing with minors!!**    \n\nHello, 20 year old female Canadian here! I'm currently a student and will be busy during weekdays in the mornings and afternoons, all evening though I'm free. My timezone is Central Standard Time (GMT-6) I am a night owl as I will probably spend most of my nights online (insomnia suck lmao)\n\nI would love to become friends with the person who is writing with me, so I won't be shy when it comes to conversation. A little bit about me: I like to play video games, write stories, and play the piano.\n\nI **ONLY** have female OCs, canon characters is a whole other story, I'll RP anyone canon from any universe, bet. I'm willing to write one-liners, paragraphs, to novellas. I like the genres romance, horror, mystery, sci-fi and fantasy. Although I am fond of writing in video games, I will not write in Anime universes as I only know a few! Here are some universes I will write in terms of video games: **Fallout 3 / New Vegas / 4, Skyrim, Mass Effect, Outlast, Far Cry, Bioshock, GTA: V, Assassin's Creed, The Walking Dead** etc. just to name a few. I can play a lot of canon characters and I also have an OC for every game universe! It's just plotting I suck at lmao.\n\nNow in terms of writing stories not affiliated with video games/movies/books influence, I'm interested in writing in the modern era (without the hassle of coming up with a whole backstory about the world and stuff lmfao). zombie apocalypse, dystopia (nuclear war, plants take over, alien invasion), and many others, I just don't have a list yet lmao.\n\nPlease PM if you'd be interested in RPing + your discord/email!",

            "selftext": "Firstly, ill probably answer the most prominent question... how the hell do you pronounce that title, And heres your answer: (Cor-Ra-Cah-La-Ki)\n\nOkay, now that that humorous part is out of the way, i can get this warning out the way, this world is the culmination of 8 years of brainstorming, movie watching, deviantart browsing and youtube binging, and i feel like im ready to put it out here... hopefully to get some responses.\n\nFirstly this will be a massive post, im literally gonna be posting that entire world in this one post, so brace for a lot of reading.\n\nSecondly, normally i rp through kik or discord, for this ill probably be limiting it to discord only simply because of the size of this RP.\n\nThis story takes inspiration from RWBY, Animorphs, Fast And Furious (particularly tokyo drift, and not for the reason your thinking), Sword Art Online, Skyrim Elder Scrolls, Japanese &amp; Chinese History, that K/DA Music video, Hunger Games (again not for the reason your probably thinking), attack on titan (no not that reason) and Avatar the last airbender.\n\n***BEGIN WORLD OPENING***\n\nMy world is set in the year 2029, in a completely different timeline to our own universe, in this universe, instead of Britain colonizing most of todays countries, and giving forth to the majority of western culture, its the opposite, the most prominent culture now is eastern culture, the generalised genre for the whole word, is dystopian future, with Neon-punk themes, Japanese culture and technology mixed in with magic.\n\nThe rp takes place in the city of Koracalci, a bustling city on the edge of the capital city of central Australia, all countries developed with major advanceds in technology thanks to the eastern culture fronting the advanced of technolgoy, so most captial cities were in the centre of the landmass.\n\nAustralias captial city was appropriately named Uluru, and was divided into 6 sections, each with a verying demographic of lifestyles, ages, gender and wealth, the center section, being section one, was the wealthiest and consisted mostly of high rise buildings and highly dense cityscapes, the further out you went, the more the life style changed from buisness to industrial to agriculture.\n\nThis world as peaceful as it seemed is no without conflict, in this timeline eastern culture fronted the advances in colonizing because of their knowledge of the Shadoub\u012bsuto (\u30b7\u30e3\u30c9\u30a6\u30d3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8) or Shadow Beast, these creatures are believed to be of a hive mind, seeking out to destroy what humanity has created and return the earth to its natural state, observations and studies have indicated that pollution draws the Shadow Beasts in, due to their black and oozy like appearance, they have been given the common name of Tarrs, they appear in forms of natural earth creatures to mythical beasts.\n\nHumanity, naturally always pushing to advanced themselves, made no action to reduce pollution, they simply built walls around their cities and defended themselves as need be, which created an area of no mans land outside the city walls, called the Shadow Zone, but another side affect of this was the unrest among the population of those cities the political, religious, ethical and cultural differences begun to divide the people, furthering the dividing of the cities to not just physical, but symbolic aswell.\n\nHumanity is not the same either as the humanitiy we have in our world, in this world, Humans are born with a spirit animal, and not in the symbolic sense, but a literal sense, each spirit animal is unique to that person, different in appearance, colour, personality and power, each spirit animal also has an elememt its linked to, as time goes by one can learn to harness and control their spirit animal and element, pushing themselves to a stage where they can physichally become their spirit animal, or their animal embodied by their element.\n\nThe more one masters their spirit animal, the more it becomes physichally shown, because only so many animals exist, different tribes and factions were form, congregating those of similar animal spirits, these soon became known as the Anamalia Factions, which ill get to soon, the physical display of one mastering their spirit animal is in the form of naturally occurring tribal like tattos, the tattos are the colour of the persons animal and the style is unqiue to that animal species, so many people can have the same type of tatto and colour, but what truly makes each unique is when they show off their mastery, using your elemental powers causes your tattos to glow and give off an aura of your element over them, for someone of a blue fire spirit their tattos would have blue flames emerging from them, purple earth would have like a cracked desert ground on them, commonly black with the respective colour illuminating the cracks.\n\nAlong with them having such unique powers, the majority of those who chose to master their abilities, chose to channel their energy through varying forms of martial arts and weaponary, they also tended to avoid most modern day weaponary like firearms and explosives as their own abilites rivalled that of a gun.\n\nAt night time, the tattos give off a distinct neon glow due to the lack of UV light hindering their energy movement, naturally your spirit has enough energy to constantly have your tattos in a state of \"aural display\" but the UV light hinders that, but at night time, they give off an beautiful clean glow (yes like that K/DA music video with the glowing face paint).\n\nA bonus that is gained from ones spirit animal come without requiring any training, the Aura that their spirit gives off forms a shield around their body, mind and soul, absorbing any damage and healing wounds, the amount of damage the aura can absorb or repair is dependent on the person.\n\nAs time has gone by an goverments used censuses to track and record the data of people's spirit animals, a trend was notcied... the Wolf was among one of them rarest spirit animals, Dragons, Snakes and Tigers being among the most common, in regards to elements, the most common being, Water, Fire and Earth, the rarest being Lightning.\n\nFor each of the animals there is a faction, and with 6 divsions in the city, there are 6 respective factions which i shall now list below (these factions are basically like the chinese mafia out of tokyo drift, varying levels of activity), please note aswell, these factions do not represent the demographic of that section, its simply the faction that is the ruling gang of that section.\n\nDivsion 1, Capital Buisness Section: The Serpentine, Snake Faction, Led by Marcus Gaskov, Purple Shadow Snake Spirit, Negative Alignment, Criminal Activity, Assault, Robbery and Murder.\n\nDivision 2, Retail Section: The Claw, Tiger Faction, Led by Emelia Jacobs, White Lightining Tiger Spirit, Positive Alignment, Lawful Activity, Specialist Security, Policing and Community Aid.\n\nDivision 3, Highrise Apartments Section: Wings Of Fire, Dragon Faction, Led by Antonio Devari, Red Fire Dragon Spirit, Neutral Alignment, Vigilante Activity, Rioting, Vandalism and Justice Enforcing.\n\nDivsion 4, Residential Section: The Murder, Avian Faction, Led by Alex Murcs, Black Wind Crow Spirit, Negative Alignment, Criminal Activity, Theft, Identity Fraud and NFC Skimming.\n\nDivision 5, Industrial Section: Pride Of The People, Lion Faction, Led by Ben Jacobs, Orange Earth Lion Spirit, Positive Alignment, Civillian Activity, Emergency Service, Security and Heavy Construction.\n\nDivsion 6, Agricultural Section: Gods Of The Sky, Mythical Avians Faction, Led by Lauren Pol, Blue Water Thunderbird Spirit, Neutral Alignment, Civilian Activity, Messengers, Community Aid and Medical.\n\nThere is a seventh faction that exists, but its a generalised one for those who train and master their spirits, but dont align with any faction, they are known as the Renegades, renegades mainly inhabit the tops of the city walls, and sometimes even outside the city walls.\n\nEach faction has control over a particular zone, how they choose to rule it is dictated by the mentality of the leader, each faction has its own form of deciding a leader, whether through strength, intelligence or agility, one trend is consistent, they all have to be adaptable to change to stay as the leader.\n\n***END WORLD OPENING***\n\nNow you maybe wondering how does this massive world, get turned into an RP, what plot is there to follow, and my answer to that is...who said there was a plot, it can be anything we want, maybe the Serpentine decide they want more than 1 section of the city, maybe the shadow beasts begin evolving and starting finding ways into the city, maybe a goverment agency begins targeting those who chose to enhance their abilities to maintain control of the population, its all up to you.\n\nNow how do you get into this RP, its pretty simply, your gonna need to create your own charachter, youll need to gather a ref pic, send a short bio, describe your spirit animal, colour and power, and then you get to choose your role.\n\nNow bear in mind, you aren't restricted to anything, if you want to be a leader of one of the factions, then you can, you can choose to make your own spirit setup, or use the ones already there, you dont have to use that leaders name either, but you will have to follow the factions alignment and animal types.\n\nIf your interested in exploring this world and roleplaying in it, then let me know, you can DM and ill provide my discord user and we can get this on the road, my charachter will be discussed once we get into the planning, as my charachters intro is the starter ill use to kick off the RP.\n\nHope to hear from you all soon.",

            "selftext": "__Hi everyone and thanks for taking the time to check out my post.__\n\nAs I have found it quite useful in constructing these in the past, I will be outlining the two main characters I have in mind for this idea first, then explain the setting and finally give you an idea what I am looking for.\n\n### Without a voice is a singer still a singer?\n\nHer career had been at its all time high. Her fans ranged from teenagers discovering her music now to the precious late 20s early 30s demographic, people her own age.\n\nEach album an instant chart topper, each single a hit on radio stations worldwide, each tour sold out within minutes of tickets going live. She had it all, money, fame, everything the young girl dreaming of a life in the big cities had dreamed of.\n\nAnd then, one morning she woke up with a cold. as usual her voice was all but gone, her throat sore, her nose runny. Nothing to worry about. Certainly not an affliction that a few days rest couldn't cure. And sure enough the cold went, her throat no longer scratchy, her nose clear. Yet her voice never returned.\n\nShe could speak just fine, sure. But anything any attempt to conjure a tune and an unbearably sharp pain would stab at her vocal chords. Understandably panic ensued. Innumerable doctors, of increasing specialisation and renown, later, she was left with the most infuriating of diagnoses. _\"Idiopathic\"_ The medical profession's fancy term for, \"we don't know what it is, what caused it or how to fix it\"\n\nPanic turned to depression. The machinery of show business kicked into gear and within a month, her label, who had been wooing her with contracts, trying to lock down her next album deal, had liquidated her. Her tours were cancelled, talk show invitations rescinded and soon enough she was well and truly out.\n\nNot that most would have considered her fate truly tragic of course. She had been the single most profitable artist prior to her fall. Her wealth was considerable, even in the hedonistic hills of Hollywood.\n\nYet, with it all gone, she no longer felt at home amongst those who still had _it_, whatever _it_ was. Her music had been her life, even with all the money and fame, she had always loved it best. No longer able to sing her songs, she couldn't have bared to pen them for someone else.\n\nThe decision to leave, to turn her back on her idyllic California estate and the penthouse in New York, took her little time. She had her chief of staff, in what would likely be her final act - for she couldn't see what she's need a staff for now - inquire about suitable accommodation in the one place she'd always imagined she might one day live. England, more specifically, the luscious southern countryside of the home counties.\n\nShe wasn't sure what exactly drew her to that small island across the ocean. She'd visited during her tours of course, but only the larger cities, London, Manchester, Birmingham and the like. Maybe it was the idyllic pictures she had seen or the TV series romanticising that part of the country, but something had always drawn her to the rolling hills of southern England.\n\nSoon enough a number of promising advertisements made their way to her, including a peculiar listing for a country villa, formally part of, but offered for rent separately from a much larger estate.\n\n### _Noblesse oblige_, whether one like it or not\n\nFor most of his life, the heir to Edgerton estate had despised his father, its lord. Had anyone dared to ask why, he likely couldn't have named a single, determining moment that inspired the arctic climate between them. It wasn't so much the man himself he hated, but what he stood for, what he represented: An ancient breed of aristocrats, who, defying the changing times, still clung onto power and wealth in modern England.\n\nThe Edgerton estate was about as old and esteemed as one might find. The family inheriting its name had been its keepers for centuries. Through wars, civil and foreign, throughout the reigns of many a king and queen, the lords of Edgerton manor had help positions of great importance and power.\n\nThe fortune, amassed over the estate's long history - much of it through means looked less than fondly on today - the family enterprise, now no longer in shipping and manufacturing, but the financial markets, even the hereditary peerage granting Lord Edgerton a seat in the house of lords, all remained to this day.\n\nThe son of the man currently reigning over this empire could not have loathed more what he was to inherit one day. In his mind his family represented everything he felt was holding back his country from becoming what his generation wished it could be.\n\nDeep down he knew that beyond this, his disdain for his father was rooted in the man's indifference to his mother, the one creature on this earth he had felt closest to. Until illness took her from him and had him sent away, across the country to boarding school. When he emerged, years later, as a young man, from the wood panelled halls of Eton, he wished nothing more than to leave it all behind.\n\nDenouncing his father's wishes he pursued a degree in the sciences, something the Lord of Edgerton Manor had little use of, or so he was told. Four years at university did much to lighten his spirit. He had almost forgotten the weight on his shoulders, knowing that one day he would be called upon to take his father's place.\n\nHis passion for science, another great treasure university had bestowed upon him, lead him to a career in research. He was three years into his doctoral studies when his old life returned to haunt his soul.\n\nHis father, by no means of old age and of sound health, had passed away to the great dismay of both his household and the English nobility at large. Having always hoped he'd have time to prepare, maybe even find an escape, the son now found himself burdened overnight with his father's privileges and duties.\n\nAfter resisting for a month or so, he soon realised that he stood no chance, one man against centuries of tradition and the fate of many a person in the balance. For while the business was largely conducted with only marginal oversight of the lord, the estate of Edgerton Manor still had in its employ more than a hundred residents of the villages surrounding its expansive lands.\n\nWith a heavy heart the new Lord Edgerton had to abandon his studies and return \"home\". Settling into the Manor and getting a grasp of what would likely constitute the daily routine of his remaining years left him irritable and depressed.\n\nOne of the many unwelcome tasks he found himself settled with was to decide how to handle his mother's estate. The large, country house, situated on the edge of Edgerton Park, the local name for the gardens, lakes and woodland surrounding the main manor, had passed to him when he lost her. His only fond childhood memories were all set in its gardens, lovingly kept by his mother, who was also the heroine of each story.\n\nAfter deliberating for a week, he decided that he could not justify keeping the housekeeper and gardener charged with its upkeep employed if the house was to remain unoccupied. Thus he begrudgingly allowed the property to be listed for rent, under the strict stipulation that any prospective tenant would be carefully vetted by him personally.\n\nIn case someone has wondered, I have (loosely) based the female character on Taylor Swift (wait don't run for the hills just yet!) and the male on my own experiences going to a painfully posh boarding school and interacting with people (usually parents) from that world. Have you clicked away yet? No? Good! First of all don't worry, I only went to school with those people, I'm not exactly one of them (too poor). As for the obnoxious reference to a celebrity, please don't think that I'm simply looking to live out some sad fantasy featuring exactly her and no one else. I include Ms. Swift (albeit begrudgingly) only so that you might get a better idea of the kind of age, fame, etc. I have in mind for the character. Feel free to make her your own in every way!  \n\n### The setting (other than \"in England\")\n\nAs the tag indicates, I see this as a slow-burning, realistic romance. Both characters have had a rather bleak time getting to where we would be picking up the story, so there is plenty of development to be had.\n\nI'm also always looking to expand a story beyond the confines of just a single genre. I for example see these two characters helping each other cope with their respective situations. Their new environment and eventual relationship leaves things open for all sorts of storylines to be explored.\n\nI can see there being elements of mystery, intrigue, adventure and much more as the story develops. And it's worth noting that I consider \"long-term\" to truly mean __long-term__. I find that if the story grips my imagination (and I have a good writing partner to scheme with) I will keep having new ideas.\n\n### My \"style\" (or lack thereof)\n\nNow even though I appear to have written a short story about each character, I hope I haven't come across like a dictator. I do in fact highly value world and character building as a team sport. Any potential partner of mine should know that I want to them to feel like they can truly make their character their own.\n\nIn addition to this, I am always happy to discuss ideas and suggestions for additions or alterations to the plot and general universe of the story. After all roleplaying is supposed to be __collaborative__ storytelling!\n\nThat being said I do have a \"style\" that I stick to while writing, so if you are interested, I ask you at least consider agreeing to it as a rough frame. I write in third person, past tense, and usually in reasonable detail and length (who would've guessed huh...). Literacy is rather important to me, so if you enjoy a very fast paced, short reply style, we probably wouldn't match too well.\n\n### Wrapping things up (omg finally!)\n\nFirst of all, if you have made it all the way down here, congratulations and thank you! Give yourself a pat on the back! I do truly appreciate people taking the time to read through my ramblings.\n\nIf you are still around, I take it I have managed to at least slightly peak your interest. (Yay!) If you have questions, suggestions, comments or (constructive) criticism but aren't sure if this is the roleplay for you yet, please don't hesitate to contact me!\n\nIf on the other hand, you've come away from all of this with the firm belief that you and this story are made for each other... same goes, please send me a message and say hello!\n\nI look forward to your messages.\n\nx",

English is *not* my first language, so please be patient if my grammar isn't the best.  \n\n\nI have a tendency to write long, lengthy paragraphs.

With that being said, because of these types of responses I like to make along with the fact that I'm working two different jobs, and am in nursing school, I'll try my best to post at least 3 times. Some days I'm more available (like today), and some days I'm completely swamped (like yesterday).  \n\n\nSome things that are of interest to me:\n\n* slice of life (so many different ideas can come from this.

            "selftext": "Hello reader, I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful day today. I appreciate you clicking or tapping on my title to see what all I have to say. Because of that, I\u2019ll try my best to keep this an interesting and engaging read for you. First of all, my name is Josh, I am 19 years old (almost 20!), and I am currently pursuing a degree for music. My schedule is fairly free except for early mornings on Tuesdays and Thursday\u2019s, but any other time I should be good unless I say otherwise. Now, let\u2019s get into the juicy bits! \n\nToday I am looking for a specific partner(s), but I should explain what that specific part is about. I want a writer who has a particular skill with word play, descriptive writing, and including literary elements to jerk emotions. Words, sentences, and their structure has always been a major interest of mine which has led me into writing and roleplaying. I can\u2019t get over the fact how a certain pronunciation of sounds from your throat can invoke sadness, lust, happiness, or any other emotion. I want a roleplay that involves plenty of this descriptive writing, beautifully structured sentences with flair that can make me feel those emotions. So, if you think you\u2019re capable of doing that with me, send me a message so we can discuss! \n\nAs far as a plot goes, I\u2019m not too picky. We can come up with something, or if you have an idea, please present it! I\u2019d love to also hear about your guys\u2019 interest with this phenomenon, tell me how it makes you feel too. Also, I\u2019m totally okay with NSFW themes if you guys want to bring some ideas pertaining that. But anyways, thanks for reading my pretty long post. I hope I get some great writers in my inbox! If you read this far, pretty please include your favorite emoji in your message. ",

            "selftext": "Greetings! So I have been roleplaying for two years now but have never gotten around to setting up my own server/group. The last time I tried to do something like this, it didn't work out so well. Now, with better management, I have decided to give it another go. Now, about the setting. Yes I know, you're probably thinking, \"Oh God, not another Old West theme. Lemme guess, you're Arthur Morgan?\" Well I can assure you that this is NOT one of those RP's. I am striving to make this a realistic, original and bloody (some NSFW material. Just a heads up) story with plenty of danger, drama, romance and grief. Think Deadwood or Hell on Wheels. \n\nThe year is 1867. The nation is still broken following a bloody civil war, a conflict that has taken too many sons and the hopes and dreams of every American look in a new direction: west. Across the great plains, a steel beast thunders across a vast and untamed frontier, inhabitied only by nomadic savage and wild animals. Soon after the completion of the permanent railroad town of Cheyenne, mysterious loners, corrupt and cutthroat businessmen and ladies looking for a new life the hard way have entered the settlement's muddy streets. Among them is a young ranch hand, Nolan Quinn, an ex soldier looking to make a future by helping to build the largest cattle empire west of the Mississippi. Through his journey, he makes friend and foe alike, ally and enemy, in a bloody struggle of greed, lust and gunfire over the newly settled territory. Meanwhile,  in the country to the north, Native tribes clash with troops of the United States Army in a desperate attempt to protect their homeland at all costs. \n\nI have discord, where a group might work better, but I recommend messaging me on here first via PM. All are welcomed as long as you are 18+, have fairly decent RP experience, a decent knowledge of the Old West and can fill out a character bio sheet when given. I hope that this turns into something new and unique and hope to hear from you soon. See you! ",

            "selftext": "Heyyo! You can call me Atomic, or your next rp partner, whatever suits your fancy. I\u2019m 19 on the verge of 20 thank you very much. I live in the Mountain Standard time zone, also I\u2019m fluent in English as well, I\u2019d prefer you are as well. \n\nSo here\u2019s the dealio-shemlio, I have two genres floating around in my beautiful head and was hoping I could find a pal that shares my thoughts. Although I\u2019d like to have some overall requirements for both rps. \n\n-First! As I said please be fluent in English! Not to mention literate or at least semi literate. I write roughly around 3-5 paragraphs a post, I hope you can do the same. \n\n-Two! Please play a female character! You don\u2019t have to be a female in real life, but this is a female on female rp. Although if you really want to play a male character, I could after a lot of convincing. \n\n-Three! Please be 18+, I know I\u2019m not 21 but I\u2019m not below 17 either. This could get slightly saucy. ;) \n\n-Four! Last but not least I was hoping we could be open to a bit of romantics. The plot doesn\u2019t have to full revolve around it but I would like there be to present in it. \n\nAlrighty! Now that the basics are out of the way here are the two plots. \n\n1. The first is a supernatural slice of life rp. This would be something along the lines of your character moving into a new town looking for a new life as well. What she finds though isn\u2019t exactly what was expected, the town seems... off. Not to mention her neighbor! The woman she seems to be just about as off as the rest of this town, if not more. \n\nYour character would slowly discover the strange people of the town as well as the neighbor next door. Where you want to go from there is up to you. Something more sinister could be on the rise, or it could be something more normal with a bit of a unusual tangent. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n2. A open world fantasy role play! I was thinking something like a band of traveling adventures go out to explore the world. I especially enjoy desert environments in fantasy rps, as well as unique races! \n\nI was going to play between two characters one of them being a summoner mage and the other being a Tiefling bard. I would prefer you have a general idea of DND as I will be taking most of my knowledge from DND. I haven\u2019t created a really in depth world in all honesty but if you would like to delve into world creation for a bit I\u2019m up for that as well. \n\n\n\nWell those are what I leave you with, my two plots and the requirements I have. So please! Contact me, I\u2019ve been in need of a role play and people really haven\u2019t been putting up things on 1x1 rps. So shock me! \n\nShoot me a message and I\u2019ll give ya my discord! I don\u2019t expect anything special for a first message. (I think that\u2019s a bit annoying) \n\n",

Some guilds have taken over entire countries, and NYC is slowly falling victim to the same fate! In this roleplay, bring in your character, weather assassin or high school student, you can still have an interesting time here :D   \n \n\nUnfortunately, right now we only have 4 people, so i decided to advertise here :) This is my first time advertising here, so please don't be harsh if i got the format completely wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPM me if you're interested and i hope you have a wonderful day! :D ",

I just wanted to put one of my ideas out there; this will also be one of my first GMing experiences as a role player too.\n\nThe premise of this RP is that all mythological pantheons exist in the same universe, as well as they doomsday they all prophesied. If you do your research, across many doomsday myths, giant snakes are often involved, the sun is usually swallowed or destroyed, and etc. ; long story short, they have many similarities that might not be a coincidence.\n\n7 villains of the world's pantheons have joined forces in possessing human hosts to bring about this Armageddon. 5 gods of each pantheon have chosen your character to use as a vessel, imparting some of their most powerful abilities to your character despite their waning power in the modern age.\n\nThis RP should be a good time; there are plenty of beasts and beings to meet along the way, new experiences for the gods your character is connected to as they see life in the perspective of a mortal in the 21st century, and a worldwide scavenger hunt for pieces of the device that will bring about the end of the world. It'll be dark, fun, and fantastical as the world of gods and mortals collide. You can PM me if you're interested and I'll send the discord link. \n\nHope you'll join along for the ride!\n\nYours,\n\nLyra ;)",

Her foster family owns and operates a circus and she is the star of the show. On the day of her 15th birthday she decides to venture from home to search for her real family which leads her to Japan. While there she befriends with Rio who offers to take her to Tokyo, yet soon she is attacked by mysterious enemies who work for a shady organization who are after her and have a key to her past. She possesses the legendary Beast Bracelet in which when she collects the legendary Beasts (Four guardians like in Chinese and japanese mythology) she can possess the power of the elements. Soon she and her new friends are in for an adventure of a lifetime to uncover the mysteries of an ancient civilization that holds a great treasure, defeat the organization who wishes to bring chaos to the world and uncover Diamond\u2019s past.   \n\n\nPretty sweet huh? Also Diamond is a rookie shaman and she becomes Rio\u2019s protege as she looks up to him as Aniki (Big brother). Also Diamond has a unique ability to talk to animals and has some spirits of her own-A tiger and a monkey, yet soon she begins to get more when she and her friends journey to find the legendary beasts.  \n\n\nRequirements:  \n\n\n\\+ Must know the characters well  \n\n\n\\+ Must know the show/manga Well (Seen every episode (English and Japanese with subs) and read the manga)  \n\n\n\\+ Flexible hours   \n\n\n\\+ Knows how to role play and puts lots of detail, emotion, etc in it   \n\n\n\\+ Accepts OCS (And has some interesting OCS that MIGHT flex into the story-If you have a Shaman King OC or whatnot)   \n\n\n\\+ Has interesting ideas to spice up the story. Anyway its all about having fun and embracing the love of Shaman by making our own adventures.   \n\n\nSo if anyone is interested-please message me about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I am Fairygal11 on deviantart so you can contact me there too :3",

            "selftext": "# Introduction and Rules\n\nHello everyone! I am a 27 year old woman living in Canada, and I have been roleplaying for the better part of 17 years. I have a few roleplay preferences. **First**, I like about 1-3 paragraphs per post, and prefer quality over quantity. In the heat of fervant replies, posts may become shorter, but should be no less descriptive. **Secondly**, I am not strict about how frequently you post, but I prefer a few times per week. I live a very busy life (full time school, part time job, and two part time volunteer positions atop a social life). I cannot post every day. My favourite way to play is to schedule certain \"online\" times with my partner which allows us to reply to each other live, but this is not necessary and not always feasible. **Third**, age is important to me. I am 27, and my partners must always be over the age of 18, with no exceptions. **Fourth**, respect is key in our engagement. I will respect your boundaries, and you will respect mine, and we will consider these boundaries as subject to change at any time. **Fifth,** and finally, we are both here to have fun. If we lost interest, or stop having fun, let's discuss it. Open communication is absolutely key to success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Story\n\nThis roleplay will center around two characters. Two protagonists. Plus, a cast of NPCs we can either share or play individually. I would like to create 2 characters with a particular archetype. Your character will be.. whatever you like! A humble farmer? Merchant? Knight? Prince? Artist? I would like to play a beached mermaid, who nust be cared for by your character. Once I am strong enough, I will share a secret with you that will set us on an adventure across the vast land of the world we build together. I want this story to primarily focus on our character's realtionship, while the plot will be a way to push them into unusual scenarios to challenge and change that relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am open to two-way world building, but I'd like to keep things relatively simple. I would love to build our world around ancient magics which rest on race. We can discuss this more together!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to reply to this post or message me, even if we have spoken before! My mailbox is sometimes flooded, so please don't be discouraged if I have no replied to you before.",

If the situation calls for it I can crank out many more though on a typical day and I'm not describing someone/place for the first time, itll most likley be 1 or 2 paragraph responses. The length may also very if the current situation is very dialog heavy and in the need of both parties to respond to continue though I have no problems with my partner taking control my character to continue the plot. And while I won't hold you to the same regard, whether you're a newcomer into rp or just having a rough day, please dont one line me. Any amount will do, just make it feel like you put some semblance of effort into it.\n* I do rp NSFW content though I prefer it appropriate to the situation and not just smut for smuts sake. \n* Lastly I do prefer being an original character vs that of a cannon character though I'm willing to flex and bend on this depending on the fandom or idea presented.\n\nId prefer to discuss one on one about what kind of rp you're interested in, I've done just about everyone of them from Star Wars, to RWBY, to Mass Effect style, to simple medieval rps. And while I am willing to do the whole \"Man saves girl because girl is special,\" theme, I'd like to have my partner be a bit more involved than that. If it's an action scene help me fight, or maybe save me from danger. If it's a political drama, get involved. Don't just sit on the sidelines throwing out one meaningful shout in the middle of court, hoping that will sway and woo the hearts of everyone there.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to read this, or skim it.

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nWhat I am looking for at the moment is a Roleplay set in the **Battletech** (or **Mechwarrior** if you prefer) universe. I am fairly open to ideas and settings, although I also have a few of my own. While this is a Tabletop RPG based universe, I'm looking for free-form writing rather than a system-based game.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here",

Gain the favour of the gods, learn incredible superhuman abilities, become a legendary hero, and create a place for yourself in the most immersive game ever made.    \n\n\n \\*Not historically accurate, multiple borders, time layers and servers exist with limited cross play opportunities.

I\u2019m completely open to brainstorming ideas together, but I thought I\u2019d pitch an idea as well! Please PM me if you\u2019re interested! \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy character is known as the \u2018single friend\u2019 in his friend group. It didn\u2019t used to be as noticeable, but now that he\u2019s approaching his mid-twenties, he\u2019s seeing more and more of his friends settling down with long-term partners. My character uses his passion for music as his excuse; he spends his days making money at odd jobs around the city so that at nights he can perform at bars and clubs, trying to make ends meet while making a name for himself. And hell, dating in New York City is expensive. He definitely didn\u2019t have neither the time nor the money for a girlfriend. \n\nYet, my character\u2019s friends are always looking to set him up. It was a Friday night and he was invited to an engagement party for a close friend of his. Unknown to him, she was looking to set him up with a friend there that she just knew would be *perfect* for him. \n\nSo from there I was thinking our two characters end up hitting it off really well, eventually going home together. One thing leads to another, and the next thing they know, their one-night-stand has resulted in a pregnancy, which neither character is emotionally or financially prepared for. \n\nWe can definitely talk about details more and change things up if you\u2019re interested! I wanted to give you freedom to describe your character however you want. \n\nThanks for reading! :)",

            "selftext": "Hey, you! Yeah, you. Are you sick of Blizzard's pitiful storytelling? Or how about a lack of compelling writers within the Warcraft Roleplay community? Or maybe you just don't want to play what is, objectively, a stale game right now but still want your fill of Azeroth? Then look no further!\n\nI'm looking for a partner, or perhaps two (if there's actually more than one person interested) for a World of Warcraft-based roleplay! For starters, I would like to outline how this roleplay will be formed:\n\n* It will consist of two writers: The GM and the Player. The GM (me), or DM if you're into tabletop RPG's, is a person who tells the narrative and forms the world around the player's character. Because this will be a GM Roleplay, it means that I will control all aspects of the story while you're given freeroam to explore Azeroth, almost as if it were your own pen-and-paper RPG (or video game, for that matter)!\n\n* It will take place on discord. I like to organize my channels and everything within a discord server to make everything easier! And, because I'm a very interactive GM, we really need the organization to keep the roleplay going!\n\n* It'll be a fast-paced roleplay. Okay, well maybe not 'fast-paced' in traditional terms. I absolutely hate waiting twelve hours for a response every single day. I reply anywhere between five and twenty times per day, so I'm looking for a partner that is also interested in writing (at least) nearly as much as me. My posts are generally overflowing with detail, imagery, and emotion, so I'll definitely give preference to people who seem like they mesh better with me! That aside, I do reply with 300-1,000 word posts most of the time, aside from the occasion where posts are generally more dialogue-based.\n\n* It'll be sort of like an open-world, or like a sandbox. I refuse to put you on a set path! If you start off in an immersive plot in Stormwind, I won't force you to stay there! Even if there's an incredible story going on, I'll allow you to travel across the world if your character can acquire the means to do so. However...\n\n* I do like my worlds to be dangerous! I like to punish all characters as per their actions. My characters are especially subject to brutality, while I'll mostly only ever give yours short-term injuries. The exceptions to that, however, are plain stupid decisions or requests to have the character injured!\n\nWith that out of the way, I'm not too picky on what era we play in as long as it takes place during the MMO-Timeline. While I have read up on the WC1-3 stories, I've never actually played those games so I'm not familiar enough to build a world around them. Ideally, I would **love** to write a story that spans the entire life of WoW, starting in the Vanilla world and progressing all the way up until The War of the Thorns, or BFA in general (and beyond). With this way, considering it takes about fifteen years, we would absolutely have to break the story down into several chapters and include time skips and, of course, roleplay together for quite a while!\n\nI'll conclude there, but I'd like to tell you a bit about me first! I'm an adult male from the United States. I recently finished school and I run a small business for myself whilst also working part-time at another job. However, I'm planning for a big move around this time next year, so I'll be quitting my job and slowing down on productivity after the summer. Ideally, I'd love a partner that'll stick around long enough to keep me occupied later in the year as well, but if not, then I'll be posting here more frequently! Aside from my job, I (obviously) love writing! I'm a huge fitness junkie despite my borderline addictive video-game habits, and I think I'm a generally fun guy to talk to. \n\nPlease message me if you're interested at all! And please, for the absolute love of all that is good, mention your favorite animal in the subject so I know you didn't just see 'world of warcraft' and decide to throw a message at me. Thanks! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "A bit about me:  \n\n\nI've been role-playing and ERP'ing for almost a decade and have a high preference to fantasy plots. I have no issues with cliches and troupes, and do enjoy a bit of romance in my story lines. I generally average 5-10 sentences, but life gets busy and I can be lazy occasionally. Sometimes I can write 4 paragraphs and other times I barely manage 3 sentences depending on my interest level and availability.  I prefer playing straight female characters, but will occasionally play a straight male or a bisexual/lesbian female, I simply tend to avoid LGBT characters due to personal issues, but enjoy playing them from time to time. I am: flexible, forgetful, full of surprises, and often free. Something to take into account is that due to brain damage I have issues with my memory, and am often very forgetful so you may need to remind me of a thing or two.  \n\n\nMy ideal partner would be a flexible male with prior experience or a hell of a lot of talent (I don't mind teaching if you're open to it though) who enjoys fantasy and Sci-fi. They would also not mind if I take a bit of time to reply, or occasionally poof at random (I have a stressful home life, but I try not to let that interfere with roleplay). They would also be willing to remind me of things and not shame me for being forgetful.  \n\n\nThank you in advance, I hope I will be hearing from some of you soon!  \nMy timezone is PST.  \n\n\nMy main platform is discord, and my user is Minthe#5171 . Feel free to random add me and shoot me a PM! :)",

            "selftext": "First time making a post on this sub, so bear with me.\n\n**Quick Notes:**\n\n* I'm currently working, so I can't promise I'll reply everyday. I try to aim to every other day at most. Though if the roleplay ends up being incredibly lengthy, I aim for one post a week. I'm flexible on this and will obviously grant you the same respect. \n* I like my roleplays to have sustenance in both plot and replies. I don't need ten paragraphs, but I do need enough to work with to keep my muse up, you know what I mean? Small descriptions, thoughts, all that fun stuff. \n* I'm looking for a partner who either wants to come up with a plot and characters, or somebody who's been dying to play around in a world they've created/won't mind if I chuck a character into their universe. \n* I'd prefer to RP over Discord. I've never roleplay through Google Docs, but there's a first time for everything, I suppose.\n* My character will be female, but I have no reservations about what gender your character is, or the gender you are IRL.\n* Please be 18+. This has nothing to do with writing, I'm just more comfortable roleplaying with adults. \n\nNow, onto more details! I can play in any scenario, from science-fiction to medieval fantasy, the only thing I need is some sort of adventure. Survivors in a post-apocalyptic world? A Prince and Gypsy coming together to defeat a Great Evil and cure the forsaken lands? I'm in! X-Men-esque mutants waking up one day with superpowers? Yes, please. The only setting I'm really bad with are real historic time periods. Too much pressure to know every detail. I love learning about History, but not so much roleplaying it. That being said, I'm not opposed to having a roleplay influenced by a time period(s). I'm completely okay with modern settings, though!\n\nI guess I'm looking for a sense of excitement and wonder. I really want to create something great or be part of something great. Whether romance is involved or not isn't my main concern. I absolutely love character connections of any sort (siblings, friends, enemies, etc.). \n\nOn the topic of romance, though, if somebody is interested in having a roleplay with romance as the center, I do love my slow-burns. The insta-love doesn't do it for me. I don't *need* a romance-heavy roleplay, but I won't turn one away, either. It just needs to be good and juicy, y'know? Something with sustenance that doesn't feel forced or too fake.\n\nIf any of this interests you, do send me a message telling me a bit about your roleplaying preferences, and what you're interested in roleplaying! Communication is so, so important, and a great roleplay takes two heads to create. I'm usually brimming with ideas and I would love to find a partner who can be as excited as I am.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I recently watched this Korean drama \"Because this is my first life\" and I really liked the contract marriage! If you're unaware what that is, basically you get married not for love but for something else and have a contract that determines the context of the marriage. In this case I want to do it similarly to the show in the sense that they don't tell anyone its a contract marriage and when infront of others act like a couple. This should make some fun and awkard scenerios! We can hammer out other details via PM. \n\nWhat I'm looking for: \n\n* 18+. Look I know you can lie on the internet and if someone tells me they're over 18 when they aren't, I won't know the difference. But I work in education. If it somehow comes out that I'm doing anything mildly NSFW with someone underage, I could lose my job, not to mention any other legal ramifications. I don't want to lose my job. Please don't make me lose my job. \n* I don't mind if your gender, but I want to play a female character and am looking for someone to play a male character. \n* I don't mind NSFW, obviously, but I want it to be natural in progression. I won't do NSFW only rps.\n* Casual length. I usually do a paragraph or less, excluding introductions and beginnings. I don't mind if my partner writes more, but I feel no need to match length if I can get my point across more concisely. My partner shouldn't feel obligated either. \n* A decent writer. If I notice in the first few exchanges that you aren't a consistent writer or that you write like a 14 y/o who just discovered fanfiction, I'm not gonna continue. \n* I write in 3rd person/past tense and I'm not really willing to change that. I could maybe write in present tense if my partner is insistent but the 3rd person isn't going to change ever. \n\nAbout me: I'm 22. As I said above, I work in education so I usually can't reply until after 3 or 4 unless I just happen to have work off. OOC chat isn't something I'm used to but I do think it can be fun! \n\nIf you're intterested PM me! I should be responding quickly. ",

            "selftext": "Hello to everyone who clicks on this post! I'll start off with a little bit about myself. My name is Ivan, I'm a male and currently looking for a partner to roleplay with. I'm 19 years old, going on 20, and have been roleplaying for approximately 4-5 years now. Some of the roleplays I've done consisted of mostly fandoms. RWBY, Red Vs. Blue, Halo, Final Fantasy X, as well as a many others. I use OC characters mostly since I'm not so good with canon characters. Roleplay that hold original stories, characters, worlding building, ect are my absolute favorites! Sci-Fi, fantasy, modern real life, action filled, romance, apocalypse, NSFW(must be 18+), just about anything with a good story with thrilling and touching moments interests me. So if you're interested, I'd love to create a whole new roleplay! So share some ideas and I will too. \n\nNow onto what I prefer in a roleplay partner. I understand you all have your own lives with jobs and such, I do too, but I'd like to find someone who's pretty active every day. 1-5 posts a day isn't something I'm fond of. Weekdays, I can post anytime before and after work, during work if I'm able, so I'd like to keep the roleplay going long term. Weekends are free game, I can post mostly whenever unless I'm busy with other things. I'll let you know if that's the case. Must be at least, semi-lit, a paragraph or two each post, something I can really respond to and be descriptive in some of your posts. Be willing to use multiple characters and add their own twists and conflicts to the story, I can't keep it interesting by myself lol. No god modding or auto hitting, unless certain situations, you know, the usual \"no doing this\" stuff that is usually in most roleplay rules. Please be open to any creative criticism, as will I. I like having things make sense to keep that realistic aspect of the roleplay. Also prefer you to be 18 or older for any romance or mature gore scenes that may happen in the roleplay. As well as, be 18 or older overall. Character sheets and such will be made during our discussion when making the roleplay. \n\nIf you've made it this far into the reading, thank you! And I hope your interested. I mainly roleplay on Kik but I do have the Discord app. Although, I've had it for a while but never really used it so I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to Discord at the moment haha. Anyways, if you're interested in roleplaying an originally built roleplay or fandom, (don't be afraid to suggest fandoms to me, I'm open to many things!) Then PM me. Send me your name, age, gender, and contact info for either platform. Kik or Discord. There we will talk more about what we can make of a fun roleplay and perhaps new friends!",

            "selftext": "I would like to GM a MHA/BNHA RP for someone's OC.\n\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\nWell I will give someone a selection of 3 quirks to pick from. They cannot edit or tweak them. I will list its advantages and disadvantages but will refrain from going into a lot detail. Why go about it this way? Well for starters, characters in the anime don't pick their own quirk, it's random/genetic as far as I understand. Plus it gives me control as a GM to allow for weaknesses and limits to be established without someone coming in with a quirk they have to have because they've been developing it on their own. In giving someone 3 quirks to pick from, I can also have breakthroughs happen throughout the story so I surprise the user with their quirk's skills/tricks. That should be natural for someone to be surprised by their own tricks and development I think. Aaaand I find people who make their own character usually make it all about their quirk. No thanks, by a GM picking a few quirks (the player will get final say though!) it allows me to ensure there is a balance and that someone's OC isn't off the charts mega strong. Plus I find it a little boring when someone's quirk dictates their personality (like, a calm Bakugo would be so much more interesting than one as assertive as his own quirk IMO).\n\nSooo as GM what am I looking for? How does this work if I'm picking quirks for someone? What else do I as a GM have a hand in?\n\nSomeone will make an OC with a personality, background, anime appearance, hobbies and such. I will then give them the quirks. Also, 1-A students will be 18 years old and UA will now become a University as opposed to a high school. Now your OC can look however he wants (within reason) but they need to have both parents living, no ties to villains, no history of abuse/depression/other pointless emotional baggage, or be some kind of genius. The OC also can't be \"stubborn,\" \"aloof but opens up once they get to know someone,\" \"clumsy,\" \"loyal,\" \"protective\" or \"easily misunderstood/a loner.\" Those buzzwords are used waaaaaay too much I've found. Sure, you can have your OC loyal to his friends but loyal usually goes without saying when you wanna be a hero right? Give me some depth that makes sense for someone wanting to make the world a better place. Don't give me the cliche hot-head or the guy who hates making friends or the guy who is a jerk but it's okay cause he's charming with a hidden heart of gold. I wanna avoid a lot of cliches if possible. I know it's not easy.\n\nAs GM I will control all canon characters. You cannot request romance options for certain canons, I am not going to force a canon to fall in love with your OC. That's not how this is gonna work. I will give a few romance options as we go along (I will take into account your personal preference as my partner to keep it heterosexual or a mix) but I am not doing this for fan-service purposes. Romance is awesome and I adore it but I am not GMing to make someone's personal fanboy fantasy come true (yes most guys seem to love Momo haha). I want romance to be truly organic and not expected. I want your OC to jive naturally with whoever they may end up with. I am open to MxF and MxM situations in this particular case as long as it makes sense and I don't have to force interactions. So make your OC someone approachable and we shouldn't have issues haha!\n\nEven though I am going to be directing the story, your character's motivations and goals will be yours to handle. I will guide the story along and give different routes to take. I am not looking for a passive partner though. I want someone who gives input and helps progress things. I do not want to give 6 paragraphs of setting the scene to only get a paragraph back. You have your character, explore their emotions, their reactions, their internal dialogue. To me, just cause I'm gonna GM doesn't mean I'm going to always take the lead. I want my partner to give ideas and invest in the story as much as I am.\n\nSo yeah, that's kinda my goal here, to give someone an awesome story!\n\nIf my partner wants to GM for me in turn, that would be pretty fun but by no mean a requirement or anything. I did post this a while ago and got a huge response. It was rather overwhelming and I had to turn a few people down because I couldn't handle the amount of people. So I only have 6 solid quirk ideas so I'm only going to take 2 people for this. Once I approve your OC and you pick your quirk, we will move to discord and I'll update this post if one or both slots are full.\n\nAs a note, I do have a life and sometimes I can't post for a few days. That's how life is. I don't expect someone to always be online or free to write and I will hope my partner is equally understanding of my responsibilities as well. \n\n**Slots:** 0/2 filled",

A bit about myself; I am nineteen, I live in Britain but can work in most timezones and I have been roleplaying for around three and a half years. When it comes to roleplay I am a big fan of romance, usually intertwined with action or adventure. I am looking for people fluent in English and over 18 to tell some tales with. I am not really fussed about post lengths as I usually only post what is necessary for the situation and I understand that real life often gets in the way of roleplaying which is all fine, I usually just ask for people to leave a message if they're going to be gone so I can know I'm not just getting ghosted as that sucks.  \n\n\nAs for setting, I am open to a wide variety of themes and settings both OC and canon although for established universes i usually play OC characters as I find it easier to get into their mindset, I will list a few that I am craving below;  \n\n\nPirates Of the Carribean,  \nRuneterra (extended world of League of Legends),  \nWarhammer 40k,  \nTerraria,  \nDestiny,  \nDark Souls (mainly the first one),  \nThe elder scrolls,\n\nStarbound.  \n\n\nIf you have other ideas or fandoms I may know feel free to ask me about them.  \n\n\nThank you for reading my post and if you are interested in RPing or have any questions feel free to send me a DM here on Reddit.  \nKind regards,  \nMorokei.",

Before I start, I would like you to know that I\u2019ve posted this before my partner ghosted me so if you\u2019re interested please be willing to send at least a few messages a day! \n\nIf you know this movie, that\u2019s wonderful, it\u2019s a great movie but you don\u2019t really need to know it to rp with me!\n\nPrompt: *Character 1* is a person that can change their size at will and chooses to live their life at around 3 inches tall, in an elderly couples home. *Character 2* is a grandson coming to live with his grandparents that spots *Character 1*. They develop a friendship and eventually small crushes on each other. But, *Character 2* believes it\u2019s impossible for them to be together and *Character 1* is afraid to tell *Character 2* that they can change their size. What will happen between these two teens?\n\nIf you want to rp these with me, feel free to pm me! I\u2019m also open to changing it around a little and I\u2019m willing to be whichever character you want. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to hear from you!\n\nCheers\n~Pandy1031",

I have a few different plotlines we could do, including:\n\n-my alien character crashes on earth, and your character finds him. Patches up injuries he has and helps him get back home.\n\n-theyre on a ship together, and they hate each other at first. A strong event, perhaps a quarantine breach or crash, forces them to get along.\n\n-your character is abducted for research, and subjected to terrible things. My character, however, has a compassion that the other aliens seem to lack....\n\nThe only things I require of you are good grammar and that you dont mind I may be gone sometimes.

You got the college and a full fledged town filled with parks, restaurants, clubs, bars, an amusement park, zoo...the works!  \nThemes include: Casual, Romance, *Suggestive Themes*, Slice of Life, and Fantasy (because of some of the residents).\n\nHere, we have your adult roleplayers...that means no one under the age of 18 is allowed here. Sorry kids!  \nThings can go bump in the night here. We can't have youngins running around!  \nThese roleplayers are talented writers. They vary between single and multi paragraph posts/responses. Usually depends on how long of a response their partner is serving them!  \nWe welcome anything and anyone into our ever growing family. Siren, fallen angel, gods, demons, succubi...anything! Powers included!  \nWe're also one of the most relaxed, PATIENT roleplay servers out there. We don't rush anyone to finish a scene the same day it starts. *\"Real life comes first!\"* is our motto because we all have lives outside of the roleplay realms!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you'll think about joining us!

My timezone is UTC-4 and although I have a busy work/study life I try to reply at least 1 to 2 times a day (mostly at night).\n\nI am a rather descriptive writer (2-3 long paragraphs sound like a good way to start). Usually 3rd person. I am looking for a literate writing partner, who\u2019s in it for the long haul. I think email is the best medium, but I am willing to discuss other alternatives.\n\nThere are a few ideas I would like to play with: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A) Slice of life with a twist \u2013 original characters/world** \n\nI have a character in mind I've been meaning to try actually. It's inspired on a character from a TV show... Basically this character is a woman, a doctor, she's in her early thirties maybe but she looks younger, and she speaks in an accent you can't quite place... There's a twist to the character. She is immortal and she does not age... She stopped aging decades ago. She can die, but she always comes back. Whatever the reason, say a car crash or a gun shot, she comes back to life. She doesn't know why, she doesn't understand it and there's no one else with this... ability. She keeps it a secret. Moving from place to place before people can realize she's not getting any older. Hardly ever connecting with other people. Of course she has had time to learn a lot... She's very worldly, she speaks many languages, she knows music, and art, and literature,... But she's extremely lonely...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking of this as a real-life RPG with a twist - the twist of her... condition. I mean, we can throw some adventure in there, but I would like for this to be close to real life - not a world crowded with other immortals, vampires, fairies, werewolves and stuff like that, if that's okay...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B) Hogwarts Roleplay**\n\nI am looking forward to play a romantic storyline  with young adult characters who have already graduated Hogwarts. I am also willing to play with Hogwarts students\u2026 I would prefer to play with an original character, but you can play canon if you wish and we can have canon characters as NPCs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**C) X-men**\n\nI have been meaning to play with Rogue for a while, but I don\u2019t really have any plots in mind for this one\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**D) Other ideas**\n\nI am looking forward to playing, even if it\u2019s not with any of the ideas I posted above\u2026 I would love to try a regular slice of life/modern story (I have never tried that before). I also really like soft sci fi stuff, and Star trek. Please PM me and we can discuss ideas.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we roleplay, I would like to be able to chat, get to know, and possibly become friends with my writing partner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. Please PM me if you\u2019re interested. I am looking forward to hearing from you.",

I have the ability to reply at least once, if not more, in a day. Another thing -- I absolutely love OOC chatter and I try to communicate regularly even if we aren't writing back and forth.\n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the plot. Dialogue is generally shorter; however, I am not against writing three to four paragraphs if the moment in the plot calls for it. I will not write with anyone who uses first person.\n\nI will write any gender in any pairing. I am comfortable with writing NSFW themes but I ask that you are eighteen or older because I don't particularly like the idea of going to jail.\n\nThis is where I wish I had a cross-through button: I'm not opposed to a purely smut-filled story at the moment! \n\nANYWAYS.\n\nMy plots will always include romance because I absolutely adore it and I will never tire of writing it. However, I am particularly fond of slowburn romance as frustrating as it can become! The genres I am searching for are post-apocalypse, dystopia, slice-of-life, and others. I don't shy away from the dark and gritty themes either. Throw me all the angst and pain. I absolutely love discussing plot and characters so I don't have any particular plots in mind as of now. It's something we should create to become our own.\n\nThe only three fandoms that I currently am interested in writing about are Harry Potter, Shameless, and The 100 -- but I don't play canon characters.\n\n\nI don't know if I missed anything. Chances are I did. However, if my post intrigues you, feel free to send me a little orange envelope! Try to intrigue me, too, please, where I feel more compelled to reply.\n\nThanks!",

I have the ability to reply at least once, if not more, in a day. Another thing -- I absolutely love OOC chatter and I try to communicate regularly even if we aren't writing back and forth.\n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the plot. Dialogue is generally shorter; however, I am not against writing three to four paragraphs if the moment in the plot calls for it. I will not write with anyone who uses first person.\n\nI will write any gender in any pairing. I am comfortable with writing NSFW themes but I ask that you are eighteen or older because I don't particularly like the idea of going to jail.\n\nMy plots will always include romance because I absolutely adore it and I will never tire of writing it. However, I am particularly fond of slowburn romance as frustrating as it can become! The genres I am searching for are post-apocalypse, dystopia, slice-of-life, and others. I don't shy away from the dark and gritty themes either. Throw me all the angst and pain. I absolutely love discussing plot and characters so I don't have any particular plots in mind as of now. It's something we should create to become our own.\n\nThe only three fandoms that I currently am interested in writing about are Harry Potter, Shameless, The Walking Dead, POSSIBLY The Mortal Instruments and The 100 -- but I don't play canon characters.\n\nOne plot that I currently am itching for is a long distance relationship that we can play out from the beginning to the end!\n\nI don't know if I missed anything. Chances are I did. However, if my post intrigues you, feel free to send me a little orange envelope! Try to intrigue me, too, please, where I feel more compelled to reply.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": " \n\nAnother month, another recruitment notice!\n\nThe Background behind this group: As the title implies, its a One Punch Man Roleplay, but with some marked differences, this one being, obviously it's a world with original characters, and the canon characters will simply be used to moved the plot forward, and we will use both plot events and our own original events for Roleplaying. But some other changes include changes to the entrance exam, now if your OC has B, A or S-Class potential and there isn't a public exam being held, they can take the test privately at the Hero Association center and get their placement, but w/ the entrance exam not only is there a field test, but every hero whose score is sufficient after the field test will be given an interview. (Details about the field test are in the chat group itself if you choose to join). Also, there are state of the art training centers established that can improve hero skills and can also facilitate Roleplay interaction. What you can know about character creation:\n\n\\-Limits for character creation are in the rules section.\n\n\\-The entire list of known heroes is in the chat group, if you wish to make a OC that fills one of the \"???\" on the list, we're glad to help you do so! Some barebones rules of the discord (More are listed there):\n\n\\-No bullying, if any bullying occurs between players on the server or even off because of events ON the server, it is to be reported to me or one of the moderators.\n\n\\-No NSFW content (But Romance and Fade to Black is allowed!).\n\n\\-No spamming\n\n\\-Please follow the rules about character creation and please be able to form complete, understandable sentences.\n\n\\-We have done monthly inactive player purges that started at the end of January, so if you don't think you'll be active as at least 1 full roleplay interaction per month, please, either don't ask to join, or ask to be an observer What you should know about the discord before coming in:\n\n\\-If you simply wish to observe the discord before making the choice of interacting with it, we can make you an observer, however this means you will not be counted towards active player roles.\n\n\\-Atm, we have 10-15 active players including myself and 4 other moderators. We are currently looking for 30 active players total, and after that we will expand that number to 40 and upward if possible. However, we need more moderators to do so, if you are looking to be a moderator, once you're there and understand the rules and make a OC, let me know if you think you'll make a good fit for a moderator\n\n\\-We are started from when Saitama joined the Heroes association, and we are currently 5 weeks in (Just past the Sea King Arc), we will not start this over, and time passage is at the discretion of the moderators.\n\n\\-We are not currently accepting any more established S-Class and A-Class heroes, (As in, they have a past with being in the Heroes association and have been in S-Class long enough to achieve a certain rank), any S-Class or A-Class hero OC must test INTO S-Class or A-Class and earn their rank. Once joined, please immediately overview the rules and background and quickly determine if this group is the right fit for you, and if not, either let me know you'll be leaving or if you'd just like to be an observer. If you're interested in joining, please PM me, let me know if you have a OC or an idea for one, and I'll send you the invite as soon as I can! (I will probably be posting this on my break, so if I miss you, just be patient)\n\nModerator Need\n\nWe have a Disboard Presence and will be getting more and more players on occasion, so we're looking for more moderators to manage the influx of newer players, who can also run random monster encounters and be present on the board when other moderators aren't present, as well as encourage engagement between players. We have a moderator application on the board, so if you wish to become a moderator, let me, or one of the other present mods know and we'll send you the application. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "Heya! You might remember me from another post earlier this week. I'm back with a narrowed down version of my settings, but feel free to message me about them nonetheless!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuick intro first, I'm a man in his early twenties from eastern Canada. I have a college degree in programming, work for a research center, and should be going to university this fall. I'm into video games (mostly fighting games right now, but I also play other popular stuff), various forms of art like music and drawing and... anime. Woops.\n\nNow! This is more a request for partners and friends than for a specific plot. I'll leave some ideas lower to help you pin down the kind of plots and character archetypes I like, but it's merely for the inspiration. We could still use them however! The best place to find me is **definitely** Discrord, but I can handle some others. You may drop your tag in your first message, I don't mind, it's maybe even better!\n\nI'm looking for partners who are social. I like to get to know the people I write with, and would appreciate becoming good friends instead of just writing buddies, if it's alright with you! I tend to enjoy hanging out with people who are confident and proud. Banter, teasing, rivalry, all of those things create the sparks that fill me with energy and excitement! I dunno how to call that archetype of person, but you're welcome to hit me with your best shot. Show me something new!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all for now! Let me know if any of these ideas caught your attention. I'll be waiting for your response, so please don't hesitate to slide a message my way! Cheers!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally! You can skip this section if you'd like, but here are some settings I'd like to try out sometime. Some are recycled ideas, some are brand new, all of them would be amazing if done well.\n\n1. **Steampunk:** ~~A young \"punk\" to fix the world~~ (CURRENTLY TAKEN)\n\nThis is the story of a young boy who thrives in a city that is rotten to the core with corruption and questionable ethics. It perhaps is the capital of its country, but for the lower-class people, it's an inevitable hell. Gangsters, an extremely active black market, corrupted authorities, there's nothing right with the place. Yet, that one boy is ready to give everything he has to make it shine bright. He's as proud of his homeland as he hates it. Will he escape, or will he dirty his hands for the greater good? There's only one certainty: he cannot do it alone.\n\n2. **Medieval Fantasy:** A blacksmith's bargain\n\nIn a small town, there once was a blacksmith who could forge the best weapons and tools in the entire kingdom. He had made a considerable profit with the recent wars, but with the tensions calming down, he had a lot more time on his hands to teach his young son about his specialty. Timeskip to a dozen years later, the boy is now a grown up man, handling his now deceased father's shop on his own. His life changes suddenly when a non-human creature comes in, looking for the man he/she had made a contract with; an extremely shocking one for the man. (I have an idea for it, but I want you to have your say in this so we can make it fit your style as well!)\n\n3. **Modern Fantasy:** Night of the Exiled\n\nThis is an idea I originally wanted to turn into a fighting game (as a programmer, I still easily could), but for now, I'll keep it as a plot for writing ideas. In this world, some people are born with magical energy bound to their bodies. It is said that this special ability has been transported from generation to generation, all the way from the ancient beings to now mere mortals. They aren't frequent, but you could expect a good handful of these people in every city. People who were found to have these abilities, in the past, were often condemned and burned alive, in fear of them being inhuman beings wishing for chaos and destruction. Nowadays, they hide from the world and try to live normally, until things started breaking down. Are some of them trying to take over the world? Perhaps there are some groups trying to eradicate all magical beings in hopes to cleanse the world from that \"corruption\"? It's up to discussion!\n\n4. **Modern slice-of-life:** The rising players of North America\n\nA group of young players aim to become the world champions. A very, very unrealistic dream for a bunch of highschool/college students. There will be sweat, tears and blood. In this roleplay, I'd like to see tensions in the group. I'd like to experiment around perhaps arrogant players learning proper respect and humility. This could also be a nice cheesy set up for some romance between a cocky tomboy and perhaps a more insecure boy that hides his anxious moments with arrogance to try and boost his ego. I'd actually really like that sort of development.\n\n5. **Modern slice-of-life:** The bright side of bullying\n\nFor this one, I was thinking along the lines of childhood friends slowly drifting apart as one of them grew up to be more popular and let it get to their head. (Preferably the girl, if we're going for romance!) I was thinking perhaps they drift apart, and rejoin later in life due to some circumstances. Are they in the same college? Perhaps do they work at the same place? Or maybe they share a \"secret spot\" in which they like to hang out alone, but they happen to visit it both at the same time?",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, my name is Mimi! I am a\u00a023 years old woman, currently looking for a new writing partner! I'm currently between jobs so I have plenty of time on my hands, and I have had a few ideas rolling around in the back of my head, and I would love to have someone to RP with!\n\nSo, the boring part:\n\nI RP on Discord, and I am looking for a\u00a0MALE FOR MY FEMALE OC; the ideal partner for me can be of any gender, so long as they are\u00a0ABOVE 18 (this is non-negotiable, I will NOT rp with anyone below this age),\u00a0can respond multiple times a day, is not afraid to voice ideas, suggestions and constructive critique, literate, and is just as invested into the story as I am!\u00a0\n\nOf course, I understand completely when things come up, and I am always very open to talking; I do have plenty of free time right now as I am between jobs, so I'd like someone who can respond with more or less my same frequency. Obviously, I have no issues if you can only post once a day, for example; just let me know and I'll be totally cool with it!\n\nAnother thing I add, is that the rp will\u00a0not be entirely smut based.\u00a0I do often do NSFW scenes of various natures, but the RP will NOT revolve around sex.\n\nSo, now that we got that out of the way, on to the more interesting part!\n\n*~*All in the Name of Rock n Roll*~*\n\nThe 80's are roaring through the world, and rock n roll is the law and order. Big hair, colorful tights, and the underground seas of rebellion. Bands like M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Guns N Roses are at the forefront of rock during this time and day, and the public craves anarchy.\n\nMy oc is a regular person that is from a more conservative family that denounces the lifestyle of 80's rock n roll. However, she listens to their music in secret, has a secret stash of clothing, and attends rock shows. At a rock show, she meets your OC, a Nikki Sixx-esque rockstar that embodies the lifestyle. What starts as a friendship, blossoms into romance, and our OCs are caught between the unhealthy living of \"sex, drugs and rock n roll\", wanting a better life, but also the freedom of self-expression sought by the 80's.\n\nThat was the prompt in mind; I don't want to romanticize and glamorize the way rockstars lived in the 80's; I'd like to have an rp that explores the reality of it via character interaction and romance.\n\nIf you read this far, DM me, including the phrase \"they call him Dr. Feelgood\" at the subject so I know you read this far! Tell me about yourself and your OC, and we can trade Discords! \n\nI hope you all have a wonderful day! :)",

I've tried setting up a few with other rp blogs, but ultimately I feel like they have fizzled out or they just lost interest (or maybe they were busy? I'm not entirely sure)\n\nAdmittedly, I prefer planning things out and asking if scenes, settings, plot and pairing characters up is okay with my partners before trying things. I have done threads with the \"Ask Memes\" or starters or whatever, but sometimes I feel a thread needs more set up than that. Or the memes in question are inappropriate for the character, be it my own or the one I'd like to rp with.",

            "selftext": "Welcome to the Virtual Prison. The year is 3086, prisons became too much of a hassle for people as they would fill with people and begin to take up  too much space. To combat this, the virtual prison was designed. It is a warehouse of containment pods, filled with prisoners. They are  submerged in liquid before being hooked up to a machine of tubes and  wires, taking their mind to the prison. So, while they\u2019re bodies are stored away, they are still in prison in their minds.\n\nThe  virtual prison takes pride in making all the inmates feel like they\u2019re really imprisoned, but because they don\u2019t want to dehumanize them, the  prison does have its own entertainment places and other normal places  from society like salons and places to eat. Here, inmates can interact during their free time, get a bite to eat, or just watch some tv imported straight from real life!\n\nThough, rules are still enforced. If an inmate acts out, the guards will come  and contain them. With or without force. If an accident somehow occurs,  just know that if you die in the virtual prison, you don\u2019t wake up in the real world either.\n\nSo, please enjoy your stay at the virtual prison! Make some new friends, try some new food and remember\u2026 Don\u2019t act out of line.\n\nIf  you are interested, Dm me please! I will give you a link to the discord server! Everyone is welcome, most OCs are welcome as well. All rules are on the server and you can ask questions on there was well.",

I love RP when I can get it, and there's been a bit of a dry spell lately. I am seeking to change that.\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you may ask? Look below:\n\n-Modern (this can be fantasy, slice of life, drama)\n\n-Historical (I am getting a kick out of medieval, as well as 1940s/1950s/1960s play)\n\n-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n-Fandoms (I like Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire, Harry Potter, Vikings, The Last Kingdom; others need ask!)\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional animated picture.\n\nI am an adult, and I write like one in terms of the writing. Give me the romantic, passionate, intimate, and everything beyond that we dare not speak of here. I seek those in a similar boat too. I also enjoy players who like to socialize outside of RP (OOC), since there'll be times when we may not be able to RP but can talk.\n\nPlease, please, please be someone who can RP and talk on a daily or near-daily basis. This is a big request. I've met plenty of players who are sporadic, ghost, or don't respond to anything for days. I am a patient and lenient person, so I will give someone a few days. If nothing in that time, better for me to move on since leaving too many messages seems stalker-ish. I will understand if you tell me! A hint: Discord or phones/tablets love to mess with notifications sometimes.\n\nOne last thing...feel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours &amp; please be someone who actively uses it. Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!",

I'm looking for a single partner to write with me in an incredibly well-developed universe that I've slowly added to over the years. I've mostly written in it and developed it as a hobby and I've yet to actually roleplay in it, but I'd love to introduce someone else to my creation!\n\nFor starters, it's a low-fantasy world based off of universes such as Game of Thrones, Dishonored, a series of classical literature, and some other fantasy/medieval settings. I bring in a lot of Machiavellian themes, as well as grand conflicts with a lot of personal drama amongst the cast of characters. But, of course, I'm getting ahead of myself!\n\nThis roleplay would be DM'd. If you're not sure of what that means, then it means I fulfill the role of a narrator/storyteller. Essentially, I control every aspect of the story and background, whilst you control a protagonist character that sits at the center of the plot. Rather than the collaborative storytelling from your typical 1x1 roleplay, this one is like having a novel built around your character's actions and experiences.\n\nWith all of that in mind, I **never** develop an end to the story until we're certainly near the end. What I mean by this is every aspect of the story and world can be altered by your character's actions. Each story could end in happiness or tragedy. Furthermore, obstacles are more apparent in this type of the story and I'll never be too merciful towards your character!\n\nThat aside, I'm a DM that will respond, on average, at least eight or so times **per day**. My posts usually come with at least 400-800 words. While I do not necessarily ask for the same length, I do ask for the same or a similar frequency. My ideal partner loves to write as a primary hobby, is passionate about their writing, and will wow me with fantastic imagery and their character's thoughts. Also, please write in the third person. *Please.* In return, I'll give you an immersive story with loveable/hateable characters that'll pull on your heart strings as much as they can.\n\nI do like to be *friends* (gasp) with my partner, so please introduce yourself if/when you message me! I'd like to know who I'm writing with, not only for added synergy, but just because it's lame to write with some unknown person in some unknown place! I will, obviously, do the same!\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, please send me a message! Thanks!",

I love RP when I can get it, and there's been a bit of a dry spell lately. I am seeking to change that.\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you may ask? Look below:\n\n-Modern (this can be fantasy, slice of life, drama)\n\n-Historical (I am getting a kick out of medieval, as well as 1940s/1950s/1960s play)\n\n-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n-Fandoms (I like Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire, Harry Potter, Vikings, The Last Kingdom; others need ask!)\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional animated picture.\n\nI am an adult, and I write like one in terms of the writing. Give me the romantic, passionate, intimate, and everything beyond that we dare not speak of here. I seek those in a similar boat too. I also enjoy players who like to socialize outside of RP (OOC), since there'll be times when we may not be able to RP but can talk.\n\nPlease, please, please be someone who can RP and talk on a daily or near-daily basis. This is a big request. I've met plenty of players who are sporadic, ghost, or don't respond to anything for days. I am a patient and lenient person, so I will give someone a few days. If nothing in that time, better for me to move on since leaving too many messages seems stalker-ish. I will understand if you tell me! A hint: Discord or phones/tablets love to mess with notifications sometimes.\n\nOne last thing...feel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours &amp; please be someone who actively uses it. Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!",

            "selftext": "**The Situation:**\n\nI'm in a discord server where we're going to start a roleplay inspired by Into the Spider-Verse. Most of us are bringing existing OCs of ours into this server, but I'm a little concerned about mine's power level because she is a Blue Lantern in addition to having the standard spider powers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background Information:** \n\nBlue Lanterns are kind of like Green Lanterns, except they're powered by hope instead of willpower. On their own, they're much weaker than Green Lanterns, but they turn into walking Deus Ex Machinas if a Green Lantern is present. \n\nOf the abilities that Blue Lanterns have on their own, the only ones that are likely to come up in the rp are flight, a life-supporting force field that enables them to survive in space and protects against some attacks, and universal translation. \n\nMy favorite two Blue Lantern powers, healing and the ability to calm emotions, are usually only available when they have help from a Green Lantern. However, I heard that Blue Lanterns with enough willpower can use abilities they would normally need a Green Lantern's help for on their own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I'm Doing:**\n\nIn order to keep her power level down, I'm downplaying the force field and keeping Green Lanterns out of the picture. However, I would like her to have the healing and calming abilities to some extent. I would like to keep the Blue Lantern stuff as close to the DC Comics lore as possible, but probably no one would notice if I deviated from it because this is a server full of Spider-Verse fans, not DC fans. For the record, I am aware of the fact that I'm mixing things from Marvel and DC together with this character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Could fact that she would probably be overpowered if there was a Green Lantern around make her irritating to the other players, even if there are no Green Lanterns present? If so, what pitfalls should I avoid?\n2. Is there a way to justify her having access to weakened versions of the healing and calming powers, and only those additional powers, without a Green Lantern present, while still fitting in with DC Comics lore?\n3. In general, what can I do to keep her Blue Lantern abilities from giving her a too much power compared the other spider-heroes?",

I only rp in 3rd person with (at the very least) one detailed paragraph and go up to 10 paragraphs. \n\nI only rp as female and as an OC, even fir fandom rps. \n\nFandoms I do are supernatural, MCU the walking Dead and Harry Potter. \n\nFor Supernatural, I prefer my partner to be Dean, Cas, Gabriel, Lucifer, or Crowley. \n\nMCU I prefer Steve, Tony, Loki or Bucky. My OC is an (ex) Hydra agent.\n\nThe walking Dead I prefer Negan \n\nHarry Potter I prefer Draco or a Slytherin OC. My OC is a Hufflepuff. \n\nThe other role ideas I have are \n\nWolf/wolf\nWolf/vampire \nVampire/vampire\nAngel/demon\nPost-apocalyptic \nMedieval\n\n\nI prefer dark and angsty rps with tons of drama and action. The romance and NSFW I like build up but the story must continue even when the other elements are introduced. \n\nPlease be 20+ as I am 25 and I will not rp with anyone under 20. \n\nI have Kik and discord to rp on. \n\nAs obvious as I thought this was, I am here just to rp and perhaps make friends.

            "selftext": "I'm fairly new to roleplaying, but was put through pretty much a roleplaying 'bootcamp' by my friend, who has been roleplaying for around 7 years, and taught me a lot. Bottom line, this is my first idea and post here. As I was learning the ropes of roleplaying and becoming a detailed writer, I've noticed that the creation side of roleplay is what I enjoy most, making my characters, and seeing my partner's reaction to them, then seeing the characters unfold in whatever roleplay they are built for. I can play 3rd person, though I do have a strong preference for 1st.   \n\n\n**RP Idea**  \nThe idea Ive had that can incorporate all the desires and things I like about roleplay would be a group or circle of characters. My partner and I would make 2 to 5 characters each, have the setting be either high school, college, or one of those overhyped MTV reality show settings, or something more story based, which can always be discussed on youtube. We make the characters, assign which ones we want to play in 1st person, which ones to be 3rd person, even who we want to play, if we want to trade created characters for fun. I imagine the group of characters building friendships, romances, or having arguments, disagreements, drama, even having a few 'special' relationships or nights together that spread a lot of rumors or buzz. All in fun for us to play up, of course.  \n\n\n**Warning**  \nFor those who are a bit cleaner than I am in the head, its unfortunate, but there is a high expectation of adult scenes in this roleplay. Aside from that, I want to warn potential partners that I do not enjoy short or one line replies in a consistent style. Length isnt too big an issue, as different scenarios call for certain kinds or replies, yet a weak one liner is a bit of a punch to the gut. Anyway, happy to see messages rolling in hopefully, thank you for reading!",

I would like a reply at least once every day or so. \n\nAs for me, I play either gender, I double and I typically only do MxF.

I love talking about the story and coming up with events and the like with my rp partners.\n\n\\*Please let me know what is your favorite flavor of ice cream is so that I know you've read the rules. :3\n\n**Plots::**\n\n* The year is 2015. In the small town of Eastville, Virginia. A population of 240, our female character lives at home with her family while she's still in college. Though she is loved by all of her family and the friends that she has, she's always felt as if she did not belong. Often, when not working on school work, she finds herself wishing that she was a part of the world of Tolkien. She's always felt that it was a place that she was meant to be. Of course, she knows that it's all fantasy. She continues to go about her life as usual.\n\nOne night, her parents go out to celebrate on Christmas Eve, leaving their daughter to her own devices that evening. The party they went to was a blast but they phoned home telling their daughter that it would be late before they returned home. The following morning, the daughter got up only to find that her parents never returned home. Worried, she starts calling around trying to find out why they never made it. It was just as she was beginning to truly panic that there was a knock on her door.\n\nShe opened it to find a pair of the local police. They informed her that her parents had been in a terrible car accident the night before, due to the terrible storm. They'd not made it. Stricken with grief, the young woman was soon forced to move in with her Grandparents. She took all of her things with her, making sure that she even had her books and movies that always seemed to take her mind off of the real world. She started pulling away from her remaining family and friends, trying to deal with her parents' sudden death.\n\nAfter four months had passed, the young woman can no longer take the pain. She finds herself sitting at her windowsill, looking out into the sky. A shooting star suddenly shoots across the sky. She wishes with all of her heart to be taken somewhere where she could start her life over, without the reminders that she faced every day. Little did she know, she was going to get her wish.\n\n**Where Our Story Will Begin::**\n\nThe female character wakes up in a strangely familiar land. She's still clothed as she was before she was brought there. She begins wandering around, trying to figure out where she is. She soon realizes that she's somehow in Middle Earth yet has no idea how it happened..until she recalls the shooting star. She's lost in a dangerous world having no idea what time she's been thrown into. A male Elf comes across her and offers to help. They are thrown together as the war for the Ring slowly begins to creep closer. Can the Mortal woman find a way home? Or does she even want to? Love will bloom between her and the Elf but is there a way for them to be together?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Thousands of years ago, Dragons ruled the world of Varnaya. They were revered as the ultimate race of the world. They ruled with compassion over the lesser races of the world..loving all that lived under them. With the Dragons ruling the world, the Elves and Humans got along quite well..one could even say that they were friends. The world of Varnaya was a beautiful and lush world. One that had never seen any amount of war or famine under the Dragons rule. The world had been a happy place. This all ended the moment the Dragons were struck with The Sickness. The disease that ravaged the ruling race turned all those that were struck to change. They no longer cared about the world or those that they protected. They only cared about themselves..their wealth. They became merely beasts that ravaged the world.\n\nAfter the Dragons turned, the Humans and Elves have begun to hate one another. They are always constantly arguing. The only thing that they've been able to agree upon is that the Dragons must be taken care of. Legions of Men and Elves ventured forth, hunting down the beasts. At first, the two races merely lost many lives. They had no idea how to kill the monsters. After many long years and so many lives lost, a way was found. One by one, the Dragons were hunted down and killed, their corpses left rotting upon the ground where they fell.\n\nOnce the threat of the Dragons was gone, the Humans and Elves continued fighting with one another. Each race saw the other at fault for everything. There was no fixing their ties. As the years passed, the fighting seemed to be never ending however, there was whispers of a shadow growing in the North high upon the mountain of Kahluna. At the highest point, the city of Ialeos is located. It is here that a new threat is growing in power. The Dragon Ethron had awoken from his deep slumber. He began gathering all remaining Dragons to him, those that had survived the Hunting. He is no king though rules as one. His name is becoming more widly known. There are none now that do not know *of* him. He seeks to rid the world of the other races for the slaughter they have done to his kind. Ialeos is unreachable by Humans or Elves. They have no way of getting to the False King on their own.\n\n**Races:**\n\nHumans} They are generally the shortest of all of the races, standing up to only **5'7**. Their eye color is usually of darker shades and their hair is darker as well. The Humans are generally non-magical creatures however, there are a select few that can do magic. Wizards they are called and they are very rare. There only only five known currently. The Humans live under the influence of their ancient gods. Humans tend to fight with Elves as they do not trust them. They've been enemies for as long as their history books go back. The hatred runs so deep that no one really remembers the real reason for the fighting. Perhaps one day they will set aside their differences and get along. Humans live to be 75-80 years old.\n\nElves} They are taller than Humans, standing up to **6'5**. Their eye color is usually of lighter shades as is their long hair. Elves are one of the two true magical creatures that reside in Varnaya. They are very in tune with all things that are nature. They serve under the influence of two gods. Loint the god of earth and Risnda the goddess of life. The Elves are a kind race unless provoked. They hate only the Humans. Their libraries are said to contain the reasons for the great hatred between the two races though this has never been truly proven. The Elves live in far off forests that they've built their cities in. Elves are Immortal and can only die when in battle and mortally injured.\n\nDragons} They are the oldest of the three races and are magical. They have the ability to shift into a elf like shape. Though they can blend in with the Elves it is still noticeable that they are different. Their ears are still pointed, but they have small pointed canines that are visible when they speak. Their eyes usually change from their natural color to one more normal for a Elf. Their hair color usually is rather dark in this form. Dragons revere no gods, only their ancient Ancestors. Dragons are fierce beasts who once ruled over the world. They lived in the ancient stone city Ialeos, a city built many long ages ago by the first Dragon King. Here, the Dragons live under the rule of the royal family of Ardurwen. Dragons come in many different shapes, sizes and colors, but the one thing that they have in common is that the males all breathe fire and the females all breathe ice. Their true eye color tends to usually be a red, emerald green, gold, or silver. Dragons are Immortal and can only die if mortally wounded.\n\n**(There are, as always, some genetic oddities among the three races. Hair colors may be off, as well as heights. Eye color however must remain true to race.)**\n\n**Where We Will Begin:**\n\nThe Dragons have been *gone* for many long years. The world is slowly falling into chaos. Now, the threat of the Dragons is coming back. The Humans and Elves must learn to set aside their differences in order to save their world. The Elven King calls forth three of the most seasoned adventurers to set fort to hunt down a Dragon that still lives in the Lower Lands. They must hunt him down and persuade him to join their cause so that they can reach Ialeos and defeat Ethron, restoring the balance of the world.\n\nWhat I'm Looking For:\n\nSomeone willing to double. I'll be playing the **Dragon** male and a **Human** female. I am looking for someone willing to play the female love interest for my male and the male love interest for my female. Your characters may be either **Human**or **Elf**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The world of Irisu is vast and beautiful. The creatures are all lovely in their own ways and tend to stay away from civilization. The capitol of the world is Silanos. The city was built in the middle of the Karhana Mountain range. By doing this, the ruling family thought that no enemy could reach them. They welcomed only their closest and most highly regarded acquaintances to live in the city. There are also many other smaller cities littered about the world that are not nearly as beautiful as Silanos. The King of Silanos is in charge of protecting the entire world. As of now, the only enemy is the slowly rising empire of Nuhardos. The ruler of Nuhardos seeks to become the king of Irisu though the current King sees him as no threat. It hasn't taken long for things to slowly become worse and worse. A war is quickly approaching.\n\nAs the days slowly tick by, the King begins becoming more paranoid by the minutes. He's begun locking himself in his study, refusing to see anyone save for his advisers. His own daughter hasn't seen him in months. The King fears for his life, assuming that the other ruler means to have him murdered by the Assassins. How wrong he was. Instead of killing the King, they have sent the Guild Master of the Assassins after his daughter. His orders: To kill the young woman. What would happen if the man instead kidnaps her? Would the Princess be able to break through all of the Assassin's defenses that he's surrounded himself with? Could they eventually love each other? More as the Story progresses.\n\nRace:Humans only\n\nWhat I'm looking for: Someone to play the princess\n\nAND if you made it this far... kudos to you! XD This ended up much longer than I expected!

Their friendship eventually transforms into something else and they discover their feelings for one another just weeks before graduating.\n\n*Will their story end before it can properly begin?*\n\n*Could they be together despite very different plans for the future?*\n\n*Or will they be forcefully separated and meet each other again many years later?*\n\n*Let's find out.* \u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Requirements:***\n\n* **characters in RP as well as writers out of RP must be 18+** (I prefer writers 21+)\n* **be able to give minimum 2 solid para per average post** (I'd like us to be able to write short conversational posts just as much as long character exposition posts and flashbacks)\n* **this is important** \\- please use physically and mentally strong, young male character (no immature/feminine/weak characters fit this story)\n* **no insta-romance** (the friendship can be pre-established but the romantic bond should be slowly discovered and explored)\n* **no overly heavy/dark themes** (just a healthy dose of teen angst and complicated family/school drama without focusing on themes like suicide, mental/physical health or addictions)\n* **discord at least for OOC communication**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Chaos of loose tropes:***\n\n**Country roads**. *Wresting in tall grass.* **Sharing same tent**. *Secretly wishing they shared the sleeping bag too*. Catfish hogging. *Mud, sweat and laughter*. Crystal clear waters. Jumping off a cliff in the sun. *Blanket of fog hanged over woods*. Rainy day with video games and snacks, his big city stories. Thunderstorm. **Seeking shelter under same roof**. Middle of the night. *Cold*. **Can't go back home**. He doesn't turn you down. Lets you slip into his spare pajamas and into the warmth of his bed.\u00a0**Human comfort turning into a hesitant kiss**. Do you talk about it the next day? **Homemade meal**. His Mom is so nice. Concerned but doesn't ask about your bruises. Shooting on the range because he likes guns. Boxing match as he watches you fight. Snow powdering over thickly clothed figure. *Winter wonderland*. Not enough money to get him a present. **Best Christmas ever even though he forgot about yours**. *Spring puppy love*. Feelings you can no longer hide. **Goodbye or a new beginning?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If this sounds up your alley please contact me through reddit DM or the reddit chat in case the direct message system seems not reliable.

            "selftext": "Hello ladies and gents! First and foremost, I should point out that I don't care what your gender is, but I would prefer that you play a male character. I'm also only interested in someone willing/able to roleplay via email, and prefer someone who uses hangouts so we can chat OOC between posts. I average 1-2 posts a day if we're not on the same schedule. If we're both around at the same time I can manage far more than that. My average post ranges from 3 detailed, lengthy paragraphs to a thousand or more words, depending entirely on my partner and the scene in question. I only write 3rd person, past tense and you must do the same. Your grammar must be decent. I don't mind the occasional typo, but if I read through a post and don't understand what you're saying at all, I'm probably not going to be interested in writing with you.\n\nAll that out of the way, I promise I'm not super picky and most want to find a partner I can connect with both as another writer and as someone I can share creative endeavors with. Bonus points if you're someone I can talk books, shows, video games, movies, etc with!\n\nNow for the fun stuff...\n\nI am very open to the type of game we do. I'm a big fan of contemporary fantasy, modern mythology (American Gods, Percy Jackson, that kind of thing), high fantasy, low medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, slice of life, and numerous other types of stories  (I do NOT like sci fi). I tend to prefer to add a healthy portion of grim dark to all of these settings. I do enjoy adding NSFW in to my stories when and where it makes sense, but I do not like them to dominate the story. Please message me if you have ideas, even if it's just the start of an idea and you want to plan something together. \n\nBig bonuses if you play your character as the more type-A and aggressive personality type.",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Superheroes, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind, admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am primarily looking for as a partner (BUT not required!). And hopefully one who has no limits, like me. And yes, I'm fine with playing female characters too.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me or ask me with the Reddit chat system, though I do prefer the PM option more.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have the urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

I\u2019m looking for someone close to my age (though so long as you\u2019re 21+ I\u2019m alright with whoever to be honest) to write in any of the following universes\u2026. I RP through email and chat in Hangouts\u2026typically active Monday thru Friday\u2026.I can write canon characters or OC\u2019s, or a combination of both. Doubling and NPC writing is fine. Not a huge stickler on post length, just do what is appropriate\u2026..whether it\u2019s a paragraph or three.\n\nNow then, here\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in writing at the moment:\n\nPersona 4 or 5. (Preferably 4)\n\nCastleVania\n\nMortal Kombat\n\nDC Universe/Injustice saga\n\nStreet Fighter\n\nSeven Deadly Sins\n\nXena: Warrior Princess/Hercules universe\n\nRed Dead Redemption\n\nFinal Fantasy VI or VII\n\nSenran Kagura\n\nAlternatively, an original concept I\u2019ve been literally trying to write for years is a love story between a human male and a female ghost, that could be sweet, dark and f-ed up, or anything in between. I'm reluctant to try this again as I've started it a couple times and got super invested only for my partner to bail, so, let's only discuss this if you're in it for the long haul, too.",

            "selftext": "Background: Fragmented Storyteller is a long term role play for the hardcore role players. It is set up similarly to DnD with the campaign system and has a few elements of an rpg with its economy, and loot system.\nTimeline: The timeline for this role play takes place in a cyberpunk dystopian society with hints of fantasy.\nPlot (simplified): In the year 2037 the country of Estren was slowly chipping away at itself when other countries sent agents to spread propaganda against the country. Some people listened and started to rebel against the government. The police were switched out for the military when things were getting violent with the rebels. Most people think that the rebels are fools but some follow the rebellion\u2019s movements. Where you come in and what stand point you have is up to how you set up your character, but do realize that every action and choice you make effects the outcome of things. \nCharacter Creation: the character creation is class based and the weaponry that you have is also class based. Magic is not class based but will need to be learned depending on the character\u2019s background. (Message me if you have any questions about character creation) \n\n\n(I also apologize if the post is unorganized, this is my first time using Reddit, but I was told that this subreddit was the best place to look for more people)",

So, I decided to put in the extra mile and set up a story with a combat system and a number of cool encounters for her to have fun with, however I found out later on that she didn't enjoy D&amp;D style roleplays. It was my fault for jumping into it too quickly, but now I have a well playtested battle system using MTG cards, a fun story, and nobody to share it with. I was hoping that I could find someone on here to RP with. The reason I specified that I'm looking for a girl is because I spent hours choosing cards to make a class tree using only cards with females on them for extra immersion. So, if you like battle oriented roleplays and like card games, you'll love this. Just DM me and we can talk about it. =)",

            "selftext": "Hello reader, I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful day today. I appreciate you clicking or tapping on my title to see what all I have to say. Because of that, I\u2019ll try my best to keep this an interesting and engaging read for you. First of all, my name is Josh, I am 19 years old (almost 20!), and I am currently pursuing a degree for music. My schedule is fairly free except for early mornings on Tuesdays and Thursday\u2019s, but any other time I should be good unless I say otherwise. Now, let\u2019s get into the juicy bits! \n\nToday I am looking for a specific partner(s), but I should explain what that specific part is about. I want a writer who has a particular skill with word play, descriptive writing, and including literary elements to jerk emotions. Words, sentences, and their structure has always been a major interest of mine which has led me into writing and roleplaying. I can\u2019t get over the fact how a certain pronunciation of sounds from your throat can invoke sadness, lust, happiness, or any other emotion. I want a roleplay that involves plenty of this descriptive writing, beautifully structured sentences with flair that can make me feel those emotions. So, if you think you\u2019re capable of doing that with me, send me a message so we can discuss! \n\nAs far as a plot goes, I\u2019m not too picky. We can come up with something, or if you have an idea, please present it! I\u2019d love to also hear about your guys\u2019 interest with this phenomenon, tell me how it makes you feel too. Also, I\u2019m totally okay with NSFW themes if you guys want to bring some ideas pertaining that. But anyways, thanks for reading my pretty long post. I hope I get some great writers in my inbox! If you read this far, pretty please include your favorite emoji in your message. ",

Natalie's performance was amazing, seeing as she was only 12 years old during filming, 11 when she was cast. \nAnd I came to love Leon and his character development. At first, he was cold to Mathilda, but began to open up, wanting to protect the young child.\n\nSo, I thought it would be an amazing and fun idea to roleplay the film. I don't want to follow the film exactly, (especially not the ending) but come up with our own plot, as to what Mathilda and Leon will be doing.\n\nI apologize if I don't make much sense. \n\nIf you are interested in the roleplay, don't hesitate to message me.",

Sometimes I get lost in the number of messages I get from the Subreddits I'm active in and things get lost.\n\nHi there! Thanks for taking a look at my advertisement!\n\nMy name's Kyle, I'm 20, English and I'm currently looking for some RP partners to write some cool and original stories! Before I say about what I like to roleplay, allow me to introduce myself and my likes.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently 20, so I'm looking for someone 18+. This is mainly due to the fact that my RPs can NSFW in parts (Both Sexual and Violence) and I just wanna make sure no trouble comes of it.\n\n\u2022 I'm currently only looking for FEMALE RP Partners. I do apologize if this offends anyone of the male/trans community. Its just my personal preference. I'd also ask that you're fairly active too. A couple of posts a day at least.\n\n\u2022 I like a partner who's detailed and experienced. Fine, quickfire posts can be shorter, but I like quality in my posts. I'm not asking for half a novel though. There's such a thing as too little and too much detail. Also, I RP in THIRD person only. Again, just my preference, however, I am more than welcome for you to use third/first at your own desire. I also play OC Characters only as well. I don't find it entertaining to play a Canon Character. I don't mind them appearing as side characters but the main story players will be OC x OC.\n\n\u2022 Finally, I like people who are interested in the same things as myself. Please understand what my RP is being based on. I offer a variety so there's plenty to choose from.\n\nRight! Now I have my expectations out of the way, here are the things I'm looking for RP story wise!\n\nThemes marked with an \\[X\\] are my primary genres. - PSA: Themes marked with a \\[#\\] are genres I'm currently interested in doing BUT don't be afraid to message me about any of the genres :)\n\n\u2022 Real Life Romance \\[X\\] \\[#\\]\n\n\u2022 Fantasy\n\n\u2022 Sci-Fi \\[X\\]\n\n\u2022 Mecha \\[X\\] \\[#\\]\n\n\u2022 Halo \\[X\\]\n\n\u2022 Star Wars (Clone Wars Era) \\[X\\] \\[#\\]\n\n\u2022 Anthem \\[X\\] \\[#\\]\n\n\u2022 Elder Scrolls\n\n\u2022 Destiny \\[X\\] \\[#\\]\n\n\u2022 Superhero \\[X\\] \\[#\\]\n\n\u2022 Apocalypse\n\nI hope you all enjoyed what I've produced and I hope that I get some responses fairly soon!

            "selftext": " \n\nHi! I\u2019m Gambit. I am a veteran role player with a couple years of experience under my belt. I am twenty one years old and live on the east coast of the United States. My job allows me to work out of the comfort of my home which gives me a lot of down time to role play. My background in role playing started when I was fifteen and played Pathfinder for the first time. That very first session was enough to hook me and I became a role playing addict. In the years since I have played in multiple campaigns and also ran plenty of campaigns as a game master. I\u2019m here today looking to find role play partners who are interested in building worlds and stories together.\n\nI have a lot of interests when it comes to role play and it ranges from fandom to completely original. In terms of fandom I am open to most video game, movie, and tv fandoms. As II love creating original characters who get to tell new and exciting stories in these established universes with complete narrative freedom to explore it all. That being said I am also completely for building these new and fresh universes to explore together as both partners and hopefully friends. If you think you have a great idea or wish to know my other fandom interests please don\u2019t hesitate to ask me. Fair warning though I do tend to prefer playing original characters just because it gives me more narrative freedom.\n\nIn a partner all I am really looking for is someone who is friendly and loves writing as much as I do. Honestly I don\u2019t care about your skill levels as long as you are invested and dedicated to telling the best story we possibly can. I do love to chat out of character about plot twists and ideas so anyone into that is a bonus. I do ask that you be over eighteen though as I tend to prefer dark stories with heavy adult themes such as violence and etc.\n\nThe types of stories I write tend to be dark and heavy in its core. They tend to have a lot of drama and mystery inside them. The stories focus on the characters and their relationships with each other and the people around them. I like to watch the character and their bond develop in reaction the events and trauma of the story. It also tends to have a slow burning romance underneath it all that explores all the intimacy that comes with a relationship. There is a beauty in watching love blossom and to explore it\u2019s journey to the ending whether it be a tragic one or a blessed one.\n\nAlso to note when it comes to romantic pairings I have the most experience with male and female. However I am also open to platonic role plays which I don\u2019t have a preference for so play whatever your heart desires. My preferred writing style is third person past tense. When it comes to length I prefer one to two paragraphs but am capable of putting out more when called for. \n\nIf any of this interests you please message me and we can discuss ideas and details. I also have writing samples if they are required. Thanks for your time and I hope all of you have a great day! Good luck in all your searches!",

            "selftext": "Good evening, ladies, gentlemen! It's nice to meet you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a quick introduction, I'm a man in his early twenties, from eastern Canada. I'm into video games, drawing, music, and a couple of other small [hobbies](https://hobbies.As). As a writer, I tend to enjoy high fantasy a lot, but tonight, I'm hanging around for a modern roleplay, and there might be one steampunk setting I'd like to try. In all cases, let me know what you think of the ideas and if you have any of your own!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I let you read the plot ideas, I just wanted to inform you that I'm mostly looking for some long term development that might lead to romance. The kind of character I tend to like roleplaying as are guys who are confident and outgoing on the outside, but might hide some insecurity or other \"weak\" traits. I like trying to make them proud enough to hide these flaws until someone pushes them into that zone. \n\nI guess you can see where I'd like to go for the character I'd pair him up with. I want a woman that's bold, forward. Tomboyish, if you'd like. I like when my partner tries to pull reactions out of my character, I absolutely adore writing the reactions! I'm not afraid to make my move either, so rest assured, I'll make it move as much as you will.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow! For the plots. The interesting part. The main course! Here are some ideas that I hope you'll like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Modern slice-of-life:** The bright side of bullying\n\nFor this one, I was thinking along the lines of childhood friends slowly drifting apart as one of them grew up to be more popular and let it get to their head. (Preferably the girl, if we're going for romance!) I was thinking perhaps they drift apart, and rejoin later in life due to some circumstances. Are they in the same college? Perhaps do they work at the same place? Or maybe they share a \"secret spot\" in which they like to hang out alone, but they happen to visit it both at the same time? In all cases, the main focus is playing around the tension of the bullied maybe still feeling uncomfortable and tense around the other character, and it's better if they're oblivious to it. \n\n2. **Modern slice-of-life:** The rising players of North America\n\nA group of young players aim to become the world champions. A very, very unrealistic dream for a bunch of highschool/college students. There will be sweat, tears and blood. In this roleplay, I'd like to see tensions in the group. I'd like to experiment around perhaps arrogant players learning proper respect and humility. This could also be a nice cheesy set up for some romance between a cocky tomboy and perhaps a more insecure boy that hides his anxious moments with arrogance to try and boost his ego, which would easily lead to great tension! I'd actually really like that sort of development.\n\n3. **Steampunk:** A young \"punk\" to fix the world \n\nThis is the story of a young boy who thrives in a city that is rotten to the core with corruption and questionable ethics. It perhaps is the capital of its country, but for the lower-class people, it's an inevitable hell. Gangsters, an extremely active black market, corrupted authorities, there's nothing right with the place. Yet, that one boy is ready to give everything he has to make it shine bright. He's as proud of his homeland as he hates it. Will he escape, or will he dirty his hands for the greater good? There's only one certainty: he cannot do it alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have some fantasy plot, but I'm not looking for these at the moment. Let's chat, and I hope to hear from you soon!",

I am a female role-player, a long time fan of the Borderlands series and would love to find more people to role play the game with.\n\n I am new to role-playing across Reddit, but I am not knew to role playing in general. I have had many years of experience across Amino and Geeking. Although Amino has gone down hill and Geeking ended up shutting down. So now I've migrated here!\n\n So, now for the plot. I am over eighteen and am open to almost any plot you can think of. I am here to try and make your ideas a reality. But they must be Borderlands related, and you must also respect my choice to say no to a plot I don't feel like doing.\n\n For characters, I can play almost any female character from the game, but I am especially good at, Maya, Nisha, Gaige and Moxxi. Oh, and I would also say that I am incredibly good at playing Handsome Jack. Characters I will not play are Athena, Janey, Auralia, and any male other than Jack.\n\n For your character, if you want to play as an OC, feel free to send me his or her or it's bio. But I wouldn't could on it because I only very rarely enjoy OCs and will probably ask you to play as a cannon character. Random nameless Bandits or wildlife is fine, but fully fledged characters is not.\n\n I hope to role play with you all! See you, soon!",

I love RP when I can get it, and there's been a bit of a dry spell lately. I am seeking to change that.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you may ask? Look below:\n\n-Modern (this can be fantasy, slice of life, drama)\n\n-Historical (I am getting a kick out of medieval, as well as 1940s/1950s/1960s play)\n\n-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n-Fandoms (I like Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire, Harry Potter, Vikings, The Last Kingdom; others need ask!)\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional animated picture.\n\nI am an adult, and I write like one in terms of the writing. I seek those in a similar boat too. I also enjoy players who like to socialize outside of RP (OOC), since there'll be times when we may not be able to RP but can talk.\n\nOne last thing...feel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours &amp; please be someone who actively uses it. Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!",

            "selftext": " Hey there! I am a female role-player, a long time fan of the Borderlands series and would love to find more people to role play the game with.\n\n I am new to role-playing across Reddit, but I am not knew to role playing in general. I have had many years of experience across Amino and Geeking. Although Amino has gone down hill and Geeking ended up shutting down. So now I've migrated here!\n\n So, now for the plot. I am over eighteen and am open to almost any plot you can think of. I am here to try and make your ideas a reality. But they must be Borderlands related, and you must also respect my choice to say no to a plot I don't feel like doing.\n\n For characters, I can play almost any female character from the game, but I am especially good at, Maya, Nisha, Gaige and Moxxi. Oh, and I would also say that I am incredibly good at playing Handsome Jack. Characters I will not play are Athena, Janey, Auralia, and any male other than Jack.\n\n For your character, if you want to play as an OC, feel free to send me his or her or it's bio. But I wouldn't could on it because I only very rarely enjoy OCs and will probably ask you to play as a cannon character. Random nameless Bandits or wildlife is fine, but fully fledged characters is not.\n\n I hope to role play with you all! See you, soon!",

Our RP is currently in it\u2019s baby stages, and we\u2019re looking for more writers to help us build something great!\n\nLore:\n\nErdegroz is said to be the most blessed planet in the universe, one hand crafted by God himself- or at least, thats what the followers of Eden believe. They believe God used his own seed to plant a lone tree at the equator of Erdegroz, and the tree had grown to such a massive size that it can be seen extending off the planet from outer space. That tree is the Tree of Life. While its existence is undeniable, scientists and several varying religious groups have argued since the dawn of humans if it were the work of some higher power. Apples large enough to create their own orbit grow here. It is said one bite from this fruit will grant godhood. Since the tree is heavily guarded by powerful beasts and deadly monsters, no one had even managed to get near the tree. That is until a large group of people risked their lives millions of years ago; all for the sake of extracting sap from the tree\u2019s roots. They were successful- and brought it back to civilization. Some say they were punished by eternity in Hell for their sins, but regardless they\u2019d managed to spread the sap; and severely diluted offspring of the Tree of Life had sprouted here and there. The apples grown from these trees, unlike the original, are only slightly bigger than an average apple. However, it is said anyone who eats one will be granted great powers.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u2022Magic-esque elements\n\n\u2022Flexible with OCs and if something doesn\u2019t work with the RP, our admin will talk it out with you or lend some advice\n\n\u2022This RP is a WIP, it\u2019s started rather recently, and we\u2019re happy to take suggestions or plot ideas!\n\n\u2022RP isn\u2019t strict length-wise, but we are looking for more literate writers!\n\n\u2022general chat and art channel- we\u2019re not just roleplay robots, we like to goof off and chit chat as well!\n\n\u2022Feel free to message me for any further details, answers to questions, or if you\u2019d be interested in checking out the server!\n\nThanks!",

Here is the setup:\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***This roleplay takes place in the setting of the anime \"Full Metal Panic\", a world where in 1998 the Cold War is still ongoing and highly advanced \"Black Technology\" has led to the development of humanoid combat mecha known as Arm Slaves.*** \n\n***The source of this advanced technology are individuals known as the \"Whispered\". Seemingly normal people born on a specific date and blessed with knowledge they simply should not possess.***\n\n***Only a select few know about the Whispered, but those who know about them seek them for their own ends.*** \n\n***However this roleplay is also set in an alternate universe where things have transpired differently then in the canon source material.***\n\n***The covert mercenary organization Mithril and the secret organization Amalgam are still at odds with one another, but the nature of the organizations has changed.***\n\n***Things aren\u2019t as clear cut as they were in canon and the pasts of canon characters have also been affected, leaving many holding different allegiances or leading different lives entirely.***\n\n***Plots are brewing, tensions are rising, and both organizations will soon clash to determine the fate of the Whispered and ultimately the world...***\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis roleplay is intended to be a 'literate' one with descriptive posts and a mix of mecha combat and character interaction, similar in tone and theme to the original series to a degree. \n\nAs mentioned above it also takes place in an AU, which might make or break things for some people. \n\nHowever I didn't want to just do a rehash of the show with original characters thrown in. With this setup people are free to make original characters to their liking or claim a canon character and retool them, allowing for interesting alternate character interpretations of canon characters. \n\nI have high hopes for this roleplay, but I need more players to make the most of things *(especially people willing to do interesting plays on canon characters).* \n\nI'm not familiar with advertising here and I think I read that we're not allowed to post outgoing links? I don't want to risk breaking he rules so if anyone is interested just say so and I'll send you the link to the forum in private. ",

i only have a few requirements, and they're honestly just basic and standard.\n\n- must be 18+, not negotiating this whatsoever, since my plots will all have some form of mature themes within them.\n- have proper grammar and punctuation. i'm not big on capitalization, etc, since i literally never use them, but a grasp on the english language just so that i can understand what you're saying, then you'll be good in my book!\n- no-oneliners. i understand that some scenes require less sentences, but i just want a happy medium, so between one paragraph and three is the best for me!\u00a0\n- don't be creepy, just have fun!\n- contribute and communicate! i just want someone that i can feel like we're both giving in and putting effort towards our plot! i don't want someone who's response to everything is 'oh that's fine with me!' i want someone who i can talk with ooc about everything.\n\nnow onto the juicy stuff, the plots!\ni have many plots in mind but for me i want them all to include romance and mature themes, i don't do fade to black. i play both m and f and i prefer if my partner can play both, or plays mainly m. i've had terrible experiences with those who play just f, so i tend to avoid them, if that's a dealbreaker then sorry, i'm not the one for you! when it comes to faceclaims, etc, i only play people of color, and i very very VERY rarely use white faceclaims, unless i can't find an alternative for a canon character, my muses range from 19-28, so i try to keep them as diverse as possible.\n\nwhen it comes to fandoms i'm only in a few, and if there's a fandom that you're interested in playing that isn't listed there, just ask me about it and i'm sure that i'll be able to try and get into it! the only fandoms i won't get into are supernatural, doctor who and riverdale, they've just... a hard no. anyways, the fandoms i find are the ones i love are: marvel, dc, steven universe, transformers, boku no hero academia and avatar: the last airbender/legend of korra.\u00a0\n\nmy favorite/most wanted pairings for each one are listed below!\n- marvel: miles morales + mj, peter parker + mj/liz, bruce banner + oc, storm + tchalla, frank castle + oc, venom + annie, venom + oc, killmonger + oc, deadpool + spiderman, deadpool + oc, cable + oc.\n- dc: batman + wonder woman, bumblebee + cyborg, poison ivy + harley quinn, batman + oc, aquaman + oc, beastboy + raven, wonder woman + oc.\n- transformers: sam witwicky + oc.\n- bnha: deku + bakugo, yaoyorozu + iida, deku + todoroki, jiro + kaminari, kirishima + oc, todoroki + oc, ochaco + deku.\n- a:tla/lok: korra + oc, korra + mako, korra + asami, bolin + oc.\n\nplots i've been craving (if i don't use gendered pronouns for that specific plot, then any pairing is okay!):\n- something along the lines of captain marvel where a human who\u2019s been given powers\u2014yet lost their memories of who they once were\u2014crash lands back to earth. while there they meet the person they once loved and now they have to adjust to life on earth, and falling back in love with the person who\u2019s been waiting for their return. \n- an alien who's brought down to earth due to being chased by some intergalactic force or is the last of their kind and decided to leave their dying world for a chance at something new. i absolutely love the dynamic of someone getting used to an entirely different world (and species) and learning a whole bunch of new things.\n- anything with maybe a princess to be set in the 60s/70s of england, where she begins to fall in love with her advisor\u2014the prime minister of england. heated, sneaky rendezvous set within the halls of the royal castle. i\u2019d absolutely crave a secretive/undercover relationship with this theme. \n- zombie apocalypse where a person living amongst the trash is discovered by a passerby heading towards a sanctuary free of zombies. they begin their journey and fall in love\u2014but, during one of their encounters with a band of zombies... one of them is bit. they continue to travel with one of them desperately fighting the change taking course within them, hoping that this sanctuary has a cure in store. \n- a soft indie couple where a shy girl slowly begins to come out of her shell around her awkward new guy friend. they begin to fall in love around their interest in music\u2014they even begin a tiny indie music band in their parent\u2019s garage, spending time in between takes falling deeper into each other\u2019s souls. bonus points if it\u2019s in the 80s or 90s!\n\n\nif you've made it this far then you deserve a whole cake, i know i wrote a whole bunch, lol. if you think we'd be a fit then please don't hesitate to message my inbox! just state your name, preferred pronouns and a mini writing sample for whichever pairing/plot stuck out to you the most! this way i know you actually took the time to read my post and gives me a great first impression of you. i hope to see a lot of you guys soon!",

I need someone who is patient, because I'm a busy person and won't always be able to reply to the story right away.\n\nAs far as story lines go, I'm very open. I have a couple in mind, or we can make another one up.\n\nSlice of life: It was by chance we had met, some would say it was fate if you believed in that kind if stuff. As time goes on we become closer, open our selves up, and help heal each other. Yay for cheesey romance!\n\nAs far as the adventure story goes, there are so many options. We could do mordern day (I'm thinking treasure hunters), Medieval fantasy (Epic quests!), Western (Who doesn't want to be an outlaw?)- the possibilities are endless.\n\nThe roleplay will be on discord only, and i strongly prefer it be in 3rd person. Like i said, 18+ is a must, because i like lots of mature themes.\nSpeaking of mature themes, we can get into details about what we prefer in private chat. I will post my limits here, though: Beast, bathroom, and underaged. \nSend me a message on reddit, with the word \"willow\" to show you have read everything. I look forward to talking to you!\n\n",

If not we can work off something you've made or have been thinking of, I'm open to new ideas! Or the third option, using someone else's world to make something cool. (I really wanna use the Gen:Lock world from RoosterTeeth's new animation or Fate/.) All I really ask for is that you're literate, more so grammatically then matching length. (Cause lets be real here there are some scenes where it's dialogue heavy and there's no way for us to write 2-3 paragraphs.)\n\nAll I ask is that you're patient with me considering I'm mainly awake nights due to my job, mainly being vertical late at night to early morning CST. (Also prefer if you're actually female but if not it's no big deal.) Also please please be 18+ if you're wanting to do smut whatsoever. (And I'd like it to only be in the roleplay if it's co-aligns with what we both want to do.)\n\nI'll basically do anything as long as it has some kind of fantasy element, and I won't do horror. Sorry I'm just really bad at writing for that genre.\n\nPM if you're interested, if it takes me a moment to respond I apologise. :)\n\n\n",

I love RP when I can get it, and there's been a bit of a dry spell lately. I am seeking to change that.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you may ask? Look below:\n\n-Modern (this can be fantasy, slice of life, drama)\n\n-Historical (I am getting a kick out of medieval, as well as 1940s/1950s/1960s play)\n\n-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n-Fandoms (I like Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire, Harry Potter, Vikings, The Last Kingdom; others need ask!)\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional animated picture.\n\nI am an adult, and I write like one in terms of the writing. I seek those in a similar boat too. I also enjoy players who like to socialize outside of RP (OOC), since there'll be times when we may not be able to RP but can talk.\n\nOne last thing...feel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours &amp; please be someone who actively uses it. Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! Thought I'd try a new idea today, a little something I've been thinking up. So to those who are familiar or partially familiar with the SCP Foundation: I'm interested in an NSFW roleplay. It'll be NSFW for a couple of reasons, given the nature of the SCP Foundation, there will almost certainly be death and dark plots. But \"fun times\" and happy moments in the story too! I'd love for this to be long term, with a nice little world built up with multiple characters and plotlines between them. \n\nThere are a few different scenarios we could try out here. Or if you have any to add on, feel free to!\n\n1- SCP/human. Involving one of the non harmful SCPs like 105. Perhaps between the SCP and a scientist, MTF member, or guard. Perhaps a fellow SCP!\n\n2- Doctor/MTF. Involving a doctor designated to an MTF team and has to patch us up, whilst falling in love with a member of the team. Added worry bonus that the MTF member may be KIA. \n\n3- MTF/MTF. Speaks for itself, falling in love on the job. Saving eachother's butts. Maybe we're the only surviving members of the team and have no idea if we'll make it out?\n\n4- Scientist/Scientist. Again, falling in love on the job but less risky. More calm than working on an MTF. But has its perks.\n\n5- O5. Hell, thrown in the deep end. O5 with anything. Since they're mysterious yet command a lot of respect. It'd be difficult to find love as an O5. But not impossible. \n\nJust to clarify. There will be \"fun times\" and stuff, but it isn't going to dominate the story. Before the \"fun times\" actually start. Character buildup would be great, as well as some development in the plot too. Please also be able to play multiple characters. If you're interested in any of these, or have ideas of your own. Hit me up!\n\n(Please no groups as well, I tend not to do so well with groups. 1x1 please :D) ",

            "selftext": "\n\n*Escape.*\n\n*{March 18th 2026}*\n\nA stadium full of screaming fans, are chanting a name. \u201cGwen! Gwen! Gwen!\u201d They has been chanting for awhile now. Then they scream as the lights are dimmed in the stadium besides the stage lights. A man with long brown hair steps out as he plays his bass, the drummer runs out with his sticks as he goes up to his drum set and began to play, then the fans go wild as a woman with blond hair comes from back stage as she starts strumming her guitar playing the right cords. She had an earpiece that was her microphone, and she began to sing\n\n_\u201cIt's getting cold down here underneath the weather\nI skipped class to sit with you\nI really like your spotty sweater\nIf ladybugs are girls\nHow do you make kids together?\nWhat's it like in a female world\nI bet it's just so much better\nI just turned fourteen\nAnd I think this year I'm gonna be mean..\u201d_\n\nAfter she finishes that last line she went to the edge of the stage, smiling, she knew her fans knew the song, as she started the chorus the fans sung along with her \n\n_\u201cDon't mess with me I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\nDon't message me cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry\nAin't that how its s'posed to be? Though it isn't me\nBoys will be bugs right?\u201d_\n\nShe loved the fact that her fans knew every single lyric, and as the show went on the fans were pleased. After the show was over Gwen went to her out and back to her tour van with her other band mates, when she enter the bus she looked at the driver he wasn\u2019t the same driver from earlier, and he had a somewhat devilish smile planted on his face. She of course looked confused but payed no attention. She went to the back of the bus crashing on the couch. When her band mates got on the bus, the driver started the bus and began to drive. As he was driving down a road he purposely crashed the bus into oncoming traffic, Gwen and her band mates went flying since they weren\u2019t in seatbelts, although Gwen didn\u2019t make it to the front of the bus like the others her head hit a metal pole that was behind the drivers seat and she was immediately knocked unconscious.\n\n\n\n{March 26th 2026}\n\nGwen was laying on a table. She was becoming conscious again. As she felt someone shaking her body, and then eventually calling her name, Gwen woke up, as she winced in pain, the back of her head and neck was in pain. As she sat up slowly there was a man dressed in all black stood before her.\n\n\u201cYour finally awake Seventy-Six\u201d \n\nHe said plainly, his voice had no emotion behind it, which kinda frightened her. He helped her off the table and began to walk down a dark hallway that led to double doorsz\n\n\u201cSeventy-Six?\u201d\n\nShe looked up at the man confused. Although she couldn\u2019t remember her name at the moment she definitely knew it wasn\u2019t seventy-six. The man just chuckled and shook his head.\n\n\u201cYes, you are number Seventy-Six. Now no more questions. Your new life awaits you.\u201d\n\nShe kept the confused look on her face, new life? What was he talking about. As we reached the end of the double doors there was a bright light through the cracks and as he pushed the door open, the light was so bright it practically blinded her for a second, she haven\u2019t seen sunlight in so long, eventually her eyes adjusted to the light, when she looked around, she saw a community with houses and shops like a normal city but it wasn\u2019t, there was something off, and their seemed to be two types of people, the ones dressed in regular clothing and the ones dressed in all white scrubs. She looked down at herself, she was dressed in scrubs. Was that good or bad? I guess she was going to find out soon enough. As the man walked with her from the doors and to the community, he showed her around and told her everything she needed to know, as she listened and looked around, the people in scrubs didn\u2019t Seem to happy rather the people in the normal clothing. Although he told her that everyone was equal here by the looks of it, it seemed far fetched. He began to take her down the road where there were only white houses, and as she looked at the houses they had numbers on them ranging from one to one thousand, but the strange thing was that the house and two numbers on it,  and they were either both odd numbers or even, for example there was Twenty-seven and Twenty-nine, or Twenty-Two and Twenty-Four. When he stopped at my house, the numbers were Seventy-Four and Seventy-six.\n\n\u201cSeventy six! That\u2019s my number, that\u2019s my house?\u201d\n\nShe looked at the man and he nodded and went to the door going straight in as if it wasn\u2019t locked, the house was pretty basic having all the basic necessities, except the for the small television in the living room.\n\n\u201cThis is your new house. And your instruments,  instructions and first job assignment will be delivered into the mail box by tomorrow.\u201d\n\nShe looked around sighing, the house looked boring but it would have to do. When she heard him say something about the instruments, and job she looked at him\n\n\u201cI have a job already? What\u2019s my job? Will I be good at it?\u201d\n\nThe man nodded slowly \n\n\u201cYes you are a musician. And yes you have a job and the details will be in the letter we send to this house tomorrow. Now just so you won\u2019t be lonely, your sharing this house with. seventy-four.\u201d\n\nHe went to the stairs and shouted-\n\n\u201cSeventy-Four!\u201d\n\nAnd just like that Y/N came downstairs, and the man moved away from the staircase. Standing next to \u2018Seventy-Six\u2019\n\n\u201cSeventy-Four, this is Seventy-Six. She will be occupying the other available room in this house, now you knew this day was coming, so make your new house buddy feel at home and catch her up on the rules. Show her the booklet please. Now, I must be off, you two get acquainted, because you\u2019ll be together forever.\u201d\n\nAnd just like that the man turned around and walked out the house, leaving us alone, \u2018Seventy-Six\u2019 looked at Seventy-four smiling as she waved.\n\n\u201cHi, my name is Seventy-Six. And you must be Seventy-four. It\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d\n\nShe held out her hand to shake, and Y/N looks at her and..\n\n\n_*Hey, thanks for reading the whole thing! I just have a few simple rules for the Rp then I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m looking for and the plot!*_\n\n_Rules:_\n\u2022Looking for a male or female to play the role of Seventy-four! ((Preferably male since I\u2019m a female, FxF is ok too.  No hate here!)\n\u2022Looking for someone who can write  at the minimum *between 1-7 lines*. *Sometimes I can write a single paragraph, if I\u2019m enjoying what\u2019s happening in the story* \n\u20223rd person please.\n\u2022SFW, But CAN Include NSFW content but I *prefer to fade to black.*\n\u2022I\u2019m semi-literate\u2b07\ufe0f\n{Semi-literate characteristics}\n\u2022fluid style\n\u2022mixture of detail and simplicity\n\u2022decent grammar\n\u2022intermediate vocabulary\n\u2022mixed sentence length\n\u2022basic punctuation\n\n_Details/Plot:_\nok I had this idea, of this \u2018utopian world, where there are two types of people. As in the starter I described it as people with scrubs and people with regular clothing, I have yet to give them specific names but I already know what I mean by that. BTW This takes place on *EARTH*\n\n*And it\u2019s your decision on where your character stands in the community! Is he/she someone fairly new? Or has been there for years?*\n\nPeople that run this new society, \u2018the leader\u2019 sends recruiters out to get people for the society. Now, they captured famous or semi famous people, that are at least experienced in doing something, as for my character you read she was a musician so that means whatever your characters profession was, they were famous from it so choose anything! now one of their recruiters hijacked her bus and crashed it purposely to render her unconscious, but they managed to go unharmed, and well, I don\u2019t wanna ruin the whole process, I want to save it for the roleplay. But they are treaded for wounds or anything else and when healed and awoken they are sent into the community to start their \u2018roles\u2019 whatever they were famous for, they would cater to the rich people, the ones in \u201cnormal clothing\u201d let\u2019s say your character was a famous chef, when brought into the community, they are a personal chef for a family they are assigned to, and even if they hate the job they have to do it. And if they rebel.. something else I want to save for the roleplay. There\u2019s a lot of things I want to work out throughout the story since it\u2019s not perfect. Like the beginning was rushed.  But if your interested please send me an message/commenting *Seventy-Four* \n\n**By the way I only Roleplay on discord**",

            "selftext": "Hello there friends!\n\nI am currently searching for long term RP partners for some interesting RPs.\n\nA little bit about me:\n\nI am a 19 year old female with about 7 or 8 years of experience and even longer writing experience (maybe 9 or 10). However, I have no preference of the gender nor age of my partner!\n\nEST time zone\n\nI RP third person literate and my responses range anywhere from a paragraph to more than several depending on what is happening in the RP.  (I also do try to match responses) \n\nIf for some reason you grow bored or disinterested please do let me know and we can fix it or try something else completely. \n\nI love chatting outside of RP whether it be about our characters, future plot points, coming up with characters in AU\u2019s or just general chat! Although if that\u2019s not your thing then no worries!\n\nI do have a full time job and have responsibilities after so my responses depending may be a couple responses a day to a couple every other day. \n\nFor random RPs, I can do canon and OC characters (although I am more used to canon), and I can play both males and females. I also love to RP groups of characters (more plot and interaction and options!)  character interaction, development, and world building is a must! I love building things to it\u2019s full potential.\n\nSome games I have played:\n\nI will put asterisks next to ones I am inspired for or that I know the most about.\n\nUndertale\nDetroit: Become Human *\nSpider-Man (PS4 2018) \nFinal Fantasy (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 13, 13-2, 13-3, 15 and Kingsglaive, Dissidia, Crisis Core) \nTales (Berseria, Xillia, and Graces f) \nLegend of Zelda (MM, TP, WW, SS, BOTW)\nTelltales The Walking Dead \n\nShows/movies:\n\nMarvel (most movies including the new Spiderverse and also daredevil, not so much comics) \nSherlock *\nMiraculous LB \nRWBY (a favorite) *\nSword Art Online Arc 1 &amp; 2 (more the universe)\nSword Art Online Season 2 (more the universe)\nThe Seven Deadly Sins \n\n\nBooks:\n\nPercy Jackson\nThe Chronicles Of Nick\nWarriors\nMaximum Ride\nAntigoddess *\nBeautiful Creatures\n\nOriginal ideas I enjoy:\n\nFantasy (medieval, magical elements, kingdoms, different races, even adding in tech like airships, modern weapons, and exploring more than one and a variety of aspects as well. There\u2019s so much more I could add but it would take forever.)\n\u2014\u2014&gt; war themes, royal themes, normal life themes \n\nRomance (MxF and possibly FxF and I don\u2019t do smut. More of a fade to black sort of person) I also thoroughly enjoy building it up over time rather than it simply happening! \n\nAction/Adventure\n\nAngst/Drama\n\nI am sure there are more things I am forgetting. \n\nI would be fine exploring any other sorts of themes/plots genres except Sci-Fi and completely normal themes (normal themes would need some convincing as I find it difficult to keep it going) as I like some sort of magical or fictional aspect to it. \n\nIf you have any other suggestions/ideas/plots/settings as to what you would like to do then please shoot me a PM with a bit about you and your interests and we can discuss! Give me a bit about your interests and preferences! I am open to nearly anything!\n\nIf you need a sample of my writing, please do not be afraid to ask! \n\nMy platforms are Kik, Discord, Skype, Email, Google Docs and Reddit PM\n\nThank you and I hope to hear from you soon!

            "selftext": "Hello.\n\nI'm looking for a longterm partner to rp with on Discord, preferably longer roleplays with lots of build ups, drama and action. I am into a lot of genres, but keep in mind if you want to do fantasy stuff with a lot of lore, I will probably be confused for the first 2 hours. It takes me some time to connect the dots, if that makes any sense.   \n\n\nI love building up a world with my partner so that it becomes unique and fits the both of us just about perfectly. That also means I never go straight into the roleplay, I prefer a bunch of discussion beforehand, also to figure out what we're both comfortable with and how we want things to go. As mentioned above, I am a confused person, so before we start I need to be 100% sure of what you prefer. Not that I'm interested in powerplay, just equal understanding on how things are going to be.   \n\n\nI am in timezone +1 (Scandinavia) and I have both work and classes to attend, so my online hours are mostly on the weekends. You will probably see me vanish sometimes if my real life is knocking me out, but don't worry! I won't ghost you and I always make sure to keep updated on my situation (as far as it's appropriate, of course).  \n\n\nGiven that I'm Scandinavian, English isn't my first language either and you will probably sometimes experience a lack in variety in some situations in the roleplays, because obviously it's harder for me to express myself in English rather than my first language. I do try my best, though!   \n\n\nOkay I just realized this is turning into a quite long introduction, and if you got this far, thanks! Please message me if you might be interested. I have today and tomorrow off, so I have plenty of time. ",

            "selftext": "The century long penitent crusade was over. The Lamenters' luck finally gave out as they were crushed by the jaws of Hive Fleet Kraken along with the Task Force of Red Hunters sent to watch them. A few managed to survive on account of the acting Chapter Master's last order that some remnant of the Chapter must survive to continue the fight, even if they might be considered exiles and traitors to the Imperium. Now with the Lamenters Chapter broken and its remnants scattered to the four points of the galactic compass, they continue to wage war upon the enemies of Humanity from the shadows and beneath the radar of the High Lords of Terra and the Inquisition because for those we cherish, we die in glory.\n\nSurvivors: Vigil - Sanguinary Guard, Uriel - Calix (Apothecary), Darian - Techmarine, Thaumiel - Librarian, Diocletian - Terminator, Israfel - Dreadnought, Florian - Tactical Marine, Furio - Scout\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey hey everyone so today I was looking to do an RP set in the 40k Universe where instead of surviving their run-in with Hive Fleet Kraken, the Lamenters were effectively destroyed. They're my favourite Chapter and I was happy to see they came out on top in canon but I figured this might make for some more interesting stories, the specifics of which I'd be happy to discuss on discord. I'm pretty open minded so don't feel the need to hold anything back.\n\nAlternatively if you're not a fan of space marines and/or prefer the guard I'm also a fan of the Harakoni Warhawks and would be happy to do something involving them as well.\n\nI know there are some creative cookies out there so I'm eager to see what sort of weird plots and dynamics we can come up with. If you're new to 40k or know nothing about it but are still interested I'd be happy to accommodate as best I can.",

            "selftext": "Instead of making several character specific posts, I decided to group them all together. I'm looking for a partner to play any canon character from DC, Marvel, Image, Valiant, IDW, or Dark Horse. I am capable of roleplaying the following characters: Invincible, Tempest, Red Robin, Timothy Hunter, Robin, Ninjak, Hawk, Marko, Spider-Man, Shazam, Batman Beyond, Red Hood, Casey Jones, Wally West, Black Adam, Hellboy, John Constantine, Jason Blood/Etrigan, Swamp Thing, Nightwing, Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, Superboy, Bane, Deathstroke, Captain Cold, Deadshot, Atom, Mister Miracle, Kyle Rayner, Beast Boy, Ted Kord, Zachary Zatara, Jaime Reyes, and a few others. The characters listed offer a broad range for genres and scenarios. \n\nNow let's go onto the boring rules part of the post. I ask that my partner be very literate and able to write quite a bit. I absolutely love having a bunch of details. I also ask that you be open to any NSFW themes. I do enjoy not having limits to the roleplay experience since it allows me to fully involve myself in my character's role. I hope I don't sound too demanding!\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message. I look forward to exploring some comic book worlds!",
