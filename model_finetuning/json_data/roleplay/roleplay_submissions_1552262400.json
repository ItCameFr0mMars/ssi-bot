Now I'm not looking for a ten page essay nor a perfectly written response, I'm just looking for someone who can post more than a bare-bones five line response every time. I am very open to criticism and would like to know if I'm doing something wrong, I ask that you are the same, I'm tired of people ghosting because they don't communicate.  \n\nNow that that's out of the way, hello there! I'm Wendigo, or you can call me Deer. I'm looking for a partner to do a literate and detailed roleplay taking place in more fantasy based settings. I'm not a huge fan of \"slice of life\" however I'm willing to do it if we add sci-fi or modern fantasy elements. As far as prompts go, I typically wait for us to discuss our characters before making something that revolves around them. I do also enjoy a sense of realism in my roleplays as well, saying that we will be exploring some dark themes, (more on that when you pm me), however I do enjoy a sense of whimsy as well, it all depends on the scenario. \n\nWhen it comes to roleplaying I use 3rd person narrative form and I typically get out three to five paragraphs, sometimes longer or shorter depending on the scene. I've been roleplaying for nearly seven years and I do prefer to use discord to write because of the server system, this will allow us to separate our regular chatting and ideas from our roleplay.\n\nWell I believe that's it! If you have any questions pm me, I don't bite, yet. Also please don't just comment on this post, please have the initiative to reach out to me and if this post is still up I'm still looking, I'm always looking for good roleplayers.",

I'm interested in finding a new RP partner or group; I used to be very active in the Tumblr Fallout RP community before it died out, and have had trouble finding a good venue/community with which to roleplay. Which is to say, I'm not new to RP, but I'm out of the loop.\n\nAnyway, in terms of plot, I'm pretty flexible and interested in hearing your ideas. I'm not super current on many fandoms but I'm big into Fire Emblem, Fallout, Undertale, Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, a few other video games; I'm also far from opposed from creating a 'verse from scratch without any connection to a fandom. I've played both OCs and canon characters and I'm totally willing to write opposite either. What I'm mostly looking for is personal compatibility as individuals first, then authorial chemistry as a secondary perk. Truth be told, I'm studying in a foreign country right now and I'm honestly a bit lonely. \n\nI'm totally down for NSFW (do we not call it smut anymore? Am I old?) but not necessarily as the primary focus of a plot. I'm interested in finding either individual partners or communities, and I'd prefer something like Discord over Kik/Whatsapp as my phone service isn't reliable here.\n\nAnyway, if any of this sparked your interest, shoot me a DM! I'm pretty friendly, tell me a little about yourself and what you're interested in and we can go from there. Cheers!",

            "selftext": "Hallo! I've been roleplaying for probably ten or eleven years now. Following the loss of a couple partners I'm looking for one or two steady partners to add to the roster. I'm about to head to bed, then work tomorrow, so I might take a bit to respond.\n\nTo preface, my details:\n\n* 23 years old gal and fine with romance/NSFW when it's a good addition to the plot.\n* EST Time zone- I'm happy to play with someone from any zone, though!\n* I basically work full time; it's hard to predict, but I'm usually out by 4pm EST. \n* If I'm working, I might be able to get a short reply in. Or a long one, if the manager is nice and it's slow.\n* Preference for long-term stories\n* Life happens, I'm patient for a story that I've fallen in love with. Just please keep chatting too! \n* I'll play in just about anything, with a preference for semi-realistic.\n* Can post novella size responses. I routinely go over the 2K character cap on Discord. \n* Loves to read. Please, write me novels! I adore it! \n* Third person, past tense. The usual here! \n* I'm pretty good about grammar but typos do like to slip out. (I also intermix variations, like color and behaviour)\n* Lots of characters- I prefer female roles (naturally) but I have males as well. \n* Any pairing- I'm all good with whatever's thrown at me. \n* Likes to throw said characters under buses. Expect lots of angst. \n* I'll roleplay most things that aren't ponies. Though I am a furry, I'm not interested in playing them.\n* I like to draw so I may draw things\n* Discord is preferred, but I also have Telegram. I can run in Reddit pm's as well. \n* Cursing is all good, I use it mildly.\n* I'll talk about *saucy* preferences once we're in a different chat! \n* I try to reply quickly- sometimes I might be out of it, tired, at work, but don't fret. If it's been a while feel free to poke! Please, do poke- sometimes I honestly do forget. \n* I'm generally stable in what times I'm available and I like that in my partners as well.\n\nTo add in before I get to the plots: I want you to write. As I said, I'm looking for people that enjoy the long term novella stuff, those who like to let the world build up on its own and let things occur organically instead of forcing something in for sake of doing it. I like to make plot points to play out down the road. I want to see some body to your inquiry! A long message is attractive on its own to me, even if it's just babbling about your favorite character or some idea for a plot line or something. If you're on a time crunch then do say so, otherwise super short responses won't garner interest from me. \n\n\n**I totally didn't just watch HTTYD** \n\nOkay, so this one isn't gonna be all that original, but I do have a bit of a craving for this theme, starting off with a character having stumbled upon a dragon of mine, injured or asleep. The setting I'm thinking of in a forest, nearby to a village. This dragon is a new character of mine, a hybrid creature that was shunned from other dragons due to the mixed \"bad blood\". I'm thinking of it being male, however it can be female. It'll be a black dragon that, when scratched or burned, reveals gold underneath the black coat. Patterns can be etched in and will remain until molting occurs. The dragon would be mature in its age.\n\n\nIf this idea doesn't interest you, but you'd still like to inquire, feel free! I'm totally down to chatting and seeing what we can do. As for other interests, I honestly, *seriously*, want to make a new story around the books Poet Anderson. I used to have a story for this, and the partner up and disappeared and deleted the roleplay with him. I adored my character Eve for this, and I'd absolutely love the chance to play her again in this world. \n\nGoodnight folks. Wish me luck tomorrow that I don't get too many crazy people. ",

We would both be playing as villains who go through the world killing everyone in our path. We can have a story if you would like that but the main appeal is getting some of your dark side out in a fun way. Note, we will not be playing the good guys in any way, we have no problem with killing the innocent.\n\nHere are the different ideas I have, feel free to suggest your own.\n\nDark fantasy: we would play as two wizards going through the world trying to get more powerful by getting the souls of mortal humans. We can what ever kind of powers you want, it does not matter how over powers your powers are.\n\nSuper villains: this is pretty self explanatory. We play as villains who want to kill all super heros. Powers dont matter in this one either.\n\nHorror movie: we play as classic horror movie villains killing people like in horror movie.\n\nIf your interested send me a dm and I can give you my discord tag and we can discuss.

A place where fans of Infamous Second Son and Infamous can come and roleplay almost directly after the events of the game.  \n\n\nWe have lore and a plot dedicated to this server. Want to come and be important to the plot? We have events where the normal users of the server get to shape the world we're set in. Have world changing effects, create a story, and have fun shaping the world.  \n\n\nDon't want to do plot important RP? That's perfectly fine. Come, make a Conduit or be a normal human. Chill in the server. Meet new people and make new friends. You don't need to participate in the events you can just come and chill out in the setting of Seattle post Bad Karma Infamous.  \n\n\nWe welcome all. Come RP paragraphs, or just RP chill. We're about the community and about the fun. Participate in giveaways. Win extra character slots, win more powerful powers, win important plot positions  \n\n\nI hope to see you there. I hope you enjoy your time and I hope you stay and become a member of the family :D  \n https://discord.gg/GnHQanw ",

The Romans and Witches. \n\nThe Romans are Battle Mechs used to fight the Mythos in Melee combat, while the Witches used the natural magic of Mythos against them. \n\nSo an academy was formed to train prospects in the ways.

            "selftext": " \n\nHi! I\u2019m Travis! I\u2019m twenty one years old and based out of the east coast of the US. This post continues my search for long term role play partners. First let me tell you a little about myself so that we aren\u2019t strangers. I have been role playing since I was fifteen years old when I played Dungeons and Dragons for the first time. Ever since then I have been completely obsessed with world building and crafting large stories containing multiple characters. That actually has turned potential partners away from me because not everyone is comfortable playing multiple characters. That\u2019s fine and I understand that which is why I would never ask my partner to do more than they are comfortable. I used to be a game master so jumping from character is second nature to me and I enjoy it.\n\nWhat I am looking for is someone is open minded and creative when it comes to writing. The ideal person would be a fan of world building and multiple genres so that we have options when it comes to picking a potential plot. The preferred writing length would be one to two paragraphs and be in third person past tense. As for the age of my partners I must ask that you be 18+ years old as I am twenty one. I would feel more comfortable with a partner either closer to my age or older because my role plays tend to be dark with adult themes. Which brings me to my next topic which is NSFW elements which my role plays tend to include. However that doesn\u2019t mean they are smut filled as they aren\u2019t I mean NSFW in the way of violent themes and things along that lines. I am completely fine with there being no smut however if there is I like to have romance as a slow burning underlying theme. That being said I am comfortable with smut but I would prefer if we also focused on the other aspects of a relationship and the different forms of intimacy.\n\nThe stories I am most interested in writing at the moment are medieval fantasy and vigilante. The Vigilante story would begin at the start of the meta human crisis and carry on as the two main characters struggle to maintain their sanity as they try to assemble a team to help them defend their city. The Medieval Fantasy would be like if Lord of the Rings mixed with Game of Thrones. It has all the magic and wonder of exploring new lands but is plagued by the cruel realities of men. If none of these catch your interest please feel free to message me anyway if you think you have a good idea. I am open to pretty much anything as long as I feel there is a good story to be told. Also just as a rule I tend to play only OC\u2019s as they make me feel comfortable and give me my narrative freedom. I also tend to play males as my main character but I often double up to play female side characters.\n\nIf you made it this far thank you for caring enough to read it all and I hope you have a great day. Thank you all for your time and I hope to hear from you all real soon. If you are interested in potentially being partners please direct message me here on reddit.\n\nPS: I also have plenty of writing samples if any of you are into that kind of thing.",

I want to write with you for a long time, especially if I like you.\n\n- Discord. While not an absolute must for the sake of the rules, I vastly prefer it to any other medium.\n\n- Platonic relationships. Never thought I'd need to specify this, but I do want to also play non-romantic relationships, as well as romantic, between characters. Frodo and Sam, Han and Chewie, that sort of thing.\n\n- Someone who doesn't care about post length. I don't ask for a lot, and while sometimes I go lengthy I prefer that you move the story along even if its short. Size doesn't matter, basically.\n\n- A partner who will communicate freely and can give and take criticism in a civil manner is another must, as I need to know when I am making a mistake or an error and I do like to point those out to my partners as well to help keep things on track.\n\nI love a lot of collaboration, so if you think you match these criteria then I would like to hear from you!",

I typically write a lot more than so but if you want fast replies and multiple in a few days we can keep it down to a few paragraphs at a time. I also highly prefer darker themes rather than \u201cfluff\u201d. Fluff can be pretty cringe-worthy and I just don\u2019t have the patience for it. Don\u2019t get me wrong though! I do like it from time to times. \n\nWhen it comes to canon vs original character, I typically prefer canon when it comes to male characters but I cannot handle female canon characters because most of them are written by a man who knows nothing but stereotypes and shaping an over- sexual character, rather than an actual human. I\u2019m pretty open when it comes to the plot. I will write just about anything that you suggest because it\u2019s important for both of us to be enjoying what we are writing and not just me. \n\nThe brings me to verses! I\u2019m a huge fan of the following but DEFINITELY not limited to: \n\nThe Vampire Diaries / The Originals \n\nOnce Upon A Time \n\nUmbrella Academy \n\nThe Last Kingdom \n\nGame of Thrones (I\u2019m a little bit behind.) \n\n I have watched a bit of anime but I\u2019m not that knowledgeable on many. \nYou can pm me about what I have watched or read manga-wise. I like to read more than watch. \n\nIf you have any other verses let me know! I\u2019m pretty much open to almost anything. Just tell me what you\u2019re thinking. \n\nI\u2019m okay with basically any sort of pairing such as \nfxf, mxm, m,f\n\nI even enjoy polygamy. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in a group let me know! \n\nFinally, all I will write on is discord. \nPrivate message me for my user!

It'll get nsfw, obviously, but it most definitely won't be 100% of the roleplay. I'm thinking maybe a third at *most?* \n\nI don't have all of the details figured out, and that's where *you* come in! I wanna world build a bit, and there's tons of room for creative choices and changes. \n\nAlso, you might have noticed F4*A*. Yeah, if you don't wanna play a guy, you don't have to. The succubus can be gay.\n\nNow, onto technicalities!\nI use both kik and discord, although I personally would prefer to roleplay through kik simply because it's more convenient to me (don't ask, long story). \nI can rp in both 3rd and 1st person, but if I *had* to choose, I'd use 1st person more often. \nI tend to give pretty good responses, I like to think. Several paragraphs when necessary. But if it's just a conversation between two people sitting at a bar, I'm more likely to just send a bit of dialogue. I've found it makes the conversation smoother and easier to digest.\n\nAnyways, enough rambling!! If you've gotten this far, then surely you and I are fit. PM me!

            "selftext": "I came up with a RP idea for my friends but essentially they\u2019re busy with actual work and school. (I\u2019m jobless atm)\n\nThe idea is using a scenario from WEBTOON; Room of Swords. I\u2019ve loved the comical scenery and the story but they\u2019ve come to an end. (End of Season 1)\nI\u2019m still aching for a new chapter and so I thought I take the benefit of similar style except my format is using in a post apocalyptic world. Futuristic zone that is covered piles of metal rubbish that is literally bodies of robots. Instead the narrative start, you\u2019d appear in a world from another universe(s). Being the only lively being among the rubble, you notice you have a game tag and inventory with slotted stats. \nThe question bar is included with quests. \n1. Find the swords\n2. Defeat the Boss King \n\nAnd there\u2019s minimalistic tasks to engage your knowledge of your survival.\nSomething of making your own weapons out of metal. Craft master\nSurvival master\nKill master\n\nZomBots (zombie robots) \nAI robots were left alone on the planet (plausibility that it\u2019s earth or another version of it)\nThey awaken alone by the sun yet they become sluggish due to no intelligence to have them maintained. The only thing they have is the mind of kill. They see living beings a threat to them, would rather to tear limb by limb or as many types of bots would do anything to gather your desires and such. \n\nThere\u2019s seven varies types of bots. \n\nPersona. \nThese robots possess disorderly personalities related to humans. Agitated, weeping and often perfection which they tear limbs from you for themselves to be perfect. Since before they were left behind, they\u2019d help people as part of a nurse to maintain their personalities or diseases of the mind. There\u2019s often a baited bot, in form of a boy in which speaks out something \u201cI don\u2019t remember where I am anymore\u201d or along the lines of \u201ccan you help me find my momma?\u201d. In the dark, it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s a bot till it\u2019s too late to turn back as the cold steel hands grab you and be pulled under a pile of rubble where many hands stretch out to tear your flesh apart. \n\nStranglers. \nRobots covered in coils of wires. Mainly to lasso victims then hang them up. They used to be part a VR contribution, your own gaming model however long after the humans fled the planet on their spaceships. These were kept in walls, engulfed by circuit cords and many other things to keep them detailed but then they awaken alone with collective files of previous game system skills. There\u2019s a variety versions of Stranglers, from competitive fighters to Wild West modules. If approaching to them, surely they will Quote their previous gamers. These are located near the Boss King. \n\nMind Hive. \nA single bot with extraordinary large head has dozen eyes and control over several lowly zombots that has no attributes to varies of seven. The previous use was a security viewing, showing off numerous screening of ads and keeping up the thieving. The Mind Hive will react with bright blue eyes when it\u2019s mob suddenly took a notice of you, if red eyes. You\u2019d run from it, the Mind Hive alerts all the zombots to chase after you. These are often located in malls, or other secluded places like banks, entertainment parks. \n\nTitans.\nTwo versions of them. \nOne is bulky while other is lean. The bulk ones can charge at you at full speed, ignoring where they\u2019d smash to. The lean ones are tall and strong, stretching out to snatch victims before swinging them up in the air like a foxtail. The bulk were mainly used as a security wall guard, to keep evasive shooters from penetrating onto the big shot business icons or celebrities. The tall lean were kept as constructive uses, carrying up heavy materials. They\u2019re absently located out on the streets, among the deserted broken buildings. \n\nStreakers. \nFast runners with horrific head face matches with a xenomorph. They\u2019ve topped off the speed matching as a jet plane. They can be slow only to start that way before you take off running, toying with you however they cannot run through piles of rubble since their speed kinetically magnetize directly upon them. They love the open plains. Their previous times is that they\u2019re used as high speed chasers, manipulate the engines of the vehicle. Their faces would spruce out tongues of tasers. Knocking the criminal drivers to a stop or crash. \n\nLimbo. \nRobots with insane postures, they crawl intensely fast like streakers but they manipulate victims to twist around in pose as them. Previous lives was prestigious gymnastics, they are supposedly to train young humans with flexibility. \n\nDESPITE this.. I forgot to mention this\nwhich makes this tedious.. \nThe Zombots or zombie robots. They come back to life on the second time after the first kill (to kill them is grenade attack or throwing a rock directly at the body). It dismantles at first, scattering for about a minute before it magnetizes it\u2019s body back together to attack again with aggravation \n~\u2022~\nSo killing them might be hard start, so start killing off the regular zombots, collect little rewards which are metal scrapes, coils, limbs or even magnets. \n\nThe stats will be leveled each time you\u2019ve killed 15 or more zombots. Which often gradually become more harder to level up. \n\nFinding cloth material is literally more harder than just getting the type of metal you needed to make a weapon.\n\nAnywho I was told that this idea would have been made into game. TT_TT Sadly I don\u2019t have the qualified skill or money to gain that momentum. \n\nIf you have any questions, please ask away. I\u2019d appreciated if there are more ideas added to this. In helping to configure this better for me in future times. \n\nPM me if you want to join an RP Server (Just started with the server. So don\u2019t complain of how little is made on Discord) \n\n\n",

It can be a fantasy themed role play since it has nobles and princes and princesses and such. I don't have any ideas now but we can brainstorm together to get a plot out. \n\nDidn't want to make it too tall on you, so yeah that's it! Pm me if you are interested.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! For roughly a year myself and a handful of friends have been developing an original roleplay setting within the Fallout universe. Set in - you guessed it - Manhattan, New York in the year 2290, players will create characters from any and all walks of life willing to settle in Manhattan Falls and take on contracts from one of the three major caravan companies: The Red Cap Caravan, Vault 70 Arms and Armor!, or The Pioneers Trading Co. From there, your character's story is yours! You can opt to participate in Game Master events, which have a large impact on the world as a whole and potentially your specific character, or you can choose to create your own stories in Free RP. The world of Manhattan is constantly changing and evolving, and every character has an influence in that shifting environment.\n\nThis is a literate roleplay, though if English isn't your first language or if you're simply new to writing and grammatical structure, we're more than happy to help anyone who wants to improve. Many of our GMs have been roleplaying or trying their hand at creative writing for quite some time, and they are truly some of the nicest and most helpful people I've met. \n\nSo if Fallout 76 didn't satisfy your craving for adventuring through the post-apocalypse, click the link and give Manhattan Project a look! We'll be looking forward to seeing you!\n\nWelcome to Manhattan.\n\n[https://discord.gg/Ras5H54](https://discord.gg/Ras5H54)",

I can write either gender, or multiples, and I would prefer if you can do the same.\n\nI have an idea that's set in the late 1800s, very supernatural/fantasy but also superbly dark and romantic. There's a lot that goes on, and can be overwhelming so it's one I understand if it isn't your cup of tea in the end.\n\nI'm also down for a few fandoms: namely Bioshock and Fallout, but I'm sure I can be convinced for a few others (ie World of Warcraft, a few animes, Resident Evil).\n\nThere's also a book series I'm super into as of recently (The Vampire Knitting Club) that's been a fantastic mix of grit, humor, and romance. If it intrigues you I'm down to explain, certainly!\n\nYou can message me for more info, and I am DISCORD ONLY.

With a thriving populous, a economy, active trade with nations, and expanding all around their borders, it seems like nothing could go wrong. For all of it's good qualities however, there is unrest, with many evil groups in play in order to break apart and take control of this great nation...\n\nSplits in the senate cause tension and unrest between those with traditionalist values and reformists who strive to remake Daxusia in their vision.Conflicts between noble houses increases unrest tenfold, as many come from roots of the common man, while other wish to keep a hierarchy and retain a pure nobility.A sudden marriage followed by a illegitimate child causes many to be worried, with fears of outsiders taking over.Divisions in class causes anger and fear between those from no noble standing, and from those that came from the highest..May the gods save Daxusia.\n\nFeaturing:\n\n\\- Documents and information for different things.In the server, there are many different channels that describe how Daxusia works. One channel describes culture, and the different gods that a person could worship. Another channel contains a document that explains the military in detail, including structure, weaponry, and formation.\n\n\\- A variety of roles to choose from.In the server, a variety of different jobs are available for someone to pick! Whether it could be a senator, making their mark within the Daxusian Senate. The option to play a person of nobility is also presented, where you can start off gradually unnoticed by many, until before long you become a great influence in the nation than you were before. Alternatively, the militaristic option is available as well, with soldiers and officers dealing with expanding and defending the great empire.\n\n\\- A Changing World.Every so often, the storyline of the server is expanded upon, with events being set up in order to add more flavor to the world around us, and to allow character development, set up for future scenarios, or even completely change the server!\n",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Superheroes, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind, admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am primarily looking for as a partner (BUT not required!). And hopefully one who has no limits, like me. And yes, I'm fine with playing female characters too.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me or ask me with the Reddit chat system, though I do prefer the PM option more.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have the urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": " *It happened again. Walking down the street until you feel it. That uneasy sensation. The feeling that all eyes are on you. Your world spins, time stops, the sky turns grey, and the once bustling street is empty. It's quiet...cold. With a tremble, you raise your hand to find the skin peeling and bones revealing. You try to scream but nothing comes out. You shut your eyes and tell yourself it will pass. Then you open your eyes and things are back to normal. This has happened your whole life. Ever since you were little, you saw the world differently...saw shadows dance in the corners, heard voices whisper in your ear. Reality would change and you would find yourself somewhere else...another dimension. At first it was only a couple of seconds...then it became minutes...then hours. You wonder if you are losing your mind...if this is real...if you will eventually become trapped in a nightmare forever.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*It\u2019s well into the future. You\u2019re a human, born and raised on the streets of a bustling urban metropolis...that\u2019s all that earth is now, a sprawling network of buildings and lights. Life never has been fair to you. Always a struggle to get by. In this world, the \u201cAugmented\u201d control the government. They are augmented (robotic) beings that have colonized earth centuries ago. They are essentially humans that have \u201caugmented\u201d their body to the point that they are more robotic than human. The more augmented you are, they higher your social class. While the augmented live their luxurious lives, the lower class humans live in shacks and often poverty. Being ruled by a tyrannical government known for its brutality and hostility to humans isn\u2019t easy...you never knew your father but your mother was close to you. She was only one that believed your stories of seeing other realities. After your mother\u2019s tragic death, she leaves behind only one thing, a silver necklace. After wearing that necklace...things begin to happen...A mysterious boy starts showing up. He\u2019s friendly, but odd and...different. It\u2019s not long before his true identity is revealed. He\u2019s far from human. He\u2019s a creature from a dark but beautiful world that your mother played a key role in. Together, you and this boy will hop between worlds, undergo perilous adventures and forge a bond unlike any other. Little by little, you\u2019ll piece together the mysteries of your family, this sinister fantasy world, and undergo a dark journey through the dystopian Earth and the beautiful nightmare that is his world.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Hi! I\u2019m looking for a dedicated roleplay partner that likes cyberpunk and dark fantasy genres. This is a rp that takes place in TWO worlds, the futuristic dystopian Earth and a more fantasy style world.\n* Looking for a long-term, detailed rp that\u2019s rich in details, emotion, and story but still has PLENTY of room for new ideas, characters and world building? You found it!\n* I\u2019m looking for a dedicated roleplayer that is passionate about building a world and powerful story with me. WARNING: Although there will be happy/cheerful moments, this is a very dark and emotional rp.\n* Please be 18+! If you\u2019d like romance, we could do that, so long as it fits with the story and isn\u2019t rushed. I\u2019m bisexual and I\u2019m comfortable role playing with and as any gender.\n* I only want a dedicated partner that is comfortable and enthusiastic about building a rp with me. I\u2019m tired of being ghosted. Please be prepared to type detailed responses and rp about everyday. I prefer discord or as a medium. I have a discord server for the two of us to use and help us world build.\n* That being said, let\u2019s be friends! :) If we\u2019re going to be rp partners, let\u2019s get to know one another and have some fun!",

            "selftext": "Partner searching, duh! (Or... not).\n\nHi all, thanks for looking at my ad!\n\nI\u2019m looking for a few partners as we head into spring, so to find the best fit I\u2019ll introduce myself a bit. I\u2019m 24 years old, and I\u2019m looking for another 18+ partner as I do sometimes enjoy delving into NSFW elements. I\u2019m much, much more comfortable doing that with someone who is around my own age, or at the very least an adult. That\u2019s definitely a hard rule for me, sorry!\n\nI\u2019m currently in EST, work a 9-5 (so I actually tend to be more free in those hours for rp!), and am unfortunately rarely available for rapid-fire back and forth rping. I\u2019m more than capable of chatting quickly back and forth, but I tend towards longer posts in my rp which means I can get around 1-3 out a day. Some days work will demand that I get maybe 1 out, sometimes work will demand that none will get out. I will 100% try to get at least one response out a day, though, so please be flexible with me. In the evenings I am usually not very available, but I can respond to messages here or there as I have the opportunity.\n\nI write in 3rd person past tense and really prefer if my partner does, too.\n\nI will almost always have at least 3 paragraphs in my posts, so if you\u2019re wanting less than that then we\u2019re probably not compatible. Description and detail is big for me, as well as emotion and thoughts of a character. When you add it all together, the post ends up being 3-5 paragraphs usually minimum. I mirror my partner a bit, so if you give me less detail then I\u2019ll give back less in kind, and if you\u2019re giving me 10 paragraphs per post then mine will resemble that.\n\nI write through discord and reddit exclusively, no email or kik (I just always forget to respond to those). I\u2019m a fantasy fan, though I\u2019ve dabbled in Sci-Fi and Dystopia. If these are your interests, you\u2019ll have to guide me a bit, as fantasy is really my strong point.\n\nI like a few fandoms, but I also enjoy original stories. Fandoms are easy to dive into, but originals have our touch.\n\nSome fandoms I\u2019m interested in:\n\nGoT/ASOIAF; Wheel of Time; Stormlight Archive; Siren (hulu); Warriors (yes, the cats); RDR2; Assassin\u2019s Creed; ARK: Survival Evolved (never tried an rp, might be interesting); Mass Effect; One Piece; Naruto\n\nIf any of these seem interesting to you or you have an idea you\u2019d like to try out, please feel free to message me! I would love to hear from you!\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "This is a copy-paste from a forum site I frequent called Roleplayer Guild. You can find the original [here](https://www.roleplayerguild.com/topics/176601-there-will-be-blood/ooc) if you're interested. I intend to play this through PMs here on reddit, or (if you're a fan of the forum writing environment such as I and up for exploring something new) over on RPG in PMs where the formatting is far more versatile. Both options are fine. I'm posting this from mobile (a first for me) so the formatting conversion may not be perfect and I haven't made hardly any revisions to the advert itself. Please bear with me. I'll likely post an updated and improved version of this over the weekend. Enjoy ...\n\n___\n\n#*I want something dark ...*\n\nNot something serious or depressing. No slice of life abuse/addiction plots here. No.\nNot something angsty, somber, melancholy, edgy even. I've grown out of pain for the sake of pain.\nThere is a time and a place for all of those descriptors. But at the core of it all, I want blood.\n\nI want something that's twisted, violent, sadistic even. Somber tones and depressing histories have their place as second fiddle to stories of unbridled vengeance. I want to tell the stories of what the cliche tragic history brings about: the stories where the wronged carve a bloody swath through everyone responsible; where corrupting power is wielded with efficient brutality, where whole nations tremble before the unhinged wrath of one person. Below are my relevant premises, ordered by preference. Also included are interesting roles I've thought about playing opposite to, also ordered by preference.\n\n___\n\n*They said she didn't have the self-control, that she would never be a mage with her impulsiveness. The Malistare name had not seen a mage in the family for near a century before now, and would not again for a century to come. Whether it was a desire to please, a stubborn insistence to prove her professors wrong, or something more sinister, Kassandra found power on her own. Or more accurately, power found her. The dark forces were well known to corrupt absolutely anyone who dared to tap its power. A young and naive failed mage reached forth into that hellish abyss, and the abyss reached back. Little did she know how quickly her sanity would fail when she tasted the boundless strength of malevolent magics. Little did the world know what it would take to save itself from her.*\n\n(A descent into madness tale spanning from a poor soul desperate to please to near annihilation as control slips through her fingers.)\n\nInteresting roles: fellow mage-in-training, childhood friend\n\n___\n\n*There are witches and there are hunters. Witches killed people. Hunters killed witches ... and whatever other eldritch horrors needed slaying. That's just the way the world worked. Everyone knew that. The lines were clearcut and life was simple. No one wanted to see that change, but change is an inevitable part of life and people have to adapt or die.\nThe hunter's essential gear - steel, silver, crossbow bolts, holy oil, lavender, etc. - was well documented. So how did a hunter called Ying, who somehow acquired a record of nine dead witches in her wake, do so with only a single steel blade? Why does she always work alone? Any hunter worth their salt would surely see something was amiss, but her track record spoke for itself. What nobody knew, the secret Ying protected with her life, is that she shattered what was normal: a hunter born and raised by witches, who then wields their own power against them. Ying would take her secret to the grave if she had her way, but hunters are suspicious folk. The odds of that are quite low indeed, and people are not ready to have their narrow worldview shattered so completely.*\n\n(A story of trying to run from the truth, yet trying to have it both ways in a world that's fearful and intolerant.)\n\nInteresting roles: fellow hunter, opposing witch\n\n___\n\n*The Queen's claim was illegitimate. Everyone knew it. The whole trial of the young princess reeked of corruption. But an iron fist was an iron first and the nail that sticks out gets hammered. Legitimacy meant exactly zero when you had an army to force your will. Yet the people of the land still held out hope that the young princess was still alive. It had been years since she was supposedly killed Everyone knew that rebels had tried to rescue her from the axe. What no one knew was whether or not they succeeded. That hope was enough to inspire a few to stand and continue to fight the Queen's tyranny. Among them stood a proud and ruthless fighter, Sylvia Blackheart. Fake names seldom got more obvious, but she was not someone you tried to pry for answers. Her skill with a blade spoke for itself. Yet she was surely hiding something. No one knows what, and everyone valued their lives more than to badger her about it. The only thing known for sure is that she hates the Queen more than anyone, and will fight against her so long as she breathes.*\n\n(A story of righteous revenge twisted by unbridled hatred where the means become unjustifiable by the ends and heroes become the very villains they sought to destroy.)\n\nInteresting roles: fellow rebel fighter, royal court servant, military defector\n\n___\n\n*All her life, all nineteen years of it, Adrianna has worked for one thing: lordship. It had been promised to her since she could talk. It was promised to her before her first brother was even born. She trained as a soldier and as a commander. She studied as a leader and as a diplomat. She was groomed to succeed her father, rule the Corvello family lordship, and command their garrison regiment. So when her father saw fit to anoint her younger punk brother as his rightful heir on his deathbed and leave her none of what she was promised, the absence of a weeklong rage fit was nothing short of shocking.\nThe lack of public display of fury does not equal its absence, however. The commandant of First Company, her top officer, longtime mentor, and personal friend got the misfortune of being the ear that was subjected to her unrestrained thoughts. The motivation and the skill to take the throne by force was there, without question. But the soon-to-be Lord was her brother, who would never relinquish his newfound crown willingly. As much as she hates him for the golden spoon he received, the question remains open whether or not she has it in her to do what must be done: to strike without hesitation and spill the blood of a sibling.*\n\n(A more psychological story between Adrianna and her confidant along the downward spiral towards an attempted coup.)\n\nInteresting roles: 1st Company CO, handmaiden, old friend outside the estate\n\n___\n\nThere's more I'll add in time. I have no shortage. You are not limited to the stated interesting roles, though following their guidance is a good way to keep my interest in what you're selling. If you like what you've read and want to pitch something to me, send me a short blurb in the same general style introducing your character concept and how it relates to the premise. And please title your PMs something inventive. \"Want to RP?\" will be immediately disqualified for lack of imagination.\nI will not actually write sex scenes but I'm not hesitant to involve characters romantically. And it should be obvious by now that I'm not shy around violence, blood, language, you name it. That's the entire point here. I will not be pulling any punches, and I expect nothing less from anyone brave enough to message me.\n\n*For your consideration,*",

            "selftext": " \n\n**Rookshaven** is one of the longest running, lore-intensive group role playing storylines on Discord right now.\n\nBased in present-day northern Scotland, Rookshaven Academy and University is a school for mages, though the storyline only allows for university students and professors to be applied.\n\n**A bit about our lore:**\n\nThe mage community has always held their royal families above the rest. Though they aren't considered kings or queens of their mage classes anymore, the royal families are believed to be the first blood lines to develop their particular kind of magics. As such, royalty have always been the law-makers for mages worldwide. In the late 1800s, a rebel sect of mages rose up to attack the royals and all of their complicit, loyal subjects - resulting in a Mage Civil War.\n\nMany mages and their royal families were killed off, while the beast mage class disappeared entirely. From that war, the High Council was formed. A collection of the remaining royal houses, electing one member of their family to represent them in the governing of the mage community.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the original eight royal families, only five are alive in present day. Additionally, two new mage classes have been discovered. Without a way to track the new class's lineage, Mythics and Necromancers have been left without a representative in the Council. As a result, many laws passed since their discovery have been created seemingly for the purpose of keeping Necromancers and Mythics at a disadvantage. While the newest class, Mythics, are sigil-bound at a young age to feel an automatic pull toward royal families, they often grow up to be employed as maids or servants for the royals.\n\nSince 2016, another uprising of rebels has been seen. Between then and 2019 (present day), many royals and loyalists alike have lost their lives in terrorist attacks by these Rebels. In the last year of the group story on Discord, students have been attacked both on and off campus, leading many to believe there are Rebels among the ranks of Rookshaven, despite the school being run by the Council.\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n\\- Monthly events in which your character can earn points to put into their dice, making them stronger.\n\n\\- Lots of lore.\n\n\\- Outlined mage classes, as well as factions to push their own agendas (Royals, Loyalists, Rebels, Sympathizers).\n\n\\- Friendly players willing to work with new players to create backstories and social networks.\n\n\\- A secondary server only viewable to applied and approved players where you can post playlists, aesthetic images, social media posts, journal entries, as well as having 1-2 private channels specific to your character for housing and training.\n\n\\- Active Admins willing to help new players any way we can.\n\n\\- Sect-Specific Moderators to help players get immersed in the story faster.\n\n\\- An NPC Library to check out characters for scenes when your own characters are locked down.\n\n**What we expect:**\n\n\\- literacy\n\n\\- a 3 paragraph minimum per post (there are exceptions to this, but the majority of players should strive for this)\n\n\\- realistic characters that fit the server lore\n\n\\- activity every 2 weeks, or communication with the Admins if you need to take time away\n\n\\- read the FAQ\n\n**Classes Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Water\n\n\\- Darkness\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n\\- Earth\n\n\\- Necromancy\n\n**Locked Classes:**\n\n\\- Beast (planned to be unlocked in Spring 2019, only available as secondary characters)  \n\\- Mythics (available as secondary characters, due to them being difficult to play)\n\n**Royal Families Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Dark\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n**Upcoming/Ongoing Events:**  \n\\- Equinox Spell  \n\\- Beast Unlock  \n\\- Anniversary Event (charms, dice, arcs awarded at random for activity)  \n\\- Hybrid Relations Act Event (abduction &amp; experimentation on hybrid mages)  \n**Actively Seeking:**  \n \\- Royals  \n \\- Rebels  \n \\- Professors  \n[Link to Discord Server](https://discord.gg/V6SUcaz)",

            "selftext": "The snowfall was a flurry of dove feathers.\n\nIt fell thick; try as it might, the blood and steam of the battlefield could only swallow so much before it choked. Even the bloodiest scenes were coated in white, the foulest corpses frozen lumps beneath a pristine blanket.\n\nGwen looked over it from the treeline. The pine cloaked hands of the evergreen forest seemed different to her now, the closer she crept to the clearing. No longer did they hold the glittering eyes of blackbirds and squirrel. They watched her with their own. The surviving sentinels burned with icy condemnation at her impending desecration.\n\nShe watched a moment longer, her breaths puffs of silver mist, before she grew too cold to stay still. Her macabre work began.\n\nScavengers weren't well loved and the girl knew it from the way she glanced, wary. She was a wild dog ripping gristle from a lion's catch. It hadn't been a grand affair, this scuffle in the woods, and she had watched the survivors slink in their bands to flee and lick their wounds. They would not be back, not for a while yet; but other corpse pickers? \n\nIt wasn't uncommon for wild dogs to rip out another's throat over bones.\n\nHer fingers grew numb as she scraped snow and clumps of ice from armour. The pickings were slim. The armour was stamped with sigils too recognisable to sell on or was ragged and too worn to be worth stripping. She pulled a small hafted axe from a dead soldier's chest that looked worth something, carved pretty and new enough. \n\nA purse of coppers here; a silver locket with a tuft of chestnut hair there. She let the hair drift onto the snowy grave but tucked the necklace in her pocket. A golden ring laid with a single tiny ruby. A pair of decent leather boots. A bow with a broken string but strong limbs. And more, all small treasures but treasures with buyers. There was even a priest amongst the dead, who's belt was lined with tiny jars of clever herbs and poultices. Those she might keep.\n\nHer destruction of the snow had given permission to the other scavengers of the forest. No people, but crows. They cawed and pulled at the frigid flesh of the corpses she uncovered, wrenched open frozen eyelids. She tried not to look behind her too often.\n\nGwen's path of defilement was carved halfway through the clearing before she found anything that gave her pause. She came to a clump of bodies that was larger than the rest, the snow stained potent crimson. Her mind was anxious from the vulnerability of being out in the open, but the cold had slowed it. It took her longer to realise than she would ever be willing to admit.\n\nSomething in that snow was alive enough to bleed.\n\n**end**\n\nHi! If you like my writing, are literate and okay with role-playing with someone who's 17 &amp; new to roleplay, please send me a message. I'm happy to hear out other prompts/ideas, so feel free to consider this a writing sample. \n\nIf you are interested in this prompt, I don't have a world to base it in but I'm picturing something Game of Thrones-esque. Gritty fantasy, but I still enjoy times where things feel light and hopeful. \n\nI'm happy to just immediately start writing, so if that's what you'd prefer please send me a description of your character and I'll make us a starter.\n\nAnyway, hope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! Thanks for reading! I am an adult male in my 20s who has been roleplaying for about a decade now, and I'm looking for a literate, adult partner who wants to do a long-term, GMed roleplay in an original superhero world! My ideal roleplays are long-term, complex, with a cast of characters. I like stories that contain a little bit of everything. Action, drama, suspense, mystery, romance, comedy, whatever!\n\nI've done a little world building in my head for a superhero world that I've been dying to play in. With me as the GM, I would guide you through this world full of superheroes, supervillains, and all sorts of fun stuff. You would play as a new entrant into the super scene. Someone who develops powers just as the story begins. Right now, I'd prefer someone who is interested in playing as a new hero, but if you're really convincing, maybe a story from a villain's perspective could be in the cards. I will play the roles of all the villains and heroes and civilians and whoever-elses that you encounter.\n\nMy preferred platform for roleplaying is Discord. I anticipate this roleplay being long-term, with a large cast, and I find that Discord is the best for keeping track of those sorts of things. I would also prefer any partners to be over 18, just so we're covered in case adult content appears in the story. It's something I'm certainly open to and enjoy, and although it's not my major focus for this roleplay, I do expect plenty of R-rated content to appear. Given that there is a large cast, if romance does happen, I'm open to pairings of any kind or gender. I also enjoy OOC chat, both talking about the roleplay and world building together, and just talking about life. None of that's necessary, of course, if you're strictly business, but I'm open to it.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd love to hear from you! Being that GMing is a lot of work, I may not be able to roleplay with all of you, but I'll do my best to delete this or otherwise indicate when I'm not looking for partners. So if you see this and it says \"Still-looking\", then shoot me a message and we'll talk about getting something set up! If you've written to me before, feel free to write again! I've gotten a fair amount of responses from the times I've posted here, so I may not be able to roleplay with 100% of you, but I hope you understand it's nothing personal, and I'm definitely open to trying again! Hope to hear from you!",

My timezone is GMT/UTC-0 However as I am in college full time I can reply a good few times per day, usually much more if I don't have too much work to do. I have roleplayed with people in EST etc before and have no problem doing this again! I prefer Discord but I can roleplay on other platforms if requested.\n\nI have a few general settings that I would like to roleplay with, however nothing concrete or extensive. I enjoy crafting a story that we can both enjoy so all of my ideas are fully open to criticism and changes of course.\n\nSome of the settings that I have had a craving for recently are as follows.\n\n\u2022 SciFi - Anything futuristic, whether that be more realistic Dystopian futures or adventurous interplanetary traveling and adventuring.\n\n\u2022 Fantasy Medieval - Anything from low fantasy to high fantasy. I especially enjoy anything that uses races from WoW or any RPG settings such as DnD or Pathfinder. I also enjoy Game of Thrones way too much and would love to do something in the same universe or similar.\n\n\u2022 Westworld - I am currently watching Westworld and would be interested in roleplaying a setting which is similar. I enjoy how the show handles advanced AI and emotions, but I won't say too much in case I spoil anything.\n\nWarcraft - Anything around Wow or Warcraft I have been dying to play.\nPlease feel free to message me if anything here interests you or you have an idea you would like to share with me, even if it's not on the list above. I will try to get back to you as fast as I can.",

As the title of this thread suggests, I am looking for Roleplay partners who are interested in the fandom of The Orville!\n\nThis is the first sci-fi show that I\u2019ve really gotten into, with the exception of later seasons of Agents of SHIELD, and I really really love it. The characters are great, and the humor isn\u2019t forced or too shticky.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get on to the main part...the characters! I\u2019m looking to play as Commander Kelly Grayson, and I\u2019m looking for someone to play as her sarcastic ex-husband Captain Ed Mercer. I love this pairing because they\u2019re both so snarky and kind of ridiculous human beings, especially when they\u2019re together.\n\nI don\u2019t have any plots figured out just yet, but that\u2019s something we can talk about. Since it is set in the future and in space, there\u2019s plenty we can work with.\n\nSome info about me:\n* I am 22 years old and would prefer to have partners who are 18+.\n* I am very active, but I don\u2019t expect you to be. However, if you\u2019re going to ditch, just tell me so I\u2019m not waiting around for a reply.\n* I definitely prefer OOC chatting so we can plan things out.\n* I stick to third person past tense and usually write 1-3 paragraphs or whatever my partner does.\n* I would prefer literate partners.\n\nInterested? Excellent! Feel free to comment here or shoot me a message! I look forward to plotting with you! ",

            "selftext": "Hey there! I'm a nineteen year old guy from Scotland and recently I've been pretty intrigued by the idea of a Star Wars themed roleplay. I'd love to find a partner who is over the age of eighteen and shares a similar level of interest and enthusiasm for Star Wars as I do!  \n\n\nThe roleplay would revolve around two Jedi during the last few months of the Clone Wars and hopefully moving into the birth of the Empire. It would be centered around their relationship and the trials they need to overcome together. I would want them to be real characters with real strengths and weaknesses. I have a rough idea for the general story line but I wanted to leave things rather open so it could change dynamically over the course of the roleplay. I planned to include some romantic elements as well although that isn't something that needs to be a part of it. Although, the idea of two Jedi forming a relationship with each other despite the Jedi code is an idea that's always intrigued me.  I also wanted there to be a decent amount of action and adventure in the roleplay, as you can't have a Star Wars story without those two things! There will most definitely be mature themes as I'd like to delve into some of the grittier side of the Star Wars universe. The things the kid-friendly movies and shows can't delve too far into.  \n\n\nAs far as a partner goes, I'm quite open! I'd expect at least a basic understanding of the Star Wars universe and how the Jedi Order functions within said universe. I don't need you to have an expansive understanding of the Star Wars lore, having seen episodes 1 to 6 and perhaps some of the Clone Wars show would be enough. I'm happy to explain things if need be as I'm really eager to find a partner for this. I'd also prefer for this to be written in third person but I can write in first if that's a major preference. Like most people here, I want someone who is detailed and is eager to flesh out characters and their relationships. Discussing our characters and the roleplay in general beforehand is greatly encouraged so we can both get a better understanding of what direction we'd like things to go in!  \n\n\nIf you're interested then I'd love to move over to Discord to discuss things further! Send me your username or ask for me to give you yours in a PM!",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Ironheart, though if you are reading this you may soon know me simply as the Game Master. For the last 2 or so years I have been contructing in detail a fantasy world for both role play and story telling purposes, and,after finally writing a description of this world that I feel does it some justice, I have decided to launch a discord server in which anyone who finds my work interesting can forge their on long term story with their own character and other rpers, as well as make friends and just have an intresting time all together. The world description is below:\n\nMora| How we came to be.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mora was once a dark and desolate place completely void of life. Then one day from the darkness of space fell a blue star. This star impacted with our world and the energy that gave it its blue hue fused with Mora's surface and all the elements within it. The living energy then assumed a physical form, using its power over the elements to meticulously create itself a body. It then became her, the crafter, and as the crafter with her powers would bring our world life and beauty. She would create plants, then creatures and finally she would create us, the dolls. The first four of our kind were born from her physical body and called the Guardians: Phyra, Isma, Proten, and Ignitis. Each represented an aspect of the Crafters personality and possessed a portion of her power,each controlling one of the elements she had fused with, the crafter herself remaining the sole holder of energy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the Elementals came the more common dolls, born of pod and seed rather then from the crafter herself. At first they remained near the place of their creation, building up a grand city, called the Origin, which still stands today as the capital of our civilization . After a while however, as their numbers grew they began to move out farther into the world, were they used their own powers to build new settlements in all directions outward of the Origin but not leaving the island it was built upon for thousands of years. They lived in such peace and prosperity that the island became known as the Oasis and here each doll lived eternally. The peace was not to last however. Unknown to the crafter and her creations, down just below Mora's surface, in the hollows of the world's crust, a being had been slowly coming awake since the crafter's descendants and now it made itself known. Enraged by the presence of unwanted guest, the being who we'd name Notin, breached the surface and sent up his dark minions who possessed the bodies of living things and used them against us. Valiantly those early dolls took up arms and alongside the Guardians and the crafter held against the threat from the shadows, but Notin\u2019s power was overwhelming and settlement after settlement fell. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thousands of our precursors were lost. In the end the Crafter, with all her compassion and love for her creations, chose to sacrifice her physical form to save all life on Mora. Once again pure energy and one with the world she closed the breeches and trapped Notin and his minions below, preventing them from reinforcing their topside comrades and giving us the reprieve we needed to beat the shadows of destruction back and retake our island.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that first big victory, under the guidance of the Guardians, now the wisest and oldest amongst us, we began to expand rapidly so that we could not be so easily overwhelmed again. For the first time we sailed from the Oasis and settled in unfamiliar foreign lands. We established new settlements and restructured our society to be more efficient, assuring our continued existence. The Authority and its caste system was put in place by the Guardians, and the 1st Arbiter, a doll of pure heart and mind, was created to head it and govern us. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under her, and with the guidance of the Guardian Phyra, who understood the process of creating life better than anyone else, we began making new dolls and using the process of strand weaving to manipulate their traits, allowing them to better fit into their caste and better fulfill their intended societal roles. Once again Doll kind began to thrive, though our war with the remnants of notins cut off forces, left on the surface when the breeches closed, would continue and still continues thousands of years later. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now a days we have managed to come to a point were most of us no longer have to fear for our lives on a daily basis. That said, today doll kind is divided more than ever before. The cities outside of the Oasis and their appointed rulers, the Dons, have become largely independent. Without the Crafter we have also lost our ability to live eternally, and even the mighty Guardians have passed as a result in the years since. This mortality has caused newer generations to seek out the endless lives our ancestor had and some have gone as far as to let their minds be taken in Notins grasp in exchange for power and eternal life. He continues to manipulate the minds of dolls from his realm and we continue to lose cities and towns to treachery and deceit from within.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Infighting has also become a problem. Some Dons let their egos outgrow their domains and clash with others of their caste, leading to strife and even war between Dolls. \u00a0Their are also those who don't wish to fulfill their duty to their kind and leave the cities were they are born to lead lives of solitude and sometimes crime in the wilds. However the most recent Arbiter, the fifth to rule, has been the most zealous in her efforts to restore unity under the Authority. She has employed symbols like the Eye of the Authority to instil a sense of dread in our enemies and security in our citizens. She has enforced our new and old laws alike with an attitude of ruthlessness and mercilessness. \u00a0She directs and coordinates our armies with precision and she does not tolerate the arrogance that some dons have allowed themselves to develop. Still, in spite of her efforts, cities on the frontier line continue to fall and the umbral forces continue to come up with new beast and weapons they use to crack city walls and massacre innocent dolls or take over their bodies and use them against us. However things are,we will continue to fight and we will continue to protect our home and civilization until the the last doll is broken.\n\nIf you are interested here is our Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/dJAvQgR",

A world where werewolves, vampires, and the rare bit of ritual magic clash with the neon glow and cybernetic upgrades humanity had been expecting.  \n\n\nWe've been around for just over a year now, and are looking for new, interesting characters to join.  \n\n\nPlayers are free to join any of the factions we have. Two major factions, and 3 minor factions:\n\nMajor:\n\n**Division** \\- A government agency responsible for investigating supernatural-based crimes. A supernatural FBI of sorts. They have high jurisdiction, and employ both humans and the supernatural. All agents are highly trained in combat and hostage situations. Their job is to keep the peace, and make both humans and supernaturals feel safe.\n\n**Wu Developing Co.** \\- A large corporation who believes the supernatural are the future and next step in evolution. The supernatural live longer and carry no human diseases, and humans becoming supernatural races will bring the world to a better state.\n\n**The Church of Black Magic** \\- A small group of magic specialists who investigate any events that have to do with magic. They tend to be contracted by other agencies, or even individuals to investigate these things, but often look into things on their own time as well.\n\n**North American Black Flag Movement** \\- Founded in 2065 as an American offshoot of the Spanish European F.A.I., B.F.M. is an Anarcho-Humanist fringe group that came to prominence in response to the Appearance of \"Supers\" in 21st and 22nd Century Society.\n\nOr make your own way as an independent character or in one of Seattle\u2019s many gang factions (several of which are player-created and run!) We encourage the creation and pursuit of a personal narrative for everyone's character, and try to make it easy for them to progress and develop as they see fit, so long as what they have in mind is within the rules and lore, but we do allow some things to bend a little bit as long as it doesn't allow for an OP character.  \n(For full lore info, visit our new website: [https://sites.google.com/view/shadowlinerp/home?authuser=0](https://sites.google.com/view/shadowlinerp/home?authuser=0) )\n\nWhile we encourage freedom of choice with characters. However, this doesn't mean there is freedom of consequence. We like to keep things here somewhat realistic, and there is always a chance for repercussions if you make a criminal type. This universe is heavily monitored and has heavy law enforcement. We recognize the importance of antagonists, but that doesn't mean they can have free reign of the place.\n\nOur server features a detailed catalog of lore for the setting and a work-in-progress timeline from present day to 2175 to help players looking for world details they can employ to fully immerse their character creations into a setting populated by all walks of other players. We even have a map, featuring the general locations of all the places featured in RP channels.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our luck to have a relaxed, friendly community of players who are always more than happy to help a new member or write a new scene (no worries about being out of the loop!) New members are expected to treat others with the same respect, and are encouraged to contact a mod on the side if they have an issue with another player (so far we\u2019ve been very drama-free!)\n\nWhile this server does not have an age limit, we do warn new members that due to the tense nature of many story lines content may be regarded as 18+. NSFW content is to be left to private messages between the players involved, but violence, gore, strong language, and drugs are allowed in general server channels.\n\nJoin us for some roleplay fun, all experience levels are welcome!\n\n[https://discord.gg/BWPUR2G](https://discord.gg/BWPUR2G)",

I won't be listing the exact things I'm looking for here, simply because I know that it might take up a bit too much typing space. I will however, give a brief introduction to myself and what I can offer as a writing partner.   \n\n\nIn terms of writing quality and quantity, I consider myself literate to advanced literate. I like my partners to be in the same general area, but it's alright if not. I'm not picky about post lengths in the long run as long as I have something to work with, even if at times it's a one liner. I write primarily in third person perspective, but am flexible on that front. I'll write as male, female, or any other gender. I will also write as trans, if you're seeking that sort of perspective. I enjoy partners who can do the same, but understand if not. I'll write f/f, f/m, and m/f. I am open to both canon and originals, as my title suggests. In terms of canon roleplays, I'm fine with original characters, canon characters, or configurations including both. I love to double, triple, and so on- therefore, I'm fine with writing as more than one character throughout the story.  \n\n\nFinally, I'd like to leave a little list of general themes I'm looking for right now.  \nWild West (I'm craving this the most right now, as my title suggests), Science Fiction, Modern Fantasy, Slice of Life, Romance, Post-Apocalyptic, High Fantasy.  \n\n\nI do, for your viewing, have a list of original ideas, a wordbank, and a list of fandoms that I'd love to show you. If  I at all seem as if I might be a good fit for writing with you, please feel free to message me here on reddit! We can, from there discuss how we'd like to go about things!  \nThank you for your time in reading all of this!  \n",

            "selftext": "Hello and thank you to anyone who reads this. I should probably be upfront about the 18+ elements in this prompt. I included that because Ideally the two main characters would become close friends, and while that doesn't guarantee romance it does make it possible. And, while Romance doesn't guarantee (Out of fear of getting hit for NSFW stuff I will use the following tearm) \"Conversations on Mattresses\" it does make that possible. \n\nBasically it can end up going into more adult content if that is the direction my partner and I decide on. \n\nRegardless, the main idea behind this RP is that of a male human man boy becoming close friends with a woman and through getting to know her better he discovers that she isn't exactly normal. This could go 1 of 2 ways. 1: Monsters used to exist but only shapeshifters were able to survive due to blending in. 2: ALIENS. \n\nIf the supernatural route is taken it can go a few different ways. An ancient slime/shapeshifter comes out of hibernation and enters the modern world while trying to act human and live \"normally\", a long line of shapeshifters have existed and reproduced over the centuries to survive and the woman was sent out to find a partner, or maybe this shapeshifter is the last of her kind and has existed for centuries by changing her shape to different animals, people, and other living things to stay alive.\n\nThe Sci Fi route could be taken different routes as well. An alien delegation sent to Earth to make peace, a spy sent to check on humanity to see if they are ready to learn the greater truth of space, or an earth where aliens and humans already coexist.\n\n\nI apologize for the vague descriptions of multiple plot lines. I like to collaborate on my RPs instead of invent roles and assign them without any say from the person taking on said role.\n\nMy preferred platform is Discord.",

You could play a canon character or an OC, it's up to you really. I do plan to have mature themes, so please be prepared for them. I would be playing as a woman who once held the title of Mandalore three thousand years before the Clone Wars occured. I had grown powerful, being the one to create and wield the darksaber. However, the people who ruled alongside of me deemed me too powerful, and stabbed me in the back. Knowing I would become a martyr if I were to actually die, they sealed me away in cryogenic freezing, keeping me buried under Mandalore's surface. They scrubbed all records of my existence, but one clan remembers; Clan Wren. Clan Wren was named after me, Emmahe Wren. You would start by stumbling upon the ruins where I am kept, either intentionally or not. I am okay with adult themes, but do not wish them to be the center of it.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, PLEASE PM me so we can work something out! Fine details we can work out in DMs (please)",

            "selftext": "Hello and good \"what ever the time of day it is for you.\" The main idea behind this RP is an Alien coming down to Earth and becoming friends with and then later possibly dating her human friend. \n\nI am aware that is a very common sort of plot but a simple plot idea can act as a seed for a more complex sort of story. \n\nI have three ideas that can act as a starting point.\n\n1) An undercover mission. The female was assigned to examine Earth and it's people to see if they were ready to join an interplanetary union of sorts, and if they weren't then she would do as much research as possible before eventually returning home for further examination of her notes. But, while on her mission she is given permission to share her true shape and the details of her mission to a few trusted humans she meets along the way.\n\n2) An official delegation is sent to Earth and several officers are sent down ro wander the Earth independently to see what it had to offer and learn about it's people. \n\n3) The Earth is already a hub of Alien activity with a large artificial island floating out in the ocean acting as a UN of sorts for several alien species. Earth happened to be in a neutral territory so for letting the Union meet on their planet the people of Earth were offer technologies beyond their current level. A alien woman is moving to said city and a human male is assigned to act as her guide in her first few days on the planet.\n\nI apologize that these aren't the most detailed but I would rather collaborate with my partner on the world building and background details. \n\nI prefer 3rd person Roleplay with detailed responses, and my preferred platform is Discord. As for the 18+ elements that is mainly there in case the relationship between the characters advance into.... a more \"personal\" connection. The inclusion of that element is completely optional though.",

Your world spins, time stops, the sky turns grey, and the once bustling street is empty. It's quiet...cold. With a tremble, you raise your hand to find the skin peeling and bones revealing. You try to scream but nothing comes out. You shut your eyes and tell yourself it will pass. Then you open your eyes and things are back to normal. This has happened your whole life. Ever since you were little, you saw the world differently...saw shadows dance in the corners, heard voices whisper in your ear. Reality would change and you would find yourself somewhere else...another dimension. At first it was only a couple of seconds...then it became minutes...then hours. You wonder if you are losing your mind...if this is real...if you will eventually become trapped in a nightmare forever.*\n\n*It\u2019s well into the future. You\u2019re a human, born and raised on the streets of a bustling urban metropolis...that\u2019s all that earth is now, a sprawling network of buildings and lights. Life never has been fair to you. Always a struggle to get by. In this world, the \u201cAugmented\u201d control the government. They are augmented (robotic) beings that have colonized earth centuries ago. They are essentially humans that have \u201caugmented\u201d their body to the point that they are more robotic than human. The more augmented you are, they higher your social class. While the augmented live their luxurious lives, the lower class humans live in shacks and often poverty. Being ruled by a tyrannical government known for its brutality and hostility to humans isn\u2019t easy...you never knew your father but your mother was close to you. She was only one that believed your stories of seeing other realities. After your mother\u2019s tragic death, she leaves behind only one thing, a silver necklace. After wearing that necklace...things begin to happen...A mysterious boy starts showing up. He\u2019s friendly, but odd and...different. It\u2019s not long before his true identity is revealed. He\u2019s far from human. He\u2019s a creature from a dark but beautiful world that your mother played a key role in. Together, you and this boy will hop between worlds, undergo perilous adventures and forge a bond unlike any other. Little by little, you\u2019ll piece together the mysteries of your family, this sinister fantasy world, and undergo a dark journey through the dystopian Earth and the beautiful nightmare that is his world.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Hi! I\u2019m looking for a dedicated roleplay partner that likes cyberpunk and dark fantasy genres. This is a rp that takes place in TWO worlds, the futuristic dystopian Earth and a more fantasy style world.  \n \n* Looking for a long-term, detailed rp that\u2019s rich in details, emotion, and story but still has PLENTY of room for new ideas, characters and world building? You found it!  \n \n* I\u2019m looking for a dedicated roleplayer that is passionate about building a world and powerful story with me. WARNING: Although there will be happy/cheerful moments, this is a very dark and emotional rp.  \n \n* Please be 18+! If you\u2019d like romance, we could do that, so long as it fits with the story and isn\u2019t rushed. I\u2019m bisexual and I\u2019m comfortable role playing with and as any gender.  \n \n* I only want a dedicated partner that is comfortable and enthusiastic about building a rp with me. I\u2019m tired of being ghosted. Please be prepared to type detailed responses and rp about everyday. I prefer discord or as a medium. I have a discord server for the two of us to use and help us world build.\n* When I rp, I focus on that and only that. So expect to send replies back and forth. I'm always available at night. I'm very much a night owl.  \n \n* That being said, let\u2019s be friends! :) If we\u2019re going to be rp partners, let\u2019s get to know one another and have some fun!",

Personally, I prefer to also be able to talk to my partner and get to know them a bit before we get into the rp. To me, it seems to make writing together easier. \n\nI'm on eastern standard time, usually available early afternoons and late nights. My preference is first person, but I do not mind third. I'm trying to get back into rping since i haven't done it as much in the past year. \n\nOnto the setting, i have a few different stories in mind that I can go over in more detail if you decide to message me, that way if you have any changes you would like we can make them there. The setting I envision is a slightly futuristic setting but not by much, maybe the late 2020s or early 2030s. The fantasy comes in with with the supernatural beasts that plague the world. Few people know about them and the general population is mostly unaware. Werewolfs, ghouls, vampires, gargoyles, and anything else in that vein of monster is on the table. Most of the stories I have are about hunting the beasts that attack people. \n\nIf you are interested please feel free to pm me. If i do not respond tonight i will tomorrow. Thank you for reading. ",

The plan at the end of this first mystery case is that they end up falling in love with each other but not admitting it out loud and my character becomes a resource of your character and to the department figuring out stuff for them and giving them the information kind of like Sherlock Holmes\n\nTags : mystery, suspense, smut, drugs, and romance.\nAnd it\u2019s long term as more cases come in challenging them and their ability to work side by side and be in a relationship. With a few old lovers from the past.",

I love RP when I can get it, and there's been a bit of a dry spell lately. I am seeking to change that.\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you may ask? Look below:\n\n-Modern (this can be fantasy, slice of life, drama)\n\n-Historical (I am getting a kick out of medieval, as well as 1940s/1950s/1960s play)\n\n-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n-Fandoms (I like Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire, Harry Potter, Vikings, The Last Kingdom; others need ask!)\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional animated picture.\n\nI am an adult, and I write like one in terms of the writing. Give me the romantic, passionate, intimate, and everything beyond that we dare not speak of here (those that know what this means will know; feel free to ask otherwise). I seek those in a similar boat too. I also enjoy players who like to socialize outside of RP (OOC), since there'll be times when we may not be able to RP but can talk.\n\nPlease, please, please be someone who can RP and talk on a daily or near-daily basis. This is a big request. I've met plenty of players who are sporadic, ghost, or don't respond to anything for days. I am a patient and lenient person, so I will give someone a few days. If nothing in that time, better for me to move on since leaving too many messages seems stalker-ish. I will understand if you tell me! A hint: Discord or phones/tablets love to mess with notifications sometimes.\n\nOne last thing...feel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours &amp; please be someone who actively uses it. Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!",

            "selftext": "Hey, there!\n\nWith Silksong coming around and having played the first game recently, I've been meaning to hold some roleplay based on the settings and the curious, sentient bugs of Hallownest, be they OCs or cannon! I find the concept of Hollow Knight way too explorable to not get to writing, and drawing, about it. I intend to draw up characters I find interesting through this.\n\nMy name is Ariel, and I tend to the past-tense, third-person writing style. My post lengths vary depending on the circumstances; how climactic the moment being roleplayed is, what the roleplay needs to keep the plot flowing, and the capabilities of my partner are all things I take into account. All sorts of RPers are welcome, too! From one-sentence beginners, to novella-style writers, I'll adjust my writing style to yours.\n\nFeel free to shoot me a PM! We can irom out the details of the plot beforehand, or jump right in and see where it goes. I usually stick to Discord, but I'm not opposed to other forms for us to get in touch.\n\nI hope to be seeing you!",

One state will be more evil in terms of abuse of their power and the other will be the powerless one where no harm is coming from in comparison to the opposing side. Both states will have the same belief that they own the land with its every square inch, therefore there will be strong opposition between one another. Now for the characters, you guessed it; I would like to have one character on the powerful side who could be a soldier with weapons and an army or just another citizen, meanwhile on the other side, a character who fights with rocks, active in protests and vocal on social media about the issues her side of the land face against the more powerful and forceful side. They could possibly meet in a protest where one can get hurt from the other, something of that sort and from there on, we can plan an exciting romance! \n\nI would love for my partner to be able to drive scenes and make things happen, don't be afraid to create conflicts and action; I love a partner who can take equal part in the formation of the plot as there isn't a fixed direction this will go.

Beyond that, I just ask that my partner be able to write at least twenty lines and be willing to explore some darker themes. I'm wanting to dive into the corrupt world of Neo Gotham. \n\nIf you're interested, please send me a message. I'm ready for a schway roleplay.",

            "selftext": "Hi, everyone. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for years now, and since I write stories on my own, I\u2019d say my literacy level is pretty decent. I\u2019m looking for open-minded people who have an interest in my listed fandoms, as well as people who can keep up with Lit - Adv. Lit roleplays. \n\nThe number of partners I\u2019ve had has dwindled over the years and i am currently down to two consistent partners and one or two other inconsistent ones that i rarely see. Everyone else I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting on this subreddit, either becomes a small-time partner, doesn\u2019t work out, or they ghost. If I\u2019m looking for anything in a partner, it\u2019s definitely someone who can be honest about their feelings, thoughts and opinions without just getting up and leaving. \n\nSorry for the lengthy introduction, let me discuss everything I\u2019m interested in doing and what I\u2019m looking for :\n\nPartner: As I said, an open-minded person, preferably someone who plays F characters or both F and M characters. Typically I like doing straight MxF pairings, where I play M. Canon character or OC depends on the plot itself. I have a lot of free time and hope to find someone like that as well, but i don\u2019t mind somebody who is busy, either. Someone who is okay with NSFW themes would be preferred as well, as I don\u2019t shy away from gore/violence and or dirty scenes. \n\nTypes of roleplays: Romance, action, adventure, tragedy, science fiction/fantasy, AU\u2019s, etc.\n\nFandoms: \n\n\u2022 Dragon Maid. \n\n\u2022 Re:Zero.\n\n\u2022 Undertale/Deltarune.\n\n\u2022 Steven Universe. \n\n\u2022 Watamote. \n\n\u2022 League of Legends. (AU.)\n\n\u2022 Kill La Kill.\n\n\u2022 Adventure Time. \n\n\u2022 Overwatch.\n\n\u2022 Edd Ed n Eddie.\n\n\u2022 Invader Zim. \n\n\u2022 Mass Effect.\n\n\u2022 Dark Souls. (AU.)\n\n\u2022 Goblin Slayer.\n\n\u2022 Spider-Verse. \n\n\u2022 Tanya the Evil.\n\n\u2022 Doki Doki. \n\nThese are the fandoms I\u2019m currently interested in roleplaying. I know many games, movies, anime, etc \u2014 So if you don\u2019t see something you typically do, feel free to ask me. I look forward to your messages and hope to find lengthy, worthwhile partners whom I can also be friends with. Thank you for reading. \n",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m looking for a partner to play in a high-fantasy open world sandbox, where the character, a regular person from Earth (or anywhere not \u2018here,\u2019 really), one day wakes up to find themselves in a completely different universe from theirs in a fantasy setting.  \n\n\n  \nTo write a little about me first, I\u2019m a 21-year-old female with about 5 (or 6?...I'm losing track) years of experience in roleplay. I write in both first and third, but heavily prefer third over first, especially when using a multitude of characters like this one. I don\u2019t really have a particular preference on the type of character I play, and I can play accordingly if you have a preference of some sort. Also, I do watch at least some anime, but I don't watch TV to begin with, so if you throw TV show references\u2026chances are, I won\u2019t get it\u2026ahahaha...  \n\n\n  \nAs for this particular RP, while I have been developing the setting for a while myself, I\u2019m open to discussing more with you and sharing ideas! The setting I have does contain a wide variety of themes, with darker themes as well as common ones within it, so please let me know if there\u2019s anything that may make you uncomfortable. I\u2019m fine with playing out NSFW scenes, but forcing one unnaturally is a big no for me, that's not what this post is about.  \n\n\n  \nAlthough everyone knows that we make mistakes and typos then and there, I do ask that you have at least a decent understanding of English and general grammar, write in third person, and\u2026reply once a while? I\u2019ve recently had a lot of free time on my hands, so I\u2019d prefer if my partner could reply frequently, but of course that\u2019s a preference and not a requirement! Once a few days, or once every few hours, anything goes.  \n\n\n  \nI mostly write on discord, and occasionally email. I heavily prefer discord as it provides an easier way of out-of-character communication, and I love talking; I\u2019m the kind of person that\u2019d go on and on about characters and settings and situations and a bunch of other\u2026see how much I typed on in this post alone? I should probably stop\u2026hue.    \n\n\n  \nIf you\u2019re interested, shoot me a PM with your discord tag! I hope to talk to you soon. Have a good day\\~",

No worries if you have a busy schedule, at least one reply a day works for me, and I won't be mad if you miss some days in between. \n\nI do have a scenario in mind, but I'm open to any ideas you might have if you're not feeling it. Basically, I'm wanting to play in a setting similar to  Sons of Anarchy and Mayans MC. If you aren't familiar with those shows, they're just biker clubs in small towns who run some shady business on the side. It's a loose concept that we can develop more to our liking, whether you're wanting to add supernatural themes or not, I'm cool either way. \n\nNow if that's not exactly up your alley, that's fine too! I enjoy anything from a historical pirate adventure with mythical elements, to good old medieval fantasy. The only thing I'm not looking for is realistic slice of life. \n\nMessage me if you're interested! I use both Discord and Kik, but have a slight preference towards Discord when it comes to detailed long-term RPs. ",

However, I would like this to take place somewhere in New Mexico, Arizona or Nevada.. Southern California, even between the 1850\u2019s and 1890\u2019s. More than likely it would be a mining town, lots of deaths and gritty realistic themes. I like my roleplays to have elements of romance.. so bring it on! Also, when I say that I am long term.. I mean months, maybe even years, multi-generational roleplays and characters. \n\nIf you\u2019re not long term, are going to plot with me then ghost, please don\u2019t waste my time. I\u2019ve had issues with people on here (almost every one I\u2019ve come into contact with) ghosting me at some point or another. Only serious role players need apply! \n\nAnyways, if this is something that you\u2019re interested in, please shoot me a PM and we can discuss further. Hope to hear from you soon!",

So I figured I'd make this new account to try and write some stories with the people of reddit!\n\nYou name it, I'm most likely game to try it. Want to build a dystopian space opera, I'm your man! Want to try high fantasy with a much lighter tone, hit me up! Maybe even just want to make a story about people living day to day? Sure, why not!\n\nFor fandoms I'm pretty varied; I love Star Wars, MCU, DC, Warhammer 40K, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, Brooklyn 99, RWBY and a few more I can't think of right now.\n\nIf you want to try a one on one roleplay\nthis way then be sure to message me. I usually use 3rd person but 1st is absolutely fine too. I usually reply with paragraphs unless I'm trying to keep dialogue fast paced, however, I'll always try to reply with more than two sentences.\n\nI have Discord and I'm happy to roleplay there and on Reddit PM.\n\nAnyhow, I look forward to your messages and if you made it this far put the film you hate the most as the subject",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI run a TWD discord roleplay server, but I'm not here to advertise it - because the server itself is OC based. But, there has been a canon roleplay added - and that's our own version of Fear The Walking Dead season 4. [See my Season 4 remake poster here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510592131946119171/554052617131786240/FTWDDISCORD-1.png)\n\nBecause well, Fear The Walking Dead season 4 was - for lack of a better term. *shit.* (***BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER, PLEASE DO NOTE*** That you have to audition for these characters. Because we want to make sure you understand these characters and know how to play them. They're canon characters with an already established history. Meaning they NEED to be treated with respect, care, and love. Hence why you must audition.)\n\nSo, we have decided to remake our own version of season 4, following the path and endgame that Dave Erickson (The showrunner for seasons 1-3) had in mind. \n\nWe will be picking up right where season 3 ended with the dam explosion. It will feature 2 characters FROM Season 4, but they will NOT retain ANY of the memories their TV show counterparts had, ONCE Season 4 began. these 2 characters being John Dorie and Althea. They will still be present. But they won't remember anything from the real season 4, meaning they never met Nick, Alycia, Morgan (*You know what it is.*), or Naomi. (That's another thing. Naomi/Laura/June has been retconned from John Dorie's history.)\n\nThe canon characters available for you to audition for are as follows:\n\n- Madison Clark\n- Alicia Clark\n- Nick Clark\n- Troy Otto\n- Luciana Galvez\n- Proctor John\n- Qaletaqa Walker\n- Crazy Dog\n- John Dorie\n- Althea\n\nThe 3 canon characters available for auditioning from The Walking Dead are as follows:\n\n- Abraham Ford\n- Rosita Espinoza\n- Eugene Porter\n\n(***__NOTE:__*** Abe, Eugene, and Rosita have NOT met Rick yet, meaning these characters will have to go bye-bye at a later date because they have to make it to Georgia for the main TV series to meet Rick and Abe to die at the hands of Lucille.)\n\nIt will be heavily story driven and will be a session based roleplay, meaning RP can only be going on during sessions. But because it is a TWD roleplay server, there are freeform roleplays for you to make an OC (Original Character) a roleplay while you await the next session.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAUDITION REQUIREMENTS:\n\n- 2 paragraph MINIMUM story of the character.\n- A paragraph of where you would like to TAKE this character (Please do note, Eugene, Rosita, and Abe are a bit harder because they have a future.)\n- Why you chose this character.\n\n***__PLEASE DM ME DIRECTLY HERE ON REDDIT WITH YOUR AUDITION! THANKS!__***\n\nP.S. I have already taken Daniel Salazar and Victor Strand. But that's because I have a very specific story in mind for these 2. If you are auditioning for Madison do note I she is SUPPOSED to SLOWlY turn into a villainous role, so I do have some extra criteria for you (If you're auditioning for Madison.) ",

Must be at least 18 due to wanting to utilize heavy adult themes. I\u2019m willing to RP just about anything, but I am looking for someone that can write lengthy and descriptive posts. Sorry, but short posts don\u2019t cut it for me. I have a couple ideas listed down below but if you have any ideas, feel free to run them by me. I\u2019d likely be interested in doing them.\n\nI can RP any gender and you can RP any gender you like. Trans-inclusive. I literally just do not care. For reference, my character will be have the he/him/his pronoun for the description and your's will have she/her/hers but as I said, genders can be swapped around. \n\n\u2022 A Veteran returns home from war, and meets your character, and helps him to lower his guard and open up for the first time in a long time.\n\n\u2022 My character saves your characters life on the job as a doctor/nurse/paramedic and wants to pay him back.\n\n\u2022 Your character is kidnapped but mine is an unwilling participant that helps your character anyway he can, then mine is caught and forced to torture her.\n\nAgain, I can do anything, those three are just a few ideas to get y'all's brains into gear. I do also enjoy other genres besides slice of life, that just happens to be my favorite. DM me and lets build our story together.",

However for cat/bat will be involved with you romantically. As you may know, Batman is surprisingly caring for the people in his life, and only wants what's best for them. \n\nHowever when you're the world's greatest detective, you're bound to get frustrated when two positive lines show up.\n\nI want there to be that gentle love Bruce Wayne has, but I want there to be anger, hatred and fear writhing deep in his soul. I want there to be hatred towards my pregnancy and the after-effects, while love is still shared for me. Abuse my pregnant stomach (I'll give you my kink list), but love me. That's the jist.\n\nWe will start off when we find out I'm pregnant, argue about my character wanting to fight, then quickly timeskip to my character 4 months pregnant squeezing herself in her uniform and going back to fight crime.",

            "selftext": "  Well, for starters, I don't have a penis--sorry to disappoint. Yes, yes, that is absolutely correct; I am a female. I am 24 years of age, though sometimes feel like I am trapped in a timeless void where algebra II actually does me good with my vague knowledge of imaginary numbers.  \n  \n  I wouldn't dare call myself a good writer, but when I write, it has always been as a male character, past tense, third person. That is just my comfort zone, I suppose. I don't consider myself highly literate, or even mildly capable of articulating proper sentences at times, but butter me up enough and I'll attempt to suit your fancy. I go with the flow, and just allow whatever happens to happen. I guess one might consider that \"chill.\" \n\n  If I were to describe my taste for writing, I'd probably gesture more towards the \"slice of life\" category, though do not mistake that for a lack of plot! Sometimes I get writers block and become a little stressed over it, but I try very hard to keep my partner in the loop despite being a naturally horrible communicator. Ahem. Sold yet? No? Perfect. So, uh... Is this the part where I cut out magazine strips and craft my demands in exchange for your precious time? (I suppose that wouldn't really make sense had I been demanding your time, eh?)\n\n  I guess what I am looking for is the simple execution of character development. As typical as it sounds--coming from a girl--I am definitely looking to feed into a potential blossoming romance between character A and character B. My best friend and I used to have a story line going for over 6 years. When her and I cut ties, I guess she left a void that I have been looking to fill ever since. I miss it. \n\n  Anyhow, back to the specifics in regards to your time:\n\n- Life comes first. Your life, my life. I get it. It happens. I work full time, and the overnight shift. I understand being spotty. \n\n- Please, though I am very aware I am far from perfect, capitalize and attempt to punctuate. I am not really worried about spelling. If I can read it? We're good. I'm usually pretty good about that. \n\n- I mean, we can write NSFW material, but you'll have to buy me dinner first. We can talk about comfort zones and create a safe word if necessary. (; (This is mostly a joke, by the way. Don't take me too seriously. I would like to thoroughly express that such content is NOT mandatory, and there are plenty of ways to take the story ot focus on other aspects of it. We could even tie it into the plot somehow to solidify it. )\n\n- Just let me know if you are going to be away for awhile. I would rather know than be waiting around in the dark while I could have occupied my time doing other things, you know? In return, as I stated above, I will attempt to do the same. \n\n- I do not require that your gender outside of the story is female, just your character. Even if you weren't looking to pursue something romantic with mine, I am actually cool with that. Send me some of your ideas, and I'm sure we can figure something out. You can have a plethora of side characters and the likes, but if one of them is going to become romantically involved with mine, I would be caught on male/female pairings. \n\n- I do not require you to be chatty OOC. I don't mind it, but please don't feel obligated. Just do you and enjoy the moment however you choose to do so. \n\n- Please be 18+\n\n- I don't really like doing futuristic or fandoms. I'd definitely be more inspired to write in modern time or perhaps in the past. Realistic or fantasy. \n\n\n  I feel like, for a stranger, reading this gives you a very basic taste of my personality both in and out of character most days. Had I appealed to you in any way, please don't hesitate to message me. I'm actually pretty nice, or at least feel that I am. We can discuss platforms to conglomerate on. If you actually made it this far without regurgitating in your mouth a little bit, thanks for taking the time. I look forward to my empty inbox in a few hours. \u2661 ",

Again, not all the time, but I would appreciate someone who can match my writing lengths and vice versa. In a universe of spatial surroundings, all senses, and thought there is always **something** to write about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Preferences:** I love fandoms as well as original content. But the true nirvana is creating an OC in a fandom universe. Dear sweet god YAAAASSSSSS.\n\n**What I\u2019m Looking for in an RPer:**\n\n* MUST WRITE M/M\n* MUST write 3rd person\n* MUST be 21+ \n* Shares similar interests, morals, and fandoms\n* MUST write PLOT and SMUT\n* MUST write more than 1-2 sentence replies (short responses are difficult to reply to)\n* A friend \ud83d\ude0a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fandoms I know and enjoy:**\n\n* Fallout\n* Hannibal\n* Marvel (Spider-man/Deadpool &amp; Kurt/Logan)   \n**Andrew Garfield Spider-man only** (I mean it. If you like MCU Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-man at all then I am not the writing partner for you. I apologize for the inconvenience.)\n* Watchdogs 2 \n* Detroit Become Human\n* Westworld\n* Vikings\n* Supernatural\n* Sons of Anarchy\n* Game of Thrones\n* Sherlock\n* A lot of video games honestly and more\u2026. (just ask \\^x\\^)\n\n**Genre/Themes: \u201cJust fuck me up\u201d**  \nI love writing angst/pain/dark/misery/anything that consists of hurt and flaw that then begets growth of a character. Nothing is more beautiful than kintsugi \u2013 pouring gold into the cracks of things that are broken to make them whole again and more valuable/beautiful than before. I write all aspects of life. Gore/Pain/Angst/Love/Fluff/ you name it- I write it. Life is everything and everything is life so that\u2019s exactly what I like to include in my stories, characters and narratives.  Oh. And smut.  TONS of smut.   \n\n\nI love playing villain, antiheroes, the broken and those who rise from a fall. I do not play heroes - or to be more specific -any \u201cWhite Knight\u201d characters whom are simply nice, kind, and have never had their metal tested.  Someone who remains unscathed and \u201cpure\u201d - I couldn\u2019t have less interest in writing or playing with a character like that.   \nI HIGHLY prefer to write **bottom** characters when it comes to pairings, however it\u2019s not impossible for me to create/write characters who top, depending on the situation. **I ONLY write M/M.**  I write on **Discord only**. It saves chats, rp\u2019s and allows for wonderful organization/privacy no other platform I\u2019ve used can offer with ease of use.  \nI am pretty flexible on most things I do not state as ABSOLUTE \u2013 if you\u2019re curious then just ask me (if I\u2019ve garnered your interest). I would like people to be as open and understanding of me as I would be with them.  Please also KNOW THE CHARACTER you are trying to portray if we are playing with canon characters. I put a lot of time researching characters to stay as close to the source material as possible and I expect the same effort. Nothing is more boring / jarring than a poorly portrayed character. Also, I don\u2019t mean this to sound stuck up or rude, but I have high expectations of the people I write with. Writing is more than just a passing hobby for me, it\u2019s something I\u2019m very passionate about / involved in, and I am looking for someone who can bring the same amount of passion and basic skill to the table.  If that\u2019s you then **awesome**! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot Ideas:**  I\u2019m open to almost anything. Again, just ask.  I don\u2019t have many set worlds, just older OC\u2019s and such. I\u2019d love to dust off the old ones or even make some new ones for the sake of our writing ADVENTURES\\~! ALSO \u2013 the deeper the world, the sweeter the story, the better the characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kinks/Stuff I love:** BDSM, abuse, consensual/non-con/dub-con, smoking/alcohol/drug use, promiscuity, fate, soul mates, age differences, height differences, subdrop, angst, anti-heros, anon-sex, AU\u2019s, dom/sub, cross dressing, violence (not senseless), fluff, domestic life, slow/quick burn romance, and more. Always willing to discuss at length and with passionate detailing when asked. I love post-apocalyptic settings too, big, big fan.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kinks/Stuff I will NOT tolerate:** NO HIGH SCHOOL (unless 18+), NO FURRIES, no sexualized gross bodily fluids aka no water sports &amp; no scat (semen and blood okay). NO ANIME. No mpreg, no omega-verse, no baby/diaper-play/infantilism, no monsters, no anthro, no animal fetishization, no bestiality, no inflationism, no celibacy/aces (perfectly alright to be- just no fun for me to write or write with), no incest, no vore (cannibalism ok). No F/F, no M/F (I write men with men).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we are writing together and you find we are not syncing well, no worries at all. Please feel free to tell me. I know it\u2019s rather hard to do but I will not mind. In the same light, if you choose to ghost me to spare my feelings (I would prefer to be told so I\u2019m not left waiting) I understand that too. It\u2019s hard to muster the strength to reject someone. Searching for an RP partner is tough and if we do not mesh it won\u2019t be enjoyable for either party. No hard feelings. \ud83d\ude0a",

Dont expect a huge response every time, 1-2 paragraphs but it varies (happy to write a long opener.) I enjoy various stories, bf/gf, school, already established relationships or just met!\n\nHappy to consider all realistic RP scenarios. Look forward to chatting with you!",
