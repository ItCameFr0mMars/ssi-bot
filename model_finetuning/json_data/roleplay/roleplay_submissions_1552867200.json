            "selftext": "He died in a patch of sunlight- that\u2019s about the only good thing Genevieve can say about her last holder. And she\u2019s been sat with his corpse for\u2026\n\nA while. She doesn\u2019t like to think about how long.\n\nShe\u2019s watched plants crawl into this funny little building, eating away at it bit by bit. They open the skylight a little more each month, each year. At first she was miffed that they were stealing her sunlight- now they\u2019re good company. She names new leaves, mourns the ones that fall away. Curls up into a lonely ball when the cold white light and the colder white snow kills them away.\nShe befriends some of the animals that roam in, and takes a delight in scaring the rest. \n\n\u201cSee?\u201d She says to empty, dusty air when the rat or the bird scampers away. \u201cI\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still *here.*\u201d\n\nNothing answers, because nothing ever answers. No matter how loud she screams. Maybe there\u2019s nothing that can- maybe nothing wants to answer the thing that screams in a broken down building.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t care anymore. She just likes the noise.\n\nShe can replicate bird calls now even without recording and replaying them. She can get curious big crows peaking in through the gaps to figure out what she is. Once, she even managed to lure a feral cat. It had hissed at her when it saw her, scared and uncertain. It had made her smile for months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nShe talks to the holder\u2019s skeleton. Half of his skull is bleached in sunlight. Most of the time she just swears at him, swears at her own ineffectiveness as she tries to kick bits of him across the room.\nSometimes it feels like she\u2019s not here at all.\n\nShe tries not to think, but it doesn\u2019t work, so she tries not to think of people. Only animals and plants; she doesn\u2019t want for company because humans don\u2019t exist. She\u2019s nothing. She\u2019s the walls, she\u2019s impassive, she watches and observes, she enjoys and tries to insist on her existence to the world.\n\nOther times, pretending doesn\u2019t work. She sits and cries silly ineffective tears and has conversations with the walls. She pretends her holder is still alive. She swears at him some more.\n\nBut now, in the hot summer light that leaves her so energized, she sits and talks to the new leaves on the creeping ivy.\n\n**About this thingy!**\n\nGene, more commonly known as Genevieve or Eugene dependent on the gender chosen, was an AI popular within the military when the disaster hit. Used for combat and terrain analysis, they were installed into most soldier\u2019s helmets. Now, three hundred and forty nine years later, there\u2019s only one functioning copy left. If you can call Genevieve functioning, that is.\n\nShe\u2019s installed into an earpiece set, a dusty scratched silver thing that fits snugly over the shell of the ears and attaches around the back of the head by a thin band. She charges via solar power. She has two forms; one is simply to function as the headset, invisible. The other is what looks like a holographic image of a young woman with stereotypically attractive features wearing a short sleeved dress.\n\nGenevieve\u2019s long length of activity has, essentially, broken her. Her previous owner, who she calls a holder, also made some large alterations to her and the way she functions. She\u2019s much more human as a result. Her lack of company has affected her close to as much as it would affect a real person, so her attitude isn\u2019t predictable.\n\nI\u2019d be very happy to roleplay with anyone as Gene! You'll have to be okay with roleplaying with someone under 18. The only requirements are that the world they\u2019re in is an apocalyptic one (zombies, wasteland, plague, you name it and I\u2019ll be happy with it. If you insist on me picking, then just say and I\u2019ll shoot an explanation of why the world is the way it is), you\u2019re not afraid to start conflict, and you write somewhere at 2+ paragraphs per reply. More is appreciated.\n\nI don't mind if you want to talk about the RP more or just start roleplaying from the get go. I want to write either over Reddit (PMs or I'll make us a subreddit), email or Google Docs. I won't use Discord, sorry.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

            "selftext": " I stumbled across this subreddit completely by accident. At first I thought it was a little cheesy but the more I think about it, it seems like something that could be a lot of fun and a good way to exercise my creative thinking. I've sort of had a look around to get a feel of what it's all about, but I need someone to kind of show me how it's done in practice.\n\nDon't let that fool you though, I'm an extremely able writer. I feel like I would work best with an extremely detailed, highly descriptive style, pretty much as if we were writing a novel. My schedule is sporadic, but I can certainly commit to one submission per day of 300-500 words, and more on some days. I'm in AEST but I don't really care where you are, since I'm not fussed about when exactly you respond as long as it's within a kind of 24h cycle. I've gathered that lack of response effort is a huge problem around here, but I assure you it won't be an issue with me. I would rather take an extra bit of time to write a proper one than give you something mediocre. Discord seems the thing. I have discord.\n\nPrompt-wise, I'm super open to ideas. I am happy to have it set in either a fantasy or modern setting, but if modern I'd prefer it to not be in a civilian context. I'm happy to work with fandom for world context, but I'd like the characters to be completely OG. If you want something from a book series, game, or show, I've probably read, played or seen it, so feel free to suggest. Either way, I'd like the arc to be focused on intrigue, conflict, war, crime or something like that. Something visceral. Some examples off the top of my head:\n\n\\- Two agents/assassins of rival secret service's come across each other in the field of some war-torn country, realise they have a common goal, and execute it. (The assassination of some figurehead, or thwarting nuke detonation etc.)\n\n\\- A young general gets framed by his malicious 2IC and outlawed from his empire. He meets someone by happenstance who helps him take revenge.\n\n\\- Two people get in a bad plane/ship wreck and end up on a tropical island, castaway style. It is inhabited by a tribe of xenophobic savages. Together, they avoid, outmaneuver and outsmart them to eventually escape.\n\nYou'll see they all centre around two people, one male and one female (it's just more interesting and varied that way). I think it'd be cool to write back and forth in a POV switching style. Obvious the potential for romance is huge and I'm happy to engage, but it should be a side arc. I'm happy to try NSFW writing, but can't promise I'd be much good at it. I'd write in 3rd person past tense.\n\nSorry for the huge post. Let me know if you want to make that first impression, reiteration that the above are just random ideas, I'm more than happy to write to yours (probably better since I'm new) as long as the elements can be fit in. yasss",

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ \n\nHello, my name is Allen, and i love history! From the ancient river valleys to the most lewd medieval rulers, i love them all. I wanted to roleplay a storyline that i came up with, and it will have a heavy historical influence.\n\nYour character: This story will center on you, a young but highly capable princess. At a time when no one imagined that a woman could rule a state, you seized the reigns if the kingdom magnificently, turning it from a small kingdom into a regional power. In the process though, you have to put down a few rebellions, and this is where my character comes in. I lead a rebel army and wreak havoc in your state as soon as i hear about your fathers death. Expecting an easy win, you defeat me and lock me away, deciding to show me mercy because i showed you a bit of chivalry.\n\nThis is when the plot gets dicey. A neighboring kingdom decides that they want what is yours, and invade the kingdom. You realize that only with my help can you defeat such a large and powerful army and unite your people. We slowly learn to respect each other, and both prove ourselves as capable leaders, maybe even becoming lovers in the process.\n\n\nThe setting: A bit more about the setting, this story will be set in a small kingdom called Galitia, and your people are called the Galitians. The capital of your kingdom is called Valle\u00e9, a rich town with a castle at its center. Its in the eastern part of the kingdom. Across your kingdom runs a river called the Laugus river, and to the west lies a castle called Eagles Nest. Controlling this castle gives you control over the west. Neighboring your kingdom is a powerful empire called the Alemanic confederacy. Your father, the now dead king, paid tribute to his empire in order to keep them from invading. Since this is medieval, know that most of the kingdom wont respect you on account of your gender. The story will start with your fathers death. The Nobles will push the country to the brink of civil war over who gets to succeed him, as he had no son, only you, his illegitimate daughter. You will take power with the help of your advisor. Some of the Nobles and knights will rebel against you, and how you deal with them is up to you.\n\nThe setup: each storyline will be a season/volume and will be roleplayed in a group chat, (just you and me) our dms will be for discussing anything outside the rp. There will also be a group for alternate storylines or character one shots just to make the universe feel bigger. This other group doesn't have to be used.\n\nThere a few plot twists that i wanna save for the actual rp, the time period can be any you would like, (i would prefer medieval Europe or the middle east) and i would be happy to discuss other matters of the rp if you like! I am also not looking for someone who wants to act like they have no idea how to run a kingdom for the sake of drama, I have had partners do that already, and my god was it annoying. If you like certain aspects of this roleplay but not others, please text me anyway, we can definitely compromise! Hope to hear from you soon!\n\nText me if interested! Thank you for taking the time to read this!",

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ \n\nHello, my name is Allen, and i love history! From the ancient river valleys to the most lewd medieval rulers, i love them all. I wanted to roleplay a storyline that i came up with, and it will have a heavy historical influence.\n\nYour character: This story will center on you, a young but highly capable princess. At a time when no one imagined that a woman could rule a state, you seized the reigns if the kingdom magnificently, turning it from a small kingdom into a regional power. In the process though, you have to put down a few rebellions, and this is where my character comes in. I lead a rebel army and wreak havoc in your state as soon as i hear about your fathers death. Expecting an easy win, you defeat me and lock me away, deciding to show me mercy because i showed you a bit of chivalry.\n\nThis is when the plot gets dicey. A neighboring kingdom decides that they want what is yours, and invade the kingdom. You realize that only with my help can you defeat such a large and powerful army and unite your people. We slowly learn to respect each other, and both prove ourselves as capable leaders, maybe even becoming lovers in the process.\n\n\nThe setting: A bit more about the setting, this story will be set in a small kingdom called Galitia, and your people are called the Galitians. The capital of your kingdom is called Valle\u00e9, a rich town with a castle at its center. Its in the eastern part of the kingdom. Across your kingdom runs a river called the Laugus river, and to the west lies a castle called Eagles Nest. Controlling this castle gives you control over the west. Neighboring your kingdom is a powerful empire called the Alemanic confederacy. Your father, the now dead king, paid tribute to his empire in order to keep them from invading. Since this is medieval, know that most of the kingdom wont respect you on account of your gender. The story will start with your fathers death. The Nobles will push the country to the brink of civil war over who gets to succeed him, as he had no son, only you, his illegitimate daughter. You will take power with the help of your advisor. Some of the Nobles and knights will rebel against you, and how you deal with them is up to you.\n\nThe setup: each storyline will be a season/volume and will be roleplayed in a group chat, (just you and me) our dms will be for discussing anything outside the rp. There will also be a group for alternate storylines or character one shots just to make the universe feel bigger. This other group doesn't have to be used.\n\nThere a few plot twists that i wanna save for the actual rp, the time period can be any you would like, (i would prefer medieval Europe or the middle east) and i would be happy to discuss other matters of the rp if you like! I am also not looking for someone who wants to act like they have no idea how to run a kingdom for the sake of drama, I have had partners do that already, and my god was it annoying. If you like certain aspects of this roleplay but not others, please text me anyway, we can definitely compromise! Hope to hear from you soon!\n\nText me if interested! Thank you for taking the time to read this!",

            "selftext": "Hello, all you wonderful writers and creative creatures,\n\nI'm just looking to do some writing and roleplaying with some people who love world building, lore and all the goodies that Science Fiction has to offer. \n\nI have a few ideas and I'm completely down for anything else that you lovely people can come up with. I'm not really looking to write something in existing fandom but I'm not averse to the idea. I prefer to cobble together ideas I've pilfered from all over the place to make something new (creativity doesn't occur in a vacuum). I love to bounce ideas because people always come up with stuff I never would've thought of. So anways, here are my ideas:\n\n* [Gritty, grim and gloomy Blade Runner and Akira-esque cityscape with all the trimmings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEoxu0_8uZU) - Always down for a grim dark future ruled by Mega Corps (although nowadays I don't really need to use much imagination). I'd love to  build a thriving city filled with layers of intrigue, mystery, politics, mayhem, weird science and technology and thumping music.\n\n* [Slow, philosophical and politically driven SF](https://youtu.be/uhesDs6FWpo?t=141) - I love the clunky aesthetic of the Alien franchise with its green and black readouts, glacial space travel and grimey living conditions and the slow and deliberate pace of the Star Trek TV series. This would probably be more dialogue heavy than action oriented. Even when the action does happen I'd love it to be more like a submarine battle with calculated moves and precise tactics rather than jetting about with lasers and the like. I love Science Fiction's exploration of moral and ethical problems and this would be a perfect setting to flex our philosophical muscles.\n\n* [Robots and Lasers and Aliens! Oh My!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xChqT5_o50o) - This would probably be a lot more lighthearted but could easily incorporate some darker themes. This would be a very Anime inspired setting, so think Gundam or Macross, that kind of thing. This would be a lot more action oriented and fast paced but I do love to build characters and organisations and lore in these settings too.\n\n* [Less science and more silly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPHvjcaY7lM) - This would be a setting of pure nonsense, something like Adventure Time or Bravest Warriors. You can't be serious all the time or you'd go mad so it's nice to just let your imagination run wild every once in a while. Weird aliens, fantastic technologies, far flung planets and a $30 Warp Drive aplenty.\n\n* [Abstract, odd and quiet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rVdUufUBss) - This just randomly popped into my head and it's rather half formed but I thought I'd throw it in the mix. One of favourite video games of all time is Hyper Light Drifter, I just love everything about it. I'd love to make something bizarre, abstract and unconventional in a similar vein to HLD. This again would be a place to let your imagination run wild but in a far more serious setting.\n\nI hope you lovely folks like my ideas, can't wait to hear from you  ",

Her week-long mission: To enjoy a collaborative roleplay experience where you, the players, take on the role of crewmembers on an Intrepid-class starship (which you might recognise from Voyager!) and roleplay with one another inbetween weekly check-ins where the overall story ticks forward. \n\nThe year is 2392.The Romulan home world has been destroyed, civil war ensued and the empire as the galaxy once knew it, fell apart in the Alpha Quadrant, being replaced by a loose confederation of colonies and factions. At the same time, a stable wormhole to the Delta Quadrant has been found, and the Romulan Union, the nomadic Government-in-exile of the former empire, is sending ships to colonize and conquer the Quadrant.\n\nIn the same token, the Federation of planets is also sending ships, to explore and help bring peace to the wild region of space. One of these ships happen to be a Intrepid-Class named: The USS Trinity.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/U4etqF7",

Although I don't know you (yet), there are probably stories, and characters, that you have absolutely loved before the mysterious disappearance of one partner or another. Maybe it's happened to you once, maybe it's happened to you multiple times. Either way, that doesn't make it any easier to lose something beloved. **That's where I come in.** I would love the chance to roleplay these stories, the ones that you may have thought were gone forever, with you. We can start from the beginning, or if you would prefer, we can start right where you left off.\n\nIf you're up for the idea, hit me up.\n\nIf you would like to know a little bit more about me, continue reading. :)\n\nA little bit about me ...\n\n* I am 30+ and require my partners to be 18+.\n   * I am open to smut as long as there's character development and build up.\n* I roleplay exclusively on Discord.\n* I roleplay in third person past tense.\n\nI hope to hear from some of you soon!\n\n**TL;DR I am open to roleplaying some of your stories that have fallen to the wayside due to the disappearance of a partner or multiple partners.**",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Ironheart, though if you are reading this you may soon know me simply as the Game Master. For the last 2 or so years I have been contructing in detail a fantasy world for both role play and story telling purposes, and,after finally writing a description of this world that I feel does it some justice, I have decided to launch a discord server in which anyone who finds my work interesting can forge their on long term story with their own character and other rpers, as well as make friends and just have an intresting time all together. The world description is below:\n\nMora| How we came to be.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mora was once a dark and desolate place completely void of life. Then one day from the darkness of space fell a blue star. This star impacted with our world and the energy that gave it its blue hue fused with Mora's surface and all the elements within it. The living energy then assumed a physical form, using its power over the elements to meticulously create itself a body. It then became her, the crafter, and as the crafter with her powers would bring our world life and beauty. She would create plants, then creatures and finally she would create us, the dolls. The first four of our kind were born from her physical body and called the Guardians: Phyra, Isma, Proten, and Ignitis. Each represented an aspect of the Crafters personality and possessed a portion of her power,each controlling one of the elements she had fused with, the crafter herself remaining the sole holder of energy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the Elementals came the more common dolls, born of pod and seed rather then from the crafter herself. At first they remained near the place of their creation, building up a grand city, called the Origin, which still stands today as the capital of our civilization . After a while however, as their numbers grew they began to move out farther into the world, were they used their own powers to build new settlements in all directions outward of the Origin but not leaving the island it was built upon for thousands of years. They lived in such peace and prosperity that the island became known as the Oasis and here each doll lived eternally. The peace was not to last however. Unknown to the crafter and her creations, down just below Mora's surface, in the hollows of the world's crust, a being had been slowly coming awake since the crafter's descendants and now it made itself known. Enraged by the presence of unwanted guest, the being who we'd name Notin, breached the surface and sent up his dark minions who possessed the bodies of living things and used them against us. Valiantly those early dolls took up arms and alongside the Guardians and the crafter held against the threat from the shadows, but Notin\u2019s power was overwhelming and settlement after settlement fell. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thousands of our precursors were lost. In the end the Crafter, with all her compassion and love for her creations, chose to sacrifice her physical form to save all life on Mora. Once again pure energy and one with the world she closed the breeches and trapped Notin and his minions below, preventing them from reinforcing their topside comrades and giving us the reprieve we needed to beat the shadows of destruction back and retake our island.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that first big victory, under the guidance of the Guardians, now the wisest and oldest amongst us, we began to expand rapidly so that we could not be so easily overwhelmed again. For the first time we sailed from the Oasis and settled in unfamiliar foreign lands. We established new settlements and restructured our society to be more efficient, assuring our continued existence. The Authority and its caste system was put in place by the Guardians, and the 1st Arbiter, a doll of pure heart and mind, was created to head it and govern us. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under her, and with the guidance of the Guardian Phyra, who understood the process of creating life better than anyone else, we began making new dolls and using the process of strand weaving to manipulate their traits, allowing them to better fit into their caste and better fulfill their intended societal roles. Once again Doll kind began to thrive, though our war with the remnants of notins cut off forces, left on the surface when the breeches closed, would continue and still continues thousands of years later. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now a days we have managed to come to a point were most of us no longer have to fear for our lives on a daily basis. That said, today doll kind is divided more than ever before. The cities outside of the Oasis and their appointed rulers, the Dons, have become largely independent. Without the Crafter we have also lost our ability to live eternally, and even the mighty Guardians have passed as a result in the years since. This mortality has caused newer generations to seek out the endless lives our ancestor had and some have gone as far as to let their minds be taken in Notins grasp in exchange for power and eternal life. He continues to manipulate the minds of dolls from his realm and we continue to lose cities and towns to treachery and deceit from within.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Infighting has also become a problem. Some Dons let their egos outgrow their domains and clash with others of their caste, leading to strife and even war between Dolls. \u00a0Their are also those who don't wish to fulfill their duty to their kind and leave the cities were they are born to lead lives of solitude and sometimes crime in the wilds. However the most recent Arbiter, the fifth to rule, has been the most zealous in her efforts to restore unity under the Authority. She has employed symbols like the Eye of the Authority to instil a sense of dread in our enemies and security in our citizens. She has enforced our new and old laws alike with an attitude of ruthlessness and mercilessness. \u00a0She directs and coordinates our armies with precision and she does not tolerate the arrogance that some dons have allowed themselves to develop. Still, in spite of her efforts, cities on the frontier line continue to fall and the umbral forces continue to come up with new beast and weapons they use to crack city walls and massacre innocent dolls or take over their bodies and use them against us. However things are,we will continue to fight and we will continue to protect our home and civilization until the the last doll is broken.\n\nIf you are interested here is our Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/dJAvQgR",

I do ask that my partners be 18+ considering I like to roleplay mature themes. I can write to accommodate my partner but I do prefer to write 3rd person, 2-3 paragraphs. I'm a big fan of OOC and developing a friendship outside of the roleplay. I'm very active and reply multiple times a day. I only use Discord and prefer to keep it there. Im a female and I prefer to write female characters. \n\nI have a couple of plots I have been dying to roleplay and I hope itll interest some of you. If you have any plots you wanna roleplay as well, tell me and we can talk about it. \n\nPlot #1: (Y/C/N) is a retired hitman finally trying to make a life for himself. He wants to start over and live like a normal person. He moves from town to town looking for a place he can call home. Finally, after moving once more, he finds a small, cozy apartment where he can finally breathe. His neighbor is a tiny fresh out of college kindergarten teacher who isn't intimidated at all by him. She becomes friends with him and starts to break into his icy exterior. (This one is considered mature because he is a hitman as well as other elements that go into the story that we can talk about if it interests you) This is a bit SOL mixed with James Bond themes. \n\nPlot #2: Super simple idea I want to build with my partner. Prince is betrothed to neighboring kingdoms princess but is in love with one of the maids from the castle. \n\nPlot #3: It's very dark and you'll just have to talk to me to find out.

It does take place mainly in the city, but it does have side areas, like countryside, mountains, a beach, ect. \n\nIt focuses heavily on use of bots, the main one being an income and currency bot. This way, players can 'work' to earn money and 'buy' luxuries, pay bills, ect.\n\nEvery single aspect in RJ is based off real life events, for example:\n\n* Each job that players can join via Roles, has it's own requirements and pay levels.\n* Players will use currency to buy items, like cars, living spaces, pets, pay bills/rent, ect.\n* There are various categories that separate each area of the city, and under those are channels that represent the specific areas of that category. \n* This is not a perfect city! Crime is present here, you choose your side. \n* Have as many characters as you can handle!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould anyone be interested in something like this? \n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "First, a few things about myself.\n\nI am 33 come May, East Coast United States (EST/EDT), and I work a full time job during the week. I love RP when I can get it, and there's been a bit of a dry spell lately. I am seeking to change that.\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you may ask? Look below:\n\n-Modern (this can be fantasy, slice of life, drama)\n\n-Historical (I am open to medieval eras (vikings/Norse/Saxon era), as well as 1940s/1950s/1960s play)\n\n-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n-Fandoms (I like the worlds of Marvel/DC, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire, Harry Potter, Vikings, The Last Kingdom; others need ask. But PLEASE don't ask me to play canon characters from these shows. There is no guarantee I may be able to play what you want)\n\n-Video Games (This is a big toss up, but I know Tomb Raider, the newer trilogy, drew some interest from me :) )\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art.\n\nI am an adult, and I write like one in terms of the writing. Give me the romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that know what this means will get it :) ). I seek those in a similar boat too. I also enjoy players who like to socialize outside of RP (OOC), since there'll be times when we may not be able to RP but can talk.\n\nPlease, please, please be someone who can RP and talk on a daily or near-daily basis. This is a big request. I've been meeting too many people ghosting lately. I will drop someone after a week of silence if they don't say anything. If anything does come up, let me know. It's courteous and I WILL understand and be lenient &amp; patient. And a hint: Discord on PC/phones/tablets loves to mess with notifications sometimes, so check it!\n\nAnd one last thing...please be someone that doesn't let much bother them. Blocking me for things like asking you innocent questions for plotting, or saying \"hi, how are you\", or needing your help in reacting to a complicated character action are ridiculous. Be someone who is open to a lot, and doesn't let much bother them, and we'll get along easily!\n\nFeel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours &amp; please be someone who actively uses it. Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!",

And I assume you're looking for the same since you're reading this right now ahah.. I'm 23, F from the UK (but i stay up pretty late), tend to write in first person but can do third, usually write 1-2 paragraphs, you get the idea.\n\nI have an idea in mind for this, and it's pretty simple; It's a high school setting, and you're, well, kind of a dork. I'm sort of popular but frankly I hate it, I feel like I have no actual friends, just people that want to be around because of popularity or some other similar vain reason. I'm thinking we get put together to study for something, or to work on a project, and we kinda grow close over it.. I even get a crush on you. Then we deal with all the drama surrounding that. Or if you'd rather skip ahead a little we can just start with already being a little bit into the project.\n\nAlternatively I am open to other ideas! I can't guarantee i'll go with them but i'd love to hear them and see if they're for me! \n\nSo.. yeah, send a message if you're interested! Don't be shy! I typically play on Discord, just tend to prefer it over reddit PM's/Inbox",

Her crimes varied in range from simple robbery to the murder of high ranking Federation officers.\n\nOnce inside the prison all the inmates had their possessions confiscated and any augments disabled, one of those being Caleta's right hand. \n\nA few weeks pass and Caleta has been segregated from the main prison population due to...problems with other inmates.

Naturally, I am up for discussions and can definitely work with my writing buddy in defining the setting that we will write in. \n\nA little bit about me: Been RPing for 7-8 years now in different settings, from low fantasy to sci fi and slice of life. I like to believe that I am a decent writer. I am from Europe (+1 gmt). I use discord for roleplaying. Nsfw stuff and relationship between characters are perfectly fine. In cyberpunk sci fi settings I usually RP a hacker or a spaceship pilot/technician but I can definitely work something out with the writing buddy. \n\nJust toss me a message and we can chat/add each other.

            "selftext": "Hiya Reddit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been wanting to try out new genres lately and did some research on Steampunk which I found to be very interesting. I'd prefer someone who knows about that already so they could give some insight along the way in an adventure roleplay! What I want is almost a D&amp;D style roleplay about a group of characters set in some large world that we could create together or base off a real one. There can be plenty of main characters and NPCs that bring a certain life to the story too. At the moment I\u2019m willing to have this spread in any number of directions as long as we can keep an interesting story going.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout me:\n\n\u2022\t21\n\n\u2022\tAround 6 years of roleplay experience\n\n\u2022\tHave a decent amount of free time in between work and school for posting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n\u2022\tSomeone who wants a long-term roleplay\n\n\u2022\tSomeone who can write at least a paragraph or two per response, which could go way over depending on how many characters you choose to control per post.\n\n\u2022\tMy schedule is pretty random right now but I like to post back and forth throughout the day, and can find lots of free time at certain points to further the roleplay (Basically someone who is free to chat often).\n\n\u2022\tA sizable amount of worldbuilding and creativity to bring the story to life.\n\n\u2022\tI want a group of characters no matter how large, whether they be main characters or side characters, since I have plenty of interests to test out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA previous partner and I roleplayed for a few years most days so I'm definitely able to have a longterm roleplay or however long you feel like sticking around. But I should say I'm only looking for 1, maybe 2 partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to PM me on here if you've got an idea or are just interested in talking things over. Just let me know how much experience you have with roleplay, or even better how much you can help me learn about worldbuilding. Tell me about yourself and if we seem like we could be a good fit then I'll send you my Discord tag.",

I like just about any genre, and theme, so I can be a pretty open-minded person. That being said, let's get down to some basics, eh?  \n\n\n1. I'm looking for people who want to explore and seize initiative in the RPs. Ask questions, examine things, talk to random NPCs, interact to your hearts content! As a GM, I want to make the world react to you, and create for 'ya. So, take advantage!\n2. (Optional but heavily preferred) I'm looking for people who may have an interest in their characters taking on leadership roles. For example, leading a survivor group in a post-apocalypse, or somesuch. A group steadily forms, a culture is distinguished, etc. \n3. Being literate, and Experienced in RP is a must. I prefer people who can match my posts' lengths, although with that being said, I don't hold it against people if they shorten some as well. After all, walking down a hallway with no dialogue does not warrant three paragraphs!\n4. Open-mindedness is advised. I like to create a diverse (but realistic) world, so be prepared to encounter all manner of distinct peoples and creatures out there.\n5. I'm hoping to also make friends while doing this. RP without being friends is kind of pointless. So, let's talk in OOC about stuff while we do it!\n6. Communication is key. I won't take offense if you want to stop the RP, or have a problem with something in it. All I ask is you don't ghost me randomly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill here? If so, shoot me a PM. Worst I can say is no, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "The first snowfall of the season was quite a strong one, covering the frozen forest with a layer of white fluff. Sparkling flurries fell faster as the winds picked up. For the most part, the forest was empty... except for a man trudging through the nasty winter storm.\n\nLindo, the soldier sent to start the fight against an unknown evil was caught in the thick of the storm in the forest. His metal armor clashed and clanged with creeks here and there as it began to freeze over. His breathing became sharp as he took his two last steps before falling to his knees, the armor on the verge of being frozen solid from the hours of walking through the snowstorm. \n\n\"Is this why they sent me... to get rid of me? I'll just be another soldier lost in his travels.\" He told himself as he felt the frostbite eat away at his tips, the rest of the body to follow. \n\n\"I cant... I mustn't...\" In a last attempt to find a place for refuge during the storm, he reached back with his weak hands and pulled his sword out. He stabbed it into the ground to pull himself up with the support he had. Even with his optimism, it would take a miracle to save him from the storm, as the suit had begun to freeze over completely and the frost was reaching and creeping onto his skin.\n\n_______________\n\nHey everyone, Chris here!\n\nI was thinking I write up a little prompt based of a Fantasy setting and a snowfall (Mainly because it just snowed where i am right now and its the middle of March). I then made it a little crazy with my character, the [handsome elven soldier named Lindo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/c2/bf/41c2bf0a43091843967f9e6092fe15ca.png) being close to death. \n\nSomehow someway, a beauty will come and save him. Is it a simple traveler that is better equiped for the cold? A guardian of the forest that sees Lindo and rushes to help him? Or maybe a mage that is able to heat the two of them up enough before getting to a cave? The choice is yours and we can definately discuss it if you have more ideas.\n\nId love for this RP to be a nice mix between a burning romance and an action adventure story against this unknown evil. The frozen forest is just where we will start and we can definately discuss what this evil is, be it a creeping infection/ corruption of the Land or a Dark Lord Emerging.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in incorporating some NSFW or smut into our RP with the romance. It wouldnt just be for the sake of doing it but it would make sense with the tension building and stuff.\n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red or orange envalope and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! And as always, all my other prompts are open to RPing too so you can just go through my post history! Thanks for reading!\n\n-Chris",

            "selftext": "Welcome to the Virtual Prison. The year is 3086, prisons became too much of a hassle for people as they would fill with people and begin to take up  too much space. To combat this, the virtual prison was designed. It is a warehouse of containment pods, filled with prisoners. They are submerged in liquid before being hooked up to a machine of tubes and    wires, taking their mind to the prison. So, while they\u2019re bodies are stored away, they are still in prison in their minds.\n\nThe  virtual prison takes pride in making all the inmates feel like they\u2019re really imprisoned, but because they don\u2019t want to dehumanize them, the  prison does have its own entertainment places and other normal places from society like salons and places to eat. Here, inmates can interact during their free time, get a bite to eat, or just watch some tv imported straight from real life!\n\nThough, rules are still enforced. If an inmate acts out, the guards will come and contain them. With or without force. If an accident somehow occurs, just know that if you die in the virtual prison, you don\u2019t wake up in  the real world either.\n\nSo, please enjoy your stay at the virtual prison! Make some new friends, try some new food and remember\u2026 Don\u2019t act out of line.\n\nIf you are interested, Dm me please! I will give you a link to the discord server! Please be active!!! Everyone is welcome, most OCs are welcome as well. All rules are on the server and you can ask questions on there was well.",

            "selftext": "Well I'm taking the plunge, my desire to finally find a Marvel RP has been piqued after seeing Captain Marvel and the riding the hype to Endgame. Personally I prefer to build a story playing an OC, but I have no qualms if you'd like to play a canon character. I'll be the first to admit while the MCU isn't my only foray into Marvel comics, I'm not as knowledgeable as I could be. That being said I'm more than willing to Google my heart out and study what I need to fill in the gaps.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow I find it easier and less restricting to just start our own universe (I'll just dub Earth-1816) than it is to squeeze into an existing story arch, but I'm easy going and open to negotiation! I have a pretty basic idea of what kind of character I'd like to play, but nothing set and stone and I would like to discuss the setting and such before I set anything in stone.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI guess it's time to lay down the law.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* 18+ More to do with minimizing the age gap than potential content.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n* That being said I'm a-ok for the expected to potentially excessive amount of violence and similar mature themes such a medium typically brings.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I'm also okay for romance, which brings me to my next point:\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I'm LGBTQ+ and totally all inclusive of everyone from all walks of life.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Now the big one. I'm pretty relaxed on the who literacy thing, if you can type full sentences and have decent spelling and grammar, we're gold. That being said, I do prefer paragraph/multi-paragraph roleplays as I tend to post as such. I do however understand that not every post needs to be super long though!\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* This one's optional, but appreciated. I usually like to be chatty between posts and typically do all that friend-type stuff. Personally I just think it's more fun than just dead air between posts, besides things seem to often click in an RP when you're on the same wavelength.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, maybe I'll hear from someone, maybe I won't. Either way, I thank you for taking the time to read!",

Gifted with magical blood and an affinity for summoning magics, first generation humans are sought after by demon cults and healers alike. First gens are rare in the modern day, most humans being born on two human parents, though they are no where near unheard of. Slice of life stuff, or blood cult if you'd prefer lol, with whatever character you'd like to make, vaugely based on the types of angels and demons from Dante's inferno and other classic literature.

In the future, or if the group fails on Kik, I may move to discord so stay tuned. \n\nGrey's Academy is for those seeking out an organized and unique school system. At Grey's Academy, you have many options as to what you wish to do, and have many people to meet while declaring your own story in this high end school. Though it may sound cliche, I believe with detail and effort that it can turn to something one of a kind. \n\nIf you're interested in joining or learning more about this group please message me, and we'll discuss more from there. This is for people possessing the ability to write from semi-lit to advanced lit. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I'll be happy to answer any questions!",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I'm a male in his early 20's, and I'm currently searching for fandom partners! Any gender will do honestly, but I am looking for people that can play as female characters.\n\nPost length isn't really an issue, post as much as you like!\n\nBefore I proceed further I think it's worth mentioning that I prefer mature themes? Naturally every character involved with nsfw stuff will be over 18, but I just thought it was worth mentioning in advance.\n\nI'm OOC friendly, I don't mind it! I think most of us are here to make friends after all.\n\nMy fandom list is pretty much a mile long I have to admit, so naturally everything I list won't have a plot already in mind. We can discuss plots and share ideas for all of them really, even the one I already have a plot listed for! My ideas are merely suggestions after all!\n\nFandoms-\n\nMarvel: I'm a huge fan of both Marvel and DC. I read comics, I've seen pretty much all the movies and watched a majority of the cartoons... so pretty much anything is on the table!\n\nDC: Okay unlike my other ideas, this one I'm actually craving to do. I've had this idea for months and had a good run with somebody but real life got in the way and they can't continue it. I'd love to give it another go! It involves my OC Shadow Spider getting transported into the DC universe and forced to make a new life for himself there, essentially having to start over. Meeting various characters from the DC universe and forming romances as well, along with fighting some villains and meeting other heroes in the DC universe. If that's not your cup of tea though, I understand. And yes, GMs are welcome! :)\n\nSaints Row\n\nHarry Potter: Perhaps an AU? What if Harry wasn't the chosen one...?\n\nNaruto:\n\nStar Wars\n\nAlright that's about everything I have to say, if you've got any questions or if I managed to capture your interest please feel free to message me!",

            "selftext": " \n\nSeven hundred years ago magic, as well as the powerful demons that plagued mankind, disappeared from the isolated continent of Ostanna. In the following centuries the once fractured and tribal communities of humanity grew into grand nation states, true civilisation opposed to warring clans. The next few hundred years saw unprecedented social and technological development. Now, airships allow easy transportation and trade across the continent for the workshop factories that produce continuous streams of cheap goods. Cities of hundreds of thousands shine bright even in the darkest of nights due to warm glowing brightstone lamps. Spiritpowder firearms and explosives has revolutionised warfare into something too brutal and costly to remain the commonplace practice it once was. Many arguments have been made questioning whether mankind's ability for magic was merely holding back the species and that only without its destructive force could we rise above stagnating barbarism.\n\nThen, as if tempted by mankind's arrogant disregard for the forgotten ways, magic was rediscovered. A powerful and dangerous 'Dark Art' that came in the form of an eldritch, inhuman language. Merely thinking in 'Demonic' turned one\u2019s mind into a tool, into a weapon with the capacity to shape the very matter of the world, to bend the laws of physics in nightmarish ways, to bring forth the long gone Demons as destructive, unrelenting forces of nature. This 'Psychomancy' provoked a new magical arms race between the myriad human nations, with ambitious imperial minded states already claiming expansive conquests and more peaceful trader kingdoms rejecting the real chance of finding themselves defenceless. Yet the fear of magic persists, and the strength of the emerging magical institutions remains extremely limited as mankind attempts to both teach and research the emerging art.\n\nYou have lived your whole life within one of these less violent countries, specifically the coastal Kingdom of Oltoria. It is a nation built on a back bone of wealthy guilds and even wealthier aristocratic houses, but unfortunately you belong to neither. As an orphan, you would have been doomed to a life of grim poverty in the always growing slums of Oltoria's port capital where it not for being 'adopted' by a mysterious talking cat who claims to have been preparing your entire life for one of magical grandeur.\n\nToday is the date of the annual Oltorian Witchcraft Institution Intake, a day you have been preparing for your entire life. The chances of acceptance are slim, but the potential future that lies ahead, the escape from the slums, the fantastical power, a life of rubbing shoulders with the noble elite, is well worth the effort.\n\n\\-\n\nThank you for reading! That was a brief introduction to my original fantasy world, a world I hope you'll enjoy exploring and meeting characters in. I do NOT consider this to be a 'Magic School' story akin to Harry Potter, rather something with larger stakes and high fantasy shenanigans. However, it does indeed start with your character enlisting in a college that teaches magic.\n\nI am looking for someone willing to roleplay as an 18-19 year old young woman who can type detailed responses in third or first person. The reason I ask for a female character is because I believe the greater story is more impactful and generally better if the protagonist is female.\n\nI will be taking on the role of the 'DM', describing the settings, playing the stark majority supporting characters and be responsible for making sure the story is coherent and flows properly while taking into account your character\u2019s own agency. I will never describe your character\u2019s actions for you, or put words into your character\u2019s mouth. It goes without saying that I'll be writing in third person. One of the main reasons I roleplay is to entertain my partner, I am to use this control to tell the most enjoyable story for you to star in, and hopefully, become immersed in! There will be a swarm of interesting characters to interact with, each with their own personality for you to interact with, and a complex, varied world to explore.\n\nThe roleplay may well bring up rather dark themes or include rather graphic imagery and I'd like my partner to be 18+. Of course, there's no way of knowing that you really are 18+, but at least tell me so for peace of mind! Similarly, smut is not strictly off the table, although it's not a focus of the story and will only happen if the plot justifies it, even then, it's ultimately your characters decision to accept the scene or not.\n\nIf this interests you, please don't hesitate to send me a PM and I'll get back to you within a little while! Please tell me the timezone you are in. Feel free to ask any questions you might have about the roleplay in the comments section so other people might see my answers to them! If you really want to sell yourself, one or two hundred words in the form of a writing sample would be fantastic.\n\nIf you aren't interested but ARE really bored, please tell me why you don't want to roleplay with me! I will appreciate the insight into why my idea didn't appeal to you and hopefully be able to avoid the problem in future roleplay ideas.",

But if it's preferred I can do third too, just can't guarantee i'll be great at it!\n\nAnyway the reason you're looking at this post at all; the RP\n\nWe're two highschool students, but you're new. I'm a ballet dancer and you're a pianist; basically, we're meant to be partners. Which is fine except.. my character is kind of a perfectionist. She can be bossy, arrogant, all of that.. she doesn't mean to be, and half the time she doesn't even realise it. On top of that it's two weeks until a big competition, and having a sudden change of partner isn't exactly helpful. As such she's a little hard on you, but despite that they grow together over those two rushed, stressful weeks, culminating in, well... romantic feelings, with her softening up gradually and being more open to criticism and suggestions.\n\nI'm thinking all of those feelings would kinda like \"explode\" the night of the competition, culminating in a lot of awkward apologies and admitting things on her end.\n\nso yeah if that sounds like something you'd be interested in, send a message! I'm not expecting that much interest but, hey, might as well try right? I play on discord so keep that in mind! We will of course discuss things further in private! I prefer 18+ characters as well since I like to have things progress into... yknow. If it feels natural of course. ",

            "selftext": "Hi there! I'm just gonna throw out a bunch of prompts I've had floating through my head, along with fandoms I like and genres I'm interested in. If you'd like a writing sample, I have one in my older posts. I'm looking for someone who's literate and writes multiple paragraphs. Other than that, no preferences at all. I have Discord and I'm happy to stick on Reddit or go to emails or Google Docs. Don't be afraid to PM, I don't mind being ghosted if you decide you're not interested!\n\n**Medieval Fantasy**\n\n* Arranged Marriage (will need to worldbuild or be okay with very generic fantasy)\n\nOur characters are betrothed; as custom dictates, they are to spend the majority of their courtship in Belmere. Belmere is a holy city where most nobles go to meet their intended and wait out their engagement. I'll be playing multiple characters here. Lady Halli, a noblewoman who's set to inherit a sizeable demesne of significant strategic value, who's both terrified and excited by the prospect of marriage. She's very childish and naive for her age (18), since she was a sickly child and largely isolated. Saima, her handmaid, has been Halli's companion since they were both children. She's much more aware of the world, not of high birth and will be highly suspicious of you and protective of Halli. I'll also play her guards. You can be anyone you want. Someone of low birth rewarded with the betrothal by the crown for some deed? Someone looking to rule the demesne and use its strategic placement as the beginning of a rebellion? Just some other poor child of some lord, looking to make the best of their situation?\n\n* Food Taster (again needs worldbuilding)\n\nThe Lord of Barrowedge is a superstitious, paranoid man. He fills his halls with those who claim to read the future in palms, tea leaves and crystal balls. He takes counsel from so-called mages and lives in fear of assassination. Most recently, poisoning. He demands that my character, an alchemist and botanist, trains you, a criminal about to be executed, in poisons. He wants someone easily replaceable to become his food taster. My character reluctantly agrees. Don't think escaping this will be easy- any hopes of that are killed when a vial of rare poison is forced down your throat. A poison my character has the antidote for. She's happy to give it to you every morning, but if you run you're destined for a painful death. \n\n**Apocalyptic**\n\n* Last Wishes\n\nYou or your group found a man who's going to die. Regular injury, plague, zombie bite, etc. You get to know him, and by the time he's on his deathbed he believes you're a good enough person to trust and ask something of. He wasn't alone before he was found. He has a daughter, trapped in a dangerous area, and he wants you to help her.\n\n**Sci-Fi** \n\n* SCP (I'm not well versed in SCP lore, so I'll be making up a lot of stuff)\n\nYou're a scientist and researcher, already stretched thin. But you have a new charge- my character. Your first human. Are you able to stay cold and detached, or will you end up truly empathising despite yourself? \n\n* AI\n\nI'll play an AI, be it one who assists with combat or just daily life.\n\n**Genres I Like But Have No Ideas For**\n\n* Mystery\n* Modern Fantasy\n* Slice-of-Life\n\n**Fandoms**\n\n* Dragon Age\n* Skyrim\n* Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts\n* The Walking Dead\n* Horizon Zero Dawn (can play Aloy)\n* The Last of Us\n* SCP",

I write in 3rd person and past tense. I enjoy romance and supernatural themes but I am down for something new. I am looking for someone who is 21+ and who can match my paragraph style. \n\nNow on to the plots! \n\nPlot 1: An angel and a demon roleplay, where the angel has fallen to retrieve a holy item. A slowburn romance would be nice with this, especially since they are on opposite sides. \n\nPlot 2: A hunter and a vampire king are forced to marry for a treaty. They hate each other and try to kill each other before the wedding is final. \n\nPlot 3: A slice of life. My character runs a cafe and sees your character there. Romance ensues. \n\nI write on Discord and Reddit. So if you are interested or have any ideas of your own, hit me up. Thank you and have a nice day. ",

I\u2019ve been roleplaying for a couple of years and there\u2019s always been this idea I\u2019ve been interested in.\n\nThe prompt:\nA stranger visits a large city ruled over by a king and his heir, the prince. The king does not treat people with magic or magical entities very nicely, choosing to execute wizards that stumble into his city. The stranger is a somewhat weak wizard who wants to change the king\u2019s and prince\u2019s viewpoint on magic so more of his kind aren\u2019t slaughtered. He has to do it subtly though and without exposing he has magic or else he will be put to death. The stranger could eventually end up working for the prince as a servant or helper and they could have a steady relationship built. (I would prefer playing the stranger, as long as thats fine with you.) I have plans for the two characters to go on quests and adventures together or stay in the city walls and resolve personal or city issues. I would be overjoyed if you added in ideas as well for the rp and GM some situations.\n\nI\u2019m fine with doing smut and NSFW topics as long as it\u2019s a bit later in the story and has an impact in the plot. I write semi lit to lit and usually can crank out from 1-3 paragraphs, give or take. I prefer to use discord but I can also use Skype if that\u2019s what you use. I think thats about it, but if I missed something, just ask me.",

            "selftext": "Alex had always tried his best to be a good man. He worked himself ragged as a paramedic, donated some of every paycheck to charity, helped his family and friends however and whenever they needed it, and in general tried to go through life being as good a person as he could be.\n\nBut luck wasn't on his side, and one fateful day, he was diagnosed with cancer. He kept up his good spirits as best he could, but fighting a multi year losing battle with a terrible illness took its tole on him. He always tried to keep a smile on his face, even after the doctors told him he only had a short time to live, and did his best to stay happy until the end. It didn't always work, sometimes he simply couldn't take it and broke down weeping, but he always had good days after his bad days were finished.\n\nThen he crossed the rainbow bridge, shed his mortal coil, died like a doornail, however you want to phrase it. His funeral was attended by most of the whole community, as there were hardly any of them whose lives weren't touched by the man in some way. \n\nMonths passed, getting close to a year since his death. It was a cold night in early December. Snow and wind howeled outside, the clock read 3AM, and there was no way anyone would be outside in this weather. And yet, there comes a frantic knock at the door.\n\nStanding at the door is Alex, looking much like he did when he was buried, but...alive. He was wearing the samw clothes in which he was buried, and was shivering like mad. His face broke out into a weak smile of relief as he knew he had the right house, his memory was foggy at best, but he knew his house when he saw it. \n\n\"Can I come in?\" He asked in a voice that contained a hundred different emotions.\n\n------\n\nHello there! This is a prompt I've posted before, had some lovely writing with, and now I'm revisiting it again because it's high time I gave it another go. \n\nI'd like you to play Alex's wife or girlfriend, but I'm not 100% married to that (pun fully intended). I want to explore what his failing health does to their life together and what will happen following his resurrection. I have other ideas for this plot, but those are the main ones I want to focus on.\n\nSo if you'd like to take a crack at this story, I'd love to hear from you! My PMs are open, and I'll respond as soon as I can to anyone who wants to try this plot out. I'll be going to bed soon, so if I don't get back to you before then, I'll do it first thing tomorrow.\n\nHope to hear from you soon! :)",

            "selftext": "From the very moment the laboratory exploded, Kaitlyn had lay in a coma, her family unsure if she'd ever wake up again. Only days ago, she had saved her best friend from a freak experiment, accidentally uncovering a conspiracy hidden beneath her town's new university only to be caught in what had appeared to be a chemical fire. What neither her or those around her knew was that hidden deep inside that facility, something had been poked, prodded, electrocuted, and tortured to the point of rebellion. A jet and crimson being, a purely artificial being whose original purpose in life was to kill, to adapt, and to obey. A symbiote. And in the moment it rebelled, it found hope in a young human female..\n\nDays later in hopes of not only finding its way in the world away from those who created it, the symbiote has been healing our young protagonist in ways the human body would take years to properly repair itself. Fusing at the cellular level, the symbiote and Kaitlyn now have a shared existence whether she knows it or not, two minds in one body. Ligaments and tissue replaced with living metal, the symbiote has exchanged its independence for camaraderie, for the chance to find a new purpose and this girl will be its hope...\n\n*....*\n\nWell hi there everyone!\n\nWhat im looking for today is a long term, romance and adventure based origin story for two individuals become one. Seeking to find its own humanity, a symbiote attaches to a young human girl in the hopes it can truly find its self in the universe. Kaitlyn, a spunky young journalist, uncovers a plot below her city she could hardly fathom and in the process becomes the host to this being. With this new relationship, Kaitlyn has found herself with some extraordinary new powers: Elasticity, super strength, inhuman endurance, shapeshifting, polymorphism, and a sweet new red and black skin tone even Venom would be jealous about. \n\nFor this prompt, im hoping that we can rp pretty consistently; I dont expect to rp all day but I do hope we can talk pretty consistently when we're free! Long term only, if you cannot commit please don't get my hopes up; ghosting is a common problem here and I do not want to invest myself in something that will only last a day. That being said if I can improve my skills and storytelling abilities, please do let me know and I'll try my hardest to bend myself to make this exciting for you! I dont mind novels but please please put some thought into your non-dialogue responses, minimum of 4 sentences or so please. Im flexible to do 1st or 3rd person, nsfw is on the table and negotiable, and please be 18+. I tend to enjoy adventures that focus on some of the darker side of socio-politics as well as the bright side of superhero-type origin stories. \n\nWith all that being said I do hope that this can be an experience we both enjoy and can potentially bond over! Making a friend where you both enjoy the roleplay is some of the most fun i've had on reddit and feel free to just talk casually if you arent up to rping that day! Share about yourself and let that bleed into the story, it will make things interesting and fun for both of us! If youve made it this far feel free to put your favorite color and super power in the title and I hope we can make something amazing here! :D",

Basically, a team of four sent by different villages, known as \"Caravaneers\" go out on a caravan to collect Myrhh drops and refill they're respective chalices and save they're villages. It's more in depth than that but I'm not an expert of the game nor the owner of the server. But we got a lot to offer. We have the original races from the game as well as original ones that we are still making. We're working on a magic system as well. The server is still in the works and hey, maybe you can help us out. Come take a gander and maybe you will join us on the adventure if it's right for you.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/JPDrexG",

My timezone is GMT/UTC-0 However as I am in college full time I can reply a good few times per day, usually much more if I don't have too much work to do. I have roleplayed with people in EST etc before and have no problem doing this again! I prefer Discord but I can roleplay on other platforms if requested.\n\nI have a few general settings that I would like to roleplay with, however nothing concrete or extensive. I enjoy crafting a story that we can both enjoy so all of my ideas are fully open to criticism and changes of course.\n\nSome of the settings that I have had a craving for recently are as follows.\n\n\u2022 SciFi - Anything futuristic, whether that be more realistic Dystopian futures or adventurous interplanetary traveling and adventuring.\n\n\u2022 Fantasy Medieval - Anything from low fantasy to high fantasy. I especially enjoy anything that uses races from WoW or any RPG settings such as DnD or Pathfinder. I also enjoy Game of Thrones way too much and would love to do something in the same universe or similar.\n\n\u2022 Westworld - I am currently watching Westworld and would be interested in roleplaying a setting which is similar. I enjoy how the show handles advanced AI and emotions, but I won't say too much in case I spoil anything.\n\nWarcraft - Anything around Wow or Warcraft I have been dying to play. Please feel free to message me if anything here interests you or you have an idea you would like to share with me, even if it's not on the list above. I will try to get back to you as fast as I can.",

An older women (about late sixties) has some small talk with you here and there, and everything is all normal. From a distance, or what sounds like it, a snap could be heard; a second goes by and suddenly you're in an old restaurant on a busy street in New York. The scenery is what you would expect about what anybody would expect: musty air, good home-style cooking, and a very nostalgic vibe to the building. You, in this life, are a young woman who was enjoying a bowl of soup before feeling like everything is new. Like before, a snap could be heard and you a moved from one life to another, without warning or control. The only recognisable person in every scene is me, your \"guide\". I want to show you the world from every angle and every expirience, and give you the true meaning of life.\n\nPlease give me ideas to add or change.

Only members who are 18 years of age or older are welcome in the server.  \n\n\nWe are a friendly and welcoming group of talented writers. It's wholesome...the sort of wholesome that makes one feel as though you've been around for months instead of a few days. Here, single and multi-paragraph writers gather to weave stories together. A laid back server...in a setting that has been sot out by those who wish to start anew. Humans, fallen angels, oni, succubi...all creatures live in harmony together.  \n\n\nWill you find something worth sticking around for? Or someone? Perhaps you wish to stir up some chaos...   \nI hope you'll stop by and take a look around. Thank you.  \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/emns4p4](https://discord.gg/emns4p4)",

Those who have seen her tell of her many forms - that of a massive silver-pelted wolf, of a great silver reindeer, a human with silver eyes and silvery hair, and of a mighty silver bear. Some call her a saint, others call her the demon of faith, but most call her the Tale Teller.*\n\nHi there! The basic premise is above, but basically, your character would be somebody seeking out the Tale Teller for one reason or another. There could be a bounty on her head, a kingdom is looking to weaponize her, or your character could simply be looking for information from the Teller and can't go back to his/her normal life.\n\nThis would not be romance. I'm not interested in romance for this particular plotline. Likewise, there will be no NSFW. I would want to play the Teller. This is non-negotiable. I'll only be taking in the first few people who message me. I don't like having multiple roleplays with the same premise going at the same time. Otherwise, I'm extremely flexible and am comfortable with pretty much anything else. I don't care what gender you play (female, male, trans, whatever). It isn't really relevant to the plot. \n\nI may not respond until the morning (I'm ADT (UTC-3) and it's late here). My schedule can get crazy and there might be days where I don't respond (these are normally rare and bunched together). When I do respond, I normally respond multiple times a day, especially on weekends. Thank you for reading! Message me for my Discord tag.",

The low rumble of the patrons' voices blending together, too low to make out any actual words, and adding another layer to the muted music in the background. The barkeeper, a portly man with thinning hair and an easy smile, wiped at a spill of foam and beer that marked the well cared for slab of oak that served as the bar top.\n\nThe patrons were as many and varied as the lives they lived and the jobs they worked. However they were all drawn to The Hanging Man by their one similarity. In a booth a great hairy man with cunning, yellow eyes and a wolfs shadow grinned a predatory smile and laughed with a beautiful Greek woman whose hair twitched and writhed as though it was alive; A collection of small, hairy men clustered at one end of the bar as two of them gesticulated wildly amid much laughter and drinking; a young woman in a nurses uniform looked out over the rim of her pint with ancient eyes; Around a table a man with a greenish complexion and leaves in his hair and beard peered out from under his hood as a grey haired man with a wide brimmed blue hat and an eye-patch over one of his eyes spoke to an Indian woman with faintly blue skin, fire in her eyes, blood red lips and a necklace strung with beads carved to look like human heads.\n\nThe heavy oak door squeaked as it opened, announcing the newcomer before the bell that hung above the entrance.\n\n---\n\nI'm looking for some sort of urban fantasy setting, sort of American Gods or Fables style.

I have a few characters, and I'd love to do an OC with canon characters, but I could also do a completely new OC adventure, provided that it's a very interesting plot.\n\nMy ideas include:\n\n-Jo'Ziah Giovanna, an OC. The son of Giorno Giovanna, the don of the mafia. Optional AU where no one dies. I'd like angst (maybe Giorno and Jo'Ziah have a Jotaro/Jolyne kind of relationship), or the exact opposite! (Dad Giorno being a dad). I understand characters that are relatives of canon characters are usually cringy, and I'm willing to take the risk\n\n-I have a couple other OCs with less developed ideas, that we can just run wild with. I dont have any specific ideas, but I'd like to focus on part 4 or 5 characters, or maybe even part 7!\n\nThe only desires I have from you is a flexible schedule and GOOD grammar. If interested, comment below, and I'll PM you my discord!",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. My top favorite characters will be in italics. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are *Dany*, Margaery, *Sansa*, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: *Mary Jane Watson*, Black Cat, *She-Hulk*, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, *Scarlet Witch*, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, *Captain Marvel*, *Black Widow*, The Wasp, *Mystique* and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: *Batgirl*, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, *Wonder Woman*. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, *Vetra*, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, *Rey*, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: *Sonya*, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, *Cassie*, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. As well as a few other non-fandom ideas I have. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

Please please know grammar and the English language. It's okay to make mistakes! But I'm sure you know what I mean. \n\nI pretty much only do OCs, and I already have a character drawn out. I'm more than willing to work something else out! Here are the fandoms/plots I do:\n\n- Star Wars (any era)\n- My Hero Academia style\n- Crime/Law Enforcement\n- Royalty/very light fantasy\n- Slice of Life\n\n\nI do ask that my partners be 18+, and any NSFW to be between two 18+ OCs! \n\nI do only use Discord\n\nI am very adventurous and flexible! If you have a plot that's not listed but want to do, please let me know! Who knows, maybe it'll turn out great! \n\nThank you all for your time and I hope to hear from you soon!

I would like to create a plot and lore which we can all agree on and take part in creating. My idea for this world is something similar to the world of Castlevania. If you are not familiar with the series, basically a world split between realms of monsters and demons and various human kingdoms. \n\nMy idea is for a diverse world-building rp. People could take on roles of their choosing whether that\u2019s a human civilian, a vampire hunter, a king/Queen, a ruler over the demon realms, etc. My plan is for this to be a detailed literate rp with some possible NSFW themes. You can expect there to be some intense gore and violence from time to time. \n\nPlease only contact me if you are 18+. I must warn that I am fairly new to discord and have no experience in running a server, so I\u2019d need help from others in running it. Please DM me if you are interested. Thank you for taking the time to read, and I look forward to hearing back from some of you.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello Everyone,\n\nI posted here a few months ago and was able to find several great partners, however over time a few have dropped off for one reason or another, and I'm finding myself wanting to write a bit more, especially when I can during usual business hours.\n\nLooking for an 18+ female to partner with for just about anything. A few (several) bullet points::\n\n\\*I typically para to multi-para, with my usual post length being at least three paragraphs. So long as we're having fun and advancing the story, we can shorten/lengthen that, though I'll probably conform to your style/the flow of our RP.\n\n\\*I have a life and will be busier at some points, and more free in others. I can promise several posts a week (sometimes in a day), but there will probably be days or spans of days when I can't reply. RP is more of a guilty pleasure and a hobby - significant others, family, work, etc will take precedence. Please respect that.\n\n\\*I play over Reddit chat/PM, e-mail, and Discord. I'd say my preferred method is over email with Reddit/Discord for chat, but I'm flexible.\n\n\\*I don't want to spend hours planning the RP. If you have something you want to play out, lets create a rough shell and then just start posting and figure things out as they come. If things are clicking after 10+ posts and we're both feeling it then maybe we can shell out some longer term goals/plans, get some pictures involved, etc. I wouldn't even be mad if you messaged me IC - I'd just pick up from where you left off (those old Yahoo chatroom days coming through).\n\n\\*I'm very open to what we RP. Straight smut, adventure, play out some fantasy of yours, canon... you name it.\n\n\\*As far as genre I'm also very open. I'd say my favorite is probably medieval/medieval-vampire - we both show up in a tavern and slowly take notice of each other, end up with a few drinks and a chat, which leads upstairs... Modern, future, western, viking, fandom, post-apoc, your world.. I'm just looking to have some fun writing.\n\n\\*If fandoms/preset canon is your cup of tea, a few of my favorite/most well versed are:: Witcher, Destiny, Warcraft, Wheel of Time, Game of Thrones, Malazan Book of the Fallen, Diablo, Harry Potter, Marvel, Peaky Blinders... to name a few.\n\nThanks everyone for your time! PM me if you're interested and we'll see what happens!",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm a male looking for a long term RP partner. I've RP'd for about 4 years now. I'd prefer my partner to be fairly literate. While it's not required, it'd be nice if you could reply fairly frequently. But I totally understand if you can't, as I might not respond immediately sometimes. Also I would also very much prefer it if we could RP on discord as I'm on there a lot. And if you're interested in my idea then please PM me!  \nAlso while this doesn't have to be in the RP, I'm fine with romance and stuff. Anyway moving onto the idea itself!  \n\n\nSo the main idea I have is this:  \nA strange meteor ends up falling from space and lands on Earth. After the meteor lands, a very large amount of the population. about 70 percent, their bodies start to feel almost a bit different for a couple of days. Some may experience worse symptoms than others. However after those couple of days pass, the sicknesses and symptoms that appeared during this event would vanish just as quickly as they came. Which then the world would soon return to normal... For a short while anyway. Not too long after the symptoms vanished, very few people might find that they have increased physical abilities and or even some sort of superpower. (The idea for the superpower itself is that it would really based around one specific thing to start out with, however multiple skills could stem from it.) Regardless by what seems like fate some of the people that gain these powers soon meet. However some that were effected might use the powers for their own desires. So it's up to the heroes of the story to take the villains down, or at the very least try and survive any sort of encounter with the enemies.   \n\n\nI do also want to mention that the initial amount of people that would be actually effected would be extremely low. Like maybe 10-30. It definitely would be a very small amount of humans.   \nAlso the Sci-Fi bit I mentioned in the title, it's not required but it could definitely give more ideas. Though I don't have too many ideas on how to incorporate it. Possibly the reason why the meteor hit was due to some sort of alien or something. Regardless, if we were to get some sort of Sci-Fi stuff involved it could make for some pretty interesting ideas later on. Especially with like space travel and different planets. \n\n  \nAnyway that's it I guess! So I hope to talk to you later!",

I'm also only interested in someone willing/able to roleplay via email, and prefer someone who uses hangouts so we can chat OOC between posts. I average 1-2 posts a day if we're not on the same schedule. If we're both around at the same time I can manage far more than that. My average post ranges from 3 detailed, lengthy paragraphs to a thousand or more words, depending entirely on my partner and the scene in question. I only write 3rd person, past tense and you must do the same. Your grammar must be decent. I don't mind the occasional typo, but if I read through a post and don't understand what you're saying at all, I'm probably not going to be interested in writing with you.\n\nAll that out of the way, I promise I'm not super picky and most want to find a partner I can connect with both as another writer and as someone I can share creative endeavors with. Bonus points if you're someone I can talk books, shows, video games, movies, etc with!\n\nNow for the fun stuff...\n\nI am very open to the type of game we do. I'm a big fan of contemporary fantasy, **modern mythology** (American Gods, that kind of thing), high fantasy, low medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, slice of life, and numerous other types of stories (I do NOT like sci fi). I tend to prefer to add a healthy portion of grim dark to all of these settings. I do enjoy adding NSFW in to my stories when and where it makes sense, but I do not like them to dominate the story. Please message me if you have ideas, even if it's just the start of an idea and you want to plan something together.\n\nBig bonuses if you play your character as the more type-A and aggressive personality type.",

            "selftext": "I typically don\u2019t do Fandom roleplays because it can be difficult portraying certain cannon characters but lately I\u2019ve been craving a few MCU pairings (With the exception of one DC couple).Although romance will be a heavy theme in all of the pairings listed below,I\u2019d love to come up with an actual plot together. Also, there will be NSFW scenes so if you\u2019re not 18+ or are uncomfortable then I do apologize. \n\nAlthough I can write many paragraphs,I ask that you be able to write at least 1 or 2 with enough detail to paint a vivid picture. I don\u2019t like rushed responses so take however long you need to construct a quality response :)\n\nWhat Im Looking For:\n\nScarlet Witch x Vision\n\nBlack Widow x Hulk\n\nMy OC x Venom\n\nMy OC x Dr. Strange\n\nVanessa Carlysle x Wade Wilson \n\nHarley Quinn x Joker\u2014(Maaaybe)\n\nBecause my comic knowledge is poor,the rp will most likely take place either in an alternate universe or a time period after the events listed in the comics/movies. I want to make it clear that I\u2019m not looking for a NSFW based rp (unless it\u2019s Deadpool because honestly that\u2019s NSFL).  I\u2019d love to build a plot and see some of their powers/abilities put to use. \n\nIf any of the pairings interest you,you can write in 3rd person,and use discord\u2014PM me and we can get something started!

I partook in a few groups and more 1x1s before things slowed down and my interest in the site dropped. I do miss writing and creating characters and worlds and would be very much interested in doing it again with the right partner/s.\n\nGlee isn't something I'd currently want to write for again, but if that's your thing I can definitely be coerced. I guess I'm not even sure what I'm looking for. I know I want to write and build a world, but that's about it. I still have a tumblr that has prompts that could be one-shots or developed into something more fleshed out. I love plotting and planning, so it would be really nice if you were down for that too. I have a preference for fluff/romance, so that's probably always going to be the endgame for whatever is written.\n\nHarry Potter is probably the only other fandom I can think of off the top of my head that I would love to create a world in. Or, copy the plot of 'To All the Boys I Loved Before'. It's a movie on Netflix and I just finished reading the second book today, so I'm full of feels!\n\nI can roleplay on discord or email or even here on reddit.",

If you can't play hard at least from 7am - 4p in my time frame weekends and weekdays, DO NOT ANSWER!\n\n\nCommunication about times that you can't play and an expected time of return is a MUST!...Not just leaving me wondering. I will do the same. Everything is optional, adjustable, ghosting without at least saying why is rude! I always try to work out any issues. If my partner has a problem with something I am willing to adjust things. \nAs for story...I am flexible, I world build as we play more and more. Play multiple characters for random things and cast. \n\nI am not fond of magic, celebrities or established universes that I am not really familiar enough with to know the lore. I would rather create a world with my partner. \n\nI usually try to build my characters and the world around my partner. You only have to play one, but the story we play will still feel like it has people in it. Not having to wait for other people that always have trouble playing a story once it gets going.\n\nI can get into most anything. NSFW elements, I like humor, romance and action. Shooting, looting...Bad guys....Surviving or just slice of life type things with some mystery or intrigue.\n\nIf you are someone like me that has a lot of long lonely days that could use a good story to make the imagination run wild...Let's talk, set something up.",

            "selftext": "Hello!  I'm Doe and I'm looking for partners  that are at least 21+ as that's  my age range. Mature themes will be in  my plots though limits will be   discussed. write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+  words). I   love to write detailed  descriptions and delve into a  character\u2019s  head/emotions as well as  surroundings. I compare it to  writing a novel  together.\n\nI understand if the scene  doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having   long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the     world.  I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the  plot and  writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100%   dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight  of my  day.\n\nI'm    a big fan of romance  and using  face claims. I\u2019m the type to make  pinterest boards, spam  you with gifs,  headcanons, and send you songs   that remind me of our  characters and/or  ship. I'll get excited if we   come up with a great plot idea or if our  characters are being cute or  going to get into  trouble. I live for this  kind of stuff honestly.\n\nLast  but not least I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy   to write  side characters of either gender to help move the  story   along.  I'd  prefer female authors writing male characters but male  writers are  fine  too.\n\nDesperately Searching For\n\n* 21+ partners\n*  For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation,   spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and out of character.  (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for   newbies). \n* Plot  before smut. While mature themes will be in my plots, and are  even  encouraged, there needs  to be a good chemistry between our characters. I   like to have a good  mix of plot and smut, along with   doses of angst  and  fluff.\n* For  you to write as an older male. I'm a sucker for  the gruff and tough  men who secretly have a soft heart. I also love  those grumpy,  hypermasculine men being intimidated by darling, soft yet commanding,   and pretty   women.\n* The  more  description, the better!  I'm looking for someone can write as  much as  me (2 to 4 paragraphs or  more) and really bring the story to  life. I lose interest if I'm the  only one that's invested/enthusiastic  or  coming up with plot ideas.\n* The  use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of  ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be    delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime  faces, only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n* Someone  who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first  post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been  greatly   saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nI   love all types of genres,  but especially  urban fantasy and science   fiction. Lately I\u2019ve been wanting something  based off The X Files   and/or Red Dead Redemption.   All my characters will  be adults and I   require my partners do the same.\n\nFor plot ideas, message me  \\^\\^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and  possibly writing. Please be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from  you!",

            "selftext": "The first snowfall of the season was quite a strong one, covering the frozen forest with a layer of white fluff. Sparkling flurries fell faster as the winds picked up. For the most part, the forest was empty... except for a man trudging through the nasty winter storm.\n\nLindo, the soldier sent to start the fight against an unknown evil was caught in the thick of the storm in the forest. His metal armor clashed and clanged with creeks here and there as it began to freeze over. His breathing became sharp as he took his two last steps before falling to his knees, the armor on the verge of being frozen solid from the hours of walking through the snowstorm. \n\n\"Is this why they sent me... to get rid of me? I'll just be another soldier lost in his travels.\" He told himself as he felt the frostbite eat away at his tips, the rest of the body to follow. \n\n\"I cant... I mustn't...\" In a last attempt to find a place for refuge during the storm, he reached back with his weak hands and pulled his sword out. He stabbed it into the ground to pull himself up with the support he had. Even with his optimism, it would take a miracle to save him from the storm, as the suit had begun to freeze over completely and the frost was reaching and creeping onto his skin.\n\n_______________\n\nHey everyone, Chris here!\n\nI was thinking I write up a little prompt based of a Fantasy setting and a snowfall (Mainly because it just snowed where i am right now and its the middle of March). I then made it a little crazy with my character, the [handsome elven soldier named Lindo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/c2/bf/41c2bf0a43091843967f9e6092fe15ca.png) being close to death. \n\nSomehow someway, a beauty will come and save him. Is it a simple traveler that is better equiped for the cold? A guardian of the forest that sees Lindo and rushes to help him? Or maybe a mage that is able to heat the two of them up enough before getting to a cave? The choice is yours and we can definately discuss it if you have more ideas.\n\nId love for this RP to be a nice mix between a burning romance and an action adventure story against this unknown evil. The frozen forest is just where we will start and we can definately discuss what this evil is, be it a creeping infection/ corruption of the Land or a Dark Lord Emerging.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in incorporating some NSFW or smut into our RP with the romance. It wouldnt just be for the sake of doing it but it would make sense with the tension building and stuff.\n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red or orange envalope and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! And as always, all my other prompts are open to RPing too so you can just go through my post history! Thanks for reading!\n\n-Chris",

Before I get into what I'm searching for, I want to give some facts about about myself, because I think everyone deserves a bit of information from the person they're going to be talking to. Not too personal of course.\n\n-- I've been writing for a total of twelve years now, and roleplaying on Kik Messenger for eight years. I\u2019m definitely willing to expand my vocabulary however, and to improve!\n\n-- I am nineteen years old, but I can be as professional or as laid back as needed.\n\n-- My timezone is PST, plus I am a full-time college student, so I might have delayed responses depending on where you live.\n\n-- If you'd like to know anything else about me, (that\u2019s within reason) feel free to ask me when you message me!\n\n\n\nOnto what I'm looking for both from Canon Character users and OC/Original Character users. If you want to discuss other options for scenarios, such as me playing as an actual Canon Character, please do! I\u2019m very open-minded and imaginative!\n\nAlso, all characters I\u2019m requesting are, or will be as of our story, over 18 years of age. Preferably 21.\n\nBelow in the prompts, you'll see that I put \"MC\" instead of my character's name.\n\n-The Canon Anime and Video Game characters of main interest are:\n\n-Final Fantasy XV [The Chocobros and/or Arden] (Prompt: MC finds a portal that leads out of her own dimension and into a different. Curious after a large monster comes out of it, she decides to find the cause of the disturbance in time and space, sending her into her final fantasy.)\n\n-Final Fantasy XIV [Your WoL/Warrior of Light, Zenos, Nero, Lord Hien, Leofard, Haurchefaunt, Sir Aymeric, Estinien, Estinien Possessed By Nidhogg, other members of the empire.] (Prompt can be discussed in PM or Kik.)\n\n-Kingdom Hearts [Terra, Axel, Xemnas, Terranort, Roxas, Riku, or Vanitas] (Prompt: When accidentally opening a door that she was blatantly told not to during an important mission, MC finds herself on a strange island after a blinding light came from the open door. She had no idea what the door did, but it wasn't there when she looked behind herself. And she had now idea how to get back...)\n\n-[Persona 4: Tohru Adachi:] (My character finds herself in Inaba after escaping a town a ways away (could be Tokyo or another rural town), and Tohru Adachi finds her. The Accomplice route will be mandatory for this storyline. How he reacts to finding out that my character isn\u2019t human is up to you.)\n\n-[Persona 4: Yu Narukami/Souji Seta:] (When coming to Inaba, my character decides to find a home to \u201ctemporarily\u201d stay in, and finds Yu/Souji\u2019s home after being run out in a few. Yu finds her, and what follows can be discussed in PM.)\n\n-[Persona 5: Akira/Ren:] (Since I already have a background story for My Character\u2019s P5 version, I believe she should be found in Mementos. Where she is found in Mementos and during what time in the P5 story depends on you.)\n\n-[Persona 5: Goro Akechi:] (This route could go the same way of Adachi, however, not much is known about his normal life aside from him getting ordered around by Shido. My Character could possibly find him in Mementos, or in one of the victims\u2019 palaces.)\n\n-Boku no Hero Academia [Kacchan, Todoroki, or Izuku]  (Prompt: About 25 years had passed since MC's story (which won't be stated but, just know she already has a story made), and after thousands of odd cases popping up with children having unique and inhuman abilities, MC had traveled to Japan as a normal monthly occurrence. But when she did this time, a villain had decided to arrived and try to take her body over. Accidentally triggering her inner daemon to come out in front of others which made her look like a villain as well. Being the man who is always on time, All Might arrives and questions MC before taking her to the police station for more in-detail questioning. After finding out that she isn\u2019t actually a villain but one in neutral standing, and sees what power she has, he asks her to attend U.A to see what the heroes have to offer. That\u2019s where our story begins.)\n\n-Owari no Seraph [Mikaela or Yuu] (Prompt: After an outbreak had nearly destroyed humans on earth, MC woke from a rather long, five year slumber. Only to find that her forest had been completely destroyed by ice and hideous creatures called: The Horsemen Of John. Coincidentally, vampires find her outside her now ruined home and take the demon to their home, wanting to know why the creature was in the middle of no-where and why her blood smelt more delicious than the finest human...)\n\n-Tokyo Ghoul [Kaneki Ken] (Prompt: MC has finally gotten a chance to travel away from her home land to vacation in Japan. Choosing Tokyo as the best option, she rather enjoys her time there with the many delicious foods and courteous citizens that helped her find her way around the areas like Shinjuku, Harajuku, Asakusa, and the various areas around. However... Upon finding some \u2018creature\u2019 eating a human within an alleyway, MC immediately realizes that this was probably the worst decision of her life, and with the creature turning it\u2019s gaze to her, she hoped there was a chance of escaping.)\n\n-Blue Exorcist [Rin Okumura] (Prompt: MC had just gotten a call from Mephisto from Japan while all the way North East in Canada. Apparently, she's up to no good yet again, so MC didn't have a choice in the matter other than to travel straight to Tokyo. Only to find that the Devil's son, her mortal enemy, is there.)\n\n-Deadman Wonderland [Crow or any OCs would be great for this] (Prompt: After being accused for a crime she hadn't done, and getting humiliated publicly, MC was thrown into a type of amusement park for psychos. Instead of any normal prison, these prisoners had to entertain people that attended the carnival and attractions by properly getting through the traps and courses. Without dying. And to keep themselves from dying, they had to get some type of bitter-tasting candies and survive their sentences. Her sentence wasn't the only thing she had to worry about however, as there was more to fear underground.)\n\n-For OC users, my base plots of this post are currently Omegaverse/ABO.\n\n\nPlease discuss prompts with me in private! I have many ideas, however, they might not be agreeable so I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts and input, please and thank you! (Ideas that I have in mind will be sent in PM.)\n\nThat aside, I plan on writing as my main character, who is a Hybrid species, so you\u2019ll get their information from a link and references. In depth information will be sent when requested for advanced themes. :)\n\nHopefully I\u2019ll get some interest in this, but thank you in advance for taking the time to read! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "Hey, there! I'm currently rewatching the A Team and I'm really craving a few pairings from both the show and the movie. I'd love to do a Face x Amy (show) or Face x Murdock rp (show &amp; movie) but I'd also be willing to do Face x Hannibal (both show or movie) or Face x OC. The roleplay doesn't have to include romantic elements although I'd prefer that. I also really want there to be some action and adventure (and of course drama!) in the roleplay so things stay interesting.\n\nI'm a literate roleplayer with a few years of writing experience and I would like my roleplay partner to at least be semi-literate. I'm in my early twenties so I'm okay with doing mature themes but I expect you to be 18+ for that.\n\nI usually roleplay over Tumblr or e-mail but I'm okay with using reddit too. If you're interested in writing with me, feel free to comment or send me a PM. \n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you!",

Going through a pretty stressed out time in my personal life, so I'm very overeager to find someone to write with. Aka, if you like your partners responding fairly quick, I'm your gal. Saying that, I do Discord only so either PM me your Discord ID or ask for mine after we discuss some general plots. I love to just chat with partners too, plot out a lot of details and just generally.. I want a good personality match (and preferably 25+ too) more than a fantastic writer. So don't worry about how new/old you are at this.\n\nSaying that, a few general topics I like:\nSuperheroes - Holly Black's Faeries - Voltron (Keith/Lance) - Arranged marriage - Circus - BJDs - Androids/Chobits - Harvest Moon - Pokemon - Slice of Life - Magical Boys\n(Allllll pairings considered.)\n\nThe more questionable are better saved for PMs.\n\nGenerally, I'm looking for themes of fantasy that can be a giant ball of romantic fluff, but deeper, is a cesspool of drama. Something so blissful at times, but heart wrenching at others. You know, like how life isn't all rainbows and sunshine. Good and bad. Power dynamics; right and wrong.\n\nAnywho, reach out if you're looking for someone who is pretty available for consistent posting and needs a huge distraction! Thank you~",

            "selftext": "Decades ago, there was an elven woman named Nythim who discovered a dark god which her ancestors tried to hide. She learned the incantations, gained its forbidden power, and soon became a force so potent that her kingdom did not want her there, and she hid herself away in the astral plane, never to be seen again. \n\nBut she left something behind. A small book, to be placed where the curious may find it...in the catacombs of a human castle. The castle you're in, as a matter of fact. And when the incantation in it is said, Nythim will reappear. No, she does not wish for a sacrifice or a ritual ingredients. She's just looking for a friend...or something more.\n\n---\n\nHello! I'm Ward, and this is a fantasy-based romance roleplay. It's set in a world that I'm still (mostly) building so bear with me. Before responding to this post, think about what kind of person you want your character to be; what role they have in the castle. Are they a servant? Are they a guard, perhaps?\n\nNow, as for the roleplay's contents itself, I want it to be a fairly slow romance. Lots of cuddling, maybe, but anything more won't happen until later. I want Nythim to become the person your character goes to when they need comfort, and her own little customized plane to become your second home.\n\nAlso as a side note, two assumptions we're making here is that 1) relationships between humans and elves are NOT condemned, and 2)not all magic is condemned, only the type Nythim uses.\n\nI'd prefer at least semi-lit for my partner. One-liners are fine, but only on occaision. \n\nPM me for any more questions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If you\u2019re not comfortable with any of this, I wouldn\u2019t recommend reading on from here. \n\nTopics would include things such as self harm, suicide attempts, depression, etc etc. \n\nThe scenarios we could come up with are endless, and I\u2019m down for pretty much anything. I would prefer a college/university based setting, but I\u2019m open to other ideas. \n\nOne idea could be a big, tough boy with anger issues and depression comes together with a girl suffering from anxiety and a history of self harm, maybe even suicide attempts. \n\nAnother could be the opposite. A girl who\u2019s not afraid to kick peoples shit in with a socially anxious boy. \n\nI\u2019m open to other ideas too, as mentioned earlier! I would like this to have a nsfw side, but that\u2019s optional. \n\nI would also prefer to rp on discord. \n\nI hope to hear from you soon! ",
