            "selftext": "Hello my fellow adventurers ! If you\u2019re reading this , I\u2019m glad ! I\u2019m going to start off by telling you this post will be rather lengthy. It holds a lot of information and design for the roleplay I\u2019ve created and I want you to know there\u2019s a good little bit for this intro ! \n\nThat being said , I\u2019m a big fantasy role player . I first role played back in servers on Warcraft 3 . I was a big fan back then, and just \u2018grew up\u2019 on my roleplays being fantasy based . This type of fantasy being like Skyrim/Warcraft/D&amp;D with a bunch of magic and castles and mythical creatures etc. I\u2019ve been able to roleplay a bit with people on here and it\u2019s been good ! However, roleplaying based of fandoms and other ideas has kinda brick walled me. I like being able to create stuff my own and get my juices flowing from start to finish . I\u2019m looking for someone *with that exact mindset* . If you\u2019d like to world build off of my main idea, then you\u2019re the type of person I\u2019m looking for . Now, I\u2019ve never done a roleplay that consists of more than 1x1 , and this idea of mine could certainly consist of more people . I\u2019m open to the idea and if some people would be interested in that let me know and we can work on it . Now enough rambling ! Below here i will post my \u2018starter\u2019 to the roleplay . My bread and butter . Under that i will outline a few pointers i feel necessary . See ya there ! \n\nOur adventure begins in the country of Retingale. A rather big country, with numerous kingdoms laid out across its rather defined landscape. More importantly however, we begin in the  beautiful and bustling city of Yasenwick . A giant kingdom with people aplenty . Markets line the busy streets. Blacksmiths that rank from new to elite. It\u2019s in the middle of Retingale, making it a perfect trading city. This allows them to have a sleuth of items and foods available to the populace. More importantly however, it makes it a perfect city for starting adventurers. The guildhall there is always full of energetic adventurers and bountiful of quests . In this world, people are born with an affinity with a certain magic type. Water, Light, Earth, Demon , you name it . With this affiliation, they grow up deciding on a class they would like to be. Your magic plays a huge role in your class selection, but doesn\u2019t force you into a class . For example, a Light affiliated person would make a great Paladin; that being said they can still be any class. A Light Assassin? You got it. A Demon Paladin? You bet your mead and cheese. Once the person has grown to a certain extent and honed their class type, they start to visit guild halls. Guild halls help give adventurers some guidance. They provide a variety of quests to adventurers, as well as starter items and a place to eat ! How cool? Quests range from hunting down goblins to taking down Undead Dragons. Quests reward things like gold and experience . They can also reward special items of a wide variety. Some quests are put up by people, the difficulty of these vary immensely. Other quests, however, are put up by the guild hall . These quests are called Urgent Quests, due to them being (you guessed it) in need of urgent help . This could be a goblin horde that\u2019s been terrorizing a village . Some could be a Dread Knight that\u2019s taken over a city . Either way, they are the most important and in return offer the best rewards . Adventurers are always checking for those hourly. Lastly for quests, most have a level requirement . That\u2019s so a Lvl 5 adventurer doesn\u2019t take on a squad of Worgens by himself . This is where we begin. Vren\u2019Gul is a low ranking Mage/Necromancer (necromancy is shunned by most, Mage is a simpler title while not fully correct) that affiliates in....... Surprise! Dark magic . He\u2019s only level 2 , but has a strong talent for his abilities. However, being a Dark Necromancer has him fumbling to find a adventuring companion. In this world, unless you\u2019re just a super strong warrior or god tier Mage solo adventuring is rather hard. Seeing as most people wouldn\u2019t want a Necromancer to \u2018defile\u2019 their group, solo adventuring has been all he could get . It\u2019s taken him a whole month to level up 1 time . However, his troubles are subsided when one day he comes across this _________ girl in the guild..............\n \nWhew, glad you made it past all that adventurer ! A few things I\u2019d like to address here . \n\n*Your class and magic affiliation are completely up to your imagination. As long as it\u2019s nothing *completely* absurd . \n\n*I\u2019d like our characters to stay common races like Human, Elf, Dwarf. It limits creativity a bit , but I want to keep that part simple in the world . \n\n*NSFW or romance things are completely fine with me ! However, there has to be some good ground building before any of that please . \n\n*This is a roleplay of *my* design , but it\u2019s a roleplay for each part involved and i want it to feel that way. I want you to help with the story, the quests , anything you feel like . Let\u2019s bounce ideas off each other and make something *magical. Get it?* \n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far , i appreciate it but why not make it a little farther and message this weary adventurer . Hoping to see you in the tavern with a full glass of mead in hand adventurer ! ",

You can call me Yiohana, Yio, Hana, etc. I'm currently looking for role play partners over discord. \n\nA little about me:\n\n* I'm a 26 female.\n* I'm role played for about 7-9 years. \n* I'm a huge nerd for Kingdom Hearts/Final Fantasy (Only played FF10, 10-2, 12, 13 trilogy, and currently the mmo of 14. Played all the KH games). Extra brownie points if you are as well.\\~\n* I love dark/angst themes. Give them all to me!\n* I love crossovers of fandoms. I love some wacky plots that come with it. Makes it more fun!\n* i don't do well with NSFW elements, so I'd like to keep it at SFW.\n* I don't do well with playing canon characters.\n* I can double up on characters if the plot needs it!\n* I only write in English. Sorry!\n\nCharacters I usually play:\n\n* I usually play my OC (original character) that I've created through Final Fantasy 14. I can only always make an original to fit an rp otherwise! No big issues there.\n* The OCs I usually play are mute, but open to changing them up a bit to fit anything.\n* If it came down to crossovers, I'd have to discuss the plotline(s) associated with it, because of how I view my FF14 OC.\n* I usually play females, but can try males. Just not great at it.\n\nJust some basic requirements:\n\n* Must have a grasp on grammar (your/you're as an example). I know not everyone is perfect, but that's fine! I just want my partner(s) to be able to understand me and vice versa.\n* Give me enough material to work with. It's not fun having so little of a reply to try and work off of. Just give me details to work with, so I can make a proper reply. I'll try to match your length, but I usually tend go overboard. \n* Within 4-5 hour difference of EST/EDT. It's hard to rp with someone that's like 7+ hours apart from me.\n* 18+ please! \n* Please keep open communication with me! If you don't like the rp(s) we're doing anymore, let me know! Or if something isn't going well within the plot, let me know! I like to keep ourselves on the same page. :)\n\nThings I'd be wanting to rp, but open to ideas:\n\n* Fantasy: Adventure, magic, action, kingdoms, wars, you name it!\n* Crossovers of Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy, etc. If there's any fandoms you're willing to do crossovers with, let me know! So if you have a better understanding of the suggestion, and if I have no idea, you'll have to fill me in on it. I'm open to most fandoms out there. Just work with me.\n* Supernatural/suspense themes. \n* Slice of life with a side of comedy/action. Maybe in a modern world with fantasy elements!\n* Always open for a lot of angst/drama filled rps. Bring 'em up here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any questions, PM me. Looking forward to hearing from anyone! :)",

I\u2018m also open to add drama and other things that might make it more interesting. After all, I am not expecting to add NSFW related activity into that roleplay but if you want to do that, neither am I reluctant to add it in somehow. I just want to make sure that I\u2018m not a perv seeking for NSFW-only roleplays. I\u2018m more interested in building a world and a good story.\n\nI roleplay in third person, at least a paragraph and more. I don\u2019t expect novels but at least something to work with but we can discuss this later if you decide to dm me :)\n\nI\u2018d be happy to meet interesting new people who share the same interest in such a plot.\n\nI have discord, kik and might get any other messenger you prefer to rp with.

The few space rocks it contains are a good source of minerals, the solitary gas giant providing other raw materials. It has been around for centuries and pretty much runs itself, its technological secrets lost to time and mostly beyond comprehension of its current inhabitants.\n\nIt's one of the few truly neutral territories in the galaxy. It has the power to vaporize entire fleets of spacecraft, but this power cannot and will not be moved out of the system it sits in. Thus, it became a safe haven for refugees, war-weary veterans, scientists, scholars and artists. It is peaceful, orderly, an oasis in a galaxy filled with conflict.\n\nIn one of its many small cafes, a woman sits by the window, her gaze occasionally drifting to the gardens and promenade outside. She's a recent arrival, her clothes make that clear. Her hands are wrapped around a mug of steaming hot coffee, her head nodding slowly along to the music, a slight, mysterious smile on her lips. For the first time in her adult life, she is enjoying an actual vacation.\n\n*Slice of life on a space station? Sort of. This is a very open long-term prompt that could go in multiple directions. Some are pure fluff, some contain a little intrigue or even action, but the general idea is very much a feelgood sort of RP without angst. This one is for those who need a vacation but can't look forward to one anytime soon. Details in PM. &lt;3*",

            "selftext": "Before we start: **The night is dark, and full of spoilers.** If you are not caught up to the current events in *Game of Thrones* or *A Song of Ice and Fire*, some key plot points about a major character will be ruined for you. Go read and watch everything first. It's too good to have some bloke spoil everything for you on a Roleplay forum. \n\n---\n\nThis story takes place in Westeros, that one beautiful continent we all know and love. And if we know anything at all about Westeros, it's that it's not a happy place. People die. A lot. And so will our characters. There's not much we can do about that, because the events of this story happened seventeen years before the start of the series. They're set in stone. They led up to what we know as the Fall of the Targaryen Dynasty, and the beginning of the Storm Lord's reign as King Robert Baratheon, First of His Name. His rebellion succeeded in overthrowing the Mad King Aerys II, whose fondness of 'burning them all' was getting a little out of hand. We know the stories. The songs. And we know of the horrors, the atrocities people commit in the name of war. We know why Robert picked up his hammer and smashed it into the ruby-studded chestplate of Prince Rhaegar at the Trident. \n\nRobert Baratheon was a proud man, who would indeed start wars over his wounded ego and later tell those who would listen that his intentions were noble. That his intended was kidnapped and raped to death by the Dragon, or that he sought to put an end to the reign of the Mad King that plunged the Realm into chaos. At the end of the day, who wouldn't want to be King? Who wouldn't want to sit on a throne and make his word the law? Who wouldn't want to drink the best wines, feast on the best foods, and bed the most beautiful maidens in the Kingdom, while leaving men of lesser importance to deal with the repercussions? \n\nLittle is known about Ser Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, and the year he spent with the Lady Lyanna of house Stark. Rumors, yes, there are enough. How he became infatuated with her at the Tourney of Harrenhal in the Year of the False Spring. Obsessed, even. How he passed over his own wife to crown Lyanna Stark the Queen of Love and Beauty after his jousting victory against Ser Barristan Selmy, as a way of insulting the North. To slight the Storm Lord. How he whisked her away in the Riverlands a year later, raped her countless times, and left her for dead to fight the battle at the Trident. But history is written by the victors, and as current events unfold, we learn more about the other side of the story, the side that was buried with the Dragon Prince and his Northern lover.\n\nThis is that story. The story of a man smitten by a Northern girl, not by her outstanding beauty but by her spirit and her heart. A man burdened by his own destiny, who sees in her the passion for life stolen from him by his birthright. This is the story of a young woman who laments her fate to be married to a Southern lord, one infamous for his drinking and his infidelity. A woman who refused to spend her days in a foreign castle at the behest of men who paid no mind to what her own heart desired. About their fated meeting, so blissful in their ignorance of what it would unleash. The bond they forged under the sigil of a Laughing Tree, and a promise disguised as a crown of winter roses. This is the story of the dragon that loved the wolf more than the sun, and the wolf that loved the dragon more than the stag. \n\nThis is the Song of Ice and Fire. \n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** Rhaegar Targaryen. Lyanna Stark. Love story. They die at the end, then *Game of Thrones* happens. Write with me?",

            "selftext": "Hello, my name is Kit! I'm 27, and I've been RPing casually for about 15 years now. It's been a few months since I've had a good RP and I'm itching to get back into it! :)\n\nI do work a full-time job, however I have consistent hours and I'm always on at around the same times every day. Usually, I'm available all day Sunday, and Monday through Thursday after about 6 PM EST and until 10 or 11 PM. I'm perfectly fine with throwing replies back and forth whenever we get a chance, but I truly love when we're both actively online and replying at the same time.\n\nWhile I am an experienced RPer, I tend to tread more on the casual side of things. I only ask that replies be one to two paragraphs at least. More is welcome, however I prefer quality over quantity. Similarly, I won't crucify you for the occasional spelling or punctuation errors, as long as your grammar is up to snuff and I'm able to understand what you're meaning. (I've had many partners in the past with severe dyslexia. If the story and characters are good and I'm engaged, I'm happy. :P)\n\nThat's really all I have for \"rules.\"\nI am open to mature themes however, it needs to be plot relevant. It is not required.\n\nI play mostly adult male characters, though I can play anything. All of my characters can easily be modified to fit into nearly any setting, fandoms included. \n\nWhen it comes to fandoms, I'm happy to play within an established universe, but I don't play canon characters. If you want to play a canon character, you're welcome to, but I prefer OCs.\n\nExamples of some fandoms I'm in:\n\nWarcraft\n\nGuild Wars\n\nDragon Age\n\nAnd more...! (Just ask. I'm unfamiliar with 99.9% of anime. Nothing against it, I just have a hard time sitting through shows.)\n\nI also like anything to do with:\n\nSuperheroes\n\nDinosaurs\n\nMythical creatures\n\nOdd pairings/Forbidden love\n\nArranged marriages\n\nEnemies-to-friends/lovers\n\nThe supernatural\n\nSci-fi\n\nAnd....more...! \n\nSeriously, just ask, I don't bite. I'm a sucker for tropes and clich\u00e9s.\n\nI love to talk, I love to plot and work on character developement OOC. I would prefer a longterm partner who's willing to chat in between posts. (AKA, I'm lonely and I want more RP friends!)\n\nPM me for contact info or to ask any questions! :)\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nNames Anthony (or Fleury), I'm 21 and looking to find someone to help renew a passion of an old hobby of mine. I had a post a while ago (since deleted) and gained a few RP partners. Since then, my partners have stopped responding, become busy, etc. Which is fine, no worries, but it means I'm in need of some new short-term, or hopefully long-term partners. \n\n**With that in mind, here's my idea:**\n\nI want to have this roleplay take place in the *Shadow of the Colossus* world, in specifically the 'forbidden lands' but, from a post *Wander* perspective. If you remember, life began coming back into the world when *Dormin* gave *Wander* his body back, and he was reborn. My thought process would be continuing from that. There are people who may have migrated there, to escape their respective villages. Or since rumors from *Lord Emon's* tribe spread around, that *Wander* brought a loved one back to life. People are wanting to do the same, including my character. But, it would also mean more wildlife, and new colossus!\n\nMy character, (an OC, not anywhere in the universe, spanning over *Ico*, *The Last Guardian*, and *Shadow of the Colossus*.) had recently lost his sister whom he was extremely close to. Since this devastating loss, mixed with the rumors of *Wander* and *Mono*, he set out on his way to repeat this at any cost. I'll give more information on my OC if anyone is interested.\n\nI figured this could be an action and adventure roleplay, that can be short, with nothing but fighting (like the game) or it could be a long-term story, where our mutual characters explore and see new things, and overall bond with each other. I'd leave your reasoning for being in the forbidden lands up to you, maybe you wanted to escape your tribe, or also wanted to bring a loved one back, or maybe even something else. \n\nI will also leave the idea of romance, or *NSFW* content up to you (however I'm not comfortable controlling female characters, or being with non-hetero characters, this offer would be to women or female characters only.) However I will play with anyone! Especially if you love this game like me. \n\n**My Rules/ Preferences/ Suggestions:**\n\n1.) I like to play in 1st person, for immersion. However,, I can type in 3rd person, just let me know what you'd rather..\n\n2.) I'm a night owl, so I'm usually up to 4:00am (it's 12:30am as I'm typing this) and sleep pretty far into the day (2:00 0r 3:00pm.) If that fits with your schedule, that'd be awesome. I figure 4pm to 4am is a pretty big window.\n\n3.) I'm a hopeless romantic at heart, so I think romance, especially in a new and crazy world like this one, could be cool.\n\n4.) Please be AT LEAST semi-literate. I will type as much as my partner, or as match the amount I feel you're trying to contribute to the plot and storyline. MEANING: No text talk. Minimal typos (of course we all mess up, I mean I probably did in this post, haha.) And no one-liners unless the situation calls for it.\n\n5.) I know this story, inside and out, and I know the Colossi even better. So, if you have any questions about the story, let me know! I can teach you, tell you, or fill you in about anything. So, don't be discouraged if you've never played the game and it seems interesting. \n\n6.) I also have a list, right now of 27 Colossi, if you want to see them, since the game only released with 16, just ask and I'll email it. Or I can make it a post on here for you to read.\n\n7.) I prefer to use Discord. But I can work with some other apps or means of talking if you need. \n\n8.) Last but not least, there's always times where you just don't feel very creative, or your mind is in a fog and you just do not want to roleplay. Please be respecting of that if it happens with me, and I'll return the favor. Communication is key with me. If you're not in the mood, don't let me overthink, just say so. Plus, I'd never turn down a conversation during breaks!\n\nIf I missed anything, please let me know. I'm also not fully committed to everything in the story yet, so if you have ideas, don't be shy! I will also be asleep in about an hour or two, so if I don't reply, that's why. Hope to hear from you soon!\n\n\\- Fleury (A.k.a Anthony.)",

            "selftext": "The Magicians roleplay, specifically Q and Eliot. I don\u2019t have a particular plot, but there\u2019s a few (very underdeveloped!!!) ideas floating around my mind that I\u2019d hope my partner would help advance. Let\u2019s get deep into it. One word prompts can bloom as far as we want, we can take anything anywhere. That\u2019s the beauty of these characters. Feel free to come at me with a completely different prompt/plot too, if you have any ideas. \n \n- Different Time Loop. In one of the loops, Quentin doesn\u2019t go to Brakebills. Either he\u2019s rejected and wiped or he simply never gets invited for an interview. Eliot finds him anyway. We could take this anywhere. It could start as a Queliot relationship where El thinks he\u2019s just seeing someone normal. It could be that Eliot remembers the other loops, or that he\u2019s from an entirely different timeline altogether and seeking Quentin out or that he\u2019s been told by Jane/Eliza to keep an eye on this Q character so naturally ends up seducing him.  \n\n- The Impossible Puzzle is solved quicker. They\u2019re not gone nearly as long, there\u2019s no peaches and plums or child. It was just them. When they get back things between them are changed. We could include some slice of life flashbacks to their time together, as well as everything happening when they return from Fillory. \n\n- Another timeline. Again. Except a complete rewrite of the story from the beginning, with new outcomes, new adventures, different relationships. This would be a very slow burn and need a lot of imagination as well as equal exchange of ideas. I think it would be a challenge.\n\n- Mental hospital AU, where Julia didn\u2019t cast a spell and it was genuinely all a dream. \n\n- Now You See Me AU. \n\n- No Beast, no drama. Quentin joins the school. Things are as normal as they can be. Essentially just a \u2018school au\u2019 with pining, angst, fluff and all that classic roleplay stuff. Action could come later?? \n\n- Eliot isn\u2019t possessed by the monster. He\u2019s given a new identity like the others, except he ends up meeting Brian. A sort of \u2018always meant to be together\u2019 tale. \n\n- Hedge Witch AU, where Eliot and Margo find Q and Julia and that\u2019s how they\u2019re trained. \n\n- Crossover ideas?? Fire them at me. \n\n\nI don\u2019t have any preference about who I\u2019d like to play, I\u2019m more than happy to let you have dibs. Just know I\u2019d like someone who is happy roleplaying as the other characters too depending on the situation and who is involved in it. \n\nOther things I\u2019m looking for; \n- Someone 18+\n- Literate. Quality over quantity but I can\u2019t carry on with roleplays that stick with one liners or one small paragraph. \n- Someone happy with OOC chat for plotting and general chit chat. I love a partner who expresses their ideas, who is imaginative and happy to share what they want to do or if they\u2019d like to take things in a different direction.\n\nI\u2019m in the GMT TZ and currently off from work and studies so I have time, but real life comes first so I\u2019m not necessarily seeking someone who replies 100 times a day. Take your time! That said, no leaving me weeks for a reply and then I\u2019d not do the same.\n\nI roleplay through email, but message me here first. ",

I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like. Edit: I *am* actually in the mood for something more focused around Yokai and the like, at the moment, but again, it's not required!\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me.

In essence, those who are interested will fill out a short application over in the Discord, and RPC staff will pair them up according to writing style/preferences/etc...\\*\\*\n\n**Don\u2019t miss out! This is an exciting new program, and an easy opportunity to meet new writers!**\n\n[https://discord.gg/uqZkFBn](https://discord.gg/uqZkFBn)\n\nWith a site founded in 2011, Roleplay Central is dedicated to helping writers and roleplayers connect with like minds! While our site offers a one-of-a-kind searchable database with hundreds of members to browse with their likes and dislikes posted for all to see, our Discord has become a storytelling portal and a community effort. Our mission may be to connect people around the world and let their creativity shine, but for the last year, our Discord has grown into something more.\n\nOur server offers both one-on-one and group advertisements to help you find your perfect partner, as well as a whole section of writing help channels to encourage you to become the writer you've always wanted to be. We boast useful sources, writer's block busters, and a section to ask your burning writing questions where someone is always around to answer! In addition, we post a daily question to make you think about your characters, your writing style, and how you tackle a story. As a perpetually active server, there's almost always someone around to chat with, bounce ideas off of, or relax from a stressful day.\n\nDon't believe us? We asked our members what their favorite parts of RPC were:\n\n\"The friendly community, post-a-plot, and the way the list is set up is my favorite!\"  \n\"The community is the best part. Everyone is really nice.\"  \n\"I enjoy how welcoming everyone is, and helpful as well.\"  \n\"Post-a-plot is a great way to get a new idea, and there's plenty of writers to indirectly learn from.\"  \n\"The community itself is my favorite part, even though I do like thinking over the questions of the day.\"  \n\"It's crystal clear that RPC is a very loving commuity where there's a place at the table for everyone!\"\n\n\u2728 [https://discord.gg/uqZkFBn](https://discord.gg/uqZkFBn) \u2728\n\nNot into Discord?

            "selftext": "Because I am as square as a box of applejacks, and wouldn't dream of ever handling a pack of illegal green or white contraband, I figured a roleplay surrounding these topics and lifestyles could be the perfect way to set things up, without Government Agencies kicking down our doors in real life. The roleplay I am shooting for will have a high expectancy of adult content, from smut, to contraband trafficking, to lives being taken... Things are going to get pretty graphic.   \n\n\n**What I hope for**\n\nWhat I envision the roleplay being, is a story surrounding two characters: A new but smart dealer, as well as his lover and trusty female partner in crime, possibly whom he teaches how to help him. Areas of a city that are risky to be in, gangs and their wars/events, the lifestyle that surrounds a dealer although the rp will have it a little easier and fun. It could even  trickle into a bit of a school setting, maybe the last year of high school, and dealing was a last resort that came to be. The entirety of the roleplay will not be strictly deal after deal and weighing this, counting that, there can be social themes and other dynamics included, which can be discussed on Discord. I do plan to brainstorm and build up a story surrounding these topics.  \n\n\n**Roleplay Partner Warnings and Expectations**  \nSomething to expect in the roleplay, as we invest into our roles, will be the use of slang. You dont have to be well versed, especially since things outside of dialogue will be described literately (hopefully). I tend to type a few paragraphs depending on what my reply calls for, and would like to let readers of this post know, I dont expect you to send that back, but I dont enjoy vague, stubborn (unless discussed/planned), or short (under 1 paragraph) replies. I make exceptions for those who show effort though :) Another warning, if you dont enjoy smut, or violence/deaths in roleplays, skip this post! Lastly, I love creation. Planning out main characters, living arrangements, assets, and even history/backstory is something I hope I can do for this roleplay. It may not kick off for our first day of meeting (California, USA - PST - GMT-8). However, I hope to find a partner or group to play this out with, as its been on my bucket list of roles ever since Ive started roleplaying. Thanks for reading! Have a good one!",

            "selftext": " \n\n**Rookshaven** is one of the longest running, lore-intensive group role playing storylines on Discord right now.\n\nBased in present-day northern Scotland, Rookshaven Academy and University is a school for mages, though the storyline only allows for university students and professors to be applied.\n\n**A bit about our lore:**\n\nThe mage community has always held their royal families above the rest. Though they aren't considered kings or queens of their mage classes anymore, the royal families are believed to be the first blood lines to develop their particular kind of magics. As such, royalty have always been the law-makers for mages worldwide. In the late 1800s, a rebel sect of mages rose up to attack the royals and all of their complicit, loyal subjects - resulting in a Mage Civil War.\n\nMany mages and their royal families were killed off, while the beast mage class disappeared entirely. From that war, the High Council was formed. A collection of the remaining royal houses, electing one member of their family to represent them in the governing of the mage community.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the original eight royal families, only five are alive in present day. Additionally, two new mage classes have been discovered. Without a way to track the new class's lineage, Mythics and Necromancers have been left without a representative in the Council. As a result, many laws passed since their discovery have been created seemingly for the purpose of keeping Necromancers and Mythics at a disadvantage. While the newest class, Mythics, are sigil-bound at a young age to feel an automatic pull toward royal families, they often grow up to be employed as maids or servants for the royals.\n\nSince 2016, another uprising of rebels has been seen. Between then and 2019 (present day), many royals and loyalists alike have lost their lives in terrorist attacks by these Rebels. In the last year of the group story on Discord, students have been attacked both on and off campus, leading many to believe there are Rebels among the ranks of Rookshaven, despite the school being run by the Council.\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n\\- Monthly events in which your character can earn points to put into their dice, making them stronger.\n\n\\- Lots of lore.\n\n\\- Outlined mage classes, as well as factions to push their own agendas (Royals, Loyalists, Rebels, Sympathizers).\n\n\\- Friendly players willing to work with new players to create backstories and social networks.\n\n\\- A secondary server only viewable to applied and approved players where you can post playlists, aesthetic images, social media posts, journal entries, as well as having 1-2 private channels specific to your character for housing and training.\n\n\\- Active Staff willing to help new players any way we can and get players immersed in the story faster.\n\n\\- Patience. It's a lot of lore. It's okay if it takes a while to get through it all.\n\n\\- An NPC Library to check out characters for scenes when your own characters are locked down.\n\n**What we expect:**\n\n\\- literacy\n\n\\- a 3 paragraph minimum per post (there are exceptions to this, but the majority of players should strive for this)\n\n\\- realistic characters that fit the server lore\n\n\\- activity every 2 weeks, or communication with the Admins if you need to take time away\n\n\\- read the FAQ\n\n\\- a drive to grow as a writer\n\n**Classes Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Water\n\n\\- Darkness\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n\\- Earth\n\n\\- Necromancy\n\n**Locked Classes:**\n\n\\- Beast (planned to be unlocked in early 2019, only available as secondary characters)  \n\\- Hybrid Mages (mages born from opposite classed parents, or from one Mirskoy parent)  \n\\- Mythics (available as secondary characters, due to them being difficult to play)\\*\n\n\\*Are available presently under rare circumstances, talk to an Admin.\n\n**Royal Families Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Dark\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n**Upcoming/Ongoing Events:**  \n\\- Equinox Spell  \n\\- Beast Unlock  \n\\- Anniversary Event  \n\\- Hybrid Relations Act Event (abduction &amp; experimentation on hybrid mages)  \n\\- Forest Games   \n\n\n[Rookshaven on Discord](https://discord.gg/V6SUcaz)",

            "selftext": "\\###\\*\\*Hello, witches and wizards of Reddit!\\*\\* \n\nAre you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter?  Have you always dreamed of a simulation of going to Hogwarts, casting spells, meeting new friends and going on adventures? Want to write out your life exactly as you dreamed it would (and should!) be? Tired of waiting hours to get a reply on your roleplaying posts? Want to attend classes, play quidditch, and meet cool people, all in the same place?\n\nWell, this is your letter of acceptance to Model Hogwarts! Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night. For some more information please check out our \\[wikia\\]([http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model\\_Hogwarts\\_Wiki](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki))!\n\n\\##\\*\\*What's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:\\*\\*  \n\n1) Everyone starts off as a First Year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences! You and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that exploded potion nearly shrunk all of your heads into pinpoints, and somehow you dramatically saved the day! We also make it easy to graduate. A year is 11 weeks, with 2 weeks of summer in between. You also get to choose how many classes you want to take. Are you the next Hermione Granger? Don't worry, we've got you covered with a time turner so you can take all seven classes! Are you more like a Neville Longbottom? You only have to take a couple and still pass the year! We understand everyone has different priorities and classwork isn't always on top.\n\n2) You get to choose where you are sorted. We're not going to place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house. We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer.\n\n3) We're at a point where we are an established roleplaying community -- Model Hogwarts has recently hit our two year anniversary! This is great because you have the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts. While having the safety net of an established community with 200+ active players and systems and guidelines to guide you along your roleplaying journey! \n\n4) As an established roleplaying community, we have developed -- and continue to develop --  a variety of systems to ensure you have the best experience possible! This includes a variety of discord bots, including a spell bot (that uses a combination of a learning and dice-based system to determine whether or not you succeed in casting a spell), a stat bot, and a chocolate frog bot, just to name a few! We also have a variety of systems, including the tokens system which allows you to purchase special abilities for your character so that your character, and every character in Model Hogwarts is truly unique. \n\n5) We\u2019re welcoming to both new and experienced rpers. If you\u2019re new to RP it\u2019s okay!  Model Hogwarts can get you started! We have a \\[detailed RP guide\\] ([http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying\\_Basics](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying_Basics)) to give you some tips and tricks as you begin. We also run a plot every year, so even if you\u2019re new to RP and shy, you\u2019ll have plenty of chances to join in on the fun!\n\n6) We want \\*you\\*. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking \\*us\\*. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.\n\n7) \\*\\*New addition:\\*\\* Post-grad! Love Harry Potter but rather not roleplay as a student? We understand! Now that we have our first group of graduates, we have created a post-grad system where anyone can play as an adult in the wizarding world. Here you can start as someone that has already graduated Hogwarts, and navigate the vast wizarding world. Want to work in the ministry, and become a department head? Want to be a dark wizard and try and take over the wizarding world? These are all possible with post-grad! \n\n\\###\\*\\*How to start:\\*\\*  \n\n1) \\[\\*\\*Join the Discord!\\*\\*\\](https://discord.gg/56z6GMM) This is where the magic is happening. Meet your classmates and professors, roleplay, go to classes, fight mysterious ghosts, and get lost in the library. You\u2019ll get a week of \u2018Hogwarts Summer Camp\u2019 where you can informally meet your peers in you year and explore the castle without all the annoying upper years.\n\n2) \\[Check out our wikia\\]([http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model\\_Hogwarts\\_Wiki](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki)) for more information as well as some information about our classes, professors and some peoples\u2019 characters! \n\n3) Take a peek at some of the classes we offer! Classes are drop in, so even if you miss some you can still attend, but they\u2019re totally optional if you\u2019re more interested in roleplay! First years can currently attend the following classes:\n\nCharms\n\nPotions\n\nTransfiguration\n\nDefense Against the Dark Arts\n\nPath to Success in the Wizarding World \n\nHerbology\n\nHistory of Magic\n\nAs well as elective classes for third years and up! \n\n4) Please comment down below with any and all questions you have. We\u2019d be happy to answer them! We can\u2019t wait to welcome you to our roleplaying community! ",

I created this character years ago, and several paintings, and other works of art and media made me remember this character. However cli\u0107he this is, the previous creation of this character and his adventures struck a deep connection within me. I'm hoping to renew this connection once more.\n\n1866, April 2nd, 0721\nEdo period, Japan, Eastern Yamato- border of Iga lands.\n\nThe rain pelted the dirt road violently as the nameless ronin's geta clomped along the dirt and sparse stone, nobody, going nowhere. The thin man travelled aimlessly. His Kimono dry from waist up thanks to the thick, and leathery like outergarment. Everythin was a dull grey, the landscape, the cloudy raining skies above, even the ronin's clothes. Save for the dark golden stray kasa atop the man's black haired head. His shoulder length hair drawn back into a singular ponytail, his wet hand clutching the ribbon covered- still sheathed singular katana at his side. From the guard, tied through it, then down along the sheath. Keeping the blade firmly seated in  it's sheath was a vibrant red silk ribbon, a firm reminder of the ronin's past. Something that still haunts his cold sweated dreams. \n\nAlright, if you're interested in perhaps creating your own story, and connections then let me know.\n\n\nAlso yes, it is that person, however no it is not exactly lore accurate. It is a alternate version, one who's story was much different and much fitting(?) for me and the other story writer's tastes. However our time together has passed and we no longer keep in touch, life at it's best.\n\nSorry for ranting on, send a DM my way if this did infact interest you.",

            "selftext": "I literally couldn't think of a better title than that, I swear.\n\nThat aside, Hello! I'm back, today looking for less of a prompt, and more of a...general search? I have no idea. Before I get into the nitty gritty, allow me to say a bit about myself. I'm a 20-something male with plenty of writing experience, about 6ish years or so. I'm the kind of guy who (proudly) sprouts absurd and out there ideas, literally just on a whim or the slightest bit of inspiration. Seriously. Sometimes I can get a little crazy. My post length is anywhere between 1-3 paragraphs, but I came definitely get more out if I'm feeling inspired.  I'm also, for whom it might concern, in the central timezone of the United States. That being said, I have a horrid sleep schedule, so I'll usually be up pretty late into the night.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say what I'm looking for. I am (unsurprisingly) looking for a female partner to nerd out with, 18+ of course, just in case we *do* go down a NSFW road at some point (It's welcome, but I'd like to not to be the focus of anything). **I will not, under any circumstances, write with someone under the age of 18**. I'm not comfortable with it, and I'm sorry if someone out there disagrees with this. Additionally, I'm looking for someone that I can call my friend. All proper and business is boring. I like to freak out with my writing partners. Come up with dumb plotlines or AUs. If you're looking for something strictly professional, I'm probably not your guy.\n\nFinally, we get down to what I'm *really* gonna be vague on. As you might've guessed by the title, I'm looking for something fantasy related. What specifically, you might ask? I have no clue. I'm a sucker for romance plots, with an epic adventure hanging above our characters' head. Be it slaying gods, or sealing away an ancient evil, I can't get enough of it. I love all sorts of different fantasy races, too. Elves? Oh yeah. Demons? Sure! Any kind of Yokai? *my god, that'll press my buttons in juuust the right way*. Anyway. If you have any existing ideas, please, throw them at me! I love reading through plots n ideas. Want to create something new? We can chat for a bit, and see what we both like. Edit: I *am* actually in the mood for something more focused around Yokai and the like, at the moment, but again, it's not required!\n\nI'm rambling now, aren't I? I think I've gone on for long enough. If I've caught your eye, please, shoot me a message, and I'll get to you ASAP. Just be sure to include your favorite color in your title, so I know you got down this far. Like I said, I'm usually around into the late hours of the night, so you'll likely catch me. Thanks for reading!\n\n(Oh, by the way, don't send me a message only saying \"hey I think we can work something out\" or the like. Tell me about yourself, have some energy. Those kind of intros give me life)",

I've been curious about putting myself in the shoes of the other sex in a roleplay situation though, and it's something I'd absolutely love to try out.\n\nI'm not too fussed about setting, though I would like the roleplay to be romantic and NSFW elements would most likely be present. I don't care if you're a guy or a girl playing as a guy, either of them work for me. Oh, and I also don't mind if you want to play as a female character too for a lesbian relationship.\n\nI don't have any specific ideas in mind, but I'm hoping someone here does and wants to help me out!

Now, let me get to the plot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the settlement of the Western United States, casualties were a regular occurrence. The Great War between the cowboys and Indians left the natives fleeing their land. Before the forced migration, the tribes, once divided now standing strong, had cursed all the land and those who inhabit it. This curse brought a surge in violence like no other. Three towns settled on the Scorched Earth: Greywater, Fort Redding, and Ciudad de Promesa (City of Promise). It wasn\u2019t long before the first attack was recorded. It was in Greywater.

I've done some world-building for a superhero world of my own (which is honestly pretty derivative of other peoples' work, but whatever!) and I'd really love to find a partner who is willing to play in it.\n\nMy ideal partner is someone who wants to be taken on an adventure, starting from square one as someone who recently developed powers, and ascending the ranks to become their city's greatest hero! Along the way, you'll join a team of other heroes, deal with friends and family who may or may not know your secret, and fight supervillains! I'd be taking on the role of a GM, playing all the other characters around you, describing the world for you.\n\nI expect this roleplay to have plenty of adult content, both in terms of violence and otherwise, so please be over 18.  As far as romance goes, I've got a good mix of male and female characters, so if you like both, you'll have lots of options!\n\nThat's all I can think to say for now, so if you're interested, shoot me a PM and we can chat!

It had been a good day, the sale seems to have gone through without a hitch and all that remains is to connect the auction winner with the seller of the vase and how hard could that be really? The truth is very and reopening the laptop Ellie starts to look over the logistics of the sale, the problem wasn\u2019t moving it from China to Moscow where the buyer was, that was an easy route. The problem was making sure it didn\u2019t get picked up en route and certainly that the police didn\u2019t recover it. Ellie lives on her reputation and if that is lost what is she to do? Finally with a plan in place she closes the laptop once more and heads for a quick shower and then pulling on the designer dress heads down t the fundraiser she was in London to attend.\n\nExpensive hotels, lavish parties. Fundraisers. It was all part of her life as a lead auctioneer for Bonhams, running the charity sale for the evening was an easy enough time. Rich people in the room and not too much work. She usually works doing appraisals these days, the work that lets her travel the world and see the amazing artifacts that are being sold on the legitimate market. These of course were never sold directly by her. Why would you arrange a theft of something you have had direct contact with.\n\nEllies side business was still as an auctioneer, but this time for items that most people wouldn\u2019t be able to find in bonhams, stolen art. Ancient artifacts. Human organs. She allows the thieves to offload the artifacts to buyers with the minimum of effort, she was a fence extrordanaire. Never meeting the buyer or the seller never touching the artefact but everyone knows that if you need a sale fast or slow you come to Invidiam auctions, and if you need it, you should know where on the web to find it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi all another bad post but thanks for reading.\n\nThis is an rp based around the underworld and the supply and demand of items therein, but rather than the usual thief rp or the assassin rp like my last post this one is about the movers and shakers, the person who knows how to get you what you want and move it on.\n\nSo how do you fit in. well you can be from the underworld or not. Ellie still has a legitimate job and that can be used to interact with her, so are you a client? If so from which world? Do you even know about her underground business. Are you a lover? A stranger in a bar? A tinder date? After all it is a hard place to find love in the dark web.",

Now with that out of the way!\n\nI'm looking for like-minded individuals to run an RP group on Discord with me. I have a *general* idea what I want, but I am open to not only interpretations but other ideas! I'm looking for the creative types: world builders, (potentially) artists, character creators. This will be over *Discord only*. So I have one of two stories I want to play out:\n\n* A Victorian Gothic, a plague bringer set to bring about the end of the world. (I would love this to be in Steampunk fashion, and have a lot of world building done on this already.)\n* Futuristic Dystopic, in the likes of Fallout/Repo! The Genetic Opera/I, Robot. There's a lot to unpack to this one- two forms of AI, live-saving drugs, the ability to manually shut someone's full system down. \n\nIf either of these interest you, shoot me a PM! We'll talk more about expectations and what I'd like for the group, and go from there. :)",

            "selftext": "Hey All\n\nFirstly id like to get this warning out the way, this world is the culmination of 8 years of brainstorming, movie watching, deviantart browsing and youtube binging, and i feel like im ready to put it out here... hopefully to get some responses.\n\nFirstly this will be a massive post, im literally gonna be posting that entire world in this one post, so brace for a lot of reading.\n\nThis story takes inspiration from RWBY, Animorphs, Fast And Furious (particularly tokyo drift, and not for the reason your thinking), Sword Art Online, Skyrim Elder Scrolls, Japanese &amp; Chinese History, that K/DA Music video, Hunger Games (again not for the reason your probably thinking), attack on titan (no not that reason) and Avatar the last airbender.\n\n***BEGIN WORLD OPENING***\n\nMy world is set in the year 2029, in a completely different timeline to our own universe, in this universe, instead of Britain colonizing most of todays countries, and giving forth to the majority of western culture, its the opposite, the most prominent culture now is eastern culture, the generalised genre for the whole word, is dystopian future, with Neon-punk themes, Japanese culture and technology mixed in with magic.\n\nThe rp takes place in the city of Koracalci, a bustling city on the edge of the capital city of central Australia, all countries developed with major advanceds in technology thanks to the eastern culture fronting the advanced of technolgoy, so most captial cities were in the centre of the landmass.\n\nAustralias captial city was appropriately named Uluru, and was divided into 6 sections, each with a verying demographic of lifestyles, ages, gender and wealth, the center section, being section one, was the wealthiest and consisted mostly of high rise buildings and highly dense cityscapes, the further out you went, the more the life style changed from buisness to industrial to agriculture.\n\nThis world as peaceful as it seemed is no without conflict, in this timeline eastern culture fronted the advances in colonizing because of their knowledge of the Shadoub\u012bsuto (\u30b7\u30e3\u30c9\u30a6\u30d3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8) or Shadow Beast, these creatures are believed to be of a hive mind, seeking out to destroy what humanity has created and return the earth to its natural state, observations and studies have indicated that pollution draws the Shadow Beasts in, due to their black and oozy like appearance, they have been given the common name of Tarrs, they appear in forms of natural earth creatures to mythical beasts.\n\nHumanity, naturally always pushing to advanced themselves, made no action to reduce pollution, they simply built walls around their cities and defended themselves as need be, which created an area of no mans land outside the city walls, called the Shadow Zone, but another side affect of this was the unrest among the population of those cities the political, religious, ethical and cultural differences begun to divide the people, furthering the dividing of the cities to not just physical, but symbolic aswell.\n\nHumanity is not the same either as the humanitiy we have in our world, in this world, Humans are born with a spirit animal, and not in the symbolic sense, but a literal sense, each spirit animal is unique to that person, different in appearance, colour, personality and power, each spirit animal also has an elememt its linked to, as time goes by one can learn to harness and control their spirit animal and element, pushing themselves to a stage where they can physichally become their spirit animal, or their animal embodied by their element.\n\nThe more one masters their spirit animal, the more it becomes physichally shown, because only so many animals exist, different tribes and factions were form, congregating those of similar animal spirits, these soon became known as the Anamalia Factions, which ill get to soon, the physical display of one mastering their spirit animal is in the form of naturally occurring tribal like tattos, the tattos are the colour of the persons animal and the style is unqiue to that animal species, so many people can have the same type of tatto and colour, but what truly makes each unique is when they show off their mastery, using your elemental powers causes your tattos to glow and give off an aura of your element over them, for someone of a blue fire spirit their tattos would have blue flames emerging from them, purple earth would have like a cracked desert ground on them, commonly black with the respective colour illuminating the cracks.\n\nAlong with them having such unique powers, the majority of those who chose to master their abilities, chose to channel their energy through varying forms of martial arts and weaponary, they also tended to avoid most modern day weaponary like firearms and explosives as their own abilites rivalled that of a gun.\n\nAt night time, the tattos give off a distinct neon glow due to the lack of UV light hindering their energy movement, naturally your spirit has enough energy to constantly have your tattos in a state of \"aural display\" but the UV light hinders that, but at night time, they give off an beautiful clean glow (yes like that K/DA music video with the glowing face paint).\n\nA bonus that is gained from ones spirit animal come without requiring any training, the Aura that their spirit gives off forms a shield around their body, mind and soul, absorbing any damage and healing wounds, the amount of damage the aura can absorb or repair is dependent on the person.\n\nAs time has gone by an goverments used censuses to track and record the data of people's spirit animals, a trend was notcied... the Wolf was among one of them rarest spirit animals, Dragons, Snakes and Tigers being among the most common, in regards to elements, the most common being, Water, Fire and Earth, the rarest being Lightning.\n\nFor each of the animals there is a faction, and with 6 divsions in the city, there are 6 respective factions which i shall now list below (these factions are basically like the chinese mafia out of tokyo drift, varying levels of activity), please note aswell, these factions do not represent the demographic of that section, its simply the faction that is the ruling gang of that section.\n\nDivsion 1, Capital Buisness Section: The Serpentine, Snake Faction, Led by Marcus Gaskov, Purple Shadow Snake Spirit, Negative Alignment, Criminal Activity, Assault, Robbery and Murder.\n\nDivision 2, Retail Section: The Claw, Tiger Faction, Led by Emelia Jacobs, White Lightining Tiger Spirit, Positive Alignment, Lawful Activity, Specialist Security, Policing and Community Aid.\n\nDivision 3, Highrise Apartments Section: Wings Of Fire, Dragon Faction, Led by Antonio Devari, Red Fire Dragon Spirit, Neutral Alignment, Vigilante Activity, Rioting, Vandalism and Justice Enforcing.\n\nDivsion 4, Residential Section: The Murder, Avian Faction, Led by Alex Murcs, Black Wind Crow Spirit, Negative Alignment, Criminal Activity, Theft, Identity Fraud and NFC Skimming.\n\nDivision 5, Industrial Section: Pride Of The People, Lion Faction, Led by Ben Jacobs, Orange Earth Lion Spirit, Positive Alignment, Civillian Activity, Emergency Service, Security and Heavy Construction.\n\nDivsion 6, Agricultural Section: Gods Of The Sky, Mythical Avians Faction, Led by Lauren Pol, Blue Water Thunderbird Spirit, Neutral Alignment, Civilian Activity, Messengers, Community Aid and Medical.\n\nThere is a seventh faction that exists, but its a generalised one for those who train and master their spirits, but dont align with any faction, they are known as the Renegades, renegades mainly inhabit the tops of the city walls, and sometimes even outside the city walls.\n\nEach faction has control over a particular zone, how they choose to rule it is dictated by the mentality of the leader, each faction has its own form of deciding a leader, whether through strength, intelligence or agility, one trend is consistent, they all have to be adaptable to change to stay as the leader.\n\n***END WORLD OPENING***\n\nNow you maybe wondering how does this massive world, get turned into an RP, what plot is there to follow, and my answer to that is...who said there was a plot, it can be anything we want, maybe the Serpentine decide they want more than 1 section of the city, maybe the shadow beasts begin evolving and starting finding ways into the city, maybe a goverment agency begins targeting those who chose to enhance their abilities to maintain control of the population, its all up to you.\n\nNow how do you get into this RP, its pretty simply, your gonna need to create your own charachter, youll need to gather a ref pic, send a short bio, describe your spirit animal, colour and power, and then you get to choose your role.\n\nNow bear in mind, you aren't restricted to anything, if you want to be a leader of one of the factions, then you can, you can choose to make your own spirit setup, or use the ones already there, you dont have to use that leaders name either, but you will have to follow the factions alignment and animal types.\n\nIf your interested in exploring this world and roleplaying in it, then let me know, you can DM and ill provide my details for you and we can get this on the road, my charachter will be discussed once we get into the planning, as my charachters intro is the starter ill use to kick off the RP.\n\nHope to hear from you all soon.",

            "selftext": "So, as some may have noticed, this isn't my usual post where I just drop a bunch of fandoms and ~~hope someone comes along and actually stays~~ search for interested people. I have two ideas that I'm gonna be posting today and hopefully they'll interest someone. \n\n***Really looking for the extreme sports one.***\n\nThe first one is a usual Marvel one where I play my original character, I'm not really too picky on who you choose, but I think Riri Williams could be cool. Just as long as it's a girl character I'll be fine, if they can mesh. The other one is more set in reality, sort of. I have a character that's a snowboarder and I'd like to cover her rise to fame with a team of other extreme sports people. It's a bit niche, I know, but I think it could be fun. I'll post short starters below for each so you can tell me what you think whenever you get around to it. \n\n*Marvel* \n\n*My name is Cynthia Rorsch. In my universe, 7173, I'm known as Spider Woman. I have the standard abilities that we all have across the multiverse, however I also have an active camouflage ability and bone blades that come out from my wrists. On top of these, I have two symbiotes that were made by man that bonded to me during a stealth mission for our variation of S.H.I.E.L.D.*\n\n*In our universe, we have what come would call a \"Ghost Rider\", a spirit of vengeance the weak pray to in an attempt to punish those who do wrong across the universe. One of our spirits gained too much power and has gone on an unstoppable rampage the likes of which we've never seen.*\n\n*The smartest minds of our world banded together in secrecy to try and come up with a solution, but all they've come up with is asking other universes for help. They sent several of our operatives out, but when it came my turn the spirit discovered our location and destroyed the lab. I was only barely able to make it through, but I've been thrown to a universe not intended. The force from its attack has rendered me unconscious, and I can feel my symbiotes desperately trying to wake me. They won't in time, but they will protect me wherever I end up.*\n\nSnowboarding: The mountains that Cecilia loved so much were for several reasons, but one more so than all the others; hardly anyone knew about it. She had miles of open stretch to herself to practice her slope skills and took the opportunity fairly often, but of course supported a local resort and boarded down their double diamond hills every so often. \n\nIn her time on the snow, she's made a few connections in extreme sports, none in snowboarding, but close enough they could talk regularly, and wanted nothing more than to become a professional and win gold at the X-games. She knew the road would be long and difficult, but her friends also wish to do the same in their respective sports and they won't rest until they make it big. \n\n**Detective: The Metro City Police Department is known for a few things. First off, their squads work together extremely well, thanks in no small part to the constant influx of assignments, meaning no one leaves on their own. Second, their SWAT team is notorious for being brutal and effective. If they come after you, you can rest assured they'll find you eventually. More often sooner than later. Lastly, their detectives have all been around the block a few times and know their way around several situations. Of course, they're not the best, but they are especially good at what they do.**\n\n**And Detective Bernoulli is a prime example. She's seen every possible incident their department can take charge of. Everyone in the station knows everyone else. So when Bernoulli suddenly disappears without a trace, it doesn't go unnoticed.**\n\nFantasy: In a world full of magic and monsters, there's only a few things that you can always be sure of; Dwarves will mine, Orcs will raid, humans will be afraid of everything, and thieves will take anything they can get their hands on. Though there are the low end thieves that get caught, captured and rot in prison or die trying to run, the best ones come and go without so much as a second glance. \n\nNot to reinforce stereotypes, but one such Wood Elf, Enna Amakiir, has lived several human lifetimes traveling the world, taking whatever she pleases and leaving more than a handful of women wondering if they'll ever wake up to that cloaked figure coming through their window to ravage them again. Though she's never been in the same place long, and nobody left alive knows her name, few are confident she'll come back. \n\nThat's all I'm willing to put up for now, but it's not all of my ideas. You can check my post history and come back to me with whatever if you're interested. \n\nSo yeah, there's my thrown together prompts, just get to me whenever. ",

I really have been wanting to participate in this prompt that I wrote a while ago, if you share the same interest in this prompt as I do then feel free to send your discord tag my way. Without further delay, here is the prompt:\n\nYour character, a female detective, finds herself on a case which follows a string of similar murders in the area. Through your extensive research, you\u2019ve shrunk your suspect list down to a select few criminals as well as one man who sticks out like a sore thumb. The man in question, my character, is a persuasive, manipulative, arrogant and suave millionaire with connections to various high ranking officials in the county. My character finds himself in the hot seat as your character grills him for information, certain he did it but having no real evidence to back it up. The relationship between our characters becomes a strange struggle for you to bust me before I slip out of your grasp or make advances toward you in an attempt to prevent you from stopping my sociopathic rampage.",

I have roleplayed with people in EST etc before and have no problem doing this again! I prefer Discord but I can roleplay on other platforms if requested.\n\nI have a few general settings that I would like to roleplay with, however nothing concrete or extensive. I enjoy crafting a story that we can both enjoy so all of my ideas are fully open to criticism and changes of course.\n\nSome of the settings that I have had a craving for recently are as follows.\n\n\u2022 SciFi - Anything futuristic, whether that be more realistic Dystopian futures or adventurous interplanetary traveling and adventuring.\n\n\u2022 Fantasy Medieval - Anything from low fantasy to high fantasy. I especially enjoy anything that uses races from WoW or any RPG settings such as DnD or Pathfinder. I also enjoy Game of Thrones way too much and would love to do something in the same universe or similar.\n\n\u2022 Westworld - I am currently watching Westworld and would be interested in roleplaying a setting which is similar. I enjoy how the show handles advanced AI and emotions, but I won't say too much in case I spoil anything.\n\n\u2022 Warcraft - Anything around Wow or Warcraft I have been dying to play. \n\nPlease feel free to message me if anything here interests you or you have an idea you would like to share with me, even if it's not on the list above.

            "selftext": "Long ago, three heroes stood up against a great evil. They managed to seal it away, however they could not defeat it. Each of them created an artifact that would choose an heir for them when the time was right.\n\nThe White Queen was a planner. She manipulated the enemy from a distance and planned out traps for them. She was also the one who raised the army that fights to this very day. She died shortly after making her greatest creation: her mask, filled with unknown magic. It lies in her tomb, waiting for someone to claim it and the destiny it brings. The one who claims it will be responsible for setting the scene of the final battle and protecting all that have come to fight.\n\nThe Prophet has the ability to see a small bit of the future. A common ability among psychics, but the way she used it was anything but. She worked as a spy, gathering information directly from the enemy. She saw where their next meeting would occur and she would go. Her artifact is a crystal ball that will amplify the user\u2019s clairvoyance. It\u2019s location is unknown to all but her heir. Once they find it and take up her mantle, they will be responsible for gathering information.\n\nThe Knight was created by the enemy to be a perfect solider. Strong and nearly invincible, they forgot only one thing. A true perfect solider would be an indiscriminate killing machine. The Knight was not. They had given him empathy and once he saw their evil deeds, he escaped and joined the other side. His role was twofold. He led the charge against the enemy, but also discovered a love of medicine. He became a renowned healer and was sought out by people all across the land. His artifact is his sword, famous for stealing the soul of whoever it killed. Only his heir will be able to unlock its true power without sacrificing their own soil in the process. Like him, they will have an aptitude for both healing and fighting.\n\nAlong with the army raised by the original White Queen, the heirs must join together as their predecessors did to fight against the evil and bring peace once more to the world.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the plot! You can choose any of the three heroes and I will play the other two. Although the heroes have set genders, the heirs do not. I also love fantasy races, so please feel free to be creative! As far as writing goes, I tend to do about two paragraphs and prefer 3rd person. If you have any questions, please message me!",

            "selftext": "*Meta*: This idea is based off of one of my favorite enemies of Silent Hill 4: The Ghosts: I decided to expand and kind of fuse that idea with the undying rebirth of the fabled phoenix: This is the result:\n\nThis character is completely unassuming, he is basically a courier, or traveler that is looking for any reason to make a quick buck. He would be a very basic character at first glance, and would have a very cynical personality, preferring to keep his distance from any major events, unless coaxed into them for reasons soon to be explained...\n\nWhen this man is alive he posses absolutely no notable traits except for an extreme sense of professionalism, and very little care of his own personal well being.... His notable features only activate when he is dead, specifically when he is killed violently:\n\nUpon death his body will explode, rather violently, into a viscous, black slime, with a scent of rotten meat. Out of this black stain a phantom form of the man will quickly rise, decayed, rotted, and featuring the most notable traits of how he was killed, this man will rise from the rotted goo of his body and begin to stalk and haunt whomever it was that killed him, using what is most psychologically damaging to first weaken the spirit of his killer, before violently ripping his killer from the inside out. However he has a very small control over these hauntings...\n\nThe most notable cases are those that already know of his powers, and choose to kill him, in order to conjure his violent and destructive spirit, in order to defeat enemies, \"for the greater good\" Although in almost all of these cases, the character in question, will do, all in his power, to destroy the adversary, and save the world, it always leads in \"the heros\" demise, as the vengeful spirit, infects, weakens, and devours, the hero of the tale. However there were a few times where people have managed to outlast the phantom. The following events will record what is to be expected of a typical haunting of our character:\n\n1 - 15 minutes after death: The body bursts into a very foul smelling liquid, and coats a large area around the mans death\n15 = 30 minutes: an ear piercing drone, comparable to the sound of metal scraping metal are heard by all, and an emancipated version of the characters corpse arises from the viscous black liquid.\n30 - 2.5 hours after death: The corpse will animate, float, and destroy anything the the victim deems a threat, or otherwise in need of being destroyed (This is the part most parties that willingly kill the character benefit from, and can easily turn the tide of a battle, as this rotted avatar cannot be killed or destroyed)\n\n3 hours - 48 hours after host death: The victim will now relentlessly haunt the one whom killed it, using anything, including psychological warfare, to wear down, and destroy the one responsible for it's demise, regardless of circumstance.\n\n50 - 78 hours after death - The phantom will begin to target any living host nearest to it's vicinity for death, manifesting any and all hosts within a 5 mile radius to manifest hauntings to destroy, break down, and kill, anything alive in this 5 mile radius. \n\n+78 hours - the phantom will rapidly decompose into the same foul smelling fluid that created it, and the character will arise from this fluid with all of his clothing, and equipment, fully intact and health.\n\nI had the idea of this character after replaying a favorite game of mine, Silent Hill 4, where you are constantly avoiding and battling hauntings and horrific floating nightmares through the game. I am open to basically any RP concept you can come up with, and if you would like a bit of eldrich in your franchise I'd love to bring it to you. This charecter's story and personality are left vague so that it can fit in any number of themes, it's really not about the characters life, as it is about what happens when he dies, whether it happens randomly, or by a hero, or villain, evoking it, this is a story of the horrors that befall any who willingly, or unwillingly let this terror into their lives, and what they do with this new entity. I really hope you can come up with a story this nihilistic nightmare can fit in, and I hope to RP with you in the future!",

            "selftext": "### THE SETTING\n\nNew York Underground takes place in the metropolitan melting pot that is New York in the year 2019.  Within the city, supernaturals live their lives among humans protected by a magical veil. Only those humans who are deemed worthy are awakened to the knowledge of the darker aspects of the world in which they live.\n\nThe city is currently in free fall after the death of the Prince of the vampires.  The supernatural council has disbanded, leaving a vacuum of power and an uneasiness settling upon the supernatural community that remains.  Only time will tell what happens and who will step up to lead their people in the next decade.\n\n### CURRENT ARC\n\nLike the buds of Spring, the supernatural population continues to grow, and the question on the minds of the awakened world is how long will the existence of supernaturals be contained?\n\nGrowing bored of hiding in the shadows and their magic denied in this technology-driven world, the supernaturals are securing their place in the city through blood and territory to such advantages that should the veil break, they will not be denied their dominion over the city.\n\nYet as they are waiting, so are their Nemesis watching from the darker corners of the city that they have come to ignore. How long before the folly of their pride becomes their undoing?\n\n*(( New York Underground is based heavily on the New World of Darkness roleplaying dice system.  Due to the limitations of this system, we have used homebrewing techniques to make alterations to the rules. This has allowed us to craft a system that fits the storyline and delivery of the system for our game. ))*\n\n### Our Website:\n\n### [https://www.wod-newyorkunderground.com/](https://www.wod-newyorkunderground.com/)\n\n### Our Discord:\n\n[https://discord.gg/NZqBSEz](https://discord.gg/NZqBSEz)",

            "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m Jitterbug, I\u2019m nineteen, and I\u2019ve been writing for a few years. I\u2019m on the hunt for more of a cute, romantic roleplay, and this could be a short term or long term partnership. To make this brief, here\u2019s a list of relevant details:\n\n1. Genres I prefer:\n\n\u2022 Romance\n\n\u2022 Historical\n\n\u2022 Modern or Character based (as opposed to world based)\n\n\u2022 Fantasy\n\n*I am willing to do any other genre as well; I just tend to prefer these.*\n\n2. My Style:\n\n\u2022 Multi paragraph responses\n\n\u2022 Third person\n\n\u2022 Mostly free Mondays and Fridays\n\n3. What I\u2019m looking for:\n\n\u2022 A partner who is patient, writes in third person, and can write multiple paragraph responses as well. \n\n\u2022 Someone who prefers to plan out our story rather than just winging it. \n\n4. Roleplay example:\n\nBulletproof vest, weapon belt, knife, boots, guns: Angela began to look like a glorified war tank by the time she was done. Fetching a small blade from her belt as she passed her home bar, she blindly threw it to land on the wood board she had hung with a photo of Vandever smack in the middle. The blade landed between his eyes. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she was pulling on her jet black leather jacket, her keys, and her helmet. The garage featured at least six different motorbikes, all lined up perfectly: her pride and joy. Tonight, she chose Hellhound, sleek with red and black designs: mostly satanic symbolism and lore to send a message. Tonight, RK was getting his due, the devil\u2019s due, and this somber Friday night, she was Satan\u2019s hitman. \n\nThe delicious sound her bike emitted as it came to life sent chills down her back. The smell of fresh gasoline filled her with power, and she was unstoppable, like a force of nature, ready to leave disaster in its wake. \n\n\u201cHe picked a perfect day to die,\u201d she said under her breath as she removed the break. The wind kissed her face as she took off, past the open gate towards the dark night, and if you looked closely, you could almost catch the hue of a fiery temper around her, subtle and orange. \n\nShe was out to kill.",

I\u2019ve been roleplaying for a couple of years and there\u2019s always been this idea I\u2019ve been interested in.\n\nThe prompt:\nA stranger visits a large city ruled over by a king and his heir, the prince. The king does not treat people with magic or magical entities very nicely, choosing to execute wizards that stumble into his city. The stranger is a somewhat weak wizard who wants to change the king\u2019s and prince\u2019s viewpoint on magic so more of his kind aren\u2019t slaughtered. He has to do it subtly though and without exposing he has magic or else he will be put to death. The stranger could eventually end up working for the prince as a servant or helper and they could have a steady relationship built. (I would prefer playing the stranger, as long as thats fine with you.) I have plans for the two characters to go on quests and adventures together or stay in the city walls and resolve personal or city issues. I would be overjoyed if you added in ideas as well for the rp and GM some situations. The beginning premise with the whole servant and prince thing is drawn heavily from the show Merlin but the adventures they go on will be different.\n\nI\u2019m fine with doing smut and NSFW topics as long as it\u2019s a bit later in the story and has an impact in the plot. I write semi lit to lit and usually can crank out from 1-3 paragraphs, give or take. I prefer to use discord but I can also use Skype if that\u2019s what you use. I think thats about it, but if I missed something, just ask me.",

I'm looking for a partner for a wonderful story idea I have after the last ghosted me mid RP.\n\nThe role would require you to play two sisters, a younger naive girl and older protective sister who will discover they have latent magical abilities. I'm in the US and strongly prefer that you are as well for the sake of time differences but if you aren't, no worries.\n\nI've always been fascinated with the idea of magic in the modern age. The world behind the world. I really enjoy playing characters who start off quite antisocial and end up warming up to the characters being played opposite him. A heart of stone turned to one of gold if that makes sense.\n\nAnyway! On to my idea!\n\n*The year is 2019 and as you're well aware, technology reigns supreme. Imagination has been relegated to video games, socialization to likes and upvotes, deep thought to 120 character posts on a feed, and the smooth feeling of pages between fingers replaced with fingertips on glass screens. Magic has moved from being the norm to being something that exists only in Harry Potter films and daydreams. The more we've moved towards technology, the further we've moved from our roots and our connection to all that really is.*\n\n*Kearan, a man who has lived so long he can't remember his age yet appears to be in his thirties, knows this all too well. He leaves his home filled with books, artifacts, crystals and trinkets to see people mindlessly shuffling along in their day to day lives with eyes glued to screens and senseless malice in the world. No one bothers to stop anymore and let a warm breeze tingle their skin or look up at the twinkling lights in the night sky with wonder at the worlds beyond. The deep blue of the night sky, the brilliant greenery of nature, and the warmth of the sun all replaced with pixels and fleeting, hollow experiences.*\n\n*It's no wonder he'd become so withdrawn from everything.*\n\n*Day in and day out, he stays to himself in his home or on the \"Other Side\" searching for knowledge, skill, and though he would never admit it, a connection. Someone to remind him why he used to travel the world instead of avoiding it.*\n\n*Little did he know that was all about to change...*\n\nI have several locales and characters prepped for this story to keep it engaging and immersive. All I need now is a long term partner who is able to send lengthy, detailed, well written, and consistent replies. The girls could have seen him walking around discreetly using magic and decided to follow him, be runaways on a rainy night who saw him and decided to knock on his door... the possibilities are endless. I'm more than willing/capable to work around any twists you want to throw in.\n\nI'm open to the idea of working romance into the story.\n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a message with a bit about yourself and let's see if we can tell a story together!",

He shared his newfound science with the world, allowing for Vo\u2014the now proper terminology for magic, to be accessible to all. This resulted in him being crowned as a god among men by the people. Unfortunately as with all life, his came to an end. Now, without their *god,* the world is divided with each dividend searching for their own *Voltairah*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill you step up to the title of Voltairah? Or will you forge your own, unique destiny. The world is yours to explore.

Not to say you can't try, this roleplay has no bearing on canon except for the inclusion of Stands and possibly how people get them. For those that understand what JJBA is and what stands are: you're aware of what I want.\n\nI want to create a roleplay that has Stand battles. I want to pit Stand User against Stand User with creative and out there abilities that allow for the kind of shonen battling never seen before. Fights the go beyond Physical Abilities and Punching Ghosts, fights like Aerosmith vs. Clash and Talking Head, Kraftwork vs. Sex Pistols, Sugar Spring Mountain, Wired vs. Tusk ACT 1...\n\nThe list goes on for what sort of fights I'm looking for, yet that's not all: I'm looking for a story that's going to give context for each of the fights. Would any of the fights I had mentioned be as awesome as they were without a context to go along with it? It doesn't have to be 2001: A Space Odyssey or anything but I'll tell you, what drives JoJo just as much as the Stand Battles is the characters. The Joestars, the Major and Minor Antagonists, the Supporting Cast all just keep things going. \n\nThat's what I want.\n\nI have a few ideas for what lind of setting we can do this is if you want to listen.\n\nFrom a small dusty Texas town to the peak of the Vietnam War to World War II Occupied France to...well you get the idea.  \n\nExcuse the fact that I sneakily rambled on about an amazing Manga series instead of making a compelling Roleplay prompt and comment your favorite JoJo Part in the title of your message. I hope to hear about some of your Stands and characters so we can get something great!",

            "selftext": "Hey there, greek mythology lovers, I\u2019ve got a hot take for you today. \n\nI\u2019d like to roleplay a stylistic modern retelling of the abduction of Persephone (Kore), specifically from the universe Lore Olympus, a WEBTOON comic. You are not required to read any of the source material, as I will provide details / lore / reference images at the beginning and per request. For a quick rundown of the universe, I\u2019ll fill you in: the Mortal World is it\u2019s own place, Olympus is a bustling upper class city, and the Underworld is its own business park that manages the dead. \n\nI am searching for a partner who will be able to play as Hades, and I as Persephone as well as most of the other characters if necessary. I have biographies and some background info on either character that I am happy to share, as well as a couple prompts you may choose from that I\u2019ll list below. Third person, literate, and descriptive is all I ask for. Please no one liners, and be aware that I only allow romantic smut if it makes sense and is built up over time. If you please could, include the word \u2018flower\u2019 in your first message / comment so I know you\u2019ve read the brief rules, thanks! \n\n~\n\nPrompt 1: Who is She?\n\nMinthe, a nymph working as secretary for the CEO of the Underworld as well as his long time toxic lover had stood Hades up for the third time that week, and this time if had made him emotionally vulnerable. The party was bustling, but one voice was heard from above the noise. \u201cHonestly, I think she puts Aphrodite to shame.\u201d The goddess of love and beauty\u2019s lavender features blushed with rage as she heard the words spill from a familiar tongue: Hades. Aphrodite turned her head quickly and targeted the culprit who he dared compared to herself, a little pink thing in a dress that even she couldn\u2019t deny looked stunning. Quickly, she devised a plan in hopes it absolutely ruin the first impressions between Hades and Persephone. \n\nPersephone\u2019s petite form lay strewn across the backseats of Hades\u2019 vehicle in a complete unconscious, unaware, and drunken state. None of it was her fault though, she\u2019d not known her limit, and Eros tempted her past that; by two glasses of wine she was drunk, but by two more he had her mumbling while her eyes remained closed. He was ordered by his mother, Aphrodite, and the man felt guilty of what he did to the innocent girl, but he felt he must serve her. If the goddess of Spring were able to see herself in the state, she would be horrified. She stirred only slightly as the driver\u2019s door opened, but continued her slumber and didn\u2019t make a noise, thus Hades entered his car like any other time. \n\nAt some point during the ride, he\u2019d driven over something in the road that caused the car to jerk a bit, but nothing of concern. Persephone responded to this with a small sigh, barely audible and equivalent to a tone just above a whisper. She idly turned to lay on her back instead of her side, and as her arms stretched habitually, they tiredly fell above her head. Now visible was a sleazy attempt at soiling the little goddess\u2019s reputation by Aphrodite: a note taped to her thigh with a heart drawn on it. \n\nPrompt 2: the Library\n\nPersephone had been introduced to the Underworld Corp. only once and just briefly via her first visit, but had not had the opportunity to start her internship within the business just yet. Just yesterday she\u2019d been given directions to a restricted area by a secretary jealous of her and Hades\u2019 closeness. It ended up disastrous, where the undead naturally attacked her because her ability to draw life through nature was seen as a threat. An alarm was tripped, and she was able to be located by Hades. They\u2019d both agreed it was a traumatic experience, and he even offered to pay her without her working in such a dangerous place, but she wagered her stance through a chess game and won. \n\nThe young goddess had been so graciously carried to work that afternoon by a very willing Hermes who had the convenient ability to fly over the bustling city below. In an over-the-shoulder bag she held a home made baking dish, wrapped over the top tightly. She was easily distinguishable from what she wore, or in fact she was easily distinguishable most of the time due to her pink hue, but even more so that day since she opted for a white dress that hugged her curves. Persephone thanked the god of travel with a sweet kiss on the cheek, and he gushed as he flew off to his shift. \n\nUpon entering the sky-scraping building who\u2019s top became lost in a sky of overcast dark clouds, she was told to wait in an empty lobby, where a mysterious water tank with dark eels slithered through. Hecate, second to Hades at the Corp, soon retrieved the young goddess and showed her the department she\u2019d be working in: the Library of Scrolls, where lives or mortal and god alike were written on seamless red scrolls and stopped at death, then finally judged by Hades to determine which labor roles they\u2019d be retrained into. Hecate let the goddess of spring go when she had to take a call, leaving her to wander the library alone. She came upon a set of doors at one point, and noticed a familiar individual through the opening. \n\nThe young woman pushed forward and perked up that much more, and without her noticing, the flowers at her hair begun a transition from pale pink to blue. \u201cHades!\u201d \u201cPersephone.\u201d He replied less enthusiastically. She smiled and approached the god, poking at his chest. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\n~\n\nFeel free to message or comment here. My main platform of communication is kik ; I look forward to chatting!",

I want to start out being apprehensive and hesitant to play hardball but I hope that in our Roleplay that you gradually convince me that yeah, perhaps it's time we stopped playing nice, go out into the streets, maybe form our own radical Left Party, use cunning tactics to sway supporters and undermine the Establishment/Opposition, and who knows, I'm not against some conflict that may arise out of this at some point.\n\nI could be the Face and/or Figurehead of the new Left Party and you maybe part of the Revolutionary Armed Wing and Advisor or maybe Co-Leader alongside me?\n\nIdeally I'd like your character to be in his 20s or 30s, bold, decisive, cunning, charismatic, inspirational. But also have flaws, have a soft side, maybe a bit of a nerd? \n\nSo yeah, if anyone is interested in starting a **real Revolution** to make America and the World a better place... hit me up :)",

            "selftext": "  \n\nEllie sighs as she exhales. The Shot going wide by a couple of inches punching the edge of the ring on the paper target, not good enough and she places the rifle down picking up a screwdriver making necessary adjustments to the screws in the scope mounts before picking it back up and firing again. The bullet flies true and lands maybe an eighth of an inch off the crosshair, acceptable given possible wind gusts and certainly good enough. Shooting 4 more into a ragged hole confirms this. Finally packing up the gun she looks down the range to where her 300m target was and nods in satisfaction before walking with her gun back inside the hut at the outdoor range. She looks out of place not only because she is one of maybe 3 women among the 50 or 60 shooters there but also that she seems to be a shooter with real skill, and in the sexist mind of most men at the range this is unusual just in and of itself. But what makes it truly unusual is that she looked like a model. Tall athletic with curves to die for, dressed in tight leather pants and a simple crop top and shaded glasses.\n\nThe real secret was that Ellie wasn\u2019t a shooter for fun, though she did enjoy it. She was a shooter for profit. A hunter of the most dangerous game of all for some of the most dangerous people in the world. She had killed 45 people in the past few years all by long range shooting, and that says nothing about the others who died in more unfamiliar ways or under \u201cspecial\u201d instructions from her employers.\n\nPacking up the rifle into a locked case in the back of her very unassuming family suv she drives herself back home, a neat little suburban house where she lived alone, no pets no partner no children, most of her neighbours thought she was a young widow who had acquired the place from her rich husbands demise, it was kind of true but only insofar as she acquired it from her husband\u2019s death, but there was nothing natural about his passing.\n\nEllie grabs a glass of wine and lounges out in front of the tv flicking through the channels bored before turning to her phone looking through tinder, she was lonely and it had been so long since she had a meaningful connection. And after all, don\u2019t killers need love too?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey all, back again with another terrible prompt. Thank you for reading. I was looking to see if anyone fancied an rp with this idea, I think I broadly got the idea from a mix of a couple of sources but a lot of it is inspired by Killing Eve. Ellie is a little bit villanelle but a lot less erratic, she is suave confident and fun, knows what she wants but how do you tell someone what you do, meaningful relationships are going to be based on lies. But that doesn\u2019t mean it cant work, does it?\n\nI would love to hear from anyone, men, women, trans, anyone is more than welcome after all love and relationships don\u2019t care about sex and gender. So who is your character? Someone at a bar? From tinder? New neighbour? Also let me know if you have a preference on looks both for your character and for mine. I am happy to make her look pretty much how you want within reason. \n\nI really hope to hear from you all\n\nEllie xxxxxxxxx\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nroleplay is romance based and may be nsfw as such I am over 18 and all partners must be 18+",

            "selftext": "Howdy!! \ud83e\udd20 The names Maya and as you can tell from the ad, I\u2019m in search of a Roleplay! Particularly a post apocalyptic, or slice of slice; but I\u2019m open to anything tbh. \nAs far as \u201crules\u201d go, Im not particularly strict but I do have a few things I would appreciate as a common courtesy. \n\nI\u2019d really like it if you could be detailed, and literate in your responses. (This should go without saying) The occasional writing error certainly isn\u2019t a problem, but please try to maintain a sense of structure! A little effort certainly goes a long way! I do not expect extreme mountains of text in each reply, however one word responses get boring very quickly. Match my effort, if you will. \n\nI do my absolute best to respond as often as I can!! I workout everyday, so that can take up most of the day. I\u2019ll get out as many responses in a day as I can, and If I plan on being gone for long amounts of time I\u2019ll make sure to inform you! \n\nNow this isn\u2019t really a requirement, however I will point out somewhere out. While it\u2019s definitely a necessity to be straight forward and serious in a roleplay, outside of that you don\u2019t have to be so serious! I\u2019m a fun loving, profanity using, laid back kinda girl! Therefore you shouldn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s strictly rp! We could also get to know eachother!! (Again, not a requirement. I can\u2019t force you to be my friend if you strictly want to roleplay :)\n\nAs for the plots I\u2019m interested in, again ill play almost anything! My favorites are:\n\nZombie apocalypse (I\u2019m clich\u00e9 like that :))\n\nRomance \n\nSlice of life \n\nI\u2019m really open to doing almost anything!! I\u2019d appreciate it if we could exchange ideas rather than one person coming up with everything! \n\nWe can discuss platforms to use privately!:)\n\n\nThanks in advanced!\nLooking forward to hearing from you!! \n\nPS: please tell me your favorite flavor of ice cream to insure you\u2019ve read the whole thing!",

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+ \n\nHello I\u2019m a female living in the US, I\u2019ve been roleplaying for about a year now so I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m pretty literate and detailed and I\u2019d like for my partner to be the same. I\u2019m basically looking for a male or female partner to do a long term RP with, so I have a couple of prompts down below. If it\u2019s something you would be interested in doing don\u2019t be shy to send me a message!\n\n\nMariam is young woman who just got laid off work and is now going through a broken engagement. Despite her misfortunes she still manages to have a lighthearted persona who loves to spread kindness everywhere she goes. Being a former kindergarten teacher rendered her to be pretty good at working with children which is how she landed a job of being a nanny for your characters children. \n\nYour character is a widowed man, his wife died a few years ago leaving him with two lovely children. A boy at the age of seven and a little girl at the age of four. He is a business man who likes to take his work a bit too serious at times but still tries to have time for his children though the past a couple of months have been too hustling for him which is why he decided to hire a nanny. \n\n\nPlot 2 (two) \n\n\u201cNow this is just for fun, okay? We\u2019ve both agreed this is what we want and there will be no feelings involved whatsoever.\u201d He stares into her eyes making sure she comprehended exactly what he meant. She lightly nods her head before speaking. \u201cYes, I get it. No feelings involved, just sex\u201d She repeats affirmatively. \u201cExactly, just sex\u201d He confirms and pulls the shirt over his head. \n\nIn which two college students have decided to become friends with benefits based on the sole agreement to not catch feelings for each other. He\u2019s kept his end of the deal whereas her...not so much. Thus when he comes inside of her dorm one day to end the pack because he\u2019s started to fall in love with someone else she simply complied keeping her feelings to herself in hopes that she can just forget about him though that becomes nearly impossible when two months later she finds out that she\u2019s pregnant. \n\n\nAnd that\u2019s basically two short summaries of each plot. I\u2019m not looking for a lot of requirements just someone that can write 2-4 paragraphs per response and is willing to RP in 3rd person. Both plots are romantic themed and although I\u2019m not a big fan of smut I can include it if my partner desires it. Even though the explanations seem kind of bland I have some good scenarios to make things interesting. \n\nAnyways send me a message and we\u2019ll go from there! ",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm in my mid 20s and asexual.\n\nI'm also fascinated by certain topics, such as: being restrained (ropes, chains, fantasy equivalents), pain (think floggers, whips) and (in a minor way) the idea of someone having power over me.\n\nCharacter limits: hoo boy, I've got lots, but common things which I absolutely will not write are smut (in any form), nudity and dirty talk. Will expand on both likes and limits if you interested.\n\nIdeas: Maybe I'm a knight entrusted with your, the king's, safety, kneeling to you and learning the protocols of the court, along with being beaten bloody on the training grounds because I'm a clutz. Maybe I'm the apprentice of an assassin, and exploring how pain feels in order to make me stronger. Maybe I'm a mage with little control over her powers, and you, perhaps my guardian or my hunter, have to ocasionaly restrain me before I cause harm to myself or others. If you've got ideas of your own...I'm more than happy to hear them!\n\nGender/age: I don't really mind what gender you or your character are. My characters will always be F. However, please be 18+. As for character visible age, I'm limiting it to a range of 18-to-30. (no characters biologically younger than 18 allowed). \n\nI'm happy to write in a range of universes, from real-world equivalents to run-of-the-mill fantasy universes and to Alternate Universes of existing stories like Harry Potter, Star Wars, Avatar the Last Airbender, Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, Soul Eater. No canon characters will be used or present, though. I'm sure I missed a few I wanted to list, so if there's any setting in particular that you like, please do mention it! I might have read/watched it. However, I will not write in innately dark settings like GoT or Berserk, and I will not tackle a lot of dark topics (like rape, emotional abuse and real-world guns. some mild torture and fantasy blasters are fine though)\n\nWriting level: It's fine if English isn't your first language, but please remember that punctuation exists! ^^ Otherwise I may have a heart attack, and therefore be unable to write with you.\nI'm not asking for novels. Like, literally don't do that. I will burn out if you send me 3000-word replies every single time, no matter how good you are at writing. I can comfortably manage 500 - 1000 word replies on average, and I'm more than happy to go over it, but pushing myself to write over 2000 words repeatedly just...won't work. That being said, no one-liners. Try at least two paragraphs for me, please ; )\n\nThis is the first time I direct my roleplaying energies to this forum, so there might be some figuring out. That said, I think PM or GoogleDocs are fine to use.\n\nContact me if this sounds like something you might be interested in!",

            "selftext": "*It started the same for all of us: as a feeling of dread. An inexplicable pit in our stomachs that made us look over our shoulders and jump at the slightest sound. Perhaps something was watching us. Perhaps something was coming. We didn't know why we were afraid, only that that dread would not leave us.\n\nOur abilities began to surface shortly thereafter. And they certainly were not the same. Some of us could heal with a touch. Others could destroy just as easily. Our powers were as varied as our backgrounds. Though we came from different countries, had different customs and upbringings, we were now special. Every one in a thousand was gifted.\n\nThe world reacted around us. Some worshiped us as gods and angels, but many reviled us as fear overtook their humanity. And though it was a frightful time, we were not afraid of the people around us. No, our dread had root somewhere else. \n\nWhen we could not run from our fear, we chose to follow it instead. At the end of our pilgrimage, we found Arcadia, a lost ruin deep beneath the Earth's surface and home to a people lost in the tides of time. Though we knew little about our forefathers, we could tell that, like us, they were also gifted. And, like us, they were preparing.\n\nBecause in the end, our dread was not without cause. Something was coming. And we needed to be ready....*\n\n~~~~~\n\nCity of Arcadia is a new Discord RP server I have created with a friend's assistance. The premise, as mentioned above, is that all of a sudden a small portion of Earth's denizens have discovered they had...well, powers. What followed was an instinctual drive to gather in a central location; a secret abandoned city underneath the city of Berlin. There they would find signs that this phenomenon has happened before, but something occurred that caused them to disappear completely. Note that this will not be a spoof-50s superheroes in tights kind of RP. Think more like the show Heroes or Umbrella Academy; otherwise ordinary people with extra-ordinary abilities, in a modern-day Earth like our own.\n\nAt the moment I'd like to get the server up and running with some quality folks. Get some roleplay going, really nail down how the community will function, and work out any kinks. A \"combat\" system for missions and crime-fighting is in the works but is not required to learn as of yet; that can wait until the server gets on its feet. If you've ever played D&amp;D, Pathfinder, etc. then don't worry everything so far is designed to be very similar so it can easily be picked up once it's ready.\n\n~~~~~\n\nRules:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1gxgE0j3_JL-iGBM_qYJRWdueqC9WHTl_f85aB7lcvvo/edit?usp=sharing\n\n~~~~~\n\nA glimpse at some of the things made so far:\n\nCurrent \"Hero\" list (As well as a peek at some combat system-related details): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xYSD8Mj31P8neZk9Z4cS8V_-u03l0ZJSoCP7w9lY3Io/edit?usp=sharing\n\nA small document detailing parts of the city itself:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/19e0Qy9y-R46nP83cJfATHHt5kbVEvLS5-SGqoqYYcVs/edit\n\nApplications would need to have the following:\n\n* Basic character info such as name, age, city of origin, etc.\n* A power, discussed with an admin to make sure it fits. These are meant to be small or limited to reflect everyone starting from scratch with their newfound abilities\n* Backstory Synopsis. No you do not have to write a thesis on your character. Just a few paragraphs of basic history and motivations.\n* Completion of a quick 4-question Google form testing your RP aptitude. \n\n~~~~~\n\nI'd like to gauge people's interest in this, and possibly get some input. If your eyes have widened throughout this post, feel free to upvote and comment your interest in joining and I'd be happy to send you an invite! If you have some questions beforehand about specifics, ask them here and I'd be happy to answer! If you think it's a garbage idea, I mean...alright, not your thing, I can accept that!

            "selftext": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters should be 18+ \n\nHey there, it\u2019s been a while since I posted on here, but here I am!\nFor this roleplay I was hoping to find a partner who also cares a lot about the story &amp; character development. For this role-play it\u2019ll also be necessary for us both to take over other characters every now and then.\n\nThis roleplay takes place in 1944, near the end of WOII. Though the future is unsure, there\u2019s a lot of resistance among the people already. You and your friends were no exception. Existing out of a group of 4 young ex-soldiers, you were still located in Lille, but on your way to Paris. You and your 3 friends were no longer officially part of the army, though you all felt it was your mission to take down as many Nazi\u2019s as you could on your way to Paris. Basically you were on a killing spree.\nAll of you were young, strong and proud men. The day you were kicked out of the army for committing a war crime (you had handled one of the hostages a little too rough after finding out he was a nazi), you knew you had to do your part for the occupied countries, at least in some way. \n\nSo here you are, walking through the wet meadows in the middle of the night with gear you had gathered on your trip so far. \nIt\u2019s around 5 am when you finally recognized the outlines of what seemed to be a small village.\n\u201cDamn... finally...\u201d Rocco mumbles to himself, \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d He adds laughing a bit. \n\u201cYou think they got some home-made spaghetti for you?\u201d Tommy  jokes as he nudges Rocco. \u201cMan\u2026 shut up, not every Italian only eats spaghetti.\u201d He mumbles as he stops to light a cigarette for himself. He takes a long drag, tilts his head back to look at the sky \u2018please let them have at least some good food.\u2019 he prays to himself as he then cracks his knuckles and catches up with the group again. \n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan here boss? Do we just burst in and have some fun? As usual?\u201c \n\u201cOut.\u201d Rocco gets interrupted by Valerio. \n\u201cWhat...\u201d Rocco mumbles confused, caught off guard by the serious tone in Valerio\u2019s voice. \n\u201cPut it out...\u201d Valerio says again as he stops in his tracks and stares in the distance. \n\u201cPut WHAT out... I don\u2019t understand you if you don\u2019t fuc-\u201c Rocco gets more annoyed.\n\n\u201cShhh.\u201d Donny now joins the conversation as he too stares in the distance. \u201cPut your cig out, they can see us.\u201d He says as he squints his eyes, desperately trying to spot any movement behind the dark windows of the first block of houses.\nThe four of you drop down to the ground the second you hear the familiar noise of a car pulling up. It didn\u2019t take you long before you recognized the dark contour of a jeep coming out of the woods. \n\n\u2018\u2019Volkswagen K\u00fcbelwagen, Typ 82.\u2019\u2019 Valerio mumbles to himself as he studies the moving object in the dark.\n\u2018\u2019Germans\u2026?\u2019\u2019 Tommy whispers softly as he crawls a little closer to Valerio, clearly a bit nervous.\n\u2018\u2019What damn Englishman would name his car a K\u00fcbelwagen\u2026\u2019\u2019 Donny mumbles annoyed with Tommy\u2019s innocence. \n\n\u2018\u2019So what now\u2026 we taking them down\u2026?\u2019\u2019 Donny turns to Valerio as he quietly swings his rifle from across his back into his hands, clearly ready for some action.\n\u2018\u2019There\u2019s like five of them\u2026\u2019\u2019 Rocco mumbles as he counts the figures getting out of the car.\n\u2018\u2019Yeah and we\u2019re with four so it\u2019s like an almost even match.\u2019\u2019 Donny says as he crawls a little closer to the village.\n\u2018\u2019Tommy isn\u2019t as an even match, so we\u2019re with like\u2026 3 and a quarter.\u2019\u2019 Rocco mumbles as he lets out a small laugh.\n\u2018\u2019Thanks man\u2026 appreciate it.\u2019\u2019 Tommy mutters while trying to quietly load his gun.\n\n\u2018\u2019They\u2019re with four\u2026 one\u2019s not a soldier.\u2019\u2019 Valerio suddenly says after being quiet, he had been studying the group.\n\u2019\u2019Great. An even more almost even match.\u2019\u2019 Donny says excited as he now sits up a little more.\n\u2018\u2019Wait\u2026 let\u2019s follow them\u2026 They\u2019re not dressed up like this for a party with just the four of them.\u2019\u2019 Valerio says as he too gets his handgun ready and loads it.\n\u2018\u2019They\u2019re dressed up? We bout to crash a little nazi-party here?\u2019\u2019 Donny says excitedly as he crawls towards the vehicle. \n\u201cMaybe... but just be careful...\u201d Valerio says as he watches Donny make his way to the car rather quickly.\n\nOnce he safely reaches the car he quietly breaks one of the windows. \u2018\u2019These pigs are gonna be drunk as hell\u2026\u2019\u2019 He laughs as he pulls out one of the many empty liquor bottles laying around in the car.\n\n\u2018\u2019Oh well\u2026 these might come in handy\u2026\u2019\u2019 Valerio says as he pulls out a bunch of clothes from the back seat. \u2018\u2019Oh no way in hell... I\u2019m not going to put on those damn clothes\u2026\u2019\u2019 Donny instantly says as he watches Valerio unfold a bunch of German soldier uniforms. \u2018\u2019Relax\u2026 it\u2019s just so we won\u2019t stand out\u2026\u2019\u2019 He says as he hands Tommy a set. \n\u2018\u2019Listen to me man\u2026 I cannot.\u2019\u2019 Donny nearly spits out the words as he pins Valerio\u2019s shoulder against the jeep. \n\n\u201cConsider his family\u2026\u2019\u2019 Rocco steps in as he gently moves away Donny\u2019s hand. \u2018\u2019This uniform is the reason they\u2019re no longer\u2026 you know\u2026\u2019\u2019 Rocco says as he takes one of the uniforms for himself.\n\n\u2018\u2019Fine. But I\u2019m not risking losing one of my men just because he doesn\u2019t wanna put on a damn vest and trousers\u2026\u2019\u2019 Valerio says annoyed as he puts his set on. \u2018\u2019You wait outside, don\u2019t do anything stupid or noticeable because we won\u2019t be there to back you up.\u2019\u2019 He says as he grabs Donny\u2019s shoulder. Donny was clearly still annoyed but tried to take deep breaths. \u2018\u2019We will get them\u2026 I promise, all of them.\u2019\u2019 Valerio mumbles as he makes his way to the woods behind the houses, knowing you would stay somewhat out of sight this way while you were trying to find the source of all the laughter, music and, of course, German talking. \n\n\n[Hi! This is the intro so far. I tried to keep the post itself short,\n\nThe idea is that you choose to take over the role of one of the four above mentioned guys. I have a small summary of the 4 different personalities I can send you later on. Obviously once you\u2019ve chosen one we can change his name, appearance etc.\n\nI already have an idea of what could be an interesting encounter with my character AND I have an idea of how we could include mine in a long term roleplay. Obviously this is only relevant if you\u2019re interested. So if you are, feel free to send me a message on here and we can discuss any detail! :) I\u2019ll obviously give you more information about me if we move to PM\u2019s. ]",

Please don't be the second one. The worst feeling is having a wil whole world built in your mind just to have it die. \n\nAs stated in the title, I ask that anyone who wishes to participate be at least 18 years old, as my roleplays tend to have adult themes, and I enjoy writing adult themes. I also ask that my partner be willing and able to quite at least five sentences with proper grammar in their responses. I know some situations like dialogue require fewer, but I really would love a good amount of detail and descriptiveness. \n\nThe stories I like to write tend to have fantasy or sci fi elements, and the exact plots are opento discussion. I really enjoy writing stories with magic, superpowers, non-humans, and exciting, other worldly aspects. \n\nFinally, I enjoy talking with my roleplay partner outside of the roleplay itself, and have actually made some good friends through them. If that's not for you, no worries. We can keep it strictly to the story. \n\nIf you find any of this interesting, send me a message. If we hit it off we can move over to discord or kik or somewhere else entirely. \n\nThanks for reading!",

LINE is my preference but not required. \n\nI enjoy slice of life roleplays the most but if you talk to me you will learn quickly I am open to most things. I do enjoy angsty, heart break, break up and get back together type roleplays. I don\u2019t mind most any genre as long as romance is in the plot. I enjoy making up a plot and adding continuous subplots to keep things moving. I am available most days, and if that changes I will let you know. \n\nPlease feel free to PM me with your preferred genre(s) and your age. I am a literate partner and am looking for the same. I am new to all this so this alone is nerve wrecking to post.\n\nThank you for reading this and have a wonderful day/night.",
