I have done that because I have found that my favorite role-plays have come from world- and character- building with my partner of choice. C'mon, who doesn't want to create their own world from scratch? I know I do! Plus, I don't want anyone to feel even slightly limited by the thoughts in my mind. Quite literally, the sky ... well, in the case of Science Fiction ... outer space is the limit.\n\nIf any of this sounds interesting, bring on the reddish orange envelopes and flood my Inbox!\n\nI look forward to hearing from you! :)",

I've had lots of experience in large groups, AND 1 on 1s; but they always seem to be missing one key ingredient.. What that is, I'm not sure; but I've been chasing it.\n\nWhat I want in this roleplay:\n\n\u25a0Some mild gameplay elements, taking inspirations from table top games.\n\u25a0LGBT friendly (this is a must)\n\u25a0Chill people, who are looking for friends! That's really what this is about, a chance to make a small but close group of friends to hang out In-game, but also ooc in the chat.\n\u25a0Literate writers. No 1 liners please. \n\u25a019+ for age\n\n\nAs for world building and setting, I am very open to most things. But a few of my favourites are: Science Fiction (cyberpunk and space opera alike). Fantasy. Horror. \nI'm hoping we can build a neat universe together, I do have some ideas already as well. \n\nImportant note: I would like this server to be E R P friendly, so if that's an issue, it might not be the group for you.

            "selftext": "Ah, once freed from the clinging clutches of high school, young mages and (sentient) mythological creatures find their way to a place of true learning... but more importantly: decadence, violence, and adventure! Who even reads books at a college? No, this school is all about letting the students figure it out on their own, whatever \"it\" is.\n\nThe headmaster and teachers have no say about what goes down on campus, the student council runs the show with President Emperor McRadiance leading them. Their rule has reinstated a sort of hierarchical class structure where students will be sorted into different groups, from S (through A, B, C...) to F, based on their power and influence like some weird JRPG. Based on that, they get different privileges and obligations, making the whole system totally unfair. Some have expressed concerns over this system, but the ruthless seraphim of the hall monitor police department makes sure to quench socialist uprisings wherever they may occur (even outside of the hallways!). So a student's class dictates a lot about their living conditions, which dormitories they spend time in, what work they have to do for their superiors, and how many inferiors they can boss around. It also determines the amount of influence they get through the system of Democracy points, giving the top students much more power in proportion to their numbers. They also receive a larger sum of the school mandated scholarship in the only currency the council has deemed legal: Trading cards and colored dice! Yet, what would an unfair, unsafe and uninhibited college be without clubs? There are tons of them, from the black market arms dealers of the Caf\u00e9teria to the Card Printing Bank, from the shapeshifting Full Moon Scouts to the ominous Death Insurance Firm, from the exciting Dragonrider Club to the mysterious Masquerade, to mention but a few.\n\nSo what is one left to do, once the semester starts? Well, attend a lecture from a Norse God, flirt and/or fight with an eldritch horror, give the house elf a sock and lose the One Ring at a party. Maybe even bring a Demon Lord to prom? The sky isn't the limit as all the janitors have flying brooms, and are also witches that do very little actual cleaning.\n\nHi there! I'm looking for someone to play a student at this weird and, dare I say, anime-as-heck magical college/university. I'll only play with people 18+. This can be adult in certain senses, but I'm not aiming to make it saucy. It's more that certain adult themes are great sources to derive humour from. I take some inspiration from Monster Prom with this, it's so amazingly written. Anyone who's played or watched playthroughs gets a Golden Pentagram of Merit to equip from their inventory.\n\nI do have a lot of the setting figured out, the campus grounds for example are connected through portals over a dozen different worlds and there's two magic systems I won't tell you about right now, but I hope you'll find them unique. Gotta spare some details for later. Btw, this setting is LGBT-friendly and will have characters from a wide variety of backgrounds.\n\nOkay, so responses should contain the following: a short description of why you like this prompt and what kind of student you envision your character to be. Include which class you want to be in, think of this as a \"difficulty setting\" where my recommendation is B, S being god mode and where F is the Dark Souls of magical education. Important! Make your subject the name of the school in question so I know you've read this and agreed to the terms and conditions! It would be cool if your response has an in-character application to that school, but that's far from necessary. I will only play on Discord. I'll reply to everyone who messages me, but only through PMs, no chat.\n\nThink that's all, hope I hear from you soon!",

He is your average sweetie-pie hiding under a bad boy mask. He **is not** a good person by all means, but it's not his entire character. I had a partner before, but one thing came to another, and real life **always** come first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we start...\n\n**I WILL NOT RP ANY RISKY TOPICS/GENRE WITH ANYONE UNDER 18.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't mind any roleplay genre, but my two favorites are Angst and Gore. I LOVE writing out drama! I'm really just looking for someone to play with Kody, and develop a relationship between the two of them. He is Bisexual, so gender doesn't matter for a romance. I don't mind NSFW, limits and triggers can be discussed later.\n\nI am willing to rp via Discord, we can even make a server for our characters if you'd like.\n\nSome info about him on his [RPR](https://www.rprepository.com/site.php?char=107241).\n\nThank you for reading, and hope to meet someone soon!! &lt;3\n\n\\-Pinky",

            "selftext": "Hey all!\n\nThanks for stopping by to check out my first ever Reddit roleplay post!\n\nA little about me:\n\nMy name\u2019s Alexandria, or Alex for short! I have about two years of experience with third-person, multi-paragraph roleplay mainly based around original characters. I\u2019ve been lurking here for quite a long time trying to see if something caught my eye with little to no luck and decided it was finally time to make an ad of my own. I usually post anywhere between two to three paragraph posts and would greatly appreciate a partner that can match that.\n\nFor scheduling purposes, I reside in the U.S in the PST (UTC -8) and am mostly available in the early to late evenings. I have a full-time job, go to college, and have other hobbies so please understand that I will not be available every night. However, I will do my best to let you know what my availability is on a week to week basis or am completely open to a play by post arrangement. I enjoy getting to know my partners through OOC chat, trading memes, pictures, and ideas so if you\u2019re the kind of person that just likes to keep things restricted to the roleplay, I\u2019m probably not the partner for you.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a roleplay partner:\n\nFirst and foremost, I\u2019m looking for a partner that is passionate about roleplaying, writing, and just being creative. I\u2019ve seen so many posts on here where the main driving force behind an ad is boredom. I really would love to find people who care about their characters, the story, and the creative process of developing the growth of our characters, their relationship, and the world around them. I\u2019m looking for a potential partner that is 25+ as I\u2019m fast approaching 30 and find it hard to relate to partners that are younger than that. \n\nThemes and Scenarios:\n\nRomance! Romance! Romance! I am looking to weave a story revolving mainly around this theme. Does this mean this is the only theme I want included? Absolutely not! I\u2019m a firm believer that romance can be successfully combined with drama, fantasy, action, and some NSFW themes that I will only discuss in PMs. Now when I saw I want romance to be the main theme in the roleplay, this does not mean I want our characters hooking up on our second session. I want things to unfold naturally and a relationship to form organically.\n\nModern Law Enforcement:\n\nOCxOC \u2013 Let\u2019s choose an agency and pair our characters up to investigate some crimes! Would really love an opposites attract story for this, each character having their own strengths, weaknesses, and perspectives to add to their investigations. This is by no means necessary, but I thought it may be fun to add elements of fantasy to this. Maybe superhumans are becoming more and more commonplace and law enforcement pair a cop, FBI agent, or any other options we can think of with a character with powers to help lower the crime that is on the rise along with powers across the world.\n\nRiverdale:\n\nOC x OC / OC x Veronica Lodge \u2013 Let\u2019s add some new blood into small town with plenty of pep! I\u2019d absolutely love to play an original character across from Veronica Lodge, though I\u2019m also open to playing alongside another original character of your own. I\u2019m leaving these scenarios somewhat bare as I\u2019d like to develop them further with my potential partner.\n\nAre we the bad guys?\n\nOC x OC \u2013 I really like the idea of playing a pair of super-powered characters that have been forgotten and forsaken by their families, friends, and society. What will they have to do to survive? Do they get taken in by a villain who takes advantage of their situation and molds them into villains? The possibilities here are endless and I would absolutely love to hear any ideas you may have for it.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWell that wraps up my ad, if you have any questions or are interested in discussing one of these scenarios please send me a private message! Thanks so much for taking the time to read this all and I hope to hear from you soon!",

My character is the only person in the world with a power. His power isn't overwhelming so the RP won't entirely revolve around his power. Here's what you should expect from this RP:\n\n* Slice of life moments\n* Drama\n* 18+ themes (violence, etc.)\n* Romance (although this RP can be done without it)\n\nAnd here is what I expect from you:\n\n* 18+ in age\n* Literate\n* 2-3 responses per day. Bonus points for frequent responses. If you have life stuff going on that is preventing you from posting, tell me and I'll understand.\n* Friendly! OOC chat is just as fun as RP.\n\nThe setting is open to discussion. Could be a high school setting, a gang setting or many more settings. That's all I really have to say for this post! DM me and we'll iron out details further. Thanks for reading :)",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I\u2019ve been wanting to do fantasy style roleplay where the setting is unique individuals have the ability to use an element, or more than one element providing they aren\u2019t OP. I\u2019d like this to be long term, slow burn romance and with plenty of drama. Here is a little starter for anyone interested. \n\nElementals exist, no longer were they a myth or a legend but a well-known group of individuals who could control a single element whether it be Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Lightning, Darkness or Light. As the population of elementals increased a school was formed to train and allow these individuals to harness their abilities. Every year new students would arrive and enter a trial to see where they stood, a mock fight between two elementals that would let showcase the new generations power and ingenuity for all to see.\n\n\nThat is where this story will start, or rather on the train ride towards the school. So basically Y/C would meet Duke on the train and they would talk. Duke is an Elemental but is special, unlike most who can only harness one element he has the ability to harness Darkness as well as use Ice instead of water when needed. It would be awesome if your character could harness Light in addition to their main element. They would eventually find out that they are destined to be around one another whether it be as friends or more. Duke and Y/C would end up facing each other in the initial trial fight to see where they are placed and things would unfurl from there. \n\nI am completely open to any changes or suggestions you have, actually I love when my partner chips in and makes it unique with me.\n\nHope to hear from you ^.^\n\nIf I wasn\u2019t clear, this is 1X1 roleplay.

            "selftext": "# Havrion Online\n\nHello everyone! Let me introduce myself and plug an upcoming roleplaying venture. I am a long-time roleplayer who spent years on AOL in chat rooms, and now as an older adult I have found a new love in tabletop RP. What I find difficult to come across is D&amp;D and roleplay in a mixed fashion that satisfies all my needs. So I have been working to develop what the community calls a 'living world' -- a D&amp;D based system where quests, campaigns, and roleplay are all intermingled and affect one another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Havrion Online, I am working towards building a persistent world where people can create a fully dimensional character and engage them in the world in whatever way they like! We're seeking to feature campaigns, quests, PvP duels, PvE arena fights against perilous monsters, an active roleplaying community (yes, gain XP by simply roleplaying and developing your character through the art of writing), crafting, guilds, businesses!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes it's a lofty venture, and even if it doesn't become a massive behemoth, I'm also quite content with a smaller group delving into the world of Havrion. Anyway, if you're interested in D&amp;D, roleplaying, and just having fun -- send me your discord tag for an invite (Invites will probably be sent out Friday, April 5th). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is a link to a google form to submit your interest! Feel free to DM me with any questions!\n\n [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10tdqqT6Ei2Aj25s-rT5nK0TEtTVO0ItpBf9wHI-D\\_ZY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10tdqqT6Ei2Aj25s-rT5nK0TEtTVO0ItpBf9wHI-D_ZY) ",

            "selftext": "It was another cold autumn day in paradise, if you can label a college town with not much to do paradise. There was a too common chill in the air that made for perfect sweater weather, however my arms were bare and bruised and a sweater was no where in sight. I take a moment to gaze up at the sky, looking into the stars and losing myself briefly. In an instant, the sound of the roaring crowd and grunts of angry and tired football players snapped me back into reality. I take my position under center and prepare to snap the football to run out the clock. \n\n\"Hit!\" I yell, and the ball comes to my hands as I kneel down to end the game. It was the 4th straight win for us, putting us at a perfect 4 - 0 to start the season. \n\nI proceed through the usual handshakes and 'good games' that follow, all the meanwhile focusing my attention on the crowd. In what almost feels like an impromptu game of 'Where's Waldo?', I struggle to find what I'm searching for. I quickly give a handshake to the nearest opposing player before rushing over to the sideline to get a better view. After a few seconds of searching, I finally spot what I'm looking for. \n\nThere in all it's glory, is my sweater. More importantly, there is my sweater providing warmth and comfort to the girl of my dreams. I smile as our eyes meet, moving along the sideline to get closer. I initially laugh at the sight of my oversized sweater over you, but then I remember whose underneath again and my heart skips a beat. Seeing you in my sweater on a cold day brings me more warmth then any piece of clothing ever could.\n\n\"Let me shower and change real quick and I'll meet you up there, don't move,\" I yell loud enough for you to hear.\n\n...................................\n\nHello! This is just a sample of my writing to give you an idea what I'm looking for. We don't have to include this and I am fine with switching to 3rd person as well. I also prefer Discord.\n\nI'm looking for a fun slice of life roleplay based in a college setting. I was thinking of a 'popular superstar guy meets unpopular girl' type of thing but I'm open to changing it. I'm a fairly open guy so if you want to take it a more darker or smuttier route, or even if you want to take this a totally different path feel free to bring forth any ideas you may have, I'm just looking for someone to write with.\n\nIf this sounds like something you'd be interested in send me a message, I look forward to hearing from you!\n",

That's certainly not what I mean. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I *do* mean when it comes to this little light-hearted craving, is that I'm looking for a kind of warm and fuzzy vibe. That isn't to say there won't be drama - what good is a story without it? But, I'm thinking a slice of life deal with some cliches, stereotypes, and everything in between. Let's go for all the cheese. Let's make a Hallmark movie, eh? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, a Hallmark movie that isn't afraid to get into NSFW themes. This is going to be an 18+ RP, so...please be 18+, alright? It's just better for everyone. Sorry kiddos. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a *very* basic idea in mind, and I'm always happy to hear different ones, or work with a partner who is willing to bounce ideas off each other. Please don't take this little blurb as an indicator of my writing ability. I assure you, my standard posts are much more detailed: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**He's a recently-discharged Army veteran in his mid-twenties. He grew up on a Christmas tree farm in (insert snowy small town here - can be real or fictional), raised by his Uncle after his parents passed away in a car accident. She's a city gal who has always loved the rhythm of a busy environment. What happens when her car breaks down in that snowy town, and she finds herself knocking on the door of the old farmhouse?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, lots of options to play with here. Things that immediately come to mind include her being in a serious relationship, or maybe he's not discharged from the military and is just home on leave, and has to go back, etc. As I said, I definitely want drama and story-building, but I've been craving something a little more cliche. You into it? Let's do it. ",

Dressed in an elegant gown Ellie had made the effort to get dressed up, red bottom heels, makeup perfect and a dress that cost more than most peoples monthly wage. Just because you were eating alone was no excuse not to be immaculate. As the meal finishes she stands and places the plates back on the room service cart and walks out onto the balcony. The City by night was beautiful, lights and sounds of a City that never sleeps below her from her high position in the cool night air. So many possibilities so much to excite her out there.\n\nThe place was new to her and yet felt so intimately familiar, one city was very much like another when you dug into its underbelly. The world over was not that different when you really got down to it and people were not as different as they liked to think. The same pattern of lusts and desires are universal and Ellie takes advantage of every single one of them. \n\nOstensibly she is an independent contractor for the oil industry but this is not a job she has actually done in years. She had found what she truly enjoyed doing and used the money from her job and her, extra-curricular activities, had made her travel and lifestyle easy enough. So eyeing up the city she wonders what sort of trouble she could get into. After all the life of a travelling Psychopath was just filled with possibilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey all. Thanks for reading. This one is a little bit different to my previous posts as this one is very much in a darker frame of mind, Inspired by the Thomas harris books and other such writers Ellie is a social, clever, sophisticated woman about the world and is beautiful, its just a shame that she is a sociopath. She is dark and twisted and violent, using her feminine charms to get what she wants, which is money, physical intimacy, and violence.\n\nSo who are you, I doubt you want to be a victim as that doesn\u2019t end well. but are you someone she knows? A stranger that caught her eye? How does she hide what she is from you. how does she keep herself from letting her inner demon run wild on you, and what does that restraint mean for her real victims?\n\nNeedless to say this is an 18+ rp due to very dark themes as well as possible other nsfw content. \n\nI hope to hear from you.\n\nEllie xxxxxxxx",

            "selftext": "Gaia Reborn, the hottest MMORPG of the last decade, has seen millions of players experience its unique world - a combination of fantasy and reality. When Gaia Reborn was a game, one goal was to make the game world a one-half scale model of the real world. This pursuit was known as the Half-Gaia Project, and it is one of the aspects which led to Gaia Reborn becoming such a popular virtual world. With regional servers having unique areas, quests, cities, and monsters, it wasn't uncommon for people to create alternate characters on other servers to experience what felt like an entirely new game.\n\nTen years after the game's launch, millions of players have joined and created countless characters across the many servers. Now, with the release of the latest expansion, Pioneers of Arcadia, many are getting ready to begin new adventures in the new Italian server, exploring the new region corresponding to Italy, known in Gaia as the Enlightened Republic. Characters would have to start from fresh in this new world, but Italy would finally get its own piece of this world.\n\nCountless players created their characters, logged in with excitement fueling, and then... darkness... Everything was black, and as their eyes opened, the players found themselves outside in an unfamiliar city. Looking around to survey their surroundings, many players realized this city was not so new after all. While desolate and ruined, the architecture conquered by vines and greenery, this city was unmistakably Rome, but at the same time, it was not. Finding themselves in the bodies of their characters, trapped in the world of Gaia Reborn, players are left to adapt to their new reality in this fantasy world.\n\n**What is Gaia Reborn?** Gaia Reborn is a roleplaying forum taking place in a \"Trapped In An MMORPG\" style of setting, in which players find themselves in the bodies of their characters, awoken in the game world. With no idea what has happened, or how they were brought here, players are left to adapt to this new world and write their own stories. Want to become a merchant, crafting and selling equipment for other adventurers? Maybe you wish to go out and seek glory by conquering raid dungeons alongside other thrill-seeking players. Perhaps your dream is to found a guild and rally adventurers for whatever cause you might have. The choice is yours in this dynamic roleplaying forum. In this forum, players can get stronger and unlock skills just like in any other MMORPG, using word count as EXP. However, Gaia Reborn runs off of a levelless system similar to that of The Secret World, so as to prevent a level gap between the stronger veteran players and the weaker new players. We have taken inspiration from many sources and built upon them to improve where we can. Some of our sources include the MMORPGs The Secret World and Mabinogi, as well as the anime series Log Horizon and Sword Art Online.\n\n**Where can I sign up?** We encourage you to join our Discord server, which you can find [right here!](https://discord.gg/GhtVbn9) The Discord is a great way to get to know some of our members, find help if needed, and to learn more about the forum! However, if you would like to find the forum itself, you can find our website over here: [Gaia Reborn](http://gaia-reborn.proboards.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe look forward to seeing you all join our community, and we are all excited to finally share this project with you, as it has been over two years in the making!",

            "selftext": "Looking for folks interested in putting the \u201cRoleplay\u201d back into tabletop RPGs.\n\nHi there, I\u2019m looking to put together an online, text-based D&amp;D 5e game with a heavy focus on Roleplay and player interaction. I feel like D&amp;D is such a great medium to build characters, plots, and adventures. I\u2019m searching for people interested in both aspects of a 5e game. Putting together the characters, adventuring, leveling, exploring dungeons will all be a part of it. But, at the same time, the discussions between the characters and the roleplay that happens between the party will be just as important. I\u2019d like to build a campaign where occasionally a session may be nothing more than a discussion around the campfire or the conversations that happen on a long day of travel. Sometimes, D&amp;D can miss out on these elements in favor of killing the next cluster of monsters. But, really, the characters and the interactions between them can be just as important and rewarding.\n\n\nThis is going to be a fully DMed, normal game of D&amp;D. There will be leveling and exploring and classic tabletop combat. I want it to be all the things we all love about tabletop RPGs, just with the sweet, added layer of a heavy RP experience on top of it. As such, I\u2019m really looking for roleplayers and writers who really want to use the 5e system for storytelling. \n\nSo, here are a few things I\u2019m looking for in prospective players:\n\nSome familiarity or desire to learn D&amp;D 5e rules and mechanics.\nCommitment to a weekly session time, specifics to be decided.\nDesire to fully build and roleplay a character in a collaborative environment.\n\nAs for some details about myself, I\u2019ve been Roleplaying for about a decade. A good portion of that has been as a DM in both online and in-person campaigns. While I love playing tabletop with people around an actual table, I find that doing it virtually through text makes the RP experience much better. Let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s easier to stick to a character in writing. The specific setting I had in mind is a world I\u2019ve built up a little bit; But, it is also one with plenty of room for player input. If you\u2019d like to hear more about it, please shoot me a message. \n\nIf any of this seems like it would be interesting, send me a DM. I\u2019m looking to build a party of maybe five or so players, so don\u2019t be shy.\n",

I\u2019ve been playing a lot of it, obviously, and have been dreaming up what I might do if I were writing more for the games.\n\nThen I decided to come here, fetch a partner looking for something extremely long term and in depth, and not bother with the whole \u201cgetting a job at Ubisoft and working my way up the AC dev team\u201d thing.\n\nSo here we are! And here is my vision:\n\nYou. Me. Maybe a group if we want but unlikely. Writing. A lot. Historical settings, the modern day, Assassins and Templars, and an endless struggle. All in our hands.\n\nWe sift through the games and decide what lore to keep. We create new, modern protagonists, and envelop them in a story. We create their ancestors, each of which will have their own individual stories to play before being retired and moving to new ancestors in new time periods. We go on as long as we want. We end it by wrapping up our modern day of and when we decide to.\n\nIf this sounds cool, hit me up! I can lay out my writing style and my availability and if it squared away, I\u2019ll give you my discord, we\u2019ll create a server (to keep it all organized) and get writing!\n\nPM me!",

Any gender will do honestly, but I am looking for people that can play as female characters.\n\nPost length isn't really an issue, post as much as you like!\n\nBefore I proceed further I think it's worth mentioning that I prefer mature themes? Naturally every character involved with nsfw stuff will be over 18, but I just thought it was worth mentioning in advance.\n\nI'm OOC friendly, I don't mind it! I think most of us are here to make friends after all.\n\nMy fandom list is pretty much a mile long I have to admit, so naturally everything I list won't have a plot already in mind. We can discuss plots and share ideas for all of them really, even the one I already have a plot listed for! My ideas are merely suggestions after all!\n\nFandoms-\n\nMarvel: I'm a huge fan of both Marvel and DC. I read comics, I've seen pretty much all the movies and watched a majority of the cartoons... so pretty much anything is on the table!\n\nDC: Okay unlike my other ideas, this one I'm actually craving to do. I've had this idea for months and had a good run with somebody but real life got in the way and they can't continue it. I'd love to give it another go! It involves my OC Shadow Spider getting transported into the DC universe and forced to make a new life for himself there, essentially having to start over. Meeting various characters from the DC universe and forming romances as well, along with fighting some villains and meeting other heroes in the DC universe. If that's not your cup of tea though, I understand. And yes, GMs are welcome! :)\n\nSaints Row\n\nHarry Potter: Perhaps an AU? What if Harry wasn't the chosen one...?\n\nNaruto:\n\nStar Wars\n\nAlright that's about everything I have to say, if you've got any questions or if I managed to capture your interest please feel free to message me!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nToday I am in the mood for some good old-fashioned procrastinations in the face of final exams. More specifically, of course, I'm looking to RP instead of studying physics!\n\nI'm very interested in fantasy settings right now, through various themes. It could be fandom universes like Game of Thrones, or the Witcher universe, and as for originals I can honestly go with any time period that you want! The ancient world, maybe the dark ages, or late medieval, renaissance, or even Victorian and modern eras are all totally fine in my book! We could even explore other cultures like ancient Indian, Arabic, or East Asian history rather than sticking to just Europe.\n\nI like to think at least that I have the very basic of knowledge to not become too anachronistic to break immersion or anything like that, but at the same time I am by no means an expert on history, so please bear with me making mistakes every now and then.\n\nNow, on to some RP ideas!\n\nIf you like a more \"overt\" fantasy setting, where magic and supernatural occurrences are somewhat common, I like the idea of playing a type of rabid/feral fantasy creature. Something along the lines of maybe a vampire who was only turned very recently, or being possessed in some way. This would lead to my character being captured for both his own and everyone else's safety, along with an opportunity to find out what exactly happened to him, and this could lead nicely into a fun action and adventure story.\n\nThe other thing is more specific to Game of Thrones, but I suppose it could fit into most other themes too. If you prefer a somewhat more character-focused story, this could mainly be a romance story between our two characters. I was envisioning something involving a woman of a high social class, could be a queen or princess, or lady/duchess/whatever title it may be, and my character being of decidedly lower status. Maybe not quite a peasant unless you want him to be, but low enough to not have an important last name, and not own any land either I think. I like the taboo aspect of this, and I think that could be a lot of fun also.\n\nIf you want to talk some more, you can PM me on here, and then if you prefer we can move to Discord as well.\n\nHope to talk to you soon, and have a nice day!",

Purgatory, is a large and wondrous city, combining the massive tech giants and skyscrapers of New York City and Tokyo, while also having the rustic and loving nature of Paris or Mexico City.

I use discord and write in third person, and I\u2019m multi-paragraph (typically one to three) and I\u2019m looking for some long term partners! Reddit is really spotty with partners and I\u2019ve been ghosted more times than I can count, so if you can\u2019t be consistent please don\u2019t apply and waste both of our times! NSFW themes are to be a part of this roleplay so you MUST be 18 or over. \n\nNow into the fun stuff! \n\nI\u2019m looking for plots that are of the ancient type... or at least old. I play female characters, however for a long-term and interesting plot there are probably going to have to be side characters in which I can play males. \n\nAncient Egypt: For this one I\u2019m thinking maybe my character is a demi-god. Not OP or anything, but a princess who has some sort of magical gift or ability. Your character (male or female) can be a warrior, a guard, or another prince or princess! \n\nAncient Greece or Rome: This would probably not have as many fantasy elements, and more gore. The capital could be pressing heavier taxes into the country side, and my character could be a simple farm girl who goes to the city to plead for some leeway on her parents property where the catches the eye of a politician or a politicians daughter.\n\nRenaissance Italy: This could involve a plethora of wealthy families intertwined with one another, as well as characters taking part of the arts. Actors, painters, writers.. for this I was thinking that my character is the daughter of a wealthy Cardinal and he hires your character (a painter) to paint my character and they fall in love. \n\nAncient China or Mongolia: This one is a lot more vague and could go a bunch of different routes. Mythology, some magical elements, lots of war and bloodshed. \n\nIf you have any other ideas you\u2019d like to share, please send me a message and we can talk further there! I hope to hear back! ",

            "selftext": "We all long to be a superhero, to fly the skies with a moral code as unyielding as steel and a punch that punch that could level city blocks. To shoot laser beams from our eyes that could rival the intensity of the sun or to be able to absorb the energy of an exploding thermonuclear weapon unscathed. Well guess whose been watching too much My Hero Academia and is ready to help see those dreams fulfilled! Hi everyone, 20-something you old generic reddit user with too much time on their hands here! If what you seek is something a mix of aforementioned anime and DC-Marvel comics, a universe where metahumans, fantasy races, aliens, monsters, and humans live side by side with one another look no further! Seeking a complex world bound by the politics of a superhuman society and the safety of those who reside in this world? High thrills, ground-up adventures from schooling to the big leagues? To confront villains and meet heroes whose views on society force you to reevaluate what it means to live in a society where rule of law under a just society is balance with the need to prevent supervillain crime at all costs? Shuffles script around Then you have come to the right place!\n\nWhat i'm looking for is pretty flexible from superhero beginnings (think My Hero, going to school to become a superhero), Hero-and-sidekick adventures (more established in the world already), or even follow the tale of a 'Quirkless' who, unlike a certain green-haired Protag, somehow stuns the world by attending a superhero school without ANY abilities! Im free and flexible to whatever ideas you have in mind, even the relationship between heroes and villains (though I do have a particular hankering for Fledgling-Pro hero relations). What matters is that I want to spend a long, long time discussing the origins of this world, the society, the effects of heroes and morality in the modern era, exploring the limits of superpowers both quirky and age-old, and building a menagerie of detailed characters who can serve as protagonists, allies, friends, family, villains, competition, and more! I don't expect to be able to play more than 1 character reliably without slowing things down but if you are interested I will do my absolute best to bring the world to you and flesh it out in a timely fashion! We can discuss our own main characters personality, morals, powers, costume, and backstory to as much length as we need to 'become' the superhero! How exciting!\n\nAt heart, i'm a novice worldbuilder who would much rather discuss the pros and cons of what these characters bring to society. My favorite themes are slice of life, romance, hero origin stories, and gritty underworld vs. bright overworld situations. Romance is a major plus for me and i'm happy to play all genders! Depending on how dark the undertones of this world are, be prepared for everything but dont fret if you're squeamish because I can tone things down if need be! I tend to reply with 2-4 paragraphs so i'm terribly sorry if you send 10+ paragraphs and I cant match it, i'm just not as skilled as i'd like to be in that situation but I will do my very best!\n\nAdditionally, do note that this is also an opportunity for something of a friendship! I've found in the past that roleplaying with someone can be an excellent way to really be intimate and really learn about a person! Be as casual as you like, express your personality, and feel free to shoot the for casual! One of the best parts about roleplay is learning about who is on the other side of the screen! Discord and reddit work just as well for me! Start off by telling me your favorite color, your favorite superhero, food, anything! With that all said and done, I hope to see you all soon! :D",

            "selftext": "Heyoooo~ As the title says, I'm extremely interested in a Power Ranger-esque RP. The genre is known as henshin which means \"transform\" in Japanese. Basically, the hero is a normal person who can transform into an armored form to take on evil at any moment!\n\nI would enjoy an RP based on the idea of different forms we can take. It can be based on any series you like that has transformations like Dragon Ball, Naruto, Ultraman, Kamen Rider or something original! I have LOADS of idea, everything from alien parasites to holy armor, so we can have any kind of adventure we like!\n\nI'm fine with anything you want to do. Just don't be too OP of course lol, fights don't mean much when you can one hit everything.\n\nWe can have any kind of genre from slice of life to post apocalypse. We don't even have to fight! A fun idea could be disaster helpers who have different forms to deal with fires, earthquakes, toxic waste, etc. Wholesome, right?\n\nI'm also up for other ideas like the title says since I'm sure not everyone is into this. Some other ideas are video games, anime, adventuring a la Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider/Uncharted, horror like Fatal Frame, Silent Hill and Resident Evil, historical, especially Revolutionary War, Civil War, ancient China, feudal Japan and others. If you can suggest it, I'll probably like it!\n\nAnywho, that's about it! Sorry if this was short and a bit strange but never too good at this, hehe. I'm more than happy to start and help control the RP. Just tell me if you want anything though, I want us both to have the most fun we can!\n\nHope to see some people soon. Have a wonderful day/night!",

I have the ability to reply at least once, if not more, in a day. Please don't let this be a deterrent. Another thing -- I absolutely love OOC chatter and I try to communicate regularly even if we aren't writing back and forth.\n\nI only write using Discord!\n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the plot. Dialogue is generally shorter; however, I am not against writing three to four paragraphs if the moment in the plot calls for it. I will not write with anyone who uses first person.\n\nI will write any gender in any pairing. I am comfortable with writing NSFW themes but I ask that you are eighteen or older because I don't particularly like the idea of going to jail.\n\nMy plots will always include romance because I absolutely adore it and I will never tire of writing it. However, I am particularly fond of slowburn romance as frustrating as it can become! The genres I am searching for are post-apocalypse, dystopia, slice-of-life, and others. I don't shy away from the dark and gritty themes either. Throw me all the angst and pain. I absolutely love discussing plot and characters so I don't have any particular plots in mind as of now. It's something we should create to become our own.\n\nThe only three fandoms that I currently am interested in writing about are Harry Potter and The Walking Dead.\n\nI'm currently searching for some plots but I'm open to more --\n\n\u2022 A study abroad trip where the one studying abroad is paired with a native to the country\n\n\u2022 A 'country boy' romance aesthetic because I've been listening too far too much Taylor Swift recently\n\n\u2022 A zombie, or natural disaster, apocalypse plot\n\n\u2022 Harry Potter slice of life in Hogwarts because I'm rereading the series! Preferably in modern times.\n\nI don't know if I missed anything. Chances are I did. However, if my post intrigues you, feel free to send me a little orange envelope! Try to intrigue me, too, please, where I feel more compelled to reply.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "A mere two years after civilization collapsed due to the biological warfare attacks on North America, only a 0.6% of the population is suspected to still be living. At least in the breathing, talking, non-flesh craving, kind of living. There are a numerous groups spread across the US, who are banding together to try and rebuild what was left of civilization. But not everyone plays by the rules that were once a part of everyday life, all of those laws were left in the old world. This is the new world. Where survival of the fittest is most every leaders motto. As a survivor in the post apocalyptic world, you will be put to the test to prove that you are strong enough, fast enough, loyal enough, and that you have enough of those killer instincts in your veins to make you a use to the leaders of these groups. The world was a terrifying place before the demise of a working society, now, the savagery that goes on outside and inside the safe gates of your compound, makes the world a living nightmare. \n\n\nLooking for a roleplay partner for this scenario, you can be male or female, it doesn't matter to me. Your character is completely up to you, I like to give others their own freedom. I prefer to roleplay in third person, as it helps with adding in side characters that would add to the roleplay a bit. If you're interested, please send me a message. I usually roleplay on Kik, so that'd be my preferred place. ",

When you first join you create your monster and it can be whatever you want it to be. It\u2019s a slice of life more or less where we just go through the cycles of being a somewhat normal teenager. You get sorted into one of possible four houses depending on your characters creation.\n\nAs for myself I\u2019m 18+ and would love for my partner to be as well so that way if our characters do fall for each other we can actually do something with them if we desire.\n\nI\u2019m currently in training to become a drone pilot so during the week my replies will have to wait until 5 PM mountain standard time. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested just DM me!",

I have been RPing for 17 years now (Since the time of the Yahoo Instant Messenger RPs!...before they got rid of the user rooms).\u00a0\n\nI have been searching for someone who can Roleplay as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. But heres the catch. I use an Original Character...but fear not! I don't make Mary Sue characters and I have been working on a full bio for my OC that I use just for the Dragonball franchise. It would be post Frieza Saga and go off in an Alternate Universe (no Trunks and the androids will probably come but it'll end up different) and it WILL be a romance! With action and adventure. Fights will be slightly included but if it gets too long we can time skip and try to figure out who is the winner between the characters.. Any more questions about this don't be afraid to ask me!\n\nNow, Rules... I am pretty lienient when it comes to Roleplays. Some literacy is a MUST. Of course we all make grammar mistakes (I know I make quite a bit as I look at myself typing this out lol). I do Semi paragraph to multi paragraph replies and starting posts as well full of detail. I would hope and wish that someone out there would be willing to do the same. also, this is in 3rd person. This will be romance like I have stated..but if you need to do a time skip through the lovey dovey bits please dont hesitate to tell me and we can time skip. Also...please DO NOT GOD MOD. its annoying.. Also...PLEASE BE ACTIVE. I know real life gets in the way and I'm understanding of that (trust me I work 40 hours a week I understand lol) I LOVE fast repliers they make me really happy trust me. If you get uninterested please just let me know I wont be mad I promise. also..PLOTTING. I love to plot out an idea that you might have or I might have before installing it into the RP. also about my OC I can tell you alot more about her if you are interested and I can even supply artwork of her as well.\n\nWell that seems to be the lot of it! I think I remembered everything...I hope I remembered everything lol. But please if you are interested hit me up with a PM or comment here and please don't be shy to ask me questions! I am always happy to answer any questions regarding everything I'm looking for. I hope I hear from someone!! Thanks!\n",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm 21/F from the UK, but I work nightshifts so technically my schedule matches up more with those across the globe. I've been roleplaying for 10+ years now and have got a story line in mind that I am itching to do! I was looking on pinterest the other day and came across this prompt:\n\n\\*You find a box of glass orbs with names on them. You accidentally drop one. As it shatters, a person appears.\\*\n\nMy idea was that the orbs were created by a powerful mage and used to imprison dangerous people or creatures hundreds of years previous. Whether they are intentionally dangerous or unfortunately just had trouble controlling their unstable powers is up to you. It is possible that there are political prisoners amongst them (royalty held for ransom and forgotten about, ect), I want to leave that choice up to you. \n\nYour character would obviously be a prisoner inside of one of these orbs and is accidentally let loose by my character. Because of the lengthy imprisonment I was thinking it would make sense that your character would have some memory loss of the events leading up to their capture. That way it would be interesting to unfold the picture as we go along. If you have another idea or suggestions, Id love to hear them.\n\nAs for the world, I've created a foundation. Think of Game of Thrones, Dragon Age and The Witcher (Without other races and limited magical creatures, thought it can be discussed). Medieval, dark and gritty full of NSFW themes. I've written a short introduction:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*The Kingdom of Greyrest has long been renowned for its superstitious natives, treacherous wilderness and ongoing state of anarchy. While King Forchard exists only to be comatose on his death bed, his three children fight for his rusting crown, each child more than willing to pry it from the dead fingers of their competition, disregarding their blood ties. Meanwhile, their Kingdom is left in a state of disarray while their attention is elsewhere, their heart filled with greed and lust while their nation bleeds.\n\nIt is a rare occasion when the peasants of Greyrest seek justice from an authority figure, only ever doing so if they have a heavy coin purse to spare, it is simply not how things are done. Rather, they pursue justice for themselves through bloodshed, knowing better than to tangle themselves in a corrupt web of politicians, judges and noblemen who would likely disregard their case to begin with. Unsurprisingly, gangs, thieves, bounty hunters, unscrupulous nobles and illustrious mages run rampant through the land, trying to make their own way in life until a new King or Queen ascends to the throne and tightens the leash.\n\nOur story begins with a twenty year old apprentice named Wendel, grandson of the great Alchemist Ivonias, who was as intelligent as he was deadly. Upon receiving word that his grandfather had passed on to the afterlife, he set about hiring a bodyguard to aid him in retrieving his vast inheritance. They set out on the seven-day trek towards the Alchemists tower, Wendel barely able to mount his horse as they left the capital city of Ilithorn.\n\nExhausted and aching from the long journey, Wendel and his bodyguard arrived and the young apprentice produced a golden key. The tower contained riches beyond Wendels wildest dreams. His mother would no longer need to work the damp street corners at night to feed her family and thus his younger brothers would no longer cry themselves to sleep at night with empty bellies. He could even bribe the guards at the labor camp to release his father. The young lads fantasies clouded his vision until a knife was roughly jabbed through the back of his skinny throat. Collapsing onto the wooden floor, clutching at the spewing wound on his neck, Wendel lay in a pool of red. His bodyguard, or thief and killer, stood above him, wiping their bloodied hands on their cloak.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the first post I write, my character (the thief) will come across the orbs. I don't mind what gender you play and I am also willing to play whatever fits best. I don't mind romance, but its not necessary. If you have stayed with me thus far, I am looking for a partner who:\n\n\\- Will write multiple, literate and detailed paragraphs. 3rd person\n\n\\- Won't shy away from NSFW themes\n\n\\- Writes on discord (I only use discord)\n\n\\- Likes to communicate OOCly\n\n\\- Doesn't mind brainstorming and helping me world build!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, please send me a message, id love to hear from you. Maybe send me a few ideas on what/who you would like your character to be?",

            "selftext": "Hello there, I am opening a Reddit-based [Marvel roleplay](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelComicsRoleplay/), using content and lore from the established universe. Of course, the roleplay game is based in an alternate timeline (Earth-1219), so as to differentiate and allow creative freedom. It isn't a competitive roleplay, rather a storytelling one, where our main goal is to allow our writers/players to write and create stories within a fun, popular setting. [I've written some of the lore on there already, check it out if you want.] Every few months, a new storyline will be written to compliment the direction in which users have taken the story and introduce a bigger saga. The first saga will revolve around Inhumans, Kree and power sources-- as well as establishing characters and teams. As you probably guessed, most of the characters will be custom ones, your creations, though organisations are lore-based (for example, you may play a Sorcerer Supreme, just not Stephen Strange).\n\nFinally, I am looking for moderators, especially one or two who know how to code on Reddit, and one or two who know the Marvel universe well. Even if you don't, it is still a lot of fun. As for people who simply want to roleplay, you may subscribe and we will announce when it actually opens.",

A forbidden love between two races....\n\nHowever.....\n\nThat isn\u2019t the case for our protagonists. Our two heroes are not the true evil as everyone paints them to be. No, these two heroes live among those that are seen as wicked creatures. The werewolves, vampires, goblins, orcs and many more. These two protagonists come from two different races, but know they have to do whatever it takes to not only save their side of the kingdom, but the world itself.\n\n\nHey everyone. I was thinking of doing a sort of different take on a fantasy roleplay where we could both play as either a warrior or a mage who would help around the people who are always seen as \u201cthe bad guys.\u201d \n\nIf romance were to occur, I think it would be pretty nice to have the human male fall for the female orc. \n\nIf you want this roleplay to have more of the SoL, feel free to let me know.\n\nSend me a message if you\u2019re interested in developing the story. Maybe the human could be elven or a vampire and the female could be an orc or a gorgon.\n\n\nI am 21+ and my time zone is GMT-5.\n\nIf you want to practice your roleplay skills or worldbuilding skills, we could work things out.\n\nI\u2019m not picky about the length of the reply. I do not mind NSFW elements, but if you prefer a fade to black, I\u2019m totally fine with it.\n\nI do hope for a partner that would be in it for the long run and willing to be very communicative.",

            "selftext": "Hey All\n\nFirstly id like to get this warning out the way, this world is the culmination of 8 years of brainstorming, movie watching, deviantart browsing and youtube binging, and i feel like im ready to put it out here... hopefully to get some responses.\n\nFirstly this will be a massive post, im literally gonna be posting that entire world in this one post, so brace for a lot of reading.\n\nThis story takes inspiration from RWBY, Animorphs, Fast And Furious (particularly tokyo drift, and not for the reason your thinking), Sword Art Online, Skyrim Elder Scrolls, Japanese &amp; Chinese History, that K/DA Music video, Hunger Games (again not for the reason your probably thinking), attack on titan (no not that reason) and Avatar the last airbender.\n\n***BEGIN WORLD OPENING***\n\nMy world is set in the year 2029, in a completely different timeline to our own universe, in this universe, instead of Britain colonizing most of todays countries, and giving forth to the majority of western culture, its the opposite, the most prominent culture now is eastern culture, the generalised genre for the whole word, is dystopian future, with Neon-punk themes, Japanese culture and technology mixed in with magic.\n\nThe rp takes place in the city of Koracalci, a bustling city on the edge of the capital city of central Australia, all countries developed with major advanceds in technology thanks to the eastern culture fronting the advanced of technolgoy, so most captial cities were in the centre of the landmass.\n\nAustralias captial city was appropriately named Uluru, and was divided into 6 sections, each with a verying demographic of lifestyles, ages, gender and wealth, the center section, being section one, was the wealthiest and consisted mostly of high rise buildings and highly dense cityscapes, the further out you went, the more the life style changed from buisness to industrial to agriculture.\n\nThis world as peaceful as it seemed is no without conflict, in this timeline eastern culture fronted the advances in colonizing because of their knowledge of the Shadoub\u012bsuto (\u30b7\u30e3\u30c9\u30a6\u30d3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8) or Shadow Beast, these creatures are believed to be of a hive mind, seeking out to destroy what humanity has created and return the earth to its natural state, observations and studies have indicated that pollution draws the Shadow Beasts in, due to their black and oozy like appearance, they have been given the common name of Tarrs, they appear in forms of natural earth creatures to mythical beasts.\n\nHumanity, naturally always pushing to advanced themselves, made no action to reduce pollution, they simply built walls around their cities and defended themselves as need be, which created an area of no mans land outside the city walls, called the Shadow Zone, but another side affect of this was the unrest among the population of those cities the political, religious, ethical and cultural differences begun to divide the people, furthering the dividing of the cities to not just physical, but symbolic aswell.\n\nHumanity is not the same either as the humanitiy we have in our world, in this world, Humans are born with a spirit animal, and not in the symbolic sense, but a literal sense, each spirit animal is unique to that person, different in appearance, colour, personality and power, each spirit animal also has an elememt its linked to, as time goes by one can learn to harness and control their spirit animal and element, pushing themselves to a stage where they can physichally become their spirit animal, or their animal embodied by their element.\n\nThe more one masters their spirit animal, the more it becomes physichally shown, because only so many animals exist, different tribes and factions were form, congregating those of similar animal spirits, these soon became known as the Anamalia Factions, which ill get to soon, the physical display of one mastering their spirit animal is in the form of naturally occurring tribal like tattos, the tattos are the colour of the persons animal and the style is unqiue to that animal species, so many people can have the same type of tatto and colour, but what truly makes each unique is when they show off their mastery, using your elemental powers causes your tattos to glow and give off an aura of your element over them, for someone of a blue fire spirit their tattos would have blue flames emerging from them, purple earth would have like a cracked desert ground on them, commonly black with the respective colour illuminating the cracks.\n\nAlong with them having such unique powers, the majority of those who chose to master their abilities, chose to channel their energy through varying forms of martial arts and weaponary, they also tended to avoid most modern day weaponary like firearms and explosives as their own abilites rivalled that of a gun.\n\nAt night time, the tattos give off a distinct neon glow due to the lack of UV light hindering their energy movement, naturally your spirit has enough energy to constantly have your tattos in a state of \"aural display\" but the UV light hinders that, but at night time, they give off an beautiful clean glow (yes like that K/DA music video with the glowing face paint).\n\nA bonus that is gained from ones spirit animal come without requiring any training, the Aura that their spirit gives off forms a shield around their body, mind and soul, absorbing any damage and healing wounds, the amount of damage the aura can absorb or repair is dependent on the person.\n\nAs time has gone by an goverments used censuses to track and record the data of people's spirit animals, a trend was notcied... the Wolf was among one of them rarest spirit animals, Dragons, Snakes and Tigers being among the most common, in regards to elements, the most common being, Water, Fire and Earth, the rarest being Lightning.\n\nFor each of the animals there is a faction, and with 6 divsions in the city, there are 6 respective factions which i shall now list below (these factions are basically like the chinese mafia out of tokyo drift, varying levels of activity), please note aswell, these factions do not represent the demographic of that section, its simply the faction that is the ruling gang of that section.\n\nDivsion 1, Capital Buisness Section: The Serpentine, Snake Faction, Led by Marcus Gaskov, Purple Shadow Snake Spirit, Negative Alignment, Criminal Activity, Assault, Robbery and Murder.\n\nDivision 2, Retail Section: The Claw, Tiger Faction, Led by Emelia Jacobs, White Lightining Tiger Spirit, Positive Alignment, Lawful Activity, Specialist Security, Policing and Community Aid.\n\nDivision 3, Highrise Apartments Section: Wings Of Fire, Dragon Faction, Led by Antonio Devari, Red Fire Dragon Spirit, Neutral Alignment, Vigilante Activity, Rioting, Vandalism and Justice Enforcing.\n\nDivsion 4, Residential Section: The Murder, Avian Faction, Led by Alex Murcs, Black Wind Crow Spirit, Negative Alignment, Criminal Activity, Theft, Identity Fraud and NFC Skimming.\n\nDivision 5, Industrial Section: Pride Of The People, Lion Faction, Led by Ben Jacobs, Orange Earth Lion Spirit, Positive Alignment, Civillian Activity, Emergency Service, Security and Heavy Construction.\n\nDivsion 6, Agricultural Section: Gods Of The Sky, Mythical Avians Faction, Led by Lauren Pol, Blue Water Thunderbird Spirit, Neutral Alignment, Civilian Activity, Messengers, Community Aid and Medical.\n\nThere is a seventh faction that exists, but its a generalised one for those who train and master their spirits, but dont align with any faction, they are known as the Renegades, renegades mainly inhabit the tops of the city walls, and sometimes even outside the city walls.\n\nEach faction has control over a particular zone, how they choose to rule it is dictated by the mentality of the leader, each faction has its own form of deciding a leader, whether through strength, intelligence or agility, one trend is consistent, they all have to be adaptable to change to stay as the leader.\n\n***END WORLD OPENING***\n\nNow you maybe wondering how does this massive world, get turned into an RP, what plot is there to follow, and my answer to that is...who said there was a plot, it can be anything we want, maybe the Serpentine decide they want more than 1 section of the city, maybe the shadow beasts begin evolving and starting finding ways into the city, maybe a goverment agency begins targeting those who chose to enhance their abilities to maintain control of the population, its all up to you.\n\nNow how do you get into this RP, its pretty simply, your gonna need to create your own charachter, youll need to gather a ref pic, send a short bio, describe your spirit animal, colour and power, and then you get to choose your role.\n\nNow bear in mind, you aren't restricted to anything, if you want to be a leader of one of the factions, then you can, you can choose to make your own spirit setup, or use the ones already there, you dont have to use that leaders name either, but you will have to follow the factions alignment and animal types.\n\nIf your interested in exploring this world and roleplaying in it, then let me know, you can DM and ill provide my details for you and we can get this on the road, my charachter will be discussed once we get into the planning, as my charachters intro is the starter ill use to kick off the RP.\n\nHope to hear from you all soon.",

            "selftext": "First of all, a bit about me. I am an experienced, mature RPer who has a number of years of experience in different formats, including face-to-face, email, forums and the like. Primarily, I am interested in character interaction and development, especially through storytelling, conversation and relationship building. I like to see well developed, well thought out and believable characters. I prefer exotic or unusual settings, primarily science fiction, cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic. \u201cReal world/slice of life\u201d scenarios aren\u2019t that interesting to me; if it's something like a military or espionage setting, maybe, but not something 'mundane'. With that being said, I\u2019m open to ideas if they\u2019re original or creative or a little unusual.\n\nI generally like well-written, well thought out posts, and definitely prefer quality over quantity. I don\u2019t want to read a novel with each post, but I don\u2019t want to see one-line-wonders. Similarly, I am a stickler for grammar and spelling and punctuation, although I am prone to the odd bout of ferocious typos myself. However, as long as the intent is there, then I\u2019m happy.\n\nMy interests lie in mutual storytelling and creativity, rather than playing along to somebody else\u2019s story or the like. I control my character, I decide what\u2019s going on with them, I create their background and so on. I ask for my partners to respect that, as I will do the same for them. Likewise, I will never launch a major story element or a plot twist or the like without okaying it with a partner, as I would expect them to do the same for me. If I do something a partner doesn't want, then I'll gladly change it, but I ask that they will do the same for me.\n\nI\u2019m flexible as to settings and backgrounds. I am currently looking for **Sci-Fi**, **Cyberpunk** and **Post-Apocalyptic** RP in original settings. I am also interested in fandom RPs based on **Star Wars**, **Battletech/Mechwarrior, Shadowrun** and **Fallout**. I am **only** looking for one-on-one RP, not groups\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me by **PM**. I will not reply to messages posted here",

            "selftext": "Heya!\n\n\nI\u2019ve been rping for around 6 years, so I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m really up for anything, but I really like fantasy and that sort of thing. I\u2019ve had a bit of trouble finding people on this Reddit, but I haven\u2019t tried posting before so I figured I\u2019d go ahead and try. So yeah, here goes this train wreck.\n\nI\u2019m Skymoot! Nice to meet whoever is reading this. I\u2019m mostly looking for someone that likes to RP, but also up for being friends. I\u2019ve sort of had trouble with friendships in that past year, so I figured I\u2019d try this because RPing is something I love and can really relate to with someone. I\u2019m up for anyone. I enjoy talking in OOC about the rp, and I like being friends with who I RP with. I consider myself a fairly nice person, and I\u2019d like my friends to be nice too. I can GM really well if I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I also love world building, it\u2019s one of my favorite things, and I love talking about the story aspects of that stuff, as well as discussing characters. I\u2019m okay with NSFW but I prefer it to be plot related if there alright. I also really prefer discord to RP on.\n\nSome things I like are:\n\n\nFantasy\n\nSci-Fi\n\nRegular Medieval\n\n1950-70\u2019s kind of stuff\n\nSteampunk\n\nSuperheroes are cool too.\n\nThat isn\u2019t everything, just the stuff off the top of my head. One more thing I\u2019d prefer is that you\u2019d be on at least semi frequently. I don\u2019t really like waiting days and days for a response, since I\u2019ll usually get bored in that amount of time.\n\nI\u2019d also like to be kept in the loop, like if you\u2019re going out of town and can\u2019t talk or anything, just give me a shout so I\u2019m not sitting here wondering what happened, and I\u2019ll do the exact same if it happens to me.\n\nSo basically, I\u2019m just kinda lonely and looking for some new friends that like to RP and hang out frequently.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this! \n\nDM me if you\u2019re interested!\n",

            "selftext": "*It started the same for all of us: as a feeling of dread. An inexplicable pit in our stomachs that made us look over our shoulders and jump at the slightest sound. Perhaps something was watching us. Perhaps something was coming. We didn't know why we were afraid, only that that dread would not leave us.*\n\n*Our abilities began to surface shortly thereafter. And they certainly were not the same. Some of us could heal with a touch. Others could destroy just as easily. Our powers were as varied as our backgrounds. Though we came from different countries, had different customs and upbringings, we were now special. Every one in a thousand was gifted.*\n\n*The world reacted around us. Some worshiped us as gods and angels, but many reviled us as fear overtook their humanity. And though it was a frightful time, we were not afraid of the people around us. No, our dread had root somewhere else.*\n\n*When we could not run from our fear, we chose to follow it instead. At the end of our pilgrimage, we found Arcadia, a lost ruin deep beneath the Earth's surface and home to a people lost in the tides of time. Though we knew little about our forefathers, we could tell that, like us, they were also gifted. And, like us, they were preparing.*\n\n*Because in the end, our dread was not without cause. Something was coming. And we needed to be ready....*\n\n~~~~~\n\nCity of Arcadia is a new Discord RP server I have created with a friend's assistance. The premise, as mentioned above, is that all of a sudden a small portion of Earth's denizens have discovered they had...well, powers. What followed was an instinctual drive to gather in a central location; a secret abandoned city underneath the city of Berlin. There they would find signs that this phenomenon has happened before, but something occurred that caused them to disappear completely. Note that this will not be a spoof-50s superheroes in tights kind of RP. Think more like the show Heroes or Umbrella Academy; otherwise ordinary people with extra-ordinary abilities, in a modern-day Earth like our own.\n\nAt the moment I'd like to get the server up and running with some quality folks. Get some roleplay going, really nail down how the community will function, and work out any potential issues. A \"combat\" system for missions and crime-fighting is in the works but is not required to learn as of yet; that can wait until the server gets on its feet. If you've ever played D&amp;D, Pathfinder, etc. then don't worry everything so far is designed to be very similar so it can easily be picked up once it's ready.\n\n~~~~~\n\nRules:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1gxgE0j3_JL-iGBM_qYJRWdueqC9WHTl_f85aB7lcvvo/edit?usp=sharing\n\n~~~~~\n\nA glimpse at some of the things made so far:\n\nCurrent \"Hero\" list (As well as a peek at some combat system-related details): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xYSD8Mj31P8neZk9Z4cS8V_-u03l0ZJSoCP7w9lY3Io/edit?usp=sharing\n\nA small document detailing parts of the city itself: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19e0Qy9y-R46nP83cJfATHHt5kbVEvLS5-SGqoqYYcVs/edit\n\nApplications would need to have the following:\n\nBasic character info such as name, age, city of origin, etc. A power, discussed with an admin to make sure it fits. These are meant to be small or limited to reflect everyone starting from scratch with their newfound abilities Backstory Synopsis. No you do not have to write a thesis on your character. Just a few paragraphs of basic history and motivations. Completion of a quick 4-question Google form testing your RP aptitude.\n\n~~~~~\n\nI'd like to gauge people's interest in this, and possibly get some input. If your eyes have widened throughout this post, feel free to upvote and comment your interest in joining and I'd be happy to send you an invite! If you have some questions beforehand about specifics, ask them here and I'd be happy to answer! If you think it's a garbage idea, I mean...alright, not your thing, I can accept that!

I prefer to make our own characters when roleplaying, and we can also modify the fandom world and it's history any way we want, as i find it interesting to do so. I would prefer for our characters to have room for growth, so that there can be a little extra room for story in the roleplay. i do also have some pre-made scenarios that we can use, if you would like to use these rather than coming up with our own, however, that is completely up to you. Pm me for my info, and i hope to hear from you soon\n\nFandoms include;\n\nNaruto\n\nBoku no Hero Academia\n\nSoul Eater\n\nRWBY\n\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime\n\nAttack on Titan\n\nThere are of course more that can be done, but those are just to name a few.",

(*Unfortunately, we are not taking original characters.*)\n\n***\n**The Plot**\n\n*Thanos was defeated, but Infinity Gauntlet exploded and scattered the cosmic stones. The New York Sanctum immediately enacted a quarantine protocol to contain the wild magics.*\n\nNow a quarantine zone encompasses most of NYC. Things may enter the magical barrier, *but nothing can leave*. Inside the zone the cosmic power of the Infinity Stones remains unstable and looming. Cut off from the rest of the world, large swaths of NYC were plunged into darkness and in other places power remains tenuous and flickering. The last burning beacon of light, Stark Tower stands in the near total darkness. With the blackout came chaos. The city has erupted in mayhem, looting, and violence. Law enforcement has been overwhelmed. New York\u2019s heroes on the ground are doing what they can to keep civilians safe, but in a city of millions they\u2019ll need backup. Those who fought Thanos on the front lines won\u2019t have time to rest.\n\nThe universe may be safe for the moment but the stones still threaten millions in the quarantine at the heart of the city, altering the area and it\u2019s inhabitants in unpredictable ways.\n\n(The story will be guided by periodic admin provided *plot &amp; event drops*, and driven by character interactions and world building choices.)\n\n***\n**Our Players**\n\nCurrently; 15 players / [22 characters](https://bedlamnyc.tumblr.com/roster)\n\nWe are a growing group of 21+ players. We are literate and work in multi-paragraph, 3rd person format. \n\nThere is daily ooc chatting and plotting via our Discord, so we\u2019d love for people that also just like to talk Marvel things with us on the side. We have a very lovely crew of players and are always looking to welcome more.\n\n***\n**Where?**\n\nTumblr (IC threads) &amp; Discord (for group IC events, OOC chatting &amp; plotting).\n\n***\n**Have Questions?**\n\nPlease feel free to drop us a line, the admin team is friendly and here to help you get involved and settled in.

I've been having a really hard time with being ghosted lately and was hoping to find new people who were maybe a bit more dedicated. \n\nWhat I'm looking for: \n\n* 18+. Look I know you can lie on the internet and if someone tells me they're over 18 when they aren't, I won't know the difference. But I work in education. If it somehow comes out that I'm doing anything mildly NSFW with someone underage, I could lose my job, not to mention any other legal ramifications. I don't want to lose my job. Please don't make me lose my job. \n* I don't mind NSFW, obviously, but I want it to be natural in progression. I won't do NSFW only rps.\n* I prefer mxm or fxf but I'm willing to do mxf if there is an interesting plot. I don't mind playing a man or a woman. I'm kind of wanting to play more fxf lately, cause they're hard to come by\n* Casual length. I usually do a paragraph or less, excluding introductions and beginnings. I don't mind if my partner writes more, but I feel no need to match length if I can get my point across more concisely. My partner shouldn't feel obligated either. \n* A decent writer. If I notice in the first few exchanges that you aren't a consistent writer or that you write like a 14 y/o who just discovered fanfiction, I'm not gonna continue. \n* I write in 3rd person/past tense and I'm not really willing to change that. I could maybe write in present tense if my partner is insistent but the 3rd person isn't going to change ever. \n* Genre-wise, I'm mostly looking for modern slice-of-life type stories. Preferably with romance, but it doesn't need to be the main plot.\n* I am drained of ideas, so I would really prefer if you already had a prompt in mind!\n\nIf you're interested, PM me your ideas! ",

He set his bag, blanket and guitar on the rear rack of his motorcycle, then a thought came to him. He pulled the revolving rifle from his back, folding it at the breach and rolling it up in the blanket. He put the ammo is his guitar case and took one last look around the farm. His eyes wandered over the charred ruins of his former home to the dual crosses and dirt mounds in what used to be the garden. He kick-started his motorcycle, clutching the sigil that held so much of his anger. A red triangle on black fabric would be the death of all who wore it. \n\n_Seal my heart and break my pride_\n\n_I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide_\n\n_Align my heart, my body, my mind_\n\n_To face what I've done and do my time_\n\nHe entered the city with the highest crime rate in the world on an empty stomach. He had no money to his name however, so he decided to sleep it off. He found a comfortable spot behind a noodle shop and his his bike, curling up and dozing off. No wonder it was night city, it was 6 pm and the sun had already set behind the buildings. Those were Justin's last thoughts before being awoken by a broom to the face. \n\n=========================\n\nHi all! I was hoping to do a roleplay in night city, the place where everything takes place in cyberpunk 2077. Justin, my character, would be a hick from the sticks who came into the city seeking revenge on the gang that killed his parents and burned his farm the the ground. Your character would be the daughter (or son, or anything in between) of the owner of the noodle shop that Justin fell asleep behind. I was hoping for this to be not only a action packed story, but also a story of taking in a stray and the romance that comes from it.\n\nHope to see you all in my dm's!\n",

I\u2019m in EST. I usually go by Charlotte but if you wanna get fancy Lotte or Charlie is fine too. I\u2019ve had a huge soft spot for fantasy for years. My first roleplay was a fantasy, so it has a special place in my heart. I try to respond as much as possible, but the best time to get in contact with me is at nighttime (usually 6 PM and after). I can write a few paragraphs if I get real inspired, I won\u2019t write novels or anything but I always try to give something to respond to. My main type of fantasy isn\u2019t like Skyrim or DnD it's more of a free for all, I have a ton of non-human species that I have written down. I haven\u2019t really thought of a plot so I\u2019m more than willing to create a plot or go with the flow , and building a world is always an option (I love world-building and it\u2019s major plus if you do too). \n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a roleplay partner: I\u2019m very fond of OOC chats and I love learning about people though them. I\u2019d like a partner who is decently active so like over 3 responses a day. If you can\u2019t be active just tell me so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ghosting me. Don\u2019t be obsessive, I know this isn\u2019t all that common, but I\u2019ve come across people in the past who will get genuinely mad if something doesn\u2019t go their way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther: I'm not too huge on NSFW stuff, but if it happens it happens.\n\nAny,way I don\u2019t want this post to be too awfully long so Pm me if interested!",

Naturally, I am up for discussions and can definitely work with my writing buddy in defining the setting that we will write in.\n\nA little bit about me: Been RPing for 7-8 years now in different settings, from low fantasy to sci fi and slice of life. I like to believe that I am a decent writer. I am from Europe (+1 gmt). I use discord for roleplaying. Nsfw stuff and relationship between characters are perfectly fine. In cyberpunk sci fi settings I usually RP a hacker or a spaceship pilot/technician type of character but I can definitely work something out with the writing buddy. Speaking about writing partners, I don't care what your ooc gender is as long you play a decent female character. One more thing, I always RP in 3rd person, no exception.\n\nJust toss me a message and we can chat/add each other. If you have any questions, same thing, hurl a message my way.",

            "selftext": "This isn't going to be nearly as flashy or in-depth as some of the others I've seen on here when looking for examples on how to design my own; partially because I'm not experienced enough in using handles, partially due to an admitted disinterest. In that same vein, I'll try and present whatever someone might find interesting or important to know if they'd want to pick up on this.\n\nAs the title gets across, I'm invested heavily into the idea of narrators - DMs, GMs, whatever your flavor of word - speaking onto a player in a world of their own creation - which, in this case, without a system, though I've no issue with someone taking inspiration from the likes of D&amp;D or Pathfinder - preferably one that they feel a good amount of sentimental pride in rather than just something manufactured for the purposes of having something to work with. In more poetic terms; I'm not-so much looking for the log cabin someone built for their family from scratch so much as I am the dream house that they fantasized about since they were kids; full of colorful characters, locations, unique and distinguishable cultures and nations that stand out amongst them. Atop that, I'm a fan of 'niche,' topics when it comes to worldbuilding that isn't obvious or can be observed in the same way one would see with their eyes - economics. Trade. These sorts of theories that live to justify why a world is the way it is rather and thus aggravating someone's ambitions and ideals whether they be on a national wide scale and thus a matter of policy, or something more personal and lead. The distinction would be, really, in what sort of story is being told?\n\nIs it a politically oriented story of the player acting as someone that, in one way or another, stumbled their way into wielding official power and all the influence that implies? That, ideally, would mean having a world that's truly flushed out itself in terms of the bounties and resources provided by the planet and what countries decide to do with them and how that justifies how they interact with one another - I have a pretty profound love for military fiction and often try to get as in-depth with it as much as I can. On that note; when I say 'medieval,' I do mean that pretty strictly. I'm talking sword, fire, and trebuchet being the most innovative things around. Magic might provide some form of alternative form of medium for science in war or otherwise, but, typically speaking, magic realistically - and ought to unless given a rationale otherwise - be a detriment to the progression of science and technology, not a benefit to it.\n\nIf it's a more off the rails adventure of a one-person army; whether it be a violent story or not? Make it a grand adventure, a road trip of sorts with a character whose intent is exploration of the world and finding every underbelly and secret it has. Full disclosure? I'm pretty big on violence. Not in sexual terms, but genuine, 'these two or more objects want to end the other's life,' sort of situations and their depiction. I'm a pretty big advocate of pacifism in real life, but I'm totally happy to use my darker tendencies to replicate harsh, brutal bloodshed through the medium of writing whether it be against monsters, humans, humanoids, the civilized and the uncivilized - whatever. A proper adventure needs no greater motivation than the urge to continue it. There really needs to be no greater plot or urgency to the story other than to see what'll happen next. That being said? There can be a greater ambition as the story goes on, perhaps even morphing into a political story of an adventurer-turned-warlord ala Pathfinder D&amp;D. Some of my favorite stories are about Kingmakers who carve out their realm with their own two hands.\n\nTo put a halt to that trail of thought - it ought to be mentioned that I am preferable to bitter, inhospitable worlds. If that's not your thing? Fair dues. I'm happy with lighthearted humor all the way through. But I feel as if it adds more weight to a story to have the world be one that's depicted for what it is; life in ye' old days was horrible, brutal, and unforgiving. Making it a better place, a genuinely happier, more loving world ought to mean more than just adding logs to the fire. That's just my perspective anyways. I'm talking poverty, disease and realistic depictions of what 'chivalry,' meant. Wartime atrocities and inhumane treatment - so on.\n\nUh. I'dunno. Running out of steam at this point admittedly - shout out to Christina Applegate. Discord's cool - feel free to ask for it if you'd want to use it for OC chatter or arpee. You'll find it in my signature. Yup. Pretty sure that's about it. Peace.",

No minors please. \n\nI\u2019m still on the hunt for a longterm rp partner. Preferably someone who is flexible in the types of characters they play. That being said I\u2019m looking for a partner willing to only play males. Doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be a straight male as I\u2019m comfortable with MxM pairings. \n\nI can make do with just about any genre but my favorite is fantasy with romance of course. If fantasy isn\u2019t your thing,that\u2019s okay, we can share ideas. The only thing I require in my roleplays is romance to some degree. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a partner who\u2019s comfortable writing in 3rd person with detail. Quality over quantity but if I\u2019m really into the rp then my responses tend to get lengthy. Oops! I\u2019m fine with OOC chat and quite prefer it. NSFW is also a requirement in my rps. I typically play switch characters but we can discuss NSFW aspects when we plan the rp.\n\nHope this resonates with someone out there! If so,just drop me a pm and we can get the ball rolling :)",

I send replies that are detailed, literate, and typically multiple paragraphs.\n\nI've had a particular story idea but thus far haven't found a partner. The role would require you to play two sisters, an older protective sister and her slightly younger sibling, who find themselves in the care of charming but controlling mage that shows them they have latent magical abilities. I'm in the US (EST) and strongly prefer that you are as well for the sake of time differences.\n\nI've always been fascinated with the idea of magic in the modern age. The world behind the world. I really enjoy playing characters who start off quite antisocial and end up warming up to the characters being played opposite him. A heart of stone turned to one of gold if that makes sense.\n\nAnyway! On to my idea!\n\n*The year is 2019 and as you're well aware, technology reigns supreme. Imagination has been relegated to video games, socialization to likes and upvotes, deep thought to 120 character posts on a feed, and the smooth feeling of pages between fingers replaced with fingertips on glass screens. Magic has moved from being the norm to being something that exists only in Harry Potter films and daydreams. The more we've moved towards technology, the further we've moved from our roots and our connection to all that really is.*\n\n*Kearan, a man who has lived so long he can't remember his age yet appears to be in his thirties, knows this all too well. He leaves his home filled with books, artifacts, crystals and trinkets to see people mindlessly shuffling along in their day to day lives with eyes glued to screens and senseless malice in the world. No one bothers to stop anymore and let a warm breeze tingle their skin or look up at the twinkling lights in the night sky with wonder at the worlds beyond. The deep blue of the night sky, the brilliant greenery of nature, and the warmth of the sun all replaced with pixels and fleeting, hollow experiences.*\n\n*It's no wonder he'd become so withdrawn from everything.*\n\n*Day in and day out, he stays to himself in his home or on the \"Other Side\" searching for knowledge, skill, and though he would never admit it, a connection. Someone to remind him why he used to travel the world instead of avoiding it.*\n\n*Little did he know that was all about to change...*\n\nI have several locales and characters prepped for this story to keep it engaging and immersive. All I need now is a long term partner who is able to send lengthy, detailed, well written, and consistent replies. The girls could have seen him walking around discreetly using magic and decided to follow him, be runaways on a rainy night who saw him and decided to knock on his door... the possibilities are endless. I'm more than willing/capable to work around any twists you want to throw in.\n\nI'm fine with working in romance between Kearan and one of the sisters (or both if you want to work in the whole competitive/jealous aspect like vying to do the best to be the favorite).\n\nIf you're interested, shoot me a message with a bit about yourself and let's see if we can tell a story together!\n\n*Please be serious when you reply. I've had a lot of people ghost on me while setting things up or disappear after a single post into the story.*\n\n***I prefer to RP on Discord.***",

So some things i love to include in my roleplays is romance, drama, action and character development. \n\nMy timezone is CST although daylight savings is never applied where i live so keep that in mind. I\u2019m free most of the time and while it\u2019s ok if you can\u2019t roleplay every day all the time i do prefer to be able to consistently progress at least a bit and not just one or two replies a month or something like that. \n\nFor the plot i don\u2019t have something solid yet but we can build the plot together so that we can enjoy it. The idea i have in mind is that we live in a world ravaged by war where there is a small group of people with special abilities. These people were the cause of the war that left the world in ruins and are still being persecuted even after the war has ended. \n\nThat\u2019s the base idea we can further discuss this plot over discord and add a main arc and characters to it. So if you are interested pm me so we can exchange our discord users.",

            "selftext": "Fifty years after Naruto Uzumaki, the Nanadaime Hokage, light of the Shinobi World, finally passed just days after his wife - Hinata Hyuga (1109). The tranquility that he had breathed into a young world took the form of the organization known as the Shinobi Union began to give way. Like all things it was victim of a cyclic decline. The future generations of Kage of the Great Shinobi Nations and their villages could no longer find the common ground necessary to govern themselves as a unit. During Sarada Uchiha's reign as Kyudaime Hokage the Union shattered into the five original pieces with countless splinters and shards. The political upheaval created a vacuum of conflict\nwhich bred the Fifth Great Ninja War.  Iwagakure is forced into a martial alliance with Kumogakure and Kirigakure before the two more aggressive villages lead a two pronged attack on the Land of Iron and the Sunagakure and Konohagakure alliances. The Land of Iron decimated the Shinobi and immediately sealed their borders to any and all outsiders.  With the brunt of the Kumo-Kiri-Iwa forces routed the Konoha/Suna alliance is allowed to breath and survive the war until a stalemate is formed. Unfortunately, Kirigakure is destroyed during this process and the Land of Water is thrown into a economic depression the likes of which have never been seen before.\n\nDuring this despair not all was lost. Even with Konohagakure crippled in strength the Uzumaki clan has began to flourish over the course of generations, as well as the Uchiha clan. Restarting strong in Konohagakure during Sarada Uchiha's reign as Hokage. The ire of the intermingled histories of the Uchiha with the origin of Konoha returned to the surface to some dissenting Uchiha and the group left the village for life abroad. Refusing to stay in such a place any long. Allowing for Uchiha of other villages to begin their origins. The Biju, tailed beasts, are free to roam the land. But have focused their activities in the area known as the Valley of the Biju. A place ornamented by the ruins of Uzu and the Tomb of Naruto.\n\nThe world is healing and the villages are once again open to cooperating - at least in theory.\nThe year is 1259 YC\n\nTL;DR: This Roleplay takes place 50 years after the Fourth Great Shinobi War. But instead of directing following in Boruto\u2019s story, this roleplay diverges paths after Naruto Shippuden. Though it may take influence and ideas from parts of Boruto. ALL USER MADE CHARACTERS ARE OCs!\n\n---\n\nYes! That is right! A NEW Naruto roleplay is here! here we pride ourselves on out basic stat mechanics and our laid back style. Here you will be a Hidden Leaf ninja and start from the bottom of the rankings as a Genin. You'll make your way up to a powerful nin and create your own journey!

            "selftext": " *The night  was like any other, normal, quiet, with a bright full blue moon and  stars dotting the sky. The air hung heavy from the recent rains, and  night was clear and bright.*\n\n*The  silence was broken by a blinding flash that made night into day for a  few alarming seconds. After the flash, there were figures dancing in the  sky. A large craft of some kind that resembled some sort of lighthouse  on a floating chunk of earth was slowly shooting across the sky, circled  menacingly by two angular, pointed black ships of smaller size. The  black ships raked the larger craft with bolts of red, causing blue and  green explosions on it. The top of the lighthouse tower glowed and the  whole of the land turned dark for a second before a great blue beam shot from  the ship, raking across the sky until it engulfed one of the black ships,  bursting it to pieces in a great crimson explosion. While the second  craft continued its assault, a second beam clipped it, sending it  careening down to the planet with a trail of deep violet smoke.*\n\n*The  damage had been done. Multi-colored flame erupted on the larger craft  and a few explosions ripped through it, causing it to pitch downward at  an angle. Its descent was slow, but steady, until it crashed to the  ground with a great and deafening impact, causing a long trail as it  dragged along. Oddly, the floating earth didn't break up, but remained  solid, like a whole ship. From out of the tower, spilled out the sole  occupant, a man in odd attire with goggles, a pilot's cap, and a thick,  wool-lined leather jacket. Blood ran from his cap, attesting to his  injured state and the growing iridescent blaze threatened to consume  him...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nI would like to do a roleplay featuring an  old character I'm brushing the dust off of. Rafe is a Time Mage from a  plane of existence far away. He is a talented and highly accomplished  mage, and a being of untold and nearly limitless power...\n\n...in  lands that he's familiar with. When the stars are strange and he's  thrown off course, his Celestial powers are deeply hampered. He has  landed far from his intended destination and traveling the planes is a  dangerous work. What's more he was pursued by the enemy of his race, who  may not be dead and may cause far more damage to this world. Rafe will  need to gather as much magically-charged material as he can to rebuild  his ship and find out where in the multiverse he is. He'll also need it  to power his temporal magic, which will be severely limited. That is how  you can control his power and bring him down a few notches, limit how  many magical items he gets. Normally, he would be an overpowered  demi-god, but for the moment he is a relatively mundane mage. Perhaps  his greatest asset is his indomitable will. Rafe has little care for  local custom or law. He is out to fix his ship and resume his course, no  matter who or what gets in his way and even without magic, he is a  dangerous person to make an enemy of. He is strong, lithe, and hardy,  very serious-minded, but I'm not above some grown-up hijinx or comedy.\n\nThe  world he has landed on and who he encounters is up to you. You may take  a DM role and control who and what he comes up against, be it an  empress, another mage, a mercenary, a lady knight, a witch, a goddess,  anything you like. This is meant to be a fantasy adventure, but he could  have landed on any kind of world, the possibilities are literally  endless in the multiverse! Hit me up and let's get this rolling!",

            "selftext": "Well met! How's it going?\n\nI've been reading the series of books called Earth's Children, and I'd really like to do a plot set in that world. I'm not all the way through the series, but the rules and cultures of the world aren't dificult to learn, and are pretty open ended when it comes to changing them since a lot of it is dependant on cultural differences between tribes.\n\nI'd very much like it if you've read or have some knowledge of the series, but if you haven't/don't, then I wouldn't take any issue with explaining and giving a rundown of the basics of the world and culture of humans of the time. There's also a lot of room to play around witb different tribal cultures like I said, so homebrewing/worldbuilding is going to be pretty open as far as that goes.\n\nIt would also be a great bonus if you have some knowledge of things like bushcraft and stone age humans, since this series is set literally before the invention of the wheel and clever survival was kinda humanity's main thing. If you don't know much about that, I'm also willing to explain and share what I know, but lack of knowledge in this area is going to be harder to work around than not havung read the series.\n\nDue to one universal cultural aspect of humans and Neanderthals alike, there are definitely going to be NSFW themes of one sort or another. If you'd like to engage in that, I'd prefer you be female and I'd accept playing a female character easily enough, but MxM pairings are off the table for me. I have no issue with people who enjoy that, it's just not something I'm personally comfortable with. I think I'll save a description of the NSFW stuff for later if you actually wanna try this setting out for a story, but just keep in mind that they're kinda hard to avoid.\n\nI'll keep this short and sweet, and leave it here for now, but there's a lot more I can talk about in relation to this setting and the story ideas I have. So if any of this sounds interesting, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to hit me up in my DMs, tell me a bit about yourself, and we'll go from there. \n\nI hope to see you soon! :)",

My writing can be anywhere between 2 paragraphs to 7, depending on how the mood strikes me. I understand everything can't be a novella, but I do ask for a general understanding of the English language. I wish I wasn't so OCD, but I'm a sucker for capitalizing the beginning of sentences and such. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the RP itself, I am open to suggestions, but as the title hints, I am looking for a little bit of indulgence in the romance drama clich\u00e9s of the world. I love damsels and knights and all that jazz. Good girl, bad boy situations. Or even a silly school affair. I have several things in mind! My most recent obsession is royalty and a thief or something along those lines set in medieval times with magic and elves and demons and such, but I do have various other things in mind as well! Anyways! Send me a DM with your favorite clich\u00e9 and we can fire up the drama together! ",

            "selftext": " Hello everyone! Here again looking for one or two my roleplay partners! A few things before we get down to the fun stuff!\n\n\\- Be 18+ please! I'm over 20 years old and prefer to roleplay with people over the legal age limit!  \n\\-Be okay with my limited time constraints. I have a full time job and sometimes can only reply in the evenings. If you're cool with that then great!\n\n\\- Be able to write well! Mistakes happen but I want to be able to understand your posts and not get one liners all the time.  \n\\- Be excited, talk to me outside the roleplay! This isn't a hard stop rule...if you don't wanna chat and just wanna roleplay thats fine but I love talking OOC and would love, love, love it if you did too!\n\n\\- Be okay with romance and smut. The roleplay won't center around it but I do like to include it! It's fun!\n\nAnyways! With all that out of the way. I'd love you forever if you were also looking for an MxM pairing. They're my favorite and I tend to have more fun roleplaying that pairing. I am open to other pairings though, so just ask.  \nAs for genres i'm cool with just about anything but i've been craving something Post Apocalyptic or Slice of Life lately. If you're looking for that also hit me up! If not that's fine too, just ask about what you're interested in. I generally like fantasy sort of things. Modern, medieval, all of that. A little magic is always great. I'm fine with regular old modern things though if the plot is good. If you're looking for fandom, you might wanna keep looking. The only fandom I do is Harry Potter and specifically HarryxDraco. If you're interested in that, i'd be more then happy to do a roleplay in that area!\n\nI think that's about it in that section. When you message me tell me a bit about yourself and add your favorite kind of pizza so I know you've read everything. I won't answer PM's that just ask me if i'm still looking or interested. Give me substance, i love that! Hope to hear from some of you!!",

Many call it home. People call it a barren disturbed wasteland, and they'd be right to say so. Life used to be looting and killing among the planet surface. This was the case until 4 vault hunters showed up on Pandora, pursuing treasure in such a foolish and dangerous place. The 4 original Vault hunters found a mystical alien key and  used it to open an alien prison. To the vault hunters that had opened it, the Vault had just been a container of peril and disappointment. These 4 vault hunters who opened it vanished into the wastes, certain that these vaults held no treasures at all. What they hadn't realized, was just the severity of opening the Vault. After they had opened it, the growth of an alien element known as Eredium had been triggered. This element was incredibly valuable, priceless even. But with the discovery of this high in value mineral, attention was drawn to Pandora. Many organizations and corporations appeared far and wide to Pandora. They came to excavate Eredium and bring order to the lawless and blood ridden planet. One of the largest corporations of those being Hyperion. \nHyperion was led by a man known as Handsome Jack, a man that vowed to not only mine Eredium, but to also uncover the potential and wealth of more vaults across Pandora. But Jack was not the only one. It turned out that many lone figures came out of the shadows to find these vaults or pursue their lust in wealth. These people were known as Vault Hunters. And that, is where your story begins. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/kNUvRfg",

Recently, I have been craving a detailed roleplay that is inspired by the animated movie Spirited Away - bath house, contracts and selling souls, magic, the unknown of the spirit world.\n\nI was thinking my character could have possibly stumbled into the spirit world somehow, or be visiting it in her dreams. We could do an offshoot of the movie with Chihiro and Haku, or a similar premise with OCs. \n\nWe could get into the grueling work of the bathhouse, introduce darker topics like the \"red light floor\" (self explanatory), or where they get all that food to serve... or what the contract could bind one to, responsibility-wise. Just some thoughts.\n\n\nI tend to write several detail-oriented paragraphs and would really love to make this world come to life. Send me a DM if you're interested in writing this!",

I am a female role-player, a long time fan of the Borderlands series and would love to find more people to role play the game with.\n\n I am new to role-playing across Reddit, but I am not knew to role playing in general. I have had many years of experience across Amino and Geeking. Although Amino has gone down hill and Geeking ended up shutting down. So now I've migrated here!\n\n So, now for the plot. I am over eighteen and am open to almost any plot you can think of. I am here to try and make your ideas a reality. But they must be Borderlands related, and you must also respect my choice to say no to a plot I don't feel like doing.\n\n\n For characters, I can play almost any female character from the game, but I am especially good at, Maya, Nisha, Gaige and Moxxi. Oh, and I would also say that I am incredibly good at playing Handsome Jack. Characters I will not play are Athena, Janey, Auralia, and any male other than Jack.\n\n For your character, if you want to play as an OC, feel free to send me his or her or it's bio. But I wouldn't could on it because I only very rarely enjoy OCs and will probably ask you to play as a cannon character. Random nameless Bandits or wildlife is fine, but fully fledged characters is not.\n\n I hope to role play with you all! Check my bio to know where to contact me, and See you soon!",

I've got around 6-7 years of experience, about two of those in english, and am a pretty adaptable and flexible Writer when it comes to post-lengths or how many replies you can dish out per day/week. I play both male and female characters, currently more looking for an M/M pairing, but also open for all other options. Preferably the RP would be held on Discord, other options might be up for debate.  \n\n\nI don't have any high expectations, just that you put effort into your replies and help carry the story on forwards. Inputs and discussions about possible scenes are always welcome, and if you happen to be OOC friendly that would be even better, as I like to just chat a little with my partners from time to time. I'd prefer you to be 18+ just in case for eventual adult scenes, though with no promise these will occur/be written out beforehand. Always depends on how we click and the dynamic of the characters we play.  \n\n\nGenere-wise I'm open for pretty much everything. My go-to's usually involve Fantasy elements, whether that be more modern/urban touches or full on high-fantasy with fictional worlds, I'm all in, but of course it can go without as well. I do love me some conflict and darker themes either way though, which can range from some softer Hurt/comfort stuff to much darker angsty scenes. Not very experienced/into Sci-Fi, but the right idea could always get me interested.  \n\n\nBelow I'm also gonna toss in a list of Fandoms which I like, these can either just be taken as an inspiration to use OCs instead of canon-characters, or twisted into Alternative Universes/versions, or combined into a weird crossover, and so forth. Also, If something's not on the list feel feel free to just ask about it as well.  \n\n\n\\-The Umbrella Academy, Full Metal Alchemist, Frontier, the Rain, Misfits, Gravity Falls  \n(If you're into Twenty One Pilots and up for an RP set in the DEMA-Universe I would love you forever)  \n\n\nSo yeah, if you're interested in working something out shoot me a DM and we'll get talking!

Whether its in the context of a small group or a full server, that doesn't really matter so much to me. What I'm looking for is a place where I can rp a few oc ideas, all of them being some sort of elf. So, this pretty much limits me to Medieval Fantasy type rps. I haven't had much luck finding anything while scrolling through here nor on Disboard so I'm just trying my luck with this post.  \n\n\nFew things about me:\n\nI've been Rping for about 8 years now and will be turning 21 at the end of this year. (I'm not some child trying to creep about into the darker aspects of rp.)  \nI'm a Literate Rper, meaning that my posts are at least paragraph size to larger.   \nOne-liners are a big hard no from me. Sorry!  \nDark content is fine with me. Settings that involve fighting with bladed weapons shouldn't be whitewashed. Its a brutal world out there, violence and depravity alike.  \nI put a lot of thought into my characters so they won't just be the stereotypical OC that fills some sort of archetype. I like to subvert expectations and turn concepts on their head for fun.  \nI am in the EST zone and I can post at least a few times a day but can go pretty fast if the RP gets really exciting. Otherwise, I may get busy and be slower. Again, my minimum is at least a few times a day.  \n\n\nIf anyone's interested in offering me some sort of outlet for this creative urge, that'll be fantastic. You can PM me on here for conversation about this topic or you can ask for my discord tag so we can have a quicker way of communication.",

I really have been wanting to participate in this prompt that I wrote a while ago, if you share the same interest in this prompt as I do then feel free to send your discord tag my way. Without further delay, here is the prompt:\n\nYour character, a female detective, finds herself on a case which follows a string of similar murders in the area. Through your extensive research, you\u2019ve shrunk your suspect list down to a select few criminals as well as one man who sticks out like a sore thumb. The man in question, my character, is a persuasive, manipulative, arrogant and suave millionaire with connections to various high ranking officials in the county. My character finds himself in the hot seat as your character grills him for information, certain he did it but having no real evidence to back it up. The relationship between our characters becomes a strange struggle for you to bust me before I slip out of your grasp or make advances toward you in an attempt to prevent you from stopping my sociopathic rampage.",

I often don't put too much about myself here because If you're truly interested I often prefer you ask me yourself!\n\nI'm looking for something a bit particular today. I can't remember any movie or such thing that I watched that had given me this idea or theme, but it feels so fresh and vivid in my mind. (Maybe the Halo mini-series?) Normally when you watch movies about not just the military, but the way war effects a man/woman, it usually takes place in modern-day or a bit in the past. But, what about wars fought in the future? Where soldiers are put into little pods and launched onto some strange beach, in the name of a lie? What if they fight to save their world(s)? Surely, war can be just as terrifying when it's done across the universe or the galaxy, as it is in another country. I want to play the aftermath of a war and it's effects on my character, whether that war be big or small on the bigger picture. I'd be fine with playing alongside another soldier, maybe being rebased back home for a lazy assignment after everything is said and done; Or maybe having to spend a year in a rehabilitation center on an off-world colony or such, growing close to a caretaker. Whatever it is, I want to explore modern tried and tested themes of fragility and trauma, in a Sci-Fi setting.\n\nI would like there to be romance with my characters, though that only applies to female/female pairings. I only play romance stories when its girl/girl, so please keep that in mind! Sex is open for male partners with my character, but not romance.\n\nI'm very friendly and approachable, but I dislike writers who can't atleast give me two para's a reply. If you are someone who isn't able to hit that criteria, or isn't sure, then It would be best for you to move on. \u2665 PM me if interested! I'll give you my Discord tag and we can discuss all sorts of lovely stuff.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I do hope you were doing well. You can call me...Voices for now. I have come with a idea that I have been kind of wanting to put down on paper for a long time. Just not really been able to out it down in words really.\n\nSo my initial idea is to play as a young male who is in college. Having been suffering with a blindness for years, it had made school, even with accommodations and specialized technology, very hard for him. Despite being very smart. He let this impairment give the illusion that he was dumber then he actually was. \nAfter seeing enough failed grades his parents decided to do something. A very expensive purchase. But in the hopes that it could change their sons behaviour and grades. They bought a very human like android, that to help and meet his accommodations. \nThe Android is very helpful and caring to him, guiding him and Pampers almost like a mother. But through all the fighting. The young man grows feelings for the Android. How will she handle these emotions?\n\n\nAnyway that is just a rough draft of what I had planned for the entire roleplay. I do appreciate that if your interested that you pm or message me for my Kik or if you wanna discuss plot changes or anything really for this rp. Reminder that this is a sci-fi, romance, slice of life roleplay and long-term.\n\nThank you and hope to meet you all!",

First off all, I'm not exigent, at all but I do have one request.\n\nDO NOT GHOST.\n\nI found a partner a few weeks ago and yesterday after not replying for days, he simply blocked me without any explanation and that happened to me more than once. If you're not enjoying the play, talk to your partner, figure what's wrong, educate, maybe it'll help not only one but both parties improve themselves. Ghosting is hurtful and rude so don't be ignorant.\n\n\nNow that my vent is over, let's head to the RP. I can do it on email or Discord, that's up to you. I like romance and lots of adventures on the play, that's a must but I don't mind a bit of slice of life too, like us not always at 100%. I'm fine with NSFW and we can discuss the limits. I'm very inexperienced with fantasy. As for my ideas, I only have small stuff which we can talk it out to create a nice plot: \n\nRivals become lovers. \n\nOC Superheros and/or villains. \n\nHarley and Joker. \n\nBatman and Catwoman. \n\nCanon superheros and/or villains. \n\nDetective. \n\nForbidden romance (detective/bad guy/girl, monarchy person and a gypsy, two people that work together.) \n\n\nThat's what I have for now and I'd also love to hear your ideas, if you're interested.

            "selftext": " Hey there! I am a female role-player, a long time fan of the Borderlands series and would love to find more people to role play the game with.\n\n I am new to role-playing across Reddit, but I am not knew to role playing in general. I have had many years of experience across Amino and Geeking. Although Amino has gone down hill and Geeking ended up shutting down. So now I've migrated here!\n\n So, now for the plot. I am over eighteen and am open to almost any plot you can think of. I am here to try and make your ideas a reality. But they must be Borderlands related, and you must also respect my choice to say no to a plot I don't feel like doing.\n\n\n For characters, I can play almost any female character from the game, but I am especially good at, Maya, Nisha, Gaige and Moxxi. Oh, and I would also say that I am incredibly good at playing Handsome Jack. Characters I will not play are Athena, Janey, Auralia, and any male other than Jack.\n\n For your character, if you want to play as an OC, feel free to send me his or her or it's bio. But I wouldn't could on it because I only very rarely enjoy OCs and will probably ask you to play as a cannon character. Random nameless Bandits or wildlife is fine, but fully fledged characters is not.\n\n I hope to role play with you all! Check my bio to know where to contact me, and See you soon!",

            "selftext": "This is probably a selfish request, but I've been wanting to play an Evangelion OC I have been cooking up for a while. I've always liked the what-if Eva Unit 04's destruction wasn't as complete as everyone was originally lead to believe and that while severally damaged, it did survive \u201cmostly\u201d intact with its pilot (the originally chosen Fourth Child) in critical condition. I've personally only seen the original series, but I have read a lot about the Rebuild series and plan on picking it up as soon as I can so I'm comfortable using either as base, but the latter seems to have expanded a lot. All in all this is definitely a fork in the canon which means how events unfold there after the destruction of Unit 04 can be complete up to our discretion, it could even start a completely new event or events to unravel.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nFirst and foremost I'm looking for 18+ partners, preferably 21+. Mostly due to the mature themes that follow the series (mostly the gory nature), but also I honestly just typically get along better with someone I can relate better to.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nObviously I will be playing an OC, but I have no preference for you. Whether you want to pay an OC or canon character is totally up to you.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nI don't have high standards on literacy, but you should be able to write at least a solid paragraph in third person. This is also meant to be a joint effort, I'm not looking to GM things so I would like someone who's willing to equally share carrying the plot. If anything, things are much less exciting if I know everything before hand! Something I imagine is shared by others as well.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nThough the subject of this RP may be serious, I'm pretty laid back when it comes to posts and life can keep me pretty busy. I do however try to post at least once a day and would like someone else who could commit to something similar, but I also understand that it's not always possible and am perfectly okay with that hope to find someone else who is too.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nLast but not least, I like to chit-chat with those I'm in an RP with, I just find things are more enjoyable when you also enjoy the person you're RPing with.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nI know this is a weird and unusual fandom to request, but maybe I'll hear from one of you!",

Usually I have a large amount of info to post whenever I do make an ad, though this time because I am on my phone it is being a bit of a butt and won't let me, so I shall try my best to go over points. Of course, feel free to check my older ads. \n\nI myself am a 23 year old gal in the EST time zone, I work full time with generally steady hours (8am-4pm) at a grocery store. I'll gladly tell you about the idiots and weirdos I deal with. I'm literate with preference for novella when it is called for that length and detail. I like having some NSFW elements in my stories when/if things develop that way. I like to throw characters under buses as well. \n\nFor this idea I have, it'll go around dragons- there are domesticated species and wild ones. Domestic breeds are far removed from wild counterparts, and not as powerful as wild ones (except military which are bred for it). The human society has a caste like system, where royalty have their own breed, the Golden Dragon. Goldens are bred in a way that the mere smell of a human royalty member is intoxicating to them, prompting easy bonds. However, \"bad blood\" such as bastard children (or just the odd outcast royal) can cause Goldens to become ignorant of the individual or even aggressive. Wild dragons also vehemently discharge those domestic dragons- often killing them, sometimes chasing them away. \n\nMy character will be a bastard child of the dragon's side, half Golden and other half wild. Normally, he is black in color, however his scales are instead coated in the black color. It can be burned or scratched away to reveal gold.\n\nWho your character is, is up to you. My idea was for my dragon to have been chased away and near to the city where he could be injured by the aggressor, to be found by your character. \n\nI've got to skedaddle now, my plane looks to be boarding. Send me a message and I'll get back to ya! Discord is what I prefer, but I do have Telegram, and i can just use RedditPMs too. ",

            "selftext": "Hello all!  I'm looking for a partner to play in the Warhammer 40,000 setting!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm looking for older players whose lives are more stable, who might reasonably be around for a while if we end up clicking.  I work from home, and I'm a fast typist, so I can usually offer fast responses.  If there's a day where, for example, I have to take a relative to the doctor or go there myself (which does happen), I'll keep you apprised and not just disappear. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm looking for an advanced grasp of grammar and syntax.  I hope you are, too.  I'm looking for someone who will step up and add to the depth and breadth of the world with me, not just be along for the ride.  Please be at least slightly familiar with canon and willing to look things up where you aren't.  I know it's a complicated setting, and I'm not going to be super strict about the exact words of a prayer the Mechanicus uses or the precise procedure of running under obscurement, I just don't want to see any catgirl commissars or pink-haired Inquisitors.  Don't step up to play a character who is in charge of a group of people if you're not prepared to also DM their home base or ship and at least some subordinates with reasonable detail.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI do want some kind of positive outcome for the characters even though the setting is dark, but it doesn't have to be romance if that's not your bag.  It could be friendship, or grudging respect, or just working together to achieve a common goal successfully.  This means that if I'm playing, for instance, a Chaos character who corrupts your Imperial, I will be playing on the less monstrous end of the Chaos spectrum, like a renegade Black Legionnaire or one of the saner Sorcerers, not the daily atrocities you would expect from a warband of Emperor's Children or Night Lords.  If you're playing an Inquisitor who recruits my character, I would hope you would hold back on the psycho-indoctrination or other more hardcore elements.  We can discuss and negotiate on how dark things get in general, and what sort of plot and story we want to engage with.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm a 37-year-old female.  I don't care about your gender or orientation, only your writing skills.  Similarly, I don't mind what gender of character I play and have writing samples for both.  I'm here for the story.  **Please be willing to provide writing samples.**  I have lots to share and look forward to playing with you!",

            "selftext": "ABOUT ME\n\nhello my name is kira and i\u2019m looking for a roleplay partner! im 17 years old, an artist who loves to draw original characters, a musician, and an actress. i looooove ooc chat and making friends : ) my timezone is est.\n\nWHAT I'M LOOKING FOR\n\nplease be around my age. i\u2019m not super comfortable writing with people like over 20, under 15-16.  i\u2019m looking for long term roleplay partners who are able to respond somewhat quickly.. my responses can be rapid fire if im interested in a roleplay.. it\u2019s cool if you\u2019re the same way, just don\u2019t spam me and message me every minute asking me where i am. if i know i\u2019ll be gone for a while i\u2019ll let you know. if you dont send rapid fire replies, i\u2019m still fine with that lol. recently, life has been a little busy for me, so my responses sometimes get limited to like once per day. when i\u2019m not busy, i\u2019ll be able to respond more of course. i\u2019m looking for someone who is semi literate (i am semi literate too i guess.. lol. i only write like this ooc) and can write somewhat lengthy responses.. i understand if there\u2019s a point where you seriously can\u2019t write more than a paragraph, but when you\u2019re able to, please do. i do the same or at least try to, hah. (NO one liners please)\n\nWHAT I RP\n\ni\u2019m really interested in romance and anything to do with fantasy or the supernatural. i\u2019m totally willing to work with other genres though. i ONLY do original roleplays using OCs, just a heads up. i will not do fandom roleplays because i honestly suck at playing as a character that isn\u2019t my own. i have a few plot ideas/concepts written down but i\u2019ve used a lot of them already so i\u2019m kind of bored of them! i\u2019m 1000938% willing to hear any ideas you might have. \n\ni write in 3rd person, past tense and i\u2019m not really willing to change that.\n\ncharacter-wise... again, i draw all of my ocs and i\u2019d really like it if you\u2019d use face claims that aren\u2019t actual people! like anime characters and other drawings that aren\u2019t yours are fine if you don\u2019t draw. it\u2019s just a thing yknow.. if you\u2019re an artist as well i will love you forever. before starting roleplays i like to give short descriptions on my character so more is learned throughout the roleplay. you can give me as much info about your oc as you want, but i\u2019ll most likely give the basics.\n\nCONTACT INFO\n\ni think that\u2019s it? just so i know you read all this, include the word yellow somewhere in your message to my discord, kik... whatever i give you. also, PM me and let me know which you\u2019d like to message me on. (i have kik, skype, discord, email) when you do message me, pleaase introduce yourself (if you\u2019re comfortable doing so), tell me how you like to roleplay, genres you\u2019re interested in, plot ideas you have.. etc!! dont skimp on the details :)\n\nif you\u2019ve messaged me in the past and i stopped responding, feel free to message again!!",

I\u2019ve had a bit of trouble finding people on this Reddit, but I haven\u2019t tried posting before so I figured I\u2019d go ahead and try. So yeah, here goes this train wreck.\n\nI\u2019m Skymoot! Nice to meet whoever is reading this. I\u2019m mostly looking for someone that likes to RP, but not just RP. I enjoy talking in OOC, and I like being friends with who I RP with. I consider myself a fairly nice person, and I\u2019d like my partner to be nice too. I can GM really well if I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I also love world building, it\u2019s one of my favorite things, and I love talking about the story aspects of that stuff, as well as discussing characters. I\u2019m okay with NSFW but I prefer it to be plot related if there alright. I also really prefer discord to RP on.\n\nSome things I like are:\n\n\nFantasy\n\nSci-Fi\n\nRegular Medieval\n\n1950-70\u2019s kind of stuff\n\nSteampunk\n\nSuperheroes are cool too.\n\nThat isn\u2019t everything, just the stuff off the top of my head. One more thing I\u2019d prefer is that you\u2019d be on at least semi frequently. I don\u2019t really like waiting days and days for a response, since I\u2019ll usually get bored in that amount of time.\n\nI\u2019d also like to be kept in the loop, like if you\u2019re going out of town and can\u2019t talk or anything, just give me a shout so I\u2019m not sitting here wondering what happened, and I\u2019ll do the exact same if it happens to me.\n\nSo basically, I\u2019m just kinda lonely and looking for some new friends that like to RP and hang out frequently.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this! \n\nDM me if you\u2019re interested!\n",

            "selftext": "So, first off, thanks for reading my post. My last post was roughly two weeks ago and I gotta say, I had some successful and not-so-successful RP's happen as a result of the people I'd found. Naturally, the unsuccessful ones are no longer running, so I have some space for a few new people. Let's get to it, shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bit about me:\n\nI'm an experienced GM, going on roughly 15 years of experience now, who very much enjoys meeting new people and trying out all sorts of stories. When it comes to the characters and stories I write, I try to have a reasonably balanced and diverse crowd of individuals. I'm A-OK with NSFW content, as long as it's FxF or FxM, and I do humbly request that it is not the only thing we do in the RP.   \n\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n* Literate, experienced Roleplayers who understand the finer points of character creation and the whole hobby. Of course, newer Roleplayers are welcome as well, it's just a preference.\n* People with a wide range of interests in regards to genres, themes, plot points, etc.\n* People who have an interest in RPing characters who are, or may be, in positions of leadership and authority.\n* The kind of RPer who likes to explore and excavate the world's around them. As a GM, I'd like to say that *yes*, everything is able to be interacted with. People, places, items, you name it! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome ideas I have, but feel free to provide your own. We can storyboard!\n\n* A Post-Apocalyptic story where the Undead are not only dangerous, but downright unfair to the few living people alive. Walking Dead? More like Leaping, Jumping, and Running Dead.\n* A Sci-Fi story where a unit of elite supersoldiers awake from their stasis pods on an alien world, far from home with likely no help to come, they're on their own.\n* Division 2-style story, taking place in the wonderful city of Pittsburgh. Your character(s) is a Division Agent, whom finds themselves encountering an entirely new threat as time goes on.\n* Fallout: New Vegas Aftermath RP. Ten years after the Battle for Hoover Dam, in which the Legion was beaten back, a squad of NCR Rangers on patrol in the Mojave find a familiar site, heralding a new threat to the Mojave, the NCR, and possibly the Wasteland as a whole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all that said, thanks again for reading! Don't hesitate to PM me. Comments work too, just...less discrete, I guess?",
