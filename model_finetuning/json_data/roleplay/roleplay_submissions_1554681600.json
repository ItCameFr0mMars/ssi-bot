But my sleep schedule makes it a lot more flexible than you'd imagine. I'm very versatile when it comes to roleplays. I love the usual tropes that have been used thousands of times, picking simple line plots and developing, fandom roleplays based off movies, television, comic books, video games, or even intense plots that involve adult themes, gore, and NSFW situations. \n\nWe can do 1x1, make a group of characters, or make a ton of different plots and characters to have fun with. I prefer plots we can build from, and play out together in whatever ways we choose. \n\n* If you aren't comfortable with specific themes, let me know. I have a preference for intense plots and characters. \n* I don't expect paragraphs or book length wise at all times, but I prefer to see you put some effort into your response. \n* I prefer to control my character how I please. I would like some effort in punctuation and spelling but it doesn't have to be perfect.\n\nLast but not least, don't get me excited for a roleplay and then just skip out on it. It has happened too many times to count. Thank you! You can PM me and we can do something through private message, discord, or even google docs. :)",

Blackwood High School, a school that was originally built for a wealthy businessman, had been renovated into a high school during the 1940s. The school is rumored to be haunted, but it seems the haunting only ever happened on the third floor. Faces and silhouettes are said to be seen in the windows of the third floor. The rumored third floor had been blocked off since the 1940 renovations and not a soul has been up there since. It was the end of May, 2004 when another bought of renovations took place. The barricades of thick would were removed and construction on the third floor started swiftly before summer break took place. The third floor, now being renovated so more classrooms could be added to the ever-growing student body, brought forth students to investigate the uncharted halls and rooms. On a Friday after classes let out, a number of students quietly ventured up to the third floor. Among those students were the few that would unravel the mystery that hid behind the buildings brick fa\u00e7ade. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRules:\n\n\u2022\tMust be 18+. I know it might sound weird for an RP to be restricted to only those who are above 18 when the character\u2019s themselves are either 18 or on the cusp of 18. The age restriction is mainly due to the fact that there will be a few dark concepts within the plot of the story that I\u2019m not comfortable with letting minors read. \n\n\u2022\tOnce the RP gets going try to at least post once a week. \n\n\u2022\tThis RP will be a community that welcomes LGBTQIA members and if you don\u2019t think you can be welcoming to them then this server is not the one for you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested don't be afraid to send me a pm!",

The Japan society embraced these new found Superheroes over the years and rallying behind these defenders. All superhero\u2019s fighting over work, money and fame each and everyday in Japan...\nBut could there be romance in the cards?*\n\nMy Hero Academia RP?\n\nI\u2019m looking to see if anyone would be interested in creating original characters for a romance/fantasy MHA rp. I want to create a story about two hero\u2019s falling in love in the MHA universe, while struggling to compete with one another and hide their identities.\n\nI typically only rp MxF pairings, so I am looking for a partner rping a Male character. I also have a soft spot for the love/hate relationships (one character being tsundere ), so I like slow building over time. The cheesy stuff is fun to me, but the angst and drama is amazing!\n\nI would like this rp to be based during the first Season of My Hero Academia. The added mystery of the League of Villians would be able to add some fun story plots and adventures of tracking information!\n\n\nMessage me on here if you are interested. All partners must be +18. I typically like to write a paragraph or more in every response and respond once or twice a day(but more on weekends). I\u2019m fine with first or third person writing, as long as it\u2019s consistent! :)",

            "selftext": "*It started the same for all of us: as a feeling of dread. An inexplicable pit in our stomachs that made us look over our shoulders and jump at the slightest sound. Perhaps something was watching us. Perhaps something was coming. We didn't know why we were afraid, only that that dread would not leave us.*\n\n*Our abilities began to surface shortly thereafter. And they certainly were not the same. Some of us could heal with a touch. Others could destroy just as easily. Our powers were as varied as our backgrounds. Though we came from different countries, had different customs and upbringings, we were now special. Every one in a thousand was gifted.*\n\n*The world reacted around us. Some worshiped us as gods and angels, but many reviled us as fear overtook their humanity. And though it was a frightful time, we were not afraid of the people around us. No, our dread had root somewhere else.*\n\n*When we could not run from our fear, we chose to follow it instead. At the end of our pilgrimage, we found Arcadia, a lost ruin deep beneath the Earth's surface and home to a people lost in the tides of time. Though we knew little about our forefathers, we could tell that, like us, they were also gifted. And, like us, they were preparing.*\n\n*Because in the end, our dread was not without cause. Something was coming. And we needed to be ready....*\n\n~~~~~\n\nCity of Arcadia is a new Discord RP server I have created with a friend's assistance. The premise, as mentioned above, is that all of a sudden a small portion of Earth's denizens have discovered they had...well, powers. What followed was an instinctual drive to gather in a central location; a secret abandoned city underneath the city of Berlin. There they would find signs that this phenomenon has happened before, but something occurred that caused them to disappear completely. Note that this will not be a spoof-50s superheroes in tights kind of RP. Think more like the show Heroes or Umbrella Academy; otherwise ordinary people with extra-ordinary abilities, in a modern-day Earth like our own.\n\nAt the moment I'd like to get the server up and running with some quality folks. Get some roleplay going, really nail down how the community will function, and work out any potential issues. A \"combat\" system for missions and crime-fighting is in the works but is not required to learn as of yet; that can wait until the server gets on its feet. If you've ever played D&amp;D, Pathfinder, etc. then don't worry everything so far is designed to be very similar so it can easily be picked up once it's ready.\n\n~~~~~\n\nRules:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1gxgE0j3_JL-iGBM_qYJRWdueqC9WHTl_f85aB7lcvvo/edit?usp=sharing\n\n~~~~~\n\nA glimpse at some of the things made so far:\n\nCurrent \"Hero\" list (As well as a peek at some combat system-related details): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xYSD8Mj31P8neZk9Z4cS8V_-u03l0ZJSoCP7w9lY3Io/edit?usp=sharing\n\nA small document detailing parts of the city itself: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19e0Qy9y-R46nP83cJfATHHt5kbVEvLS5-SGqoqYYcVs/edit\n\nApplications would need to have the following:\n\nBasic character info such as name, age, city of origin, etc. A power, discussed with an admin to make sure it fits. These are meant to be small or limited to reflect everyone starting from scratch with their newfound abilities Backstory Synopsis. No you do not have to write a thesis on your character. Just a few paragraphs of basic history and motivations. Completion of a quick 4-question Google form testing your RP aptitude.\n\n~~~~~\n\nI'd like to gauge people's interest in this, and possibly get some input. If your eyes have widened throughout this post, feel free to upvote and comment your interest in joining and I'd be happy to send you an invite! If you have some questions beforehand about specifics, ask them here and I'd be happy to answer! If you think it's a garbage idea, I mean...alright, not your thing, I can accept that!

I'd like to learn how to form this character by experimenting through roleplay, and if I can make a friend along the way, I'd love that too!\n\nI've got a character that's able to function and work as needed, but emotionally there's a lot to be unpacked. Think long term veteran that's dealing with a bit (read: a lot) of PTSD. She can laugh, joke, and feel normal, but there are times she might \"go wooden\", so to speak. Close up on the world and relive those memories. Whether all of this becomes something romantic along the way, or it remains simply slice of life based friendship, that's something we can discuss.\n\nI write third person, and I try to always match my partner's length at the very least. Shorter responses during conversations is fine, but I don't want to have consistent one liners. My availability is pretty much always open, and I'm in the EST timezone. NSFW isn't something I normally do, but given it's a possibility, I'd appreciate if only those 18 and older applied just in case.\n\nFinally, I'm the type that loves goofing off in side chats, making memes and jokes, sending pictures and gifs, just really getting into the plot and character interactions. So, if you're the type that prefers to only stick to the plot and is radio silent otherwise, I don't think we'll mesh very well.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd love to hear from you!",

The wind whistling gently over the forest\u2019s thick canopy, the great sun slowly dipping its gaze beneath the horizon. It had been a beautiful place to be born into, a beautiful place to grow old. The tiny incense filled shrines that lined the narrow cobble paths between rice paddies, the tall bright wood watch towers kept watching sleepily like wise old benevolent grandparents. It was no place for the cursed. No place for the likes of you.\n\nAnd what an education it had been! The sole child of the village chief, the crown princess, the one who, until just a few hours earlier, had been destined to one day take her father\u2019s place and Shepard the clan.  An education of great hunts in honour of the ancestors paying due respects to the animal spirit of your quarry. Of perfect etiquette and noble heroism. Of swordsmanship and statecraft. Indeed, arrogance would insist it was difficult to imagine the village without you. It was perhaps lucky that you wouldn\u2019t need to try.\n\nFor exile was permanent. The clan\u2019s hidden valley had survived for five hundred years in peaceful isolation. The world beyond was a far away and unknown place. There was nothing out there of any worth to the village. And that was how it would remain. To return would be sacrilege. It was your duty to leave.\n\nMarked by a demon, you had become a dead-woman walking. The curse would eat and eat and eat until there was nought of you left but a husk of desperate animal anger. A tragedy and one that the village could not assist you in bearing. But as well as parting gifts, your fathers\u2019 horse, a family bow, rice cakes to last a few days, and of course, a sword, you were also given words. They came choked and hollow, stumbling and spluttering like pebbles thrown by children into a stream.\n\n\u201cTo us, princess, you are dead. And we shall grieve for you in kind. Yet\u2026 who knows what lied beyond our borders? Perhaps you shall find a cure. We wish you luck, in this life, and the one here after.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2018Sixteen Deadly Folds\u2019 is a fantasy themed long-term roleplay heavily inspired by East Asian culture and mythology, predominantly that of Japan, but also to a lesser extent Korea, China and culture of the eastern steppe peoples. Your character would be that of a princess who, after being cursed by a monster, is forced to leave her homeland. She would go to discover more and more about the whole that lies beyond her own village, encountering friend and foe, joy and grief.\n\nI would like by partner to be at least eighteen or over as the roleplay with feature graphic violence and darker, more adult themes. Likewise, if you would like smut to feature at all within the roleplay, you ought to let me know. \n\nI tend to write about 200-400 words a reply, occasionally more. On most day\u2019s I\u2019ll be able to reply at least once per evening. Sometimes I\u2019ll be able to send a whole string of messages, on over evenings unfortunately none.

I\u2019m 26, male, in Seattle, looking for a new partner to RP with!\n\nI\u2019m looking to play a romance, with a good splash of drama, and am very open to going for a different theme to make it not like every other roleplay theme out there. I love the brainstorming and world building process and would prefer a detailed and literate partner. Oh and I only RP on discord. \n\nIn terms of my title \u2014 I\u2019ve just noticed over the years that if I\u2019m not able to joke, talk, get excited about the roleplay and discuss life with my RP partner it just doesn\u2019t have the longevity that we all are looking for. With that in mind, I\u2019m looking for someone who embraces OOC, and understands that  the relationship is integral to the RP.\n\nA little about me: I\u2019m a mental health counselor/therapist, enjoy running and reading a good amount, and my job can be stressful, and need the escape that RP gives. I love laughing (not sure who doesn\u2019t though) and love writing as well!\n\nSend me a message with a little about you and your discord and we can go from there!",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019m starting up a Discord RP group tentatively called Empire of the Lotus. The gist of it is that it\u2019s set in a feudal Japan-like country with a number of factions vying for power over the remains of the kingdom after a series of invasions and cataclysms. What is left of the empire is in rough shape and various warlords, bandits, former generals, sorcerers, nobles, and even peasants have risen from the ruins and are making their move to take power. Among these groups are individuals of great power, heroes of legend. Before the disasters that hit the kingdom they were often in service to the lords and Imperial army. For many those obligations have since been overruled by more pressing matters like survival, others they remain loyal to the Emperor, and others seek to use their powers to carve out a throne for themselves.\n\nThe thing is, I am currently in this endeavor on my own. I still have a bit of worldbuilding to do in fleshing things out, but if you\u2019ve got any experience in acting as an admin for roleplay groups and this sounds like an interesting premise, send me a PM! I can\u2019t promise a position right from the start, but once we get to know each other and I know you\u2019d be someone I could trust not to abuse the position I would welcome the help. I\u2019m not sure what to ask for to show you\u2019d make a good admin beyond talking with me and patience. I have some general faction ideas, but would welcome some input from others. Once we\u2019ve built it up a bit more we can open it up to even more people! \n\nSend me a PM if you\u2019re interested and we\u2019ll talk/I\u2019ll link you the Discord.",

I have a few ideas in mind, but id mostly like to create our ideas and worlds together. \n\nI write 2/3 paragraphs. Sometimes novels. And rarely short paragraphs. Way more at the start. \n\nI\u2019m excited to talk about what\u2019s going to happen in the rp, where our characters are headed, how they\u2019ll develop. Basically i dont like feeling lost....i want my character to be surprised with big events, not myself....especially if it changes the trajectory of the whole gosh darned rp. Since we\u2019re both dming, we should have a bit of an outline. \n\nJust a PSA. smut is something i hesitate with, story needs to be 95% focus (idk maybe ill feel different). But be 18 pease. \n\nUmmmmmm i think that\u2019s it. Oh, daily reply minimum is suuuuuper cool. I want someone interested in creating. I just want anyone easy going. I write third person, and i like sharing images at times. \n\nOkay, hope i dont sound like a picky nose picker. I just want to fight orcs. If you\u2019re wondering about what makes a great reply to this post: I\u2019d say any length pm with your contact details, and a expression of interest. I only ask that you genuinely think we\u2019re a good fit, based off of what I\u2019ve written above.",

Anyway, I write between 1-2 paragraphs usually but i'm really not picky about length as long as it's not one liners and i feel like you're being detailed enough, so don't sweat it! I'm from the UK so, that's my timezone too. But enough about that, onto the idea! \n\nWe're both young adults, having just turned 18. But we've known each other since we were little kids. We've been the best of friends for.. well, ever! Inseparable no matter what, and there's always been a hint of romantic undertones to our relationship but for one reason or another neither of us ever acted upon any feelings either of us may have had.\n\nNot like there's much chance of that now anyway.\n\nThere's an incident. I lose my family, and my memory. I'm lucky to be alive, so i'm told, but I don't exactly feel lucky. No family, no memory of anything, I knew no one anymore, barely remembered my family anyway.. I felt hopeless, kept in a hospital room for days on end, wishing it'd all come back.\n\nThen you visit. I don't remember you, but something tells me that I can trust you. \n\nSo yeah that's the idea! I am open to anyone of any gender so don't be shy! My only requirements are a decent grasp of english  and no one liners, other than that it's all good! I'd prefer 18+ simply because I am as well, and I like including NSFW elements once it makes sense in the relationship (though they will never be the focus) but it isn't required, just make sure you let me know if you -are- under 18.\n\nI am also open to suggestions! I love feedback and input from my partners :) and i find a lot of ideas can be improved or turned into something entirely new with that feedback. Anyway, see you soon!",

It can be anything from star wars-esque adventure to leading a mega corp on earth or maybe some detective partners story in a slum city in cyberpunk time. Really, we can do all kinds of things. Naturally, I am up for discussions and can definitely work with my writing buddy in defining the setting that we will write in.\n\nA little bit about me: Been RPing for 7-8 years now in different settings, from low fantasy to sci fi and slice of life. I like to believe that I am a decent writer. I am from Europe (+1 gmt). I use discord for roleplaying. Nsfw stuff and relationship between characters are perfectly fine. In cyberpunk sci fi settings I usually RP a hacker or a spaceship pilot/technician type of character but I can definitely work something out with the writing buddy. Speaking about writing partners, I don't care what your ooc gender is as long you play a decent female character. One more thing, I always RP in 3rd person, no exception.\n\nJust toss me a message and we can chat/add each other. If you have any questions, same thing, hurl a message my way.",

            "selftext": "*I\u2019m a little old school and nostalgic for some part of my childhood; so in this roleplay I\u2019d like to play out the crossover lives of various Nicktoons. Not many or even any of the current ones. Here\u2019s the ones I have in mind:*\n\n* Spongebob Squarepants\n* Doug\n* Rugrats\n* Rocko\u2019s Modern Life\n* Aaahh!! Real Monsters\n* Hey Arnold!\n* The Angry Beavers\n* Catdog\n* Jimmy Neutron\n\n*In this RP I want you to play the latter. I was thinking that we could do a plot where the other Nicktoons are bullying Jimmy Neutron and his friends for sucking so much. The RP would consist of Jimmy trying to befriend the other Nicktoons and them scorning him but he is either too stupid (despite the premise of his show) or too in denial to realize it. Here\u2019s a starter written from your perspective. If you don\u2019t like the characterization and aren\u2019t willing to play him like this, then don\u2019t even message me.*\n\n-------\n\nHi, I\u2019m Jimmy Neutron! I finally got a decent time slot on Nickelodeon which means people are forced to watch my show when they get home from school or risk missing more popular cartoons afterwards. I think eventually they\u2019ll come to like me! I also think that the other Nicktoons will too.\n\nYesterday I met every single one of them. I said hi to Arnold, but he must not have heard me because he kept walking and his friend Gerald shoulder checked me as he walked by, which is kind of crazy because he barely has any shoulders. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say he did it on purpose, but I do know better because I am a boy genius!\n\nThen as I was finishing up in line the Nicktoons cafeteria (the lunch lady accidentally gave me the ugliest and smallest portions of every option), Angelica walked by my and tipped my tray over my hands and all over the floor! That little prankster! Unfortunately, it landed on Doug and then him and his friend Skeeter accidentally spent 30 minutes beating me up and then everyone in the cafeteria accidentally pointed and laughed. They must have thought they were doing something else. In fact, I KNOW they didn\u2019t see me because everyone walked over me on the way out and Catdog (specifically Dog which is normal because he can be oblivious) coughed up a hairball onto my face. Then Rocko\u2019s dog sh*t on me!\n\nLater I heard Dagget and Norbet talking about a party they were planning that night and I asked if I could go and they accidentally said no. Because it was an accident I showed up later that night! Patrick wouldn\u2019t let me in but then I told him I was Squidward wearing a costume and he believed me. Sometimes to pays to be really, really smart! Smarter than a starfish for sure.\n\nBut when I got there, I saw Cindy accidentally kissing Doug\u2019s bully Roger!\n\n\u201cCindy!\u201d I yelled, \u201cthat\u2019s not me, that\u2019s Roger!\u201d\n\nBut she didn\u2019t hear me and before I got her attention, I accidentally tripped over Catdog as they accidentally walked sideways into me and I fell on the floor where Ickis, Oblina, and Krumm accidentally started kicking me in the side over and over again. But then Krumm accidentally shoved his eyeballs in my mouth and accidentally made me smell his armpits while they all accidentally laughed and laughed and laughed! They must have thought I was Squidward too because I\u2019m way more popular than him, right?!\n\nThen those police fish from Spongebob showed up and said there was a noise disturbance. I yelled out to them for help but instead they only made Krumm take his eyeballs back and then accidentally started beating me up with their batons while Squidward played on his clarinet! Then they accidentally said I was the noise complainer and arrested only me for filing a false police report and while they were cuffing me and carting me off everyone accidentally pointed and laughed again.\n\nI had to spend 24 hours in jail and when I finally got home, Goddard sh*t on me too.\n\n-------\n\n\n\n*Tell me what you think!*",

            "selftext": "Hey there! Back again looking for some long term roleplay partners, as is the norm with RP quite a few of my partners have either disappeared or other issues have stopped them from being able to continue but that's part and parcel with this, right? I would love to start on some involved and interesting roleplays. I'm always interested in starting new roleplays with exciting partners! I've been looking over the past few weeks but I'm still hoping to get some more long term partners to build some interesting stories with. \n\nA bit about myself, I'm a big fan of reading, gaming, movies and writing and find roleplay to fit nicely in as a hobby alongside a most of them. I also like reading comics, especially Marvel and would be interested in doing something based on that world and characters, it could be as loosely accurate as we'd like. \n\n I'm also interested in a wide range of genres from science fiction, to more generic fantasy and espionage style roleplay just to name a few. My favourite genre overall is cyberpunk but it is quite niche and very rare to find a partner interested in it, so bonus points if you are! Other genre's / settings I'm interested in are Lovecraftian, Apocalyptic, Fantasy, Noir, Futuristic Sci-Fi and honestly anything fictional I'm most likely to be interested in it! Just give me your suggestions or idea's and i'll be happy to discuss and see what works for both of us. I'm honestly open to just about anything so don't worry about suggesting ideas!\n\nI also have numerous prompts on my profile, but they all lean more to an adult setting. I don't mind with our roleplay being more adult orientated or not. I'm fine with either, although I would like the roleplay to be somewhat mature in tone. Any sexual aspect would be depending on your preference. \n\nMy timezone is GMT (UK) and I should be free to talk and roleplay most days, if not then I'll try to make you aware as I feel communication is key. I work 24hrs so depending on my shift I can be online at various times. If I don't message back after a day or two then just fire me a message to get my attention, it's more than likely something IRL has come up and I've just forgotten to respond. \n\nI'm open to any ideas or discussions, just fire me a PM and we can see if we work out. Hope to hear from you soon!",

What I'd love to do in our roleplay is explore more of his past, before he was the Symbol of Peace, and probably throw some headcanons in the mix.\n\nNow then! What I can offer is good grammar, detailed and frequent replies (at least once a day), lots of awful jokes and angst! Oh boy do I love torturing my characters. \n\nIf you are the same as me and like the idea of the roleplay, great! You can be any character from the show (that existed back then) or an OC, if you'd like. \n\nI don't have any preferences for the plot, it can be romance/action/angst, whatever you desire! I just really want to explore him more. \n\nI do have two rules though. First is that I use Discord only and second, you must be under 25 years old. I am a minor myself, so if that bothers you, I don't think this ad's for you.\n\nAnyway, in case you fit the requirements, I really hope you send me a PM or your Discord tag and we can have a plus ultra roleplay!

            "selftext": "\nHey there!! \nLet me just first start out by saying when I say long term, I really do mean it! I want someone I can world build with and connect with outside of the RP. I truly want to create and obviously since I posted here, I\u2019d like to do that through a roleplay. I\u2019ve been rp\u2019ing for about 6 years in and off and I have quite a few favorite genres. Before we get into that, though, I like to start off with a few key things I feel like need to be stated.\n\n\n\n\nFirst off I\u2019d like to state that like the title reads, I only roleplay with people over the age of 18. While it\u2019s not (nor ever will be) the main focus of the storyline, some NSFW elements may be present. I just want to make sure no trouble comes about so for this reason, I remain unwavering on that decision.\n\n\nI\u2019d really like it if you could be detailed, and literate in your responses. (This however,  should go without saying) The occasional writing error certainly isn\u2019t a problem, but please try to maintain a sense of structure! A little effort certainly goes a long way. I definitely don\u2019t expect extreme mountains of text in each reply, however one line responses get boring very quickly. Match my effort, if you will. \n\nI do my absolute best to respond as often as I can!! I workout everyday, so that can take up most of the day. I\u2019ll get out as many responses in a day as I can, and If I plan on being gone for long amounts of time I\u2019ll make sure to inform you! \n\nNow this isn\u2019t really a requirement, however I will point out somewhere out. While it\u2019s definitely a necessity to be straight forward and serious in a roleplay, outside of that you don\u2019t have to be so serious! I\u2019m a fun loving, profanity using, laid back kinda girl! Therefore you shouldn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s strictly rp! We could also get to know eachother!! (Again, not a requirement. I can\u2019t force you to be my friend if you strictly want to roleplay :)\n\nAs for the plots I\u2019m interested in, again ill play almost anything! My favorites are:\n\nZombie apocalypse (I\u2019m clich\u00e9 like that :))\n\nReal life Romance/Slice of life \n\n\nI\u2019m really open to doing almost anything!! I\u2019d appreciate it if we could exchange ideas rather than one person coming up with everything! \n\nWe can discuss platforms to use privately!:)\n\n\nThanks in advanced!\nLooking forward to hearing from you!! \n\nPS: please tell me your favorite tv show or movie to insure you\u2019ve read the whole post!",

If you are interested in any of them, please pm me here and if you seem to fit what I'm looking for, we can move elsewhere. Please be able to write in grammatically correct and complete sentences, including capitalization and punctuation. I only write in third person and would prefer my partner to do so as well. Please be able to write 4+ lines per reply as well. \n\n1. She had finally done it. Charlie had been working up the courage to go through with this plan for a month now, and had finally worked up the nerve to go through with it. Though it may not have needed much bravery for most, it took a lot for her to convince herself to do it. \nCharlie had been going to a local coffee shop, one (y/c) went to nearly every day. Today, when (y/c) had gone to use the bathroom, Charlie rushed over, placed a sticky note on their cup of coffee, then immediately ran outside to her car and drove away. \nOn the sticky note was her phone number and a small heart, but no name. Once she got back to her apartment, she picked up one of her many books and began to read in an attempt to distract herself. \n\n2. Riley was born and raised in a small town in Virginia, along with her little sister, Grace. When she was 17, the family decided to take a Christmas vacation, but a while after they got on the road, a drunk driver t-boned the car, killing her mother and sister. \nUnable to deal with the terrible loss, Riley resorted to not speaking. It was her way of bottling up her emotions and not letting others in. Her father became an alcoholic, and was eventually put in jail for abusing her when she was 19. Riley decided to move out of Virginia and up to New York for a fresh start. \n(Y/c would be someone living across the hall/in the same apartment building as Riley.)\n\n3. 1. Alex and y/c had childhood friends since third grade, despite being very different. Y/c came from a very rich family. He had an easy life and was generally very comfortable. Alex on the other hand, was the opposite. Her family was quite poor, and had barely been scraping by since she was born. However, the pair enjoyed each other's company and remained friends until college. They both went to the local college, as most people in the small city did. It was soon into their freshman year that they started to drift apart. Y/c joined a frat and began hanging out with the more popular rich kids, leaving Alex behind. While y/c was out partying, she was struggling to make ends meet, and desperately trying to find a job in order to help pay her tuition and support her aging mother. \nY/c always knew Alex had feelings for him, but never acted on them as she was too shy. He never made any attempt either, as he knew his snobby father would never approve of him being with someone of a lower class.\nOne night, y/c and his friends were drinking and partying, when they began making bets. A few of the guys knew that y/c was friends with Alex, and like his father, didn't approve, as she was nowhere near their status financially. Y/c had just lost a bet, and was fairly drunk, so his friends decided that his punishment for losing was that he had to invite Alex over and kiss her. Y/c knew she liked him, so it would be easy.\n\n4. Maggie Fletcher had never grown up in civilization. Ever since she was a baby, she had been stuck on a small island across the sea from England where she was born. Maggie and her parents had been the sole survivors of a ship that had crashed on the island, leaving them stranded and alone. The family was forced to learn how to survive on the island, eating fish and fruit, and boiling water to cleanse it of bacteria. Maggie grew up watching and learning these techniques from her parents, until they were attacked by a black panther, leaving her to survive on her own at the age of 7. She had now grown into a young woman of 19, living and fighting in the wild all by herself. That is, until an English ship landed on the shores of the island. \n\nMaggie was munching on a mango when the sounds of voices reached her ears. She froze, listening, then carefully, quietly made her way to the edge of the jungle. She looked over the edge of a cliff to where the sea met the shore. Her brown eyes widened as she saw a large ship anchored, and a handful of men already on shore. \n(Y/c will be someone on board the English ship. Maggie may recognize a little English, but not much. She may be taught more though. We can both play as other people on board the ship.)",

            "selftext": "So I'm looking for a partner to do something fun, romantic, with a bit of a plot. Nothing too complicated, really. A journey from A to B with a few excited diversions along the way will suffice.\n\nI've been thinking of experimenting with fandom roleplays these days. It's not something I usually do but as long as we use OCs, I think I would be fine trying it out. I'm not well-versed in a lot of fandoms, however, so I'll list a few I'm comfortable with/can research on the fly:\n\n* Naruto\n\n* World of Warcraft\n\n* Monster Hunter \n\n* The Witcher\n\n* Star Wars\n\n* Lucifer\n\nNothing else really comes to mind. I'm kind of a boring person in that regard. \n\nThat being said, I prefer to play more \"everyman\" characters. For example, if we were roleplaying in the Naruto universe, I'd rather not be a ninja. Yes. I'm the person who plays a human warrior in fantasy games. \n\nI'm a guy but can play as both male or female. I'm fine with playing with both male and female characters as well. Things don't necessarily have to involve smut. Would prefer lighthearted roleplays, but I can be down with some angst if we come up with good characters for it.\n\nHit me up if you're interested. I'm free all evening more or less. I use several platforms so we can probably figure something out.",

Amnesia has always been an eerily fascinating condition to me, and I would love to create a scenario in which one of our characters, preferably mine, is involved in a serious car accident resulting in no major physical damage, but the mental toll is far greater\n\nOur characters' relationship can be any number of things, maybe they were simply neighbors before the accident, or maybe they had been dating for a while. Perhaps they had broken up, but still had feelings for one another and couldn't bring themselves to reconcile.\n\nIf this sounds even remotely interesting to you, please feel free to shoot my a PM so we can discuss details. I would love for you to be able to throw in your own plot twists and feel like you have as much control over the story, maybe even tossing in some huge ones like you having a child after we broke up that I didn't know about.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

One City in particular would stand at the forefront of this moment. It's name forever know as, Utopia.

The city is almost perfect, except for what lies beyond it's border. \n\nEnter... The Void. The Void is a city located at the edge of Utopia's border. It's home to 20 million citizens both human and non-human. The Void is a city where everyday life is a struggle just to see the next day. It's paradise for criminals and anyone who's on the run from the law. \n\nTwo cities that seem to be polar opposites, but are indeed linked in more ways than one. Are you prepared to join this adventure to see what lies within the cities and what adventures await?\n\nIf you've read this far and you're interested in the RP then pm me and we can discuss more. I use both discord and Kik and as far as length of response, I'm good with whatever as long as you don't keep giving me single sentence replies.

I've RPed for about roughly 10 years so I have extensive experience in telling a story and writing. \n\nOne thing I should note I don't ever do slice of life roleplays, but lately I've been in the mood for something not so heavy. Most genre parts can be overbearing when it comes to the stories they follow. That being said, I'm up for the roleplay to take place in different eras or possibly somewhere in the future. \n\nAnother thing I would like to note on is when I say Romance and NSFW, I'm not talking about purely smut... Yeah, I like those types of scenes as much as the next guy but what's the point if our character's don't mash well together. There has to be build, yearning, love between them.\n\nSo enough said/rambled. PM if you have any other questions!\n\nHappy roleplaying!",

Watching the movie gave me some inspiration to start using my oc again which I had written to coincide with my own universe \n\nIf you're interested in a 1v1 DC rp then I'd love to help. \n\nThe base characters would be my Oc and whichever character you decided to play. I'm okay with all canon characters or OCs.\n\nFeel free to message me for further details and such\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAlso holyyyy heck I really liked shazam more than expected.

After realizing how diverse this community is I decided to craft a more detailed post about potential roleplay that I would be interested in. I'm a female in my 20s and would prefer to roleplay with someone around my age.\n\n* I usually write in first person, occasionally switching to third person.\n* Long posts such as two paragraphs woud fine, but I've found more depth with dialogue that is around two lines with an emote. I prefer the shorter more frequent dialogue approach. For example: \\*The young girl nonchalantly reached into her pocket, pulling out a pack of pink gum. After casually placing it in her mouth, she made eye contact with the man in front of her.\\* \"So, about that shipment I asked you about. Any updates on it?\"\n* I do enjoy chatting oocly and I'm a pretty easygoing friendly person, so I won't give you the cold shoulder oocly.\n* Any time setting is fine but medieval or an era without technology as we know it is preferable.\n* Putting emphasis on character growth and transformation is a big deal for me. It allows me to progress relationships and the character depth.\n* Romance is fine as long as it is not the only thing in the scene and it seems natural for the setting/ current state of the characters.\n* I prefer to use one character and completely develop that character instead of switching around to multiple ones.\n* Fantasy is fine but I don't have much experience with it.\n* I'm not looking for fandom roleplay and would prefer to use my imagination!\n* I really enjoy developing relationships for characters and progressing their story lines.\n* IF you are in a group of people roleplaying, feel free to add me to it! I hope to create my own group someday./\n\nSend me a chat message if this sounds like something you would like to do!",

I'd like to start in second year, where Harry Potter finds out he has a half-sister (through dramatic events!) and further, that she's more than she seems. No, she's not the Chosen One v2, but she does believe that not only is he the Chosen One to defeat the Dark Lord, but he's also destined to give rise to the new and true Dark Lord and Light Lord, and restore truth to magic itself. \n\nI'd like someone to write this out with me. I'd like this version of Harry to be similar to the canon figure; hot tempered, loyal, dedicated, a go get kind of boy destined for greatness. He simply has a half sister who wants to help him achieve it, and perhaps join in. \n\nIf you're interested, let me know. It'll be a slice-of-life, adventure, dramatic retelling of an AU world. I'd like you to be able to write others, as well - OCs and canon characters. Message me, and we can discuss details to see if this fits you. \n\n18+ because violence and adult themes in general",

Literate, anything from multiple paragraphs to single lines in a back-and-forth type of situation. I prefer 1-2 paragraphs; it's hard to write whole novellas as a post. I work in the mornings, so typically I'm available in the afternoons-evenings (never late at night, since I have to wake up early). Discord, email, Google Docs. We all have lives offline, so please tell me what your posting schedule looks like. For me, I try to post at least once a day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*No fandoms.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*At the moment, I am ONLY looking for fantasy settings.\\*\\* I prefer low, epic, and/or dark fantasy over high. But I can be coaxed into a sword and sorcery type of deal. I used to play D&amp;D and World of Warcraft, so I'm familiar with the use of magic and magic systems, I just don't have a lot of experience roleplaying them. Ideally, you and I would make a world and plot together (or at least a basic goal for our characters to work towards). I like fantasy because I like problem-solving without the use of technology, especially when the problems require diplomacy, treks into strange lands, and overall gumption. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*YOU:\\*\\* Age 25+ ONLY. I'm sorry, this is a firm requirement. Yes, there will be some NSFW themes, but also I find it hard to relate my partner when they're more than five years younger than me. Preferably with strong grammar and spelling skills. I'm not looking for perfection, but blatant and consistent mistakes will take me out of the story and distract me. I prefer to play female characters, but am open to my partner playing FxM or FxF pairings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* Due to past experiences, I may ask if we can exchange writing samples before we commit to roleplaying. Too many times I\u2019ve delved into a new rp, only to find the writing incompatible. \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I tend to go heavy with the worldbuilding and expect my partner to invest the same energy. This will be a longterm roleplay, so if you've read this far and think that sounds good to you, drop me a message with 'palmtree' in the subject line. Even if you pass, thanks for reading my post, and happy roleplaying!",

(*Unfortunately, we are not taking original characters.*)\n\n***\n\n**The Plot**\n\n*Thanos was defeated, but Infinity Gauntlet exploded and scattered the cosmic stones. The New York Sanctum immediately enacted a quarantine protocol to contain the wild magics.*\n\nNow a quarantine zone encompasses most of NYC. Things may enter the magical barrier, *but nothing can leave*. Inside the zone the cosmic power of the Infinity Stones remains unstable and looming. Cut off from the rest of the world, large swaths of NYC were plunged into darkness and in other places power remains tenuous and flickering. The last burning beacon of light, Stark Tower stands in the near total darkness. With the blackout came chaos. The city has erupted in mayhem, looting, and violence. Law enforcement has been overwhelmed. New York\u2019s heroes on the ground are doing what they can to keep civilians safe, but in a city of millions they\u2019ll need backup. Those who fought Thanos on the front lines won\u2019t have time to rest.\n\nThe universe may be safe for the moment but the stones still threaten millions in the quarantine at the heart of the city, altering the area and it\u2019s inhabitants in unpredictable ways.\n\n(The story will be guided by periodic admin provided *plot &amp; event drops*, and driven by character interactions and world building choices.)\n\n***\n\n**Our Players**\n\nCurrently; 18 players / [25 characters](https://bedlamnyc.tumblr.com/roster)\n\nWe are a growing group of 21+ players. We are literate and work in multi-paragraph, 3rd person format. \n\nThere is daily ooc chatting and plotting via our Discord, so we\u2019d love for people that also just like to talk Marvel things with us on the side. We have a very lovely crew of players and are always looking to welcome more.\n\n***\n\n**Where?**\n\nTumblr (IC threads) &amp; Discord (for group IC events, OOC chatting &amp; plotting).\n\n***\n\n**Questions?**\n\nPlease feel free to drop a line, our admin team is friendly and here to help you get involved and settled in.

            "selftext": "\n**scene**\n\nOn Monday morning Jaimee had a mission to do, a mission she never thought she would have to do in her twenty-three years of living. Hopping off the public bus, she found herself standing across the street of Sanders and Sons cooperatives, she looks up at the tall building more like glared with a sneer on her lips knowing exactly who owned it. She sighs and blows air from her lips, pushing strands of her curls away from her face. \u201cOkay, lets do this\u201d. She says to herself and takes a step off the sidewalk to cross the street before she could take another step a car zooms pass her letting out a string of honks. Jaimee swiftly positions herself back on sidewalk, her heart beating widely inside of her chest. \u201cI think my life just flashed before my eyes\u201d. She whispers, taking a few seconds to calm herself down then successfully crossing over. \n\nEntering the building her eyes wandered around the spacious room before settling on the front desk, she hastily makes her way over and smiles politely. \u201cHi, I\u2019m looking for Ryder Sanders?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr Sanders doesn\u2019t take walk-ins. Do you have an appointment?\u201d The woman looks up from her computer enough to give Jaimee a once over. Seeing that she wasn\u2019t anyone important she averted her attention back to the computer. \u201cAh okay, when I do make an appointment. Where would I meet him? Which floor?\u201d She asked slowly but eager to hear the answer. \u201cHis office is on the 20th floor\u201d The lady replies absentmindedly as she typed away on the computer. \u201cGotcha, I\u2019ll be sure to let him know how much of a great job you\u2019re doing\u201d Jaimee grins sarcastically before turning away and making her way to the elevator. \u201cWait what- hey! You can\u2019t go up there without an appointment!\u201d \n\nIgnoring the woman\u2019s screams she impatiently waited for the elevator to slide shut before pressing the button. Once she reached the 20th floor she walks out and rolls her eyes when she was met with another secretary. \u2018Not even going to bother\u2019 She thought and quickly started walking down the hallway. \u201cMiss, Miss! Do you have an appointment?\u201d Again Jaimee ignores her and when she heard footsteps following her she looks back and noticed the woman coming after her, without a second thought she started jogging and made a sharp turn knowing she wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up with those heels she has on. \n\n\u201cWhere is Ryder\u2019s office?!\u201d She questions loudly towards the group of people in front of her. They stayed quiet for a moment until one of them pointed down the opposite hallway. Jaimee turns and runs towards his office pretending like she couldn\u2019t hear the woman shouting after her. She burst through the doors and pointed her index finger menacingly towards him. \u201cYOU\u201d \n\nRyder looks up from the papers on his desk and does a double take at the person standing in front of him. He quickly composed himself and leans back with a smirk on his face. \u201cJaimee..oh my, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen you again but I guess that night was too good to not come back for more huh\u201d \n\nJaimee seethes and takes the steps closer to his desk. \u201cListen here, you cocky, arrogant, self-centered, big headed pig! I didn\u2019t come here for you. You and I both know that night was a mistake, we were both drunk and you know well if I was sober I would\u2019ve never slept with someone like you! It was a stupid mistake!\u201d She screams glaring at him. \n\nRyder jumps out of the chair and smacks his palm against her mouth. \u201cKeep it down lady! Jesus you\u2019re so loud...even in bed\u201d he teased with a sly grin on his lips then he got more serious and pressed his hand harder when she started screaming again which was muffled by his palm, thank god. \u201cIf you regret our sexy night so much then why are you here? What do you want?\u201d He removes his hand to let her speak. \n\nJaimee harshly wipes her lips with the back of her hand before looking away and down at her purse, rummaging through it until she found what she was looking for. She threw it on top of the desk and crossed her arms over her chest, waiting for his reaction. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant? Congratulations! Who\u2019s the lucky fella? You didn\u2019t even invite me to your wedding? I\u2019m truly hurt-\u201c Ryder started with a mock hurt expression on his face. He knew exactly who the lucky guy was. \n\n\u201cShut up! Are you really that dense? How do you take care of this big company when you\u2019re such a dummy? Do the math, I\u2019m three months pregnant, we slept together three months ago. So congrats, you\u2019re the lucky fella.\u201d She smiles sarcastically and snatched the pregnancy test from his hand. \n\n\u201cBut-\u201c he started to say though he was cut off when the secretary burst in with two security guards behind her. \u201cThere she is! Escort her out of here, immediately!\u201d She exclaims pointing her acrylic finger at Jaimee. \n\u201cOh no\u201d she cursed at the same time that Ryder asked \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d \n\u201cThis bitc- this woman walked in here with no appointment\u201d The blonde sneers glaring at her just as the guards approached her and grasp her arms. \n\u201cHey! Let me go! I\u2019m a pregnant woman, I can walk on my own.\u201d Jaimee snatched her arms away and stomped towards the door. \n\u201cJaimee wait, can we talk later? What\u2019s your number?\u201d Ryder looks at her with hopeful eyes. She remained quiet for a few seconds before speaking. \u201cThe same one from high school\u201d With that she turns away and walks out. \n\n**********\n\nAnd that\u2019s just a small scene of the plot. There\u2019s more background story to how our characters met and why they \u2018hate\u2019 each other. There\u2019s basically a lot to discuss which I will gladly do so over pm. So if anyone is interested shoot me a message! I\u2019m not just looking for male partners, females are welcome to message me as well. If you want to play the female character I can play the male and if you want to play the male then I\u2019ll obviously play the female. \n\nAll I\u2019m looking for is someone who is literate and descriptive, roleplays in 3rd person and can write 2-4+ paragraphs per post with decent grammar. Also someone who can be engaged in the story in all aspects which means if you want to add any of your ideas let me know. I also like to play side characters, I don\u2019t expect you to do that but just letting you guys know. \n\nPS: this is a cute mushy romantic story. With lots of sweet kisses, cuddling, hand holding, midnight trips to the store for pregnancy cravings and deeply family oriented. (And if I\u2019ve lost your interest, don\u2019t worry there will be smut :)",

That means I am very busy: there will be days when my brain will be fried and served with pickles. This introduction seems a bit repetitive, I know, but it is as accurate as can be right now.\n\nIf you add my frequent pauses and bouts of grief to the above, you will see why I'm looking for writing buddies who understand that I am not able to deliver novella type posts. For me, a writer can describe feelings and actions in a few words, and this is what I seek right now. Meaningful but laid back realism, having fun, being able to relax. I can only write in Fandom settings because I no longer have the time to come up with something of my own, sorry about that!\n\nPlease be at least over 18, because mature themes will surely arise: not as a form of compulsion, but as an organic part of the story.\n\nAdult women are what I am looking to play at the moment, in MxF relationships. Romance and Drama are vital for me, as moving, evolving character studies of some sort. I am not interested in Anime or Furry, sorry about that.\n\n1. Marvel Cinematic Universe. Time for something a lot more specific. I am looking to play my own interpretation of Pepper Potts against Tony Stark, as well as Christine Palmer against Stephen Strange.\n\n\nThe above is something I'm inspired by, but not the only thing I'll consider. Hit me up with ideas, plots, cravings, pairings you might have in mind. I have nothing set in stone and enjoy the planning phase of a story the most. :)\n\nThanks for reading all this and I hope to hear from you soon!",

I live in Italy, so my timezone is GMT+2. I'm seeking the following:\n\n* Message rate of at least 1x a day, but hopefully more!\n* A mature player to go along with me, who is willing to discuss their limits if they have any.\n* Messages of any length, or a flurry of them as long as they provide substance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I had in mind for scenes were the following:\n\n* Fantasy RP. Middle magic setting, where it's not common but not unheard of to be a spellcaster. I'd like to play a half-elf Ranger, who could be escorting your character through the wilderness, or hired to clean your land from wild animals, or even as personal security\n* Superhero Fantasy: I'd like to play a street level hero, learning his powers and finds a partner to work with take down a villain we'd make together, or something more in line with slice of life as we patrol the streets together.\n* Sci-fi: Think Mass Effect, Halo or Star Wars! We'd need to work together on what elements of the genre we're including, but I'm willing to work with you!\n\nThank you for reading, and please send me a PM or comment if you're interested!",

From personal experience, two lines of writing and simple gestures can progress a story line and allows for more interactivity between the people. Also, I prefer medieval roleplay because it allows for more development of the characters and their wants, needs, desires, and wishes. I'm really not picky with the scene, but I prefer shorter emotes and quotations. Crafting a short backstory to base that character has been really helpful. Well, those are a few thoughts and interests I thought so- \"Why not put them out there!\" Send me a PM if you are interested in roleplaying! Oh and I hope you are at least 18!

Our aim is to make a server that combines everyone's ideas into it.\n\nWe don't have many restrictions concerning this one. We're looking for people who, above all, are very active on Discord. Veterans or Beginners are welcomed if the idea seems appealing, although we will prioritize people who can RP several lines and/or a few, and put a decent amount of details into it. It doesn't matter if you prefer 1st or 3rd person.\n\nOCs are well encouraged, and we have taken the liberty to add channels with information that could be useful to your creations. \n\nWe're all pretty cool, also! If this seems interesting or you'd like to know me, send me a DM and I'll answer as soon as possible.\n\nHave a great day ~",

            "selftext": "*Hi! Thanks for checking out my post! I'm going to start by outlining a few specific things that are absolutely mandatory for both my partner and I. This is to save you time so that you don't have to read through my entire post to determine if we would match well! Furthermore, I want to ensure that I find the best partner possible because I only ever have one at a time!*\n\nI'm specifically looking for someone who fits the following description:\n\n* Someone incredibly passionate about writing. If roleplay is just your way if filling some void for romance, smut, or something to do while you're bored, then we probably wouldn't mesh well.\n* Someone who likes to write a lot! I've been known to write long posts ten times a day (and if we're both enjoying it, a lot more)! I'm not saying that I want to write a full-length novel every day, but quantity plays just as big a role as quality to me! With that being said...\n* Someone who respects the necessity of quality writing. While I love spitting out reply after reply, I also want to be able to see paragraphs of details and your character's thoughts. I also put no less than three-hundred words into most of my posts, although I've been known to go as high as a thousand or so in the past. I'll never ask you to match my length and depth but it's important that you're willing to actually write out meaningful, descriptive posts.\n* Someone who has experience with a DM. For the uninitiated, that means 'Dungeon Master', which is better described as a narrator and storyteller. Rather than controlling one character, I control the entire universe around yours, whilst you fulfill that of a protagonistic role.\n* And, of course, someone who has at least some basic knowledge of Elder Scrolls lore! I'm no expert myself, but it's important that you at least know the essentials! But if you're an expert on it, then you'll be able to correct any of my mistakes!\n\nI know I've lost a lot of people already! But that's okay. I've spent months and months trying to find a partner because I'm incredibly picky! I don't want just some person to write with, I want a passionate person to befriend and make a beautiful piece of art with. Roleplaying with a stranger gets boring, but writing with a friend is something I can do for the rest of my life.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's talk about **The Elder Scrolls**.\n\n-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-\n\n*30th of Frostfall*\n*171st Year of the 4th Era (4E171)*\n\n*A weakened Empire sat at the center of Tamriel, with antagonists to the south, brigands to the west, ruins in the east, and havens in the north. There was a sense of uncertainty in the air and, in truth, everyone could sense it. Whether you were a noble Altmer or a Nordic nomad, you felt it in your heart. One of the greatest, but shortest, wars Nirn would ever see was preparing to burst open and fell the greatest Empire that the world had known.\n\nIt began with a message. The Aldmeri Dominion sent a *gift*, of sorts, to the Imperial City, heart of the Empire. But rather than being a gift, it was a threat. There were demands of tribute, religion, bureaucracy, and military. The Emporer spat at the envoy. Surprisingly enough, he did nothing other than unveil his gift: A cart full of the heads of every royal agent that had been stationed in Summerset. They were the Blades, one of the oldest orders of warriors that had served the Emporers of Tamriel. Yet, they had all been executed. Before the hour had passed war was declared.\n\nDays later, Thalmor armies invaded Cyrodiil and Hammerfell. They took cities, villages, and forts alike, showing little regard to the populace but offering great brutality instead. \n\nTypical life changed in a matter of days. If you were in a flourishing city, you saw all that glittered devoted to the war effort, regardless of where you lived. Those under the boot of the Aldmeri Dominion were used to life in a militant and brutal society, but people of Highrock, Skyrim, and Cyrodiil were introduced to new forms of rationing and survival. In some way, shape, or form, everyone was devoted to the war effort.\n\nAnd that is where our story begins. The Elder Scrolls have already foretold the fate of the war, but the fate of individuals is not written. Greater threats loom ahead, decades away, but the actions you make today can determine the roads ahead.*\n\n -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-\n\nSo, if you don't know, this story will take place some time after the events of the Oblivion Crisis (TES IV: Oblivion) and a few decades before the Skyrim Civil War (TES V: Skyrim), as well as several hundreds of years after the Three Banners War (ESO). It involves the declaration of Independence by the Aldmeri Dominion followed by their invasion of Cyrodiil, which would last five years. I feel that this is the best time to write out a sandbox-style story because the war takes place in all of Tamriel to some degree. And, if we're enjoying the characters, we can always lead directly into the events of Skyrim and the return of the dragons, as well as the Skyrim Civil War, and even potentially make our own spinoff based off of those events!\n\nAs a DM, I give my partners full-roam of the world that we write in. If you can give me a reasonable explanation for why something should be possible or should happen, I'll allow it. I've incorporated rolling before, but lately I just go by the rule of creativity and cleverness. If you're more clever than your character's opposition, you'll win. But if you make bad decisions, there will be consequences! We can go more in-depth into that later.\n\nI'll conclude this now because I figure it's getting lengthy! If you're interested, please send me a message and tell me about you. Not who you are online, but who you are in real life! I think it's pointless to try finding a friend in a partner if they hide behind usernames and personas. I'll tell you all about me in response and then we can discuss potentially roleplaying together! Thanks for reading!",

Now with that out of the way!\n\nI'm looking for like-minded individuals to run an RP group on Discord with me. I have two set up for different prompts, and I need both mods and members- so world builders and those willing to write in the setting. \n\n* A Victorian Gothic, a plague bringer set to bring about the end of the world. Set in a Steampunk fashion, it is very close to the sky being the limit. \n* Futuristic Dystopic, in the likes of Fallout/Repo! The Genetic Opera/I, Robot. There's a lot to unpack to this one- two forms of AI, live-saving drugs, the ability to manually shut someone's full system down. \n\nIf either of these interest you, shoot me a PM! We'll talk more about expectations and what I'd like for the group, and go from there. :)",

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nDecided to post something here! This post is mainly about the fandom of Kingdom Hearts! Though, a few quick things about myself, in case you were wondering.\n\n\\- I\u2019\u2019m 18+, and prefer my partner to be around the same age.\n\n\\- This is a SFW post, nothing sexual please.\n\n\\- I write in Third person, POV. Love to double/play multiple characters, and even GM.\n\n* I use a number of platforms to write, just mention your favorite- if you wish to write with me.\n* I live in EST Timezone. I try to get at least one reply out, a day- if not more. I don\u2019t try to rush anyone with their replies. Though, I do ask if it will be longer than four days before a reply, just give a quick heads up- I\u2019ll do the same.\n* Anything else? Feel free to ask!\n\nNow, onto my idea. Taking place, after the events of the Special Episode of Birth By Sleep, when Xehanort is found by Ansem the Wise. There is that large, ten year plus gap, of them working on research. I think it would be fun, to dive into that time period. Control those who would later become Nobides, and create the first *Organization XIII* .\n\nSo, Briag, Xehanort, Isa, Lea, Even, and so on. All under the teaching and guide of Ansem the Wise. Listening to them speak on that time, throughout the games, and reading some of the Reports (throughout the games as well), its hinted that they experimented in some dark stuff. Some sketchy business went down, which probbaly lead to Ansem trying to shut it down.\n\nOf course, this idea is open for discussion and taking it into other directions. An AU with them in College could be fun too!\n\nI\u2019m also open to other Kingdom Herats idea, since KHIII is still very fresh in my head. ~~Besides, I love the series anyway, despite all its flaws~~.\n\nThere are aspects in KHIII That I would like to re-write and craft into its own RP.\n\nSomething with a trio, we both like. Diving into almost anything really!\n\nA story, with th trio of, Young Xehanort,  Eraqus and Yen Sid, could be fun to write!\n\nTakign a manga approach, and having Kairi be more active and fun, is also something I\u2019d dive into!\n\nOther Fandoms I enjoy:\n\n*Persona 5, Akiba\u2019s Trip:The Animation, Sword Art Online, JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, Star Wars, did I Say Persona 5?, others too.*\n\nAll open for discussion!\n\nSo, if you are intertested, feel free to shoot a PM my way.\n\nAnd of course, let your heart be your guiding key.",

In short, imagination can take the unpleasant aspects of this weird and twisted world in which we live, and make them into things we're glad to wake up to in the morning.\n\nFriendship is another wonderful and powerful thing. \n\nIt can bind people together for life, let them endure the most catastrophic hardships, and life people up to new heights they never thought possible. A friend at your side is a great blessing, a good friend can save your life, and your best friend can change your life altogether. \n\nIt is those things I'd like to explore and utilize in this story, which takes heavy inspiration from Bridge to Terabithia, a wonderful book and film of you haven't seen or read it. I'd like us to play a pair or a group of young friends that go through life together, sharing the good times and enduring the hardships as only true friends can. Whenever they want to celebrate some great stroke of fortune, escape from some great hardship, or simply pass the bountiful free time their juvenile lives afford them, they go to their special and secret place. Whether it be a hand built treehouse, a well kept spot by the river, an unused allyway, these friends have come together to make it their own and let it be whatever they wanr or need it to be. Whether that might be a space ship under attack by zombie ninjas, a stash of favorite games and books to wile away the time, or simply a quiet and secure place to hide away from all life's problems and hardship, the hideaway is there for them as they are there for each other. \n\nIf what I've written here appeals to you at all, then I'd love to hear from you! My DMs are always open, and I'll respond to you as soon as I can, which may be a little later because I'm about to go to bed at time of writing, but I pinky promise I'll return your message when I see it.\n\nHope to see you soon! :)",

            "selftext": "This timeline isnt so different from our own: Christ, Rome, the Silk Trade, Colonialism, events that have defined our world till about the end of the late 19th century. Where things diverge is just weeks before the American Civil War in a sleepy town in eastern California, a marvel amongst marvels was discovered by two prospective silver miners: what appeared to be a young girl who bore a cotton ball tail, rabbit ears, and digitigrade legs. What they believed to be a girl with birth defects left to fend in the mountains was in fact only the beginnings of what would be a timeline not only dominated by humans but by creatures borne from the imagination of Tolkien, Martin, mythology and fantasy. \n\nThe day was New Years Eve, 1859 and the world would be changed forever as the passing of a blue-tailed comet stirred a world humanity had hardly fathomed could live beside them. From below the earth, dwarf clans long forgotten to the sunlight were discovered by coal miners in Britain, elusive wood elves living in the untouched woods of Germany and France, Genie lamps discovered in the sand dunes of Arabia, dragon clans leaving hibernation in the Himalayas, and ancient bayou spirits stir in the marshes of Louisiana. Great Thunderbirds fly the skies of the Great Plains while towering Wolfkin march south from Scandinavia and Yokai shed their human form to live amongst their human neighbors. For a world steeped in racism, imperialism, and the age of Coal, no one was prepared to know that humans were not alone on this world. And it all started with a rabbit girl, later named Melody by those that found her.\n\nIt is now 2029 and the world has changed since the fateful passing of a blue comet. The world was alit with electricity, airplanes invented, the world still reeled from the horrors of the World Wars, and man landed amongst the stars but they did so with the knowledge that they shared this experience with others. Humans and fantastical creatures fought by side in battles across the seas, on different continents, and in the workplace and streets of everyday life. Where human beings were oppressed for the color of their skin, their religion, or nationality, elves, centaurs, and gnomes were persecuted just as much for features no humans possessed. And as the world progressed into the twenty-first century, the world celebrated the freedoms and liberties of humanity and non-humanity. And our story follows this lull, this calm of the modern day...\n____\n\nHello everyone, today im looking to find someone who wants to venture into the construction of a world very similar to our own where in the modern day creatures and races thought fantasy walk beside us in the workplace, at home, and abroad. Its my hope that we can brainstorm just what has changed in our world with the addition of these peoples as well as build a relationship between our two characters. Personally I prefer something a bit more romantic, mushy-gushy, and cliche perhaps with some adult themes (18+ only please). Are we two humans living in this world together or perhaps one human and another non human and the stigma and complexities that come with such a relationship. Or maybe two non-humans eek out a live in the modern world where only decades before they would've been harassed for simply existing. Regardless, im hoping to find someone who also is seeking a romance-driven narrative where we can explore the life and times of a couple either newly formed or waiting to blossom. Perhaps there is even adventure afoot, perhaps not all is right in this precarious peace between humans and non-humans? Maybe the government has found that with the races of fantasy true and living, so too are the demons, monsters, and ghouls of nightmares! Only time will tell!\n\nAs for what im looking for specifically, im looking for someone who can message back frequently throughout the days if not most days. I write 4-7 sentences on average but can match paragraph to paragraph if I feel its an intense scene; good grammar is preferred by I too know we all mistakes and should not dissuade from a good story if we're having fun! I love OOC relations and I hope that when we arent roleplaying we can just talk and maybe find a friend in the process! Adult themes such as sex, violence, and political themes are possibilities for this depending on what route we take! Please please please be willing to commit to longterm, ghosting is worse than being disinterested because at least then things can end on a good note!\n\nOther than that, not much to it! If you've come this far let me know a bit about yourself! Favorite color, food, favorite mythical race or creature! Just please take time to introduce yourself, very minimalistic messages will be ignored...oh and include the phrase 'Blue Comet' just to show you're reading along! \nHope to hear back soon! :D",

Furthermore, I need someone who is willing to help play the role of \u201cDungeon Master.\u201d\n\n**How the RPG will be done...:*\n\nMy hope is to have the RPG play out like an adventure game similar to Clue or the old school text based adventure games.  There will be rooms/locations with clues that the players can inspect, and NPCs that the writers can interact with.  Depending on the writer\u2019s actions and the clues that are uncovered, the mystery will unravel to all.\n\nIf you think you\u2019re interested, please feel free to shoot me a DM!\n\nThanks.\n\nLex",

            "selftext": "The first snowfall of the season was quite a strong one, covering the frozen forest with a layer of white fluff. Sparkling flurries fell faster as the winds picked up. For the most part, the forest was empty... except for a man trudging through the nasty winter storm.\n\nLindo, the soldier sent to start the fight against an unknown evil was caught in the thick of the storm in the forest. His metal armor clashed and clanged with creeks here and there as it began to freeze over. His breathing became sharp as he took his two last steps before falling to his knees, the armor on the verge of being frozen solid from the hours of walking through the snowstorm. \n\n\"Is this why they sent me... to get rid of me? I'll just be another soldier lost in his travels.\" He told himself as he felt the frostbite eat away at his tips, the rest of the body to follow. \n\n\"I cant... I mustn't...\" In a last attempt to find a place for refuge during the storm, he reached back with his weak hands and pulled his sword out. He stabbed it into the ground to pull himself up with the support he had. Even with his optimism, it would take a miracle to save him from the storm, as the suit had begun to freeze over completely and the frost was reaching and creeping onto his skin.\n\n_______________\n\nHey everyone, Chris here!\n\nI was thinking I write up a little prompt based of a Fantasy setting and a snowfall. I then made it a little crazy with my character, the [handsome elven soldier named Lindo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/c2/bf/41c2bf0a43091843967f9e6092fe15ca.png) being close to death. \n\nSomehow someway, a beauty will come and save him. Is it a simple traveler that is better equiped for the cold? A guardian of the forest that sees Lindo and rushes to help him? Or maybe a mage that is able to heat the two of them up enough before getting to a cave? The choice is yours and we can definately discuss it if you have more ideas.\n\nId love for this RP to be a nice mix between a burning romance and an action adventure story against this unknown evil. The frozen forest is just where we will start and we can definately discuss what this evil is, be it a creeping infection/ corruption of the Land or a Dark Lord Emerging.\n\nI am only looking for partners that are 18+. Please let me know if you are interested in incorporating some NSFW or smut into our RP with the romance. It wouldnt just be for the sake of doing it but it would make sense with the tension building and stuff. \n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red or orange envalope and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! And as always, all my other prompts are open to RPing too so you can just go through my post history! Thanks for reading!\n\n-Chris",

            "selftext": "Good evening r/roleplay, recently I\u2019ve been playing FromSoftware\u2019s new release Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, this has put me in the mood for a samurai adventure in mystical Japan.\n\nThe ideal world for the roleplay would be set around the years 1500-1600 (the Sengoku era for those knowledgable on the subject), while there would be tonnes of realism, there would, of course, be some fantasy creatures such as ogres, ghouls, dragons and the like. All with a Japanese twist.\n\nSo as for storylines, I\u2019ve came up with one, listed below:\n\n1. Us two are samurai, sworn to protect a young Lord for our own reasons. The Lord is kidnapped and the palace is left in flames, we only just make it out alive. With near-to-nothing left but each other, we set out to rescue the Lord, battling bloodthirsty warriors and mythical beasts in the process.\n\nFor those who\u2019ve played it, you\u2019ll know this sounds quite a lot like the storyline of Sekiro. That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m aiming for.\n\nComing to the end, I\u2019d like to note that romance could be involved but is not at all necessary.\n\nI\u2019d like my partner to be able to write with quality, as for quantity I\u2019d expect you to write detailed in the slow, quiet moments, but short messages while in the heat of battle.\n\nThat\u2019s it really. Also, I\u2019m in BST (Britain) time zone, I would like it if you were there as well.\n\nI\u2019m off to bed, so bye for now!",

You were fairly young around early 20's. I was the guildmaster of the thieves guild around your age. Our first encounter was when you were at a party months back geared at brining the 4 nations of the north south east and west together. The party was going great until some undercover thugs tried to attack and use the royal families as hostages. But when they tried to attack their swords had vanished being left with a weird note saying \"I'm with the guild\" they looked around for their weapons but couldn't find anything the guards rushed in and knocked them out they felt like fools. You were hiding in the back room that led to the exit you saw someone around your age walking with 2 swords. You were scared but I put my hand out with a weird note. \"I'd like to chat but here's my card good enough\" I gave it to you and walked out taking the jewels off the hilt of the swords and dumped the swords on the ground. Your dad always told you thieves were bad influences but that made you grow a liking to me, your dad took my card from you an hour later telling you thieves are bad. You haven't directly seen me for a while but you've heard about certain heist that had the same note next to the missing goods. One heist in particular had a missing dagger the was top tier and one of a kind being from the previous royal family. As the princes you were proficient in battle you had mastery over the sword and your spells were some of the greatest. You were tasked with helping your troops your dad planned on showing you around the battlefield as princess who'd have to lead her army. He had you gear up for battle but since it would be hours until it started you walked around the area exploring a bit until you saw someone in a black hood. Next to them had the missing dagger and in a travel pouch had a familiar card. Did you want to follow your heart or bring him to justice maybe understand his reasoning you could approach him with almost any intent\n\n\nI want this to kinda be a romance rp between you and I. Hope you enjoy it\n\nMy Kik matches my username",

I experimented with this set-up a few years ago, back when I was just beginning to immerse myself in the world and all of its associated lore as a Kinderguardian, and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Sadly, as with all things, that endeavor came to an end as said partnership lacked a grander sense of purpose, and life simply got in the way.  \n  \nSo, I thought I'd cast my wish out into the Void, and wait to see if Riven might see fit to align my fate with that of another similarly interested individual.  \n  \nAs with all of my inquiries, I strongly advise any interested parties to peruse [the following document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NB0lwdANbuL8zNsw2OgI9Mjo95koRMIbPU_pDbxMs4k/edit?usp=sharing) **prior to contacting me** so as to avoid wasting one another's precious time.  \n  \nIf you've made it this far, thanks for stopping by.  But if I haven't managed to pique your interest, I wish you the best of luck in your respective searches!  \n  \nCheers,  \n-Izu.",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Ironheart, though if you are reading this you may soon know me simply as the Game Master. For the last 2 or so years I have been contructing in detail a fantasy world for both role play and story telling purposes, and,after finally writing a description of this world that I feel does it some justice, I have decided to launch a discord server in which anyone who finds my work interesting can forge their on long term story with their own character and other rpers, as well as make friends and just have an intresting time all together. The world description is below:\n\nMora| How we came to be.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mora was once a dark and desolate place completely void of life. Then one day from the darkness of space fell a blue star. This star impacted with our world and the energy that gave it its blue hue fused with Mora's surface and all the elements within it. The living energy then assumed a physical form, using its power over the elements to meticulously create itself a body. It then became her, the crafter, and as the crafter with her powers would bring our world life and beauty. She would create plants, then creatures and finally she would create us, the dolls. The first four of our kind were born from her physical body and called the Guardians: Phyra, Isma, Proten, and Ignitis. Each represented an aspect of the Crafters personality and possessed a portion of her power,each controlling one of the elements she had fused with, the crafter herself remaining the sole holder of energy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the Elementals came the more common dolls, born of pod and seed rather then from the crafter herself. At first they remained near the place of their creation, building up a grand city, called the Origin, which still stands today as the capital of our civilization . After a while however, as their numbers grew they began to move out farther into the world, were they used their own powers to build new settlements in all directions outward of the Origin but not leaving the island it was built upon for thousands of years. They lived in such peace and prosperity that the island became known as the Oasis and here each doll lived eternally. The peace was not to last however. Unknown to the crafter and her creations, down just below Mora's surface, in the hollows of the world's crust, a being had been slowly coming awake since the crafter's descendants and now it made itself known. Enraged by the presence of unwanted guest, the being who we'd name Notin, breached the surface and sent up his dark minions who possessed the bodies of living things and used them against us. Valiantly those early dolls took up arms and alongside the Guardians and the crafter held against the threat from the shadows, but Notin\u2019s power was overwhelming and settlement after settlement fell. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thousands of our precursors were lost. In the end the Crafter, with all her compassion and love for her creations, chose to sacrifice her physical form to save all life on Mora. Once again pure energy and one with the world she closed the breeches and trapped Notin and his minions below, preventing them from reinforcing their topside comrades and giving us the reprieve we needed to beat the shadows of destruction back and retake our island.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that first big victory, under the guidance of the Guardians, now the wisest and oldest amongst us, we began to expand rapidly so that we could not be so easily overwhelmed again. For the first time we sailed from the Oasis and settled in unfamiliar foreign lands. We established new settlements and restructured our society to be more efficient, assuring our continued existence. The Authority and its caste system was put in place by the Guardians, and the 1st Arbiter, a doll of pure heart and mind, was created to head it and govern us. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under her, and with the guidance of the Guardian Phyra, who understood the process of creating life better than anyone else, we began making new dolls and using the process of strand weaving to manipulate their traits, allowing them to better fit into their caste and better fulfill their intended societal roles. Once again Doll kind began to thrive, though our war with the remnants of notins cut off forces, left on the surface when the breeches closed, would continue and still continues thousands of years later. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now a days we have managed to come to a point were most of us no longer have to fear for our lives on a daily basis. That said, today doll kind is divided more than ever before. The cities outside of the Oasis and their appointed rulers, the Dons, have become largely independent. Without the Crafter we have also lost our ability to live eternally, and even the mighty Guardians have passed as a result in the years since. This mortality has caused newer generations to seek out the endless lives our ancestor had and some have gone as far as to let their minds be taken in Notins grasp in exchange for power and eternal life. He continues to manipulate the minds of dolls from his realm and we continue to lose cities and towns to treachery and deceit from within.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Infighting has also become a problem. Some Dons let their egos outgrow their domains and clash with others of their caste, leading to strife and even war between Dolls. \u00a0Their are also those who don't wish to fulfill their duty to their kind and leave the cities were they are born to lead lives of solitude and sometimes crime in the wilds. However the most recent Arbiter, the fifth to rule, has been the most zealous in her efforts to restore unity under the Authority. She has employed symbols like the Eye of the Authority to instil a sense of dread in our enemies and security in our citizens. She has enforced our new and old laws alike with an attitude of ruthlessness and mercilessness. \u00a0She directs and coordinates our armies with precision and she does not tolerate the arrogance that some dons have allowed themselves to develop. Still, in spite of her efforts, cities on the frontier line continue to fall and the umbral forces continue to come up with new beast and weapons they use to crack city walls and massacre innocent dolls or take over their bodies and use them against us. However things are,we will continue to fight and we will continue to protect our home and civilization until the the last doll is broken.\n\nIf you are interested here is our Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/dJAvQgR",

Ideally I would like one of us to play as a Blind/Deaf and the other playing as a barista or anyone whomever works in a shop such as this. Romance would blossom eventually, but I love mild slow burn romance. I don't really fancy the two of them falling for each other right off of the bat.\n\nIt is completely up to you, aside from what I mentioned above you can style your character however you may like. I only beg for you not to write for my character, and to be realistic on how you handle the RP. I am totally fine with cracking jokes, this does not have to be a serious 24/7 Roleplay. I just wouldn't want wise cracking all the time. I know we can't completely play a disabled character right, but I'm hoping we try!\n\nAgain, it is up to you on what pairing you would like to take part in. Me however, I like FxF the most and second handedly MxM or I can write a MxF with me playing as male. You can decide to fill a character sheet, or you don't again that is up to you. We can discuss on how old we would like our characters to be, I'm more than fine with college students or young adult. Or even playing as someone older like 35-50 years old. You can just tell me what you care to do here as well, I'd like that to be in your message along with which pairing you would like. I also very much enjoy literate writers, I myself do 2-3 paragraphs but I at the very most ask two paragraphs at most.\n\nI love character development, and maybe we can see some of that with both our characters. It also brings me to my next request. I would like my partner to brainstorm ideas and events with me if that may be okay. If it isn't, that's fine I can just do that. Let's just make this as much as possible! I joke a lot, and I'm down to earth. I won't ever snap at you for anything, and I'm even hoping to make a few friends. But if talking outside RP isn't for you, then you may tell me! I am a patient partner, so I am fine with 1 reply a day or something like that. I am busy as well, so I for sure can give 2 or 3 replies a day but all I ask if for you to know that I did not lose interest I was only busy. I would always message and let you know what held me up.\n\nI am okay with NSFW themes, but given the theme we don't have to go crazy. If you aren't comfortable then just tell me, I can do with or without I have no preference. Fading to black is also an option if that makes you feel more comfortable too. \n\nI only use Discord to RP in. I may be persuaded to use Google Docs for writing, but I never done that before so I would need to be informed on how to do so. Lastly, in your message include something about yourself, the pairing you would like to do, the characters' age range, and which role you care to play. \n\nHappy writing!",

            "selftext": "Howdy! I\u2019m a 19 year old creative writer that has an awesome time-traveling plot to play with with other people. If I have a few players that join a server on discord, then essentially everyone can create a character that is from different times. Each character is teleported to a different era and meet each other. The plot involves teamwork restoring historical and mythical artifacts, despite everyone from being from a different time. Players will have to depend on each other to know some history or for their skills. Combinations can include a Spartan from Ancient Greek times trying to work and understand a cowboy from the cowboy era, a knight working with a modern boxer, etc. \n\nIf you like to play just with one other person but still interested in the plot, then I would be more than happy roleplaying with a solo person. Flexibility for character still applies and I don\u2019t mind what gender you wish to play. \n\nSome rules that I have is that all characters would need to be approved by me. I have a character sheet format set up and I\u2019m not too strict about what you can do. However, if you aim to play something incredibly offensive then I would have to disapprove as there are some things in history that are not okay and is still a problem today. I allow any romance that may develop between players in a group or in solo. NSFW in solo is okay. NSFW in group is not allowed and if you want to get frisky with someone else\u2019s character then I would appreciate it if you took it to DMs. \n\nIf you have any questions you can comment or PM me :)",

This will grant you access to the Imperial Throne, and enable declarations of war, imperial edicts, and boost your prestige, both as a ruler and a dynasty. \n\nWatch as borders around you change, vassals squabble, heresies form, and crusades are declared. Will you restore supreme power to the Imperial Throne, or will you undermine the Emperor, freeing yourself from the shackles of imperial rule, and cast your own fortunes?\n\n[In Dynasties, anything is possible!](https://discord.gg/EUhjmc)",

I like to think I know what I\u2019m doing. I like to be semi-descriptive, extremely descriptive... basically, I like details and I tend to ramble... like right now.\n\nI\u2019m very chatty OOC and I can/will hook you up with pictures of a cute pitbull. I also like to quote vines and memes.. all of the time.\n\nMy phone is always on me at work so I\u2019m very easy to get ahold of most days.\n\nI like my roleplay partner to also be literate. I get it. We all have typos. We all make mistakes.... but if it\u2019s constant, every single response.. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll work out.\n\nAlso, please don\u2019t ghost. I\u2019d rather you bow out then just ghost me.\n\nI\u2019m a full time employee with a lot of time on my hands when I\u2019m off, plus I also like to do stuff on my breaks at work. When I\u2019m bored, I get really bored.\n\nI\u2019ve done mostly fandom, but I\u2019m open to do anything really! Completely an open book, but fandom is where I\u2019m most comfortable.\n\nThe fandoms I like/feel most comfortable in are\n\n\\-Harry Potter (mostly marauders! I\u2019ve played a lot as Sirius!)\n\n\\-Marvel MCU! Mostly Avengers however. I\u2019ve played as Clint, T\u2019Challa, Steve, Bucky, Pietro... but I\u2019m open to play anyone and give it a try!\n\n\\-also the MCU on Netflix... mostly Daredevil and Punisher.\n\n\\-sons of anarchy cause I love me some bikers.\n\n\\-westworld is also a big hit with me\n\n\\-aaaand maybe a select few others I can\u2019t think of right now? It\u2019s too late for my brain to work and I\u2019m killing time at work here.\n\nI usually do OC x Canon, but I am partial to canon x canon, but mostly leaning towards oc x canon. I do like to double so we each have a couple we can both play female in. It just seems fair tbh. I\u2019m all about fairness.\n\nI tend to gravitate towards MxF pairings. Nothing against LGBT+... because I myself happen to be part of the spectrum. But I just am better adept at writing MxF. I also mostly write SFW because most of the time.... I am at work. But I\u2019m also comfortable with writing NSFW. Nothing... super explicit however, because again, at work most of the time.\n\nI do use discord quite often, I\u2019m also a fan of using email. I don\u2019t have a preference. If you wanna go the discord route, sure. If you wanna go the email way, sure. Either way... feel free to message me and we can work something out! I don\u2019t bite, I promise.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, congratulations! Hope to hear from anyone who wants to role play!",

            "selftext": "*In the ancient land of Hyrule, there was once a powerful demon who fought with a goddess and her champion from the sky. The demon was slain, yet before his passing, he cursed the goddess and her hero, dooming them to an eternal cycle of being hounded by his wrath for the rest of time. Over time, the demon's wrath took the form of a powerful sorcerer from the desert, one who was King of Thieves. This sorcerer made war against the goddess' and hero's descendants for many years, before he was finally slain in the bowels of Spectacle Rock and banished forever... Yet there were rumors that the sorcerer's ashes remained, and if the hero's blood was sprinkled on, than the sorcerer himself would reappear...*\n\n*But the years went on, with no sign of the evil sorcerer in sight. The kingdom of Hyrule advanced in both the study of magic and technology. Soon, lands that once were teeming with monsters were replaced with roads, towns, and farms. The ancient temples gradually were forgotten, the monsters and curses within growing dormant. And even the bloodline of the hero itself seemed to fade, though rumors persist of the last line of Hylian knights, living far away in the hills, ever vigilant.*\n\n*Hyrule itself has now progressed. A new invention called an 'automobile' slowly replaces the horse and carriage. Magic, once an arcane force, has been studied and analyzed to the point where it can be used to power machines and even a child can learn how to conjure small fireballs. The kingdom has long been ruled over by the wise Royal Family. Queen Zelda has recently ascended to the throne, and she uses the Triforce to ward Hyrule against evil.*\n\n*But not everything is well, as far to the south, whispers of the once extinct Gerudo tribe begin to resurface, led by a witch of both fire and ice. Furthermore, the kingdom's once staunch allies, the Zora and Goron, seem to have become mistrustful of both each other and the Hylians who live near them. And worst of all, a troubling report has surfaced among the seedier bars of the world: tales of an ancient tomb, with the ashes of he who was once \"King of Evil.\" None can say where the tomb is, but a small cult of outcasts is paying anybody with information...*\n\nHey! Thanks for reading this far. Basically, this is an idea that I came up with of a Zelda game set in a Hyrule that resembles an early 1900's world. (i.e. Cars are around but not widely available, telephones are somewhat hard to come by.) This would be set in the Downfall timeline (Attlp, Oracle, LA, Loz,AoL) a few hundred years after the Adventure of Link, in a Hyrule with somewhat modern technology and a advanced understanding of magic (think something like the Elder Scrolls).\n\nYou would be playing as the latest version of either the Hero (i.e. Link, but I'm not picky with regards to gender or name) or some other OC we could decide on. I would be playing as a mystic who is searching for the hero.\n\nTimezones:\n\nI live in the EST and am usually active from 2:00-10:00. I will always try to do at least one post a day, maybe more if my schedule allows.\n\nMedium:\n\nI can do either Discord or here with Reddit PM. I usually will do about 4 or 5 sentences.\n\nRomance:\n\nRomance is not a requirement, but if you want it, I will only do MxF romance. I also only do SFW, so nothing more mature than PG.\n\n[Other]\n\nWhile Zelda is of course usually a family friendly series and I will generally stay there, I may introduce some more mature elements such as violence or psychological themes. Please be at least 20 before replying.\n\nIf this catches your interest, PM me and we shall see where it goes. Thanks for reading!",

The world of Aedre is largely undiscovered, even much of Inoctsam remains a mystery, and a wild magic and a diverse ecosystem make much of it dangerous to explore. The primary playable area is the trade city of Esnium and its surrounding lands, which sits on the Esnan Isthmus connecting the Northern and Southern portions of the continent of Inoctsam. Esnium is not an entity unto itself, however. It is the combination of cooperating guilds and prolific trade to its sister cities of Yliritas and Gealwen. The guilds of Esnium include The Church of Vestau, The University of Magic, The Merchants' Guild, and the Mercenaries, each filling a vital role in Esnium. For those less savoury types, the Underground is also host to its own guild: the Vipers, a collection of assassins, thieves, thugs, and other ne'er-do-wells.\n\nCome check it out, and see if it's for you!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/B6XS3uP",

HOWEVER, I want it to fit into the story and not be rushed for the sake of NSFW\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's pretty much it! Like I said, I'm  very flexible with topic ideas/genres/ect. so please feel free to ask questions!

I'm looking to do an RP based on the Fallout universe, as I've been playing that a lot lately and it's given me the inspiration to do something like this! \n\nA little about me, I'm 21 and have... A few years role-playing, couldn't tell you exactly how many years I have under me. I'm typically okay with NSFW elements, though I would prefer it to be on the back burner. I'm on PST and work late at night, so I'll be able to respond during then. \n\nAnyway, if any of this interests you, drop me a message and we'll see where we go! I typically like to RP on Discord, but I have several platforms from which to do so. \n\nHope to hear from you!  \ud83d\ude03",
