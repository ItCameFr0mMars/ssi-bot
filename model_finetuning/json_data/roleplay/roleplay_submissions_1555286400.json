The premise is good for a group RP, but I\u2019m open to one on one RP in PMs. \n\nThat being said, I will happily do crossovers with canon universes and characters. I\u2019m especially interested in Loki but I\u2019m definitely open to other characters.\n\nI\u2019m looking to RP on Discord, Kik, or Skype. \n\nL\n\nThe original world premise. \n\nIn an alternate universe, on an Earth virtually identical to our own, fates were changed on a night in December of 2012. On the night of the 21st, the sky changed. The stars and moon seemed to glitch, flickering before blacking out altogether. The sky remained black for 2 minutes before there was a bright flash of bluish-white light. That was the Night of the Change. The next day was Death Day.\n\nA majority of people on Earth were changed after witnessing the flash associated with the Change. Some were changed physically, and others were changed in other, invisible ways. Over half of humankind had become superhuman overnight. However, most of the humans that were changed (now called Changelings) died as a result of not being able to handle or control their superpowers. Several normal humans were killed as well as they came into contact with the brand new, unprepared Changelings. The recorded death toll at the end of the day was in the millions. But some believe that it was over a billion.\n\nHowever, not everyone died. Some were knocked unconscious before their new abilities could overwhelm them, some (who were exceptionally mentally strong) managed to suppress their powers by sheer will, and others were just plain lucky.\n\nAfter society reformed, known Changelings were quickly recruited by the government and military forces to capture or take down the Changelings that decided to use their superpowers for crime. Some of these recruited Changelings have been assigned to teams for more top-secret missions. Criminal Changelings that are captured are commonly used for tests and experiments.",

            "selftext": "I've already posted to this thread for the past two days asking for something with a Sci-Fi based RP, but have had no luck in anyway messaging me about it. So with this post I hope I can find a partner. As opposed to the previous posts I'll have sort of more of an idea for the plot in this post, so that'll hopefully help you find this interesting! However before that I would like to just talk a tiny bit so you can get to know me a bit better.  \nI've RP'd for about 4 or 5 years now and I'm male. I'm also a pretty big fan of anime (And for anyone wondering the only currently airing anime I'm watching right now is JoJo's. Besides keeping up to date with that I'm going to finally start Steins;Gate pretty soon.) Anyway anime aside I also want to mentioned that I would very much prefer to do the RP on discord, as I'm quite active on there.   \nRegardless getting back to RP itself... As you already know I'm looking to do a more Sci-Fi based RP. It doesn't have to be strictly that, as I'm fine with stuff like romance, though if romance is involved I would still like there to be an actual story around the actual RP itself. Also if you have any suggestions or ideas for the RP, feel free to mention them! (Even completely new plot ideas are welcome!) Anyway without a further ado...! Let's move on to the first plot idea!  \n**Plot Idea - (Would definitely include aliens as well as mechas and the like. Would Likely include space travel.)    (Romance is optional.)     (Having some sort of 'superpower' based aspect is also optional.)**  \nThe time period for when this RP could begin, could either be in a more modern setting, or could already be in a slightly more advanced type of Earth. Regardless to the plot itself... What seemed to be like a meteorite would land on the planet. My own OC would be nearby the event, and would end up snatching a glowing piece of what came off from the meteorite. However unknown to him it had not been a meteor, but rather what looked to be a space pod of sorts? The government would quickly take the space pod into their custody but there didn't seem to be anything inside of it... Less than a day later unfathomable ships from space would invade the planet, the aliens from within them demanding the 'L.A.I.' to be returned to them. Should the 'L.A.I.' not be returned to them within 24 hours, the aliens would tear apart the planet until they find it. But this would raise the question of what is this so called 'L.A.I.'? Why is it so important? These questions will be answered in the RP should you chose this plot.   \n*That's more of the starting point of the idea I have for this RP! While I'm not sure what kind of character you would use, there are honestly quite a bit of options. I'm not going to make you play any specific one, nor do you have to use any of the ideas I'm about to give, but I figured I'd give the ideas out in case you needed them! So first up, you could play as a normal human, the same as my character. Possibly a friend, classmate, co-worker, or even just a stranger. Anyway another one is that your character could possibly be an alien that had been hiding on Earth for a while, but this invasion could bring you out of hiding? Or you could even possibly be one of the aliens attacking the planet, or perhaps some sort of spy from space infiltrating the current invasion. Regardless as I mentioned before, you don't have to follow any of those if you don't want to, just some ideas I thought I would throw out there! Also the 'superpower' based aspect that I mentioned was optional, could just be something as simple as like certain aliens have unique abilities like some can breath fire, etc. Or even humans could mutate to an extent an obtain these certain powers.*  \n\n\nAnyway! That's my idea for the RP... I hope that this interested you, and if it didn't as I mentioned before, feel free to suggest stuff! And if you are interested or have other ideas, please message me directly here on reddit, as we can also share our discord tags there. Anyway I hope to talk to you soon!",

            "selftext": "ABOUT ME\n\nhello my name is kira and i\u2019m looking for a roleplay partner! im 17 years old, an artist who loves to draw original characters, a musician, and an actress. i looooove ooc chat and making friends : ) my timezone is est.\n\nWHAT I'M LOOKING FOR\n\nplease be around my age. i\u2019m not super comfortable writing with people like over 20, under 15-16.  i\u2019m looking for long term roleplay partners who are able to respond somewhat quickly.. my responses can be rapid fire if im interested in a roleplay.. it\u2019s cool if you\u2019re the same way, just don\u2019t spam me and message me every minute asking me where i am. if i know i\u2019ll be gone for a while i\u2019ll let you know. if you dont send rapid fire replies, i\u2019m still fine with that lol. recently, life has been a little busy for me, so my responses sometimes get limited to like once per day. when i\u2019m not busy, i\u2019ll be able to respond more of course. i\u2019m looking for someone who is semi literate (i am semi literate too i guess.. lol. i only write like this ooc) and can write somewhat lengthy responses.. i understand if there\u2019s a point where you seriously can\u2019t write more than a paragraph, but when you\u2019re able to, please do. i do the same or at least try to, hah. (NO one liners please)\n\nWHAT I RP\n\ni\u2019m really interested in romance and anything to do with fantasy or the supernatural. i\u2019m totally willing to work with other genres though. i ONLY do original roleplays using OCs, just a heads up. i will not do fandom roleplays because i honestly suck at playing as a character that isn\u2019t my own. i have a few plot ideas/concepts written down but i\u2019ve used a lot of them already so i\u2019m kind of bored of them! i\u2019m 1000938% willing to hear any ideas you might have. \n\ni write in 3rd person, past tense and i\u2019m not really willing to change that.\n\ncharacter-wise... again, i draw all of my ocs and i\u2019d really like it if you\u2019d use face claims that aren\u2019t actual people! like anime characters and other drawings that aren\u2019t yours are fine if you don\u2019t draw. it\u2019s just a thing yknow.. if you\u2019re an artist as well i will love you forever. before starting roleplays i like to give short descriptions on my character so more is learned throughout the roleplay. you can give me as much info about your oc as you want, but i\u2019ll most likely give the basics.\n\nCONTACT INFO\n\ni think that\u2019s it? just so i know you read all this, include the word yellow somewhere in your message to my discord, kik... whatever i give you. also, PM me and let me know which you\u2019d like to message me on. (i have kik, skype, discord, email) when you do message me, pleaase introduce yourself (if you\u2019re comfortable doing so), tell me how you like to roleplay, genres you\u2019re interested in, plot ideas you have.. etc!! dont skimp on the details :)\n\nif you\u2019ve messaged me in the past and i stopped responding, feel free to message again!!",

            "selftext": "This will be geared more towards trying to find a good long-term partner rather than a roleplay itself. I hope to give you everything you need to make an educated choice if I would fit as a good partner.\n\nA little bit about me: I started roleplaying when I was way too young being taken advantage of by someone way too old. I loved it at the time and I didn't even realize what was happening but I was falling in love with writing, being different characters in different situations, living different lives in different places. I spent way too much time writing the clich\u00e9 boring old smut plots that everyone seems to hate (I know don't judge me) Since then I have evolved, learned and gained better taste. I do not regret what I used to do as it helped me become who I am today and if I may say so I've never heard a complaint on the r rated theme. I will state off the bad I do enjoy r rated themes I'm not pushing, demanding, or asking for them.\n\nI started off roleplaying in a quick-firing sort of way and it spoiled me. I have a harder time trying to do the forum sort of reply when you can style but I do my best. I love getting into the roleplay and hyped in the moment, experiencing it like reading a book or watching a movie. It's such an addicting experience and I find during in the forum style I don't get as pulled into it. I'm open to whatever at the moment I'm not demanding quick-firing but I'm also not willing to take those who are so busy they can only reply once a week, not to sound too demanding.\n\nI've always appreciated time and how important it is. We should all value our time which is why I always look for mature partners with good communication. Unless you completely hate my writing there is absolutely nothing we can't work out together and I mean it, I'm as easy going as they come. I dislike those who can't speak their minds and explain what is wrong and why. I know not everyone has a firm understanding of themselves and I feel like I'm able to explain myself (in most situations) very well and articulate but someone likewise would be nice. We are mature adults I can handle negative feedback as long as it's done with a little class.\n\nIt's also important for me to not be the side roleplay, the one you reply to when you are waiting for the big main to reply. I'm not going to be that guy, I refuse it. If you are looking to just fill your roleplays up please keep looking. I love when a partner appreciates what I wrote, the easiest way to hook me into a story or make me smile is just letting me know you enjoyed the previous reply. \n\nI can post as much as you, I tend to post at least a paragraph each and every response I do not do shorter than that. I've done posts that's been well over the 1k word mark but I'm not setting a requirement. As much as I love long replies they have to be a really good story! I'm sure we can find a medium sweet spot.\n\nI'm looking for someone who likes a fair share of different themes, relationships, experiences, plots, etc. I don't want to be stuck doing the same old play or the same old character. I absolutely love romance and its a major theme in all my plays. I've done my fair share of simple romantic roleplays and I do love them.\n\nIf you want a simple slice of life roleplays I'm your guy, if you want longer, deeper with a rich story and vast world I'm still your guy. I like romance in anyway I can get my hands onto it. Romance must be a theme as long as the roleplay has that I'm completely open to whatever it is we do. Long-term, short-term it's all good! You will never get stuck doing the same thing with me.\n\nI'm good at build up, dialogue and getting into a character's mind and feeling who they are. I'm not as good at fantasy settings (willing to do them) Nor am I great at grammar, you probably notice me using the wrong word hear ;) and there it will happen. I do my best, if you haven't had a major issue with this message then you shouldn't have a problem in a roleplay. I'm human and I tend to live in the moment, I do not obsess for hours over my replies making it 100 percent perfect.\n\nIt seems like I'm either really well liked or ghosted really quick, or liked for a week and ghosted? I'm not sure why but there it is. I'm hoping to make it past the week point with someone (crosses fingers) I don't push for replies, if I haven't heard from you I will ask, especially if we just started talking but I don't hound. I'm mature and I understand everyone has lives and such.\n\nAs of right now I'm pretty open with what to do I have no aches or urges so talk to me and maybe we can stir something up together. I would love to find a partner for a simple romance plot. I'm in my comfort zone when it comes to modern, romance, a slice of life, character building but I'm more than happy to step outside my comfort zone with you. If you have a problem with something please speak up. \n\nSomething I've been craving lately is a bit of role reversal. Take your typical female roles and your typical male roles and do the opposite. So for a very basic example, normally whenever I do Boss x employee females tend to pick the employee side and males tend to do play the boss. I would like to try the other side of roles for a change (this is only really needed with a simple slice of life roles or ones that just need a little twist to make it good)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of right now: No fandoms, no anime, no roleplays centered around abuse or addictions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can work the rest out in private! I hope to hear from someone! Lets create some love.",

I am looking for decent Roleplay partners that can take roles and settings that we both can agree on. The more character development the better. \n\nRULES BEFORE ASKING ME\n\n*Please be 18+ / serious about certain topics\n\n*Dont just leave me on Read, and if you do, let me know if you\u2019ll be busy. I\u2019ll do the same\n\n* PLEASE be literate. I usually do a couple of paragraphs. I\u2019d be happy to write at your rate, but be detailed.\n\nSome plots that I\u2019m good at, and I\u2019d love to do with others\n\n1.) In the town of Arailia, the royal hears from the trained guards that a person has stolen from a local business. That man, was actually robbing to get into the kingdoms jail, so it was easier to murder the royal. During the time being, the royal interviewed this person; their intentions, where they came from. Suddenly the man grew closer to the royal, and fell in love. But if he didn\u2019t go through his task, something bad will happen. \n\n2.) A drug addict was put in a Rehab center, and grew a bond with others in there with personal experiences. They themselves finding some type of personal feelings towards a certain someone also struggling with these types of drug addictions. \n\n3.)  there\u2019s a meteor eventually going to hit earth, and the world is told that the majority of America will run down and the population will die. A group of friends believe this, and do everything off their bucket lists before time runs out.\n\n4.)  A scientist works in a lab that secretly was working on a genetic intelligence that lives in a tube and eventually wants out. The scientist had found this to be unjust, and one day opens up the lab and the imprisonment  of the entity. \nThe scientist found that the entity was more human like than it was abnormal. \n\n**** if you have ANY other plots that you want to do let me know and I\u2019d be happy to do them! ***\n\nPM me if you\u2019re interested!",

It's currently very small, but we're hoping the more members to join, the more fun it'll be.\n\nPhoenix Rising takes place in 1920s New York, and mainly revolves around a magical world, attempting to keep together and stay hidden while a rebellion attempts to overthrow the current form of government ruling over the arcane community. While facing down this threat, they must also avoid discovery from a Mundane group of Witch Hunters and a cult to a German Necromancer dragon. With tensions rising and even independents being dragged into the conflict, it is a matter of time before something gives, and it is uncertain if the magical world-or the mundane for that matter- will survive.\n\nFeel free to directly message me for a link, and feel free to ask any questions you might have!",

            "selftext": "Before we get to the good stuff. I do want to say my Time zone is Central US. So I am most active in the evenings my time.   \n\n\nSteel rang and a woman grunted. She spun back and thrust with her spear. The beast easily smacked her weapon aside and swiped at her with its claws. She jumped back and with a mighty flap of her wings gained altitude. Her crimson hair fanning out as she let out a battle cry and dove back towards the beast. It again easily slapped her spear aside its other had flashed up. She didn't have time as its massive hand wrapped around her throat. She immediately kicked at it but even with her strength and armored boots, the beast didn't seem to notice. It pulled her close its rancid breath hot on her face and laughed. \"They send a pathetic creature like you to oppose me?\" Turning he slammed Arariel against the wall. She cried out in pain and dropped her spear. Her golden eyes flashed with anger. She went for the sword at her waist. The creature laughed again. \"No no, my little bird. Can't have you hurting yourself.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArariel had been sent to destroy a demon who had been bold enough to try and climb into the heavens. Instead of some minor demon, she had found a beast that was more than a match even for a chosen like her. It stood huge nearly eighteen feet tall as it held her pinned against the wall.  It leaned low a cut across its cheek leaking small amounts of fire. \"Now what to do with you?\" Arariel had never known fear, She was a champion to the Archangel of justice. The look the beast gave her caused her to learn what it was to be afraid, Ice seemed to fill her veins and settle around her stomach. \"I know what we shall do.\" The beast pulled her sword from its scabbard. It pulled her away from the wall and with a swift movement spun her to face the wall before slamming her against it again. She cried out in pain but it was nothing compared to what she suddenly knew was coming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beast grabbed her arm easily pulling it out and with a grunt drove the blade through her arm pinning it to the wall. She screamed and did her best not to pull it and cause more damage. He repeated the process with her other arm leaving her pinned to the wall and even more helpless before his strength. It laughed again. \"Look at you. True seraphim to the core. You won't even beg me to not do exactly what you know I am going to.\" She was afraid and he was right she knew what was going to happen now or she thought she did. His hands came up and each took hold of her golden wings. She broke and screamed. \"NO!\" His foot came up and the world vanished in a white haze of agony. She could hear herself screaming but it sounded so distant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't know how much time passed before she came back to herself. The pain in her back was indescribable. It was the sight of one of her wings laying just within her line of sight as she turned her head that brought tears to her eyes. \"Oh don't cry little bird there is more fun to come.\" He yanked the swords from her arms and she slid to the ground. The beast lifted her and looked into her eyes. \"I challenged your master to send his most faithful servant and I would break them. Now we will see if he was right to choose you.\" His claw came up and carved a symbol on to her chest. Not overly large but she immediately felt the weight and knew it was a corrupting thing. The beast smiled. \"Now thank me as you will serve a much more noble purpose than being a guard dog.\" She hit him but had little strength left. He laughed again and hit her back she flew over the edge of the plinth they stood on. He loved the look of fear on her face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe screamed as she fell. It took her a moment to notice the sudden glow of bright golden light. She stared and hope filled her for a moment he had come for her. Castiel Archangel of justice appeared before her. He smiled but it wasn't his usual smile of greeting it was sad. \"I am sorry this had to happen to you. Know that there is a reason for it and one you shall soon understand.\" He placed his hand on her chest opposite the demon mark a golden flash and a feeling of warmth. \"The war is changing. A dangerous imbalance has appeared and you have been chosen to stop it. Know that you and you alone will do this.\" She was stunned. \"M....my lord?\" He had set her up for this and now expected her to solve this problem? Anger flashed in her golden eyes. \"Faith my dear you will soon find out where you belong.\" He faded and she screamed for him to wait. He just smiled and vanished. She opened her mouth to scream at him but the impact with the ground robbed her of the breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(OK, so I am hoping that this might go a few different routes. The demon continues to stalk her and corrupt her. Working to turn her against the heavens and give the infernal a massive advantage with her knowledge of the heavens defenses.\n\nOr she falls in love with a mortal. I don't think I need to explain this one too much. They work to address the balance together.  \nI am happy to discuss ideas or variations of this or to make changes if someone is interested.   \nThis will have Action, adventure and likely romance of some kind. Could be dark if she is stalked by the demon. Based on a dream I had. I am not expecting responses in the length of above, One or two paragraphs would be great.)",

            "selftext": "TLDR: professionals / bounty hunters specialising in the magical and paranormal travel around a magical world, dealing with / subduing magical threats and monsters. Exact relationship between characters to be decided. (Inspired in part by Hellboy / Assassins's Creed Odyssey).\n\nHello, and thanks for clicking on this one. I'm sure you know all the \"house keeping\" stuff, so I'll cover that at the end. \n\nI'll say now that my focus is on world building / character development, but ultimately I just want to have fun. Any questions, just PM me.\n\nFirst the actual idea;\n\nI'd like to create and explore a world meshing together elements of ancient mythologies and legends; Gods, Monsters and magic. We could take from existing stories and pantheons, or lay our own foundation and create a fantastical world from scratch.\n\nI'd like our two characters to adventure together. Quests and trials and shenanigans aiding the growth of whatever relationship we chose for them. Be it enemies who grow to be friends, friends who grow to be lovers, or lovers who become enemies. (Yes I'm ripping that from Sky High!)\n\nIn my mind the magic would be closer to things like Percy Jackson, Skulduggery Pleasant, and Avatar, but with enough of a nebulous element to facilitate anything that might not fall immediately under that umbrella (like something closer Sabrina on Netflix).\n\nI am as of yet undecided as to whether this would best suit a \"swords and sandals\" ancient setting, or if it could take place in a more modern environment without too much changed. I don't see it going too far to the future though as I don't see magic / fantasy mixing well with Sci-fi.\n\n(Also, I'm always open to ideas and suggestions, so please tell me any you have.)\n\nRegarding formatting/ preferences: as long as you write fairly well the finer details can be ironed out later.\n\nI've been Roleplaying on an off for about 10 years now, so I'm adept but not overly fussy. I feel having a partner I can engage enthusiastically is more important than my gripes, and I'm versatile enough to cater to any specific set up. I would however like to find someone who enjoys world building and developing characters as much as I do, and who looks forward to exploring new ideas.\n\nI'd also prefer said partner be 18+. Sexuality isn't my main focus, but I'm open to stories which include that if called for. And with that I think it best for everything to be above board.\n\nI think that is everything that needs saying, so I look forward to hearing from you.",

That being said, I'm also super excited to get creative and stretchy my writing muscles. \n\nI'm looking for a partner who wants to write with me. I'm really not a fan of the \"*hugs you*\" type role play, as it comes off as a little awkward to me. I personally prefer 3rd person writing, but I'm also not super picky. I'd like to role play with someone near my age (20) male or female. I am a female, and I do not have a male/female preferance for my characters. \n\nAs for genre, oh boy. That's the thing about not having done this in a while, I have no idea where to start. I would really like it if you PMed me, and we could start brainstorming ideas off of each Other. I'm not opposed to fandom based RPs, and the idea of creating one from scratch is pretty cool too. \n\nI would prefer to use discord or kik, but if that's not your style we can figure something else out. \n\nI guess the bottom line here is, you should just message me, and we'll figure the rest out from there.",

My girl Lianna is a small town ranch owner who is a member of the Adopt a Soldier program, the group that sends letters and packages to soldiers out on deployment. One day, one of her letters reaches a Navy SEAL or maybe even a Green Beret on deployment, and he strikes up a camaraderie with her amongst the war and tragedy surrounding him. They fall in love through their letters, emails, packages she sends, and there could be a few different routes we could go, whether he returns to meet her, the enemy intercepts their letters and figures out where she lives, she is told he was killed/missing in action and mourns even though he has in fact survived and is trying to make his way back to her alive...we can certainly talk about where it could go! I write in third person past tense and tend to write a paragraph to several paragraphs in my replies. We can rp through email or Discord, but message me here if you are interested!",

Japan, once dominated by heroism, as seen the increased creep of criminal presence.

We provide a healthy environment for both veteran RPers and newcomers alike, with an easy to learn \"script-based\" style. The server also sports consistent tournaments, arcs, and events both seen in the show and ones created by the talented Roleplayers in our ranks. With a month already carved through, your character can jump right into the action with little they haven't experienced.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world we set is not intended to be, or in any shape is to be accepted as canon. We do it for our own fun, and as to not spoil those who are anime only with future plot points not yet explained. We run alongside the real world of My Hero Academia, fifty years in the future.

            "selftext": "Good day, all you lovely lads and ladies!\n\nI'd like to take another stab at a plot I attempted a little while ago, with some slight variations and more openness this time around.\n\nLong story short, my idea centers around a mother (or a father, but I'd prefer to play a mom) having raised a sickly child (you) since birth, and being a total supermom in the process. Since she's devoted so much of her time and effort to raising you and making sure you have as good a life as she can manage, she's neglected her own life and needs, and has essentially pushed them away and almost forgotten that she's her own individual person too. I'd like to explore what happens after she finally finds a cure or treatment for your disease, and as you grow more and more independent, she finds herself no longer needed, and has to face the music and deal with the fact that she has been neglecting herself for possibly decades, and her closest is full of legions of nasty skeletons. She then unwillingly begins the long road to recovery of her own, and maybe has to rely on her child for a change instead of always being the superhero. \n\nI like emotional and heavy plots, and if any of this sounds interesting to you, feel free to messege me! I'd love to talk some more if you'd like to try this out, and I have a lot more ideas on the story and where it could go in the future.\n\nHope to hear from you soon! :)",

Unfortunately i usually don't have time to do consistent chat-based games. This is a \u201csandbox\u201d hard sci fi RPG idea i've been developing for a while: A few words about the setting: it's a grand scale space opera style, with spaceships traveling between systems, establishing bases and doing the von Newman thing.. (more spaceships) \u00a0there is no known faster than light travel, no artificial gravity. \n\nEnergy produced mostly by fusion and antimatter catalysed fusion, so antimatter is extremely rare and expensive, big spaceships will have maybe a few grams on board. \n\nInterstellar propulsion made possible by fusion engines, and a combination of solar/laser sails which require megastructures in form of laser arrays at least in the outbound system and gravitational maneuvering, with possible bussard ramjets if the gas density in the region is very high. \n\nInterstellar ships is massive with large crew, with most of the crew in \u201ccold sleep\u201d anabiosis for most of the voyage. Voyages between even close stars take decades.\n\n\nOn the story: You will start as part of a reduced crew of an interstellar ship Red Star sent to investigate an outpost that went \u201cquiet\u201d unexpectedly. \n\n\nWhere the story takes us, the sky's the limit. Depending on a scale we wish to take it could be from individual adventure to massive scale with players controlling multiple ships and colonies. NSFW is fine if its in a scope of a game (and everyone involved is an adult) this is however mostly an adventure game not intended as exclusively romance game.",

Operating more like a college than anything, kids attending will choose a subject to study in, such as music, art, science, or theatre. Even attempting to gain the ability to submit an application to the school is hard, and most suitable candidates are selected through a lottery. A small town with a mall, restaurants, and stores eventually sprang up around the school, which is far away from most other towns. Because of this, kids tend to live in dorms, each in co-ed dorm halls. \n\n\nThis RP will focus the inhabitants of one dorm hall in particular, Freshman hall A-9. If you are interested in, then join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/wZjgfFt). There is no max amount of people and you can join whenever you want, so don\u2019t feel afraid. Beyond that, I get that we all have our own lives, so 24/7 contact and playing is NOT necessary.\n\n\nThanks, and have a nice day",

(That is to say, I like the elements of high fantasy and adventurers- I don\u2019t expect you to bring a bag of dice \ud83d\ude02) \n\nI\u2019d prefer it if you were over 18, I\u2019m not especially into nsfw stuff (though if you want to make the case for it, then I certainly don\u2019t mind exploring some of it)- it\u2019s mainly because I\u2019m 18+ myself and the idea of writing with a 14 year old is kind of weird for me idk. \n\nAnyway- if I haven\u2019t driven you off so far, pop me a PM if you\u2019re interested!",

It can be romantic, whatever you'd like! \n\nThis roleplay is inspired my My Chemical Romance's Danger Days setting, a nuclear apocalypse where a megacooperation rising to power is on the mission of capturing survivors for their own benefit and to create a perfect world again. A team of rebels are trying to take the company down, often running away from the grasp of the company and trying to survive as best as they can. The rebels steal from, kill and raid the company's bases.\n\nI will play the character of a teenage girl, surviving on her own in this hellish landscape. You can be anyone you want, another rogue survivor, a member of the rebel team, or an employee of the megacooperation. I hope you like it! I will enjoy roleplaying with you.",

She studies Art and philosophy and works as a street artist as a side job.  \n(I have a full bio written for her that I will send you in private)  \nI don't want to make to many requirements for your character, but my idea was that she could maybe come from a wealthier family and seem more like a straight-A student. Of course, she also should have problems, but I will leave those up for you to decide on. Some examples would be confidence issues or too high expectations from her parents. You don't have to choose that, just make sure your character is different from mine.  \n\n\nThe themes for this roleplay would be hurt/comfort, drama and romance.  \nI know I kept it short but well pictures of my character and bio are waiting for you, after you pm'd me.  \nHave a nice day/week.",

I tend to use Discord as my platform, but Google Docs is fine too... as long as you don't mind me making it pretty!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not picky if the Rp takes place before or after Weirdmaggedon and if its before, I'm willing to do canon divergence to keep it interesting/natural instead of forcing everything to happen the same way it did in the show. I'm also willing to do NSFW content and darker themes (i.e. abuse, toxic relationships, mental illness, etc...) if it tickles your fancy. If not, I can always adapt so the rp is something you're comfortable with and we can both enjoy it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested and want more information, please PM me so we can talk and see if we can work something out",

            "selftext": "Hello there! I am looking for a long term buddy, now before I get into anything I would like someone literate and at least creative with what they're writing. Also, the point of this is Romance too. I am fine with doing FXF, MXM, and MXF(me as male.) that's really the only point I can stress. I would like development, not our characters instantly in love or anything like that, a crush is different. I am open to your ideas as long as you don't control and force my role. \n\nI do plenty of Fandoms, I have been Roleplaying for five years now and I can say I am very literate. I strive for that, makes everything better for me. I don't mind NSFW themes, as long as it's plot driven. I do love a dark Roleplay, but if anything like that doesn't suit you then tell me. I wish not to make you uncomfortable. \n\nI Roleplay Naruto, Marvel, DC, Last of Us, Avatar, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Legend of Korra and Teen Wolf. I can play canon Characters, we can also mash together ships that don't exist too. And I am fine with OC, I also love themes with Supernatural. I always wanted a Werewolf Roleplay, or even a Vampire Roleplay would sound good to me. My favorite would be for Harry Potter or My Hero Academia, and Viking style with Dragons possibly. \n\nIf this one, we can create OC or play Canon Characters in a different direction than the running anime. If so I'd be interested in playing  Midoriya, Iida or even Bakugou. I can plot an idea out for any of these, and I wish for you to help me out with plotting in general. I don't expect you to go crazy with length. Just two would be fine, I love quality over quantity.\n\nI would rather have long term as well, and I mostly use Discord. You can message me information about it. In your message include something about yourself, and if you message can you make sure you're capable of literacy and semi long replies. Be friendly and creative! I won't answer if you don't tell me about yourself and what you're interested in. And what pairing you like, MxM or MxF. If not, It would show you didn't read any of it, and that you aren't interested much. That may not be the case but that's what it would seem as.",

I\u2019ll elaborate more on the plot (forgive me if it doesn\u2019t make sense). \n\nI\u2019m thinking of doing a romantic horror plot revolving around a werewolf who has over time lost their humanity to their lycanthropy, to the point that they struggle to act normal when in human society. This often causes people to view them as a freak or a brute, only pushing them further into isolation. Till they happen to met someone who doesn\u2019t treat them like a brutish oaf, who doesn\u2019t scoff at or judge their strange behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s not fully fleshed out, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nThis plot could possibly delve into some dark themes, so just be aware of that. \n\nMy only writing requirements is that you write in third person, no text speak, and no one word responses. Extremely long replies not required(but welcome), but please be detailed. I'm not picky about occasional spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading!",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Superheroes, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), Greek, Roman, some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind, admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am primarily looking for as a partner (BUT not required!). And hopefully one who has no limits, like me. And yes, I'm fine with playing female characters too.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me or ask me with the Reddit chat system, though I do prefer the PM option more.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have the urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm here on Reddit again to search for a partner for... something, man, I dunno. I've been indecisive on what I want for a while, and I guess something like this is the best way I'll find anything even close to what I'm looking for. What do I want? Something with romance. Romance, romance, romance. The cuter and fluffier the better. I want to be able to gush over our characters' interactions, and I promise at least that I'll be able to contribute in that regard. Bring any concepts for plots/characters you like, give me all the wacky ideas that you always wanted to try but never knew how to do, I'm game for anything. I'm fine for MXF, FXF, MXM, and again, anything. That being said... I am looking for the rp to be largely SFW. Which is to say, I'm mostly cool with NSFW tidbits in a possible side chat, or darker themes, but I can only do Fade to Black in terms of sex. I cannot write sex scenes, and thus if you're looking for that, I'm not your guy. I'm looking for someone who's at least semi-lit, who can message at least twice a day, and who uses Discord or Kik. In return, I can promise you quick responses, and posts full of detail! I love rping with people who are willing to chat in the ooc and screw around and have a good time. That being said, pm me if you've got something in mind for this! And title your pm your favorite video game if you read this far. Y'know, just to make sure.",

            "selftext": "Hey all, thanks for clicking on this.\n\nBig Super-hero,DB, Anime, movie, fan and over-all nerdy person here. Lately, I\u2019ve been in a super-hero mood, and decided to post this. \n\nThough, this post is diving into Akira Toriyama\u2018s world of Dragon Ball. The world of ki, and seven magical orbs that summon a mythical dragon to grant a wish. More now, since the yesterday, I re-watched Warth of the Dragon and that movie starts off with Saiyaman and Saiyawoman.\n\nIdeally, I wish to focus on the characters of, Son Gohan and Videl Satan, but more so their secret identities: Saiyaman and Saiyawoman. Of course, if we want to start things out with just Gohan being a hero, and work towards Videl suiting up, also fine. Part of me enjoys the Saiyaman Arc, in the Buu Saga, with Gohan just starting off with his Hero- Persona. Perhaps we can write this as an AU, where Buu never appears, and Gohan focuses more on School and Hero work; this might involve some OC villain creations along the line.\n\nOr, if we would want to start, with both suited up, and working a hero team, that\u2019s fine too. Perhaps taking a page from Either Xenoverse with some, timey wimey fun, having the two Saiya-warriors deal with the likes of the Ginyu force, or other beings who might challenge the two and their poses throughout time.\n\nThe aspect I really love about the Saiyaman persona, is the call back to Sentai and things of that nature. over the top poses, displaying a sense of Justice, a righteous attitude. Almost hinting at Jo-jo levels of poses too!   \nAll things I\u2019d like to include, but with the fun Dragon Ball elements too: flying, powering up, dealing with huge creatures similar to Kajui.\n\nThis fully up to discussion, so if you are interested, let\u2019s start brainstorming!\n\nA quick few things about myself:\n\n* I live in EST, and have a part time job.\n* I aim for at least a decent post a day, though I am aware of life and things come up.\n* Usually move to Discord, or here. \n* I prefer to write in third person, and past tense.",

            "selftext": "Hey all.\n\nI am looking for 1-2 new partners. I do play males and females so my partner shouldn't expect to take on all guy characters himself. I tend to give around three paragraphs, often more but three is a good number I think. I can post every other day usually. I do not like people who are online all the time or expect me online all the time though. We all have stuff to do that isn't always related to writing so I respect that and want my partner to not be too clingy if I haven't gotten back online in a day or two. Sometimes stuff happens yeah?\n\nSo I can do fandoms and original based stuff. For fandoms, I do prefer canons because it's easier for me to work with characters we both know fairly well. But for original stuff, OCs are obviously fine because everything is from scratch there. I am open to putting canons in an original setting though, if it makes sense and can work. I'm pretty laid back so I'm not too strict on canon stuff.\n\nFandoms I'd be into: Game of Thrones, Death Note, Harry Potter, Final Space, Naruto, My Hero Academia, Doctor Who, Star Trek, and so on. Ask if you have a fandom in mind. There's so many out there, I don't want to list them all.\n\nOriginal concepts I love would be: slice of life, modern day, modern day with light fantasy, online virtual reality, light fantasy, time travel, knights and royalty, sweet cute stuff. I like simple plots and simple characters, then developing them as we go along. Romance is great and makes things better in my mind. I'm not too big on action/combat but I can try to get better there.\n\nI have one or two ideas but I'd love to hear from people too, I'd like a partnership where we're both heard and respected. \n\nLet me know if you wanna make something happen!",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I bet you've all missed me! (Probably not.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I come with a roleplay request (As expected). Gonna jump right into it now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off, my new and improved rules:\n\nOne: Replies must be AT LEAST four sentences in length. Exceptions can be made, but they will be strict. One-liners are a no-go. Personally, I do about a paragraph, and would prefer around that long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo: Controlling my character, without my permission, is on the same level as one-lining. If you want or need my character to be under your control for a moment, ask for my permission, or tell me if you want a specific reaction, and I'll say if it'll work or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree: I CAN'T STAND perfect characters, who know every emotion mine is feeling, and is able to know instantly how to fix them. You run that, and I'm out. Same goes for untouchable, God-like characters, when we're in an roleplay that would be killed by that, like a combat-focused one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFour: Time skips are cool with me, but not if they're every other post. I get it, most people wanna skip the boring parts, but sometimes I have a plan, a plan that a time skip kills. If you wanna skip time, just ask, okay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that big thing out of the way, on to what's next: What I'm looking for.\n\nI'm primarily looking for something with a focus on romance. I'm not looking for your regular, two average High School students bump into each other, then suddenly fall in love deal, nor a Princess falling for a servant. I want something even mildly more interesting than that, like a character is a bit on the creepy side, which drives the other away slightly, or my favorite, some creature much stronger than humans ends up in the modern world, takes on a human form, and falls for a human. (\\*cough\\* Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, basically \\*cough\\*  I need to get this cold checked out...) I have a few ideas, just ask and I'll provide.\n\nNote: I'd prefer to do a homosexual character pairing, but am okay with playing a straight one, as either male of female.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf that doesn't catch your interest, though, I happen to be a bit interested in doing a post-apocalyptic set roleplay, or something to help me work out a universe I'm making. Though I'm slightly less interested in either of these, either could end up more interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, interested in roleplaying with me? Contact me!\n\nI primarily use Discord, but can be talked into using other places.",

            "selftext": " **Introduction**\n\nHello! I\u2019m a role player who is new to the subreddit and was interested in getting my feet wet. I guess I will start with a little bit about myself. I\u2019m a twenty two year old male college student who lives on the eastern coast of the United States. I have been role playing since I was about thirteen years old but I like to think I have gotten better since then. My main experience role playing does come from tabletop games as both a game master and a player. I\u2019m actually looking forward to the narrative freedom that comes with freestyle RP without all the need for massive rule books and even more importantly math. \n\nWhen it comes to genres I am pretty much open to anything as long as there is potential for a good story. I am mainly looking for a good slow burn romance story as it\u2019s been a while since I had the privilege of authoring one. That being said I am just craving to write so I\u2019d love to hear other ideas if you have them. I\u2019ll throw out some very vague and general premises that I had in mind for a potential role play.\n\n**General Plot Ideas**\n\nThe first one I had in mind was a small town country romance story that would be similar to the film \u201cAn Unfinished Life\u201d. It would take place in a small rural town and the original character I had in mind to play would be a young single father trying to make ends meet on his family\u2019s ranch. The idea I had for the love interest would be maybe a potential childhood friend returning home or maybe a stranger running from a dark past. I\u2019d very much like it to be a journey of redemption and romance for both characters as cheesy as that sounds.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t have enough action or interest for you I had an alternate version floating around in my head. It would have a darker tone as the main character would be a young father who was born into a life of crime. He struggles to maintain a balance between his responsibilities both to his daughter and his gang. This would be a story centering around the twisted web that we as humans make when we are willing to do everything and anything for the people we love. \n\nThose are just general ideas that I had been interested in bringing to life on paper. If either of those sounded interesting to you please don\u2019t hesitate to message me. Also if you think that you have an idea that I might like please message me.\n\n**Ending Statement**\n\nI know this has gotten rather long so I will just wrap it up with a brief summary of what I\u2019m looking for in a partner and what they can expect from me. My preferred writing style is third person past tense and I tend to write anywhere from one to three paragraphs depending on the scene. There will be some adult themes in these romance role plays but the details can be discussed of course. In terms of a partner I would like someone who can match my style and is interested in collaborative writing. What I mean by collaborative writing is someone that is open to out of character chat about plot and potential characters. All in all I am willing to work with both novice and veteran role players as long as you try your best and are a good friendly person!\n\nThank you for reading this long post and I hope it was at least interesting to some of you! I hope to hear from some of you soon and if I don\u2019t then I wish you the best of luck in your search! Have a great day!",

Here is the basic plotline:   \n \n\nThe year is 2020. The secretive group known as the Devil's Angels have continued their daunting task of bringing in new operators from all Special Operations Groups across the world. Now in the late months of the year, a new terrorist movement is rising. One with no religious ties or motivations. One simply bent on the destruction of any and all political structure in the world. Little is known about them. However their attacks are well funded and well planned. It will take the full force of Devil's Angels to put an end to their plans while also not neglecting all the others matters of world wide security.   \n\n\nWhat I'm looking for: \n\n* Be professional, and do not use one-liners except in OOC chat. \n* Be realistic, do not pressure anyone into doing something they don't want to do. \n* Action will be intense with blood and gore.   \n\n\nIf you're interested, leave a message or PM me and I'll give you the link! Hope to see you there ;)",

            "selftext": "The two adventurers had been traveling for months, fighting off evil and saving countless innocent souls. Lindo had a fighting spirit inside him which contributer to him being a faithful paladin. His short black hair was always covered by his helmet but was extremely fluffy when it came off. His eyes were a shade of ocean blue with a sharp chiseled chin making his face come together perfectly. Lindo always got up close and personal with his foes... and his lovely partner. \n\nWhen Lindo met her, they had an instant connection. They were only partners for a simple delivery mission at first. As time went on, they were inseparable, spending each and every moment with eachother as they fought side by side. It would have been an understatement to call them lovers, they were soulmates. \n\nThey complimented eachother with their fighting styles, becoming eachothers safety net in the event of a failure, they promised that to eachother. Little did she know, her love and her vow to Lindo would soon be put to the test.\n\nIn present day, Lindo and his partner were fighting an giant that had locked them in his cave, like many they had fought before. The giant swung his club eratically, making it hard for the two of them to decipher where it would go next. They spent the greater amount an hour trying to come up with a plan to at the very least, stun the ogre. \n\nLindo was getting restless and his fighting style got the better of him. He charged in with his spear in hand and lunged at the giant when he was focussed on Lindo's soulmate. His spear pierced the chest of the raging giant and screamed. \"I got him!\" Lindo was about to push himself off before turning his head to see the club moving fast and soon being inches away from his face.\n\nLindo's body flew across the cave and crashed into a wall, the sheer force of the impact made a crater in the wall before he fell down and smacked his head off the ground. It would have been the better part of an hour before he had regained some consciousness, seeing his soulmate holding him from above with the giant's body was mangled in the distance of the cave. Lindo looked up at her and the first few words that escaped his mouth shocked her. \n\n\"Who... am I? Who are... you?\"\n\n___________________________\n\nHello there! My name's Chris and I just really felt like doing some sort of amnesia prompt today! This story is meant to explore the rekindling of a strong love between soulmates. My character, Lindo, would be a paladin who had fallen in love with your character and the two of them had been adventuring together ever since.\n\nYour character can virtually be anything you want, from a mage to a soldier. \n\nObviously, the impact of the smack and the wall had rendered him unconscious and given him a very heavy form of amnesia. He remembers nothing but how to talk and how to fight, along with basic knowledge of survival. The rest has been wiped from his pretty little head.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in incorporating some NSFW or smut into our RP with the romance. It wouldnt just be for the sake of doing it but it would make sense with the tension building and stuff.\n\nThe rest is up to you! If you want to, we can spin this on its head and have your character be the one getting amnesia by slightly rewriting things and seeing how Lindo would deal with it. As it says above in the title, I only RP using reddit PMs and talk out of context in reddit chats. Feel free to use either of those mediums to message me about this prompt and I will surely get back to you! \n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely orange envalope or a chat request and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! Thanks for reading!\n\n-Chris",

I have always loved the sort of friendships-into romance type of roleplays, but i wont restrict myself to simply playing that. Therefore i come to you with a quite broad idea. Or set of ideas one might call it.  \n\nThe broad background and setting for the roleplay is that my character is the heiress of a large manor and a fortune to supplement it.  She is by no means nobility or a snob, but have lived a somewhat sheltered life within the enclosed gardens and halls of the manor. \n\nI want your character to change that, to be her opposite. Divided, yet still united due to your interests.  What kind of interests? I, personally, like to incorporate pieces of myself into my characters and i think this would be a good oppurtunity. I would absolutely love it if your and my character would share an interest in: history, archeology, antropholgy or mythology. \n\n\nI do hope that this vauge idea would be interesting for you to play out.

            "selftext": "I see my roleplay forums as my homes. Now, once again, I'm a nomad in search of one. I've roleplayed for about half of my life, and somehow each time I move on it is more difficult to find another.\n\nI guess I must've been spoiled by one of my first forums. It was an anime AU RP. On it, there were at least a dozen people whose writing left me speechless, and many more with whom it was really enjoyable to write. This wasn't always connected to literacy, as there was that one amazing guy who never capitalized anything, but it was a reasonable correlation. I don't think it's just the fact that I was younger, and less discerning, because when I look at my old threads I am still impressed by those people's style and characters.\n\nI never found a community quite like that again. I guess...this is what I'm looking for:\n\n- Text-, forum-based roleplay site (not Discord) with an active member base (large or small, doesn't really matter);\n\n-PG...13? 16? I guess? - I like to keep most of my writing SFW. I'm not saying that more mature themes or stories can't exist, but they should not be the norm or expected of everyone (also, threads that contain them should probably be tagged as such in the title)\n\n-Fantasy/light sci-fi: Ideally I'd like to roleplay in an AU setting based on my fandoms. Canon setting are less preferred, but might be okay. I've never roleplayed in a fully original setting and I'm hesitant to do so, but will consider it if you have good suggestions. Mainly I'm hesitant because one of the themes I like to feature in my writing is 'exploring magic as a science and developing unexpected applications' (whether that magic is called reiatsu, chakra, the Force etc). I'd be hesitant to do so when the author of the original setting can always decide on the fly that they disagree with my interpretation.\n\nFandoms I've written in before: Naruto, Bleach, Star Wars, Soul Eater, Hunter x Hunter\n\nFandoms I haven't tried roleplaying in, but would be happy to: Avatar the Last Airbender, LotR.\n\n- People who are happy to craft stories: While some level of literacy would be lovely, enthusiasm for and capacity to tell stories is the most important. On my last forum, I often found myself in situations where I was the only one driving the stories forward, while my roleplay partners only reacted. Now, I've been there myself. At some point, it was the only way I could write. But right now...It's tiring to be on the other side, all the time. And it's tiring if no one can write good enough villains, so I have to write my enemies too.\n\n- Content over form: I mostly write plain text, with the occasional italics or colored dialogue. But I've seen forums in which it was a hard rule that members had to make their posts look pretty with these colorful text cassettes, often with images of the character in the background. I am very sorry, but if you're telling me that my text is ugly just because it doesn't look like it was sneezed on by an unicorn, we clearly have incompatible values.\n\n- A mechanics system (that doesn't suck): I quite enjoy having some feeling of progression with my character. I enjoy having some sort of points that I can gain, and spend on new abilities, or skills. I enjoy having an approximation of 'hey, I'm faster than before' or 'that's skill beyond what I can imagine'. So a progression system is a must. I don't ask for a hard mechanics system (in fact, if you make detailed DnD-style rules about what happens if you grapple or fall prone, I'll walk away) but anything at all would be lovely. The best progression systems I've encountered counted both quantity and quality of writing.\n\nThat said, there are some things that I found don't work for me at all: \n\n(-)being limited to one thread at a time with a character. I write slowly, and prefer focusing on one character at a time.\n\n(-)the mechanics system not distinguishing between 'skill' and 'strength'. I like to play weak, hyperskilled characters. Therefore, settings in which this is not possible don't work for me.\n\n(-)pay to win - Yes. I saw this on a text-based forum. No, I am not interested.\n\n- Reasonable powers: This is related to mechanics. If you allow everyone and their cat to be OP, then the setting loses its credibility for me.\n\n- A stable setting: I am a slow writer, and I get attached to my one character. If your forum changes their timeline every few years, making all the previous stories moot, it is not a place for me.\n\n- A mod team that isn't absent, insane and/or composed of petty tyrants: On one of my last forums, I argued with the admin (politely). His reaction was to encourage another member to kill my character. Don't be that guy. That also relates to...\n\n- Death should be meaningful: I don't like roleplays in which character death can occur at any time. Sure, by all means allow it to prevent people doing stupid things like jumping into volcanoes for the lulz. But don't treat it as something meaningless, and say 'oh, just don't write threads with stronger characters if you don't want to risk death'. I've written incredible stories with people who had evil, much stronger characters, and it was incredibly rewarding. You know why? Because they respected me, and saw value in writing a story, not in a vain attempt to make their character look edgy with PC death.\n\n- I don't like places that disallow, or heavily look down on solos. Solos are stories written by a single person. While I agree that they should be gently discouraged by bringing in fewer points than an equivalent-length roleplay, I firmly believe that they can have a valuable place in a character's story. Sometimes I want to write a story about my character without being considerate to what a roleplaying partner needs.\n\nI know it's a tall order...but this is why I rely on you, hive-mind of Reddit ) Give me your best!",

Anyway, I\u2019m hoping to do a spiderman themed roleplay, so I\u2019m looking for a partner. Here is some brief info:  \n\\- Be familiar with the spiderman story, villains,etc. (even if it\u2019s a little).\n\n* 18+\n* Available mornings (EST time zone)\n* M/F &amp; M/M\n* Short term with the potential to go long term.\n* OC Characters.\n* 3RD POV.\n* NSFW: gore, sexual encounters (not the main focus), violence, etc.\n* Post length: Varies, but averages on the short side (2 paragraphs or so).   \n\\~\\~My character: An OC spiderman I made. He\u2019s more of an antihero who acts out of obligation than actual interest in being a hero. He\u2019s cynical, sarcastic, irritable, and doesn\u2019t like to work with others overall. \n* This RP has a lot of potential plots depending on what you\u2019d like to do.Here are some examples:\n* Mentor: Sort of like the Miles Morales ordeal where he\u2019s taught to be a hero.\n* Powerless Sidekick: Sort of like MJ to Peter Parker.\n* Anti villain: Not exactly a lawful person for the things they do, but not exactly a villain. They can work with \u201cspiderman\u201d to catch bigger fish.\n* Hero: Just another hero who dwells in the city fighting crime.\n* Any suggestions.\n\nNote that none of the plots need to involve romantic affairs. They can remain platonic. \n\nJust pm me telling me a little bit about yourself.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello! I\u2019m a role player who is new to the subreddit and was interested in getting my feet wet. I guess I will start with a little bit about myself. I\u2019m a twenty two year old male college student who lives on the eastern coast of the United States. I have been role playing since I was about thirteen years old but I like to think I have gotten better since then. My main experience role playing does come from tabletop games as both a game master and a player. I\u2019m actually looking forward to the narrative freedom that comes with freestyle RP without all the need for massive rule books and even more importantly math. \n\nWhen it comes to genres I am pretty much open to anything as long as there is potential for a good story. I am mainly looking for a good slow burn romance story as it\u2019s been a while since I had the privilege of authoring one. That being said I am just craving to write so I\u2019d love to hear other ideas if you have them. I\u2019ll throw out some very vague and general premises that I had in mind for a potential role play.\n\n**General Plot Ideas**\n\nThe first one I had in mind was a small town country romance story.  It would take place in a small traditional and conservative rural town called Hartville. It would focus on an young ex-rodeo star turned single father who works his father\u2019s ranch. He earned a bad reputation in the past few years as he fell into his vices for drinking. fighting, and the comfort of loose women. In the past year or so he had finally started to get his act together but once small town folk have an opinion of you there ain\u2019t much you can do to change it. The ideal love interest would be a stranger who floated in to town. However for added drama I would love to explore the dynamic of my main original character with a young woman who fled an abusive relationship. I love a good redemption romance story.\n\nMy second idea was still about a relatively small rural town but it wouldn\u2019t be as traditional. He would have been born into a life of crime. When his family\u2019s ranch started to go under his father took a drastic approach to earn a living by any means necessary. He didn\u2019t know any different way of life when he was growing up but as he got older he saw different ways of life. However when he became a young father his hopes for that were dashed and he joined up with his dad\u2019s club. They use their ranch as a front for their sinister criminal enterprise. The ideal love interest for this would be a good girl who falls for him and is corrupted along the way. However if someone wanted to take it the other way where they try to fix him then he\u2019d be open to that too.\n\nThose are just general ideas that I had been interested in bringing to life on paper. If either of those sounded interesting to you please don\u2019t hesitate to message me. Also if you think that you have an idea that I might like please message me.\n\nI know this has gotten rather long so I will just wrap it up with a brief summary of what I\u2019m looking for in a partner and what they can expect from me. My preferred writing style is third person past tense and I tend to write anywhere from one to three paragraphs depending on the scene. There will be some adult themes in these romance role plays but the details can be discussed of course. In terms of a partner I would like someone who can match my style and is interested in collaborative writing. What I mean by collaborative writing is someone that is open to out of character chat about plot and potential characters. All in all I am willing to work with both novice and veteran role players as long as you try your best and are a good friendly person!\n\nThank you for reading this long post and I hope it was at least interesting to some of you! I hope to hear from some of you soon and if I don\u2019t then I wish you the best of luck in your search! Have a great day!",

I like to get to know each other as well, at least on a superficial level. If we become friends, or chat OoC, even better. I feel it makes the wiring better when you know what your partner is like.\n\nHi there, I'm a 22 year old man looking for a long term roleplay partner. I'm looking to make an in-depth story with a good amount of world building and charcter development. These stories do have NSFW themes, but are not the center. NSFW is fun, and I enjoy writing them, but I'm not going to just throw it in there without reason. \n\nMy writing style is pretty flexible, being first or third person, present or past tense. I prefer third person past tense though. I like to write at least one or two solid paragraphs, but I know that some situations may call for less, like give and take dialogue. Just try to be descriptive and immersive to some extent.\n\nPossible plot lines: I like to build the plot with my partner, creating the entire world with each other. I do love stories set in magical or fantastical worlds, or super high tech and futuristic, things that are more exciting than real life.\nI've written a lot of different stories, in fandoms or OC worlds. If you have a fandom in mind, I'd love to hear about it! If I'm not familiar with it, I could read up on it, or you could explain it to me. \n\nThanks for reading! Send me a message and we'll see if we hit it off and we can find a platform we both can use. I'm pretty open.",

I live in California, so my timezone is UTC-7. \n\nI've never posted here before so I hope this is everything. It's a little long. \n\nI try to reply as many times as I can per day. I have severe chronic pain, to the point where I can't work or go to school or do any of that normal life stuff, which really sucks but also gives me a lot of free time! I'd prefer you to be able to reply multiple times a day too.\n\nI have this character who is... a bit complicated to find roleplays for. She's a super fun character, don't get me wrong, but she's a little odd and doesn't cleanly fit into most plots.\n\nMeet Zeta, necromancer extraordinaire! She's a priestess in the cult she grew up in, dedicated to an imprisoned old god who would, along with her siblings, very much like to become *un*imprisoned. But don't let the cannibalism fool you, Zeta's a pretty nice person! Cheerful, optimistic, and a bit dense, she doesn't really fit the traditional idea of an evil necromancer. She doesn't want to turn the world into a graveyard. She's not trying to bring about the apocalypse. All people she sacrifices are free range and sustainably farmed. Well, usually, at least. She also has a talking book (named Book) that was a gift from her goddess. I don't want to ramble too much so I can go more in-depth if you're interested. I've got a good amount of world building done for the eldritch cults, but not much for the outside world (besides the fact that her religion is *very* illegal) or the new gods (besides the fact that they *really* don't like the old gods) so if you want to develop that with me, that would be great!\n\nI don't have any plots thought out for her, because it really depends on your character. But let's talk! Maybe you have a difficult character too.\n\nI'm not a big stickler on post length as long as you give me something to work with. I used to do big long novellas, but I've since decided that I'd rather move the story along than craft works of literary art that will only be seen by one person after I spend like 90 minutes writing. Also I'm lazy and I don't have a computer, so everything is written on my phone. **Expect 1 to 3 paragraphs.** Sometimes more, rarely less. I usually do 3rd person, but I'm okay with 1st, I guess.\n\nI ***really*** need someone who doesn't mangle the English language when they sit down at a keyboard. Grammar and punctuation are our friends! Spelling isn't arbitrary! I've had some *really* bad experiences in the past and I can't compromise on this. Mistakes and typos happen, I get that, but know the difference between there, they're, and their! Use commas! It's \"you\", not \"u\"! I'm literally begging you! Sorry, that's a bit melodramatic, but readability is important to me.\n\nI don't do smut, and I don't care much for romance. Zeta is pretty hard to romance anyways but I guess you can try. If it makes sense for the characters, I'll do romance, but I'm not going to force anything.\n\nPM me if you're interested, I have a writing sample that should also help explain the character a bit.",

Our first encounter was when you were at a party months back geared at brining the 4 nations of the north south east and west together. The party was going great until some undercover thugs tried to attack and use the royal families as hostages. But when they tried to attack their swords had vanished being left with a weird note saying \"I'm with the guild\" they looked around for their weapons but couldn't find anything the guards rushed in and knocked them out they felt like fools. You were hiding in the back room that led to the exit you saw someone around your age walking with 2 swords. You were scared but I put my hand out with a weird note. \"I'd like to chat but here's my card good enough\" I gave it to you and walked out taking the jewels off the hilt of the swords and dumped the swords on the ground. Your dad always told you thieves were bad influences but that made you grow a liking to me, your dad took my card from you an hour later telling you thieves are bad. You haven't directly seen me for a while but you've heard about certain heist that had the same note next to the missing goods. One heist in particular had a missing dagger the was top tier and one of a kind being from the previous royal family. As the princes you were proficient in battle you had mastery over the sword and your spells were some of the greatest. You were tasked with helping your troops your dad planned on showing you around the battlefield as princess who'd have to lead her army. You were geared up and ready for battle but had some time to kill. You walked around the area exploring a bit until you saw someone in a black hood. The person next to them had the missing dagger and in a travel pouch had a familiar card. You had a few options, bring him to justice, question him, confront him make a move it was all up to your heart\n\n\nI want this to kinda be a romance rp between you and I.

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nDecided to post something here! This post is mainly about the fandom of Kingdom Hearts! Though, a few quick things about myself, in case you were wondering.\n\n\\- I\u2019\u2019m 18+, and prefer my partner to be around the same age.\n\n\\- This is a SFW post, nothing sexual please.\n\n\\- I write in Third person, POV. Love to double/play multiple characters, and even GM.\n\n* I use a number of platforms to write, just mention your favorite- if you wish to write with me.\n* I live in EST Timezone. I try to get at least one reply out, a day- if not more. I don\u2019t try to rush anyone with their replies. Though, I do ask if it will be longer than four days before a reply, just give a quick heads up- I\u2019ll do the same.\n* Anything else? Feel free to ask!\n\nNow, onto my idea. Taking place, after the events of the Special Episode of Birth By Sleep, when Xehanort is found by Ansem the Wise. There is that large, ten year plus gap, of them working on research. I think it would be fun, to dive into that time period. Control those who would later become Nobides, and create the first *Organization XIII* .\n\nSo, Briag, Xehanort, Isa, Lea, Even, and so on. All under the teaching and guide of Ansem the Wise. Listening to them speak on that time, throughout the games, and reading some of the Reports (throughout the games as well), its hinted that they experimented in some dark stuff. Some sketchy business went down, which probbaly lead to Ansem trying to shut it down.\n\nOf course, this idea is open for discussion and taking it into other directions. An AU with them in College could be fun too!\n\nI\u2019m also open to other Kingdom Herats idea, since KHIII is still very fresh in my head. ~~Besides, I love the series anyway, despite all its flaws~~.\n\nThere are aspects in KHIII That I would like to re-write and craft into its own RP.\n\nSomething with a trio, we both like. Diving into almost anything really!\n\nA story, with th trio of, Young Xehanort,  Eraqus and Yen Sid, could be fun to write!\n\nTakign a manga approach, and having Kairi be more active and fun, is also something I\u2019d dive into!\n\nOther Fandoms I enjoy:\n\n*Persona 5, Akiba\u2019s Trip:The Animation, Sword Art Online, JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, Star Wars, did I Say Persona 5?, others too.*\n\nAll open for discussion!\n\nSo, if you are intertested, feel free to shoot a PM my way.\n\nAnd of course, let your heart be your guiding key.",

(Y/N) and Star were the top preforming detectives which is why they had some favoritism and got the best cases and cases that have became cold cases for nearly decades and would manage to solve them all. All besides *One*. A smart Serial killer by the name \u201ceraser\u201d had became a household name all around, everyone feared to become victim of his killing spree, but some were lucky, many victims did not meet there end by the blade of the knife. Many of them somehow had their memories erased, and no one could figure how to undo the damage. Not even Star and (Y/N) and one misstep caused (Y/N) and star to fall victim, but the eraser \u201cspared\u201d their lives for the time being. Instead he decided to erase (Y/N)\u2019s memory of the day you found him and all the work leading up to it. But Star has it worse, he erased her memories dating back to when she was deciding to be a nurse or cop. She didn\u2019t remember that she became a cop and got engaged to (Y/N). When the eraser finished his work on them, he induced them into a coma and send them to the hospital to where they were treated and recovered. Of course Star went back to her old life, things she used to do before she went down the path to become a cop, although you had your memories. You went back to work, one day goes by and you think *she probably called in sick* and another day goes by and another and you start to get worried. She\u2019s never missed work and it wasn\u2019t like her to do so either.  No one had contact with her, not even her own parents. Eventually you had to put up missing persons posters and continue on with life. A week goes back and a miracle happens, you were your desk filing paper works when a co worker approach\u2019s you about an eyewitness on a case you just had received, the eyewitness? Star! You were ecstatic to see her, but to her you were a complete stranger. You plead and plead that you know her but she\u2019s not having it. You realized the only way to get her back was to try and help her remember who you were.\n\n((The story goes on as you are trying to get back into her to remember again, but at the same time the Eraser case is opened back up and you are assigned to it, and you began to suspect that maybe the eraser had something to do with it and etc etc..))\n\n**2.Brainstorming!**\n\nWe can brainstorm any ideas! And come up with something entirely new! \n\n**Just Message me if you\u2019re interested**\n**Btw I only roleplay on Discord!**\n\n**I AM NOT LOOKING FOR PURELY NSFW.

The basic idea for the story is this.\n\nThe year is 1947, Set in Los Angeles you would be a detective. Either homicide or narcotics who have through a long investigations linked organised crime to a Club where I happen to sing at. To make it even more intresting you and I live on the same street but you don't know that yet considering my work hours. \n\nI know it's not much to go on but as said, I am looking for someone to along with me build the roleplay and the story. This will be focused on the two charchters that we play and their interactions and choices. The more complications they face the more intresting it will become!\n\nSmut may happen at some point but it can not be rushed nor should it be the focus of the story.",

It is still a work in progress, but I hope people will join in and help create a site they will stick to :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Site Link!](http://narutosatokigen.jcink.net/index.php)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Site Plot:**  \"The Warring States Period (\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3, Sengoku Jidai) was the long, violent era preceding the formation of the hidden villages. During the Warring States Period, the countries of the world were uniformly small, constantly battling each other for land, power, and opportunity. To fight these battles, countries hired one or more clans of mercenary shinobi to represent their interests, the shinobi's loyalties ultimately going to the highest bidder.\n\nHowever, there were those who yearned for peace and order in a chaotic world bound by war and death. Walking up to the Daimyo of Hi no Kuni, the head of the Hyuuga clan, Hyuuga Hasuhime proposed an alliance. They would serve and protect the country as their military, and in turn the country would only ask for their aid, no one else. Additionally, Hasuhime sent out a note to any nearby clan, asking them to join her alliance, in order to unite the ninja world once and for all.\n\nSome answered the call, others only adopted the idea for varying reasons, until the world was reshapen and reformed. Thus was the Warring States Period brought to an end, replaced by the Shinobi Organisational System...\n\nBut is this the true way to peace? Or will the flames of war set the world ablaze once more...?\"\n\n**Information:** Sato Kigen is an AU Naruto RP set many years in the past, during the founding of the villages. However, the game, which has a heavy focus on the characters, require players to take an active part in shaping the world, founding said villages and making it into a powerhouse. There is a simple stat system, which is only a gauge, and combat is based on common sense more so than numbers. Villages themselves will have systems for growth, which will effect everyone in the village.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes**: The forum is one I have had a long time and is reworking, so please do not mind the time stamps on some posts :)",

Im currently looking to so a long term superhero/vigilante roleplay the story will center around your character being recruited to join a team of heroes of various ages and backgrounds, and slowly becoming the greatest heroes the world has ever seen.\n\nIve done many roleplays in the past, hut this is one I'm particularly excited for, as i love superheroes/mythology. I love building a universe and building lore for for it, and i especially love stories about people rising up to do good in a world where people tell them that they cant.\n\nSo what can you expect from this roleplay? Action, drama, romance, and much more. As the GM I will he playing multiple characters, all of whom will be unique and interesting, and I'm not just talking about powers. Ill be taking lots of inspiration from other comics, and I will do my best to keep you hooked. \n\nThe stories will be divided into chapters, each chapter will focus on character development; characters will die, and others will be introduced, and the villains will test the heroes in ways you cant even imagine.\n\nIm purposefully being a little vague here... for more details, dm me! I can roleplay on discord or kik, and i look forward to hearing from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello all! I\u2019ve been getting back to replying to everybody and with a bit more free time now, I\u2019ve been looking for one or two more roleplays centered around the MCU, specifically our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. I\u2019ve got a handful of ideas and a female OC on hand that can either be really badass and feisty, or more of a timid character. Whatever you want! I\u2019m also definitely open to hearing any ideas you have in mind, because I want to make sure you\u2019re enjoying this as well (:\n\nI\u2019d also be open to playing Scarlet Witch against your Peter Parker, incase you\u2019re not a fan of OCs!\n\nRomance is kind of a must for me when it comes to RP, because I really love development when it comes to the relationship between two characters. But I\u2019m also a big fan of kickass action, so maybe our characters can fight crime together too (even as Avengers!)\n\nAnyway, thank you for taking the time to read this. Send me a message if you\u2019re interested in playing as Peter! Look forward to hearing from you.x\n\nside note: If you\u2019ve messaged me before, feel free to message me again! I wasn\u2019t able to get back to the amount of replies I got last time.",

            "selftext": "Well met! How's it going?\n\nI've been reading the series of books called Earth's Children, and I'd really like to do a plot set in that world. I'm not all the way through the series, but the rules and cultures of the world aren't dificult to learn, and are pretty open ended when it comes to changing them since a lot of it is dependant on cultural differences between tribes.\n\nI'd very much like it if you've read or have some knowledge of the series, but if you haven't/don't, then I wouldn't take any issue with explaining and giving a rundown of the basics of the world and culture of humans of the time. There's also a lot of room to play around witb different tribal cultures like I said, so homebrewing/worldbuilding is going to be pretty open as far as that goes.\n\nIt would also be a great bonus if you have some knowledge of things like bushcraft and stone age humans, since this series is set literally before the invention of the wheel and clever survival was kinda humanity's main thing. If you don't know much about that, I'm also willing to explain and share what I know, but lack of knowledge in this area is going to be harder to work around than not havung read the series.\n\nDue to one universal cultural aspect of humans and Neanderthals alike, there are definitely going to be NSFW themes of one sort or another. If you'd like to engage in that, I'd prefer you be female and I'd accept playing a female character easily enough, but MxM pairings are off the table for me. I have no issue with people who enjoy that, it's just not something I'm personally comfortable with. I think I'll save a description of the NSFW stuff for later if you actually wanna try this setting out for a story, but just keep in mind that they're kinda hard to avoid.\n\nI'll keep this short and sweet, and leave it here for now, but there's a lot more I can talk about in relation to this setting and the story ideas I have. So if any of this sounds interesting, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to hit me up in my DMs, tell me a bit about yourself, and we'll go from there. \n\nI hope to see you soon! :)",

I've inadvertently been roleplaying with some spooooky ghosts, and so I'm back.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm looking for older players whose lives are more stable, who might reasonably be around for a while if we end up clicking.  I work from home, and I'm a fast typist, so I can usually offer fast responses.  If there's a day where, for example, I have to take a relative to the doctor or go there myself (which does happen), I'll keep you apprised and not just disappear. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm looking for an advanced grasp of grammar and syntax.  I hope you are, too.  I'm looking for someone who will step up and add to the depth and breadth of the world with me, not just be along for the ride.  Please be at least slightly familiar with canon and willing to look things up where you aren't.  I know it's a complicated setting, and I'm not going to be super strict about the exact words of a prayer the Mechanicus uses or the precise procedure of running under obscurement, I just don't want to see any catgirl commissars or pink-haired Inquisitors.  Don't step up to play a character who is in charge of a group of people if you're not prepared to also DM their home base or ship and at least some subordinates with reasonable detail.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI do want some kind of positive outcome for the characters even though the setting is dark, but it doesn't have to be romance if that's not your bag.  It could be friendship, or grudging respect, or just working together to achieve a common goal successfully.  This means that if I'm playing, for instance, a Chaos character who corrupts your Imperial, I will be playing on the less monstrous end of the Chaos spectrum, like a renegade Black Legionnaire or one of the saner Sorcerers, not the daily atrocities you would expect from a warband of Emperor's Children or Night Lords.  If you're playing an Inquisitor who recruits my character, I would hope you would hold back on the psycho-indoctrination or other more hardcore elements.  We can discuss and negotiate on how dark things get in general, and what sort of plot and story we want to engage with.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm a 37-year-old female.  I don't care about your gender or orientation, only your writing skills.  Similarly, I don't mind what gender or orientation of character I play.  I'm here for the story.  **Please be willing to provide writing samples.**  I have lots to share and look forward to playing with you!",

            "selftext": " \n\nThese are the species of the rp. everyone is on team dragon-born (explained later)\n\nDragonborn (Fire): These Dragonborn's have fiery red scales. Their tails are spiked with orange and they have amber eyes. they have fiery breath and are the boldest among the Dragonborn. The leader of the Dragonborn, Blaze, is a 'fire-born'. These Dragonborn are often named after fires, so names like Blitz, Cloquet, and Ahi are common.\n\nDragonborn (Water): These Dragonborn's have blue/green scales. Their tails are finned and they have green eyes. they have the ability to glide on water and are the smartest among the Dragonborn. Their Tribal leader is called Visi. These Dragonborn are often named after water, so names like Auga, Wassa, and Amanzi are common.\n\nDragonborn (Nature): These Dragonborn's have Yellow, lavender, light green, white, and blue scales. Their tails are tufted and they have yellow, blue, or green eyes. They can grow plants by touching them and are the timidest among the Dragonborn. Their Tribal leader is called Lule. These Dragonborn are often named after flowers, so names like Lavender, Fleur, and Bloom are common.\n\nDragonborn (Flight): These Dragonborn's have blue/white scales. Their tails are twirled and they have light blue or yellow eyes. They are commonly blind due to genetic defects. They are the only Dragonborn that can truly fly, as all others are only able to glide. They are the most competitive among the Dragonborn. Their Tribal leader is called Sky. These Dragonborn are often named after clouds or the sky, so names like Himmel, Float, and Leru are common.  \nMountaineer's: Mountaineers are short elf-like beings who have pale blue skin and long ears. They often wear metallic armor. They live in the high mountains and try to stay out of the war. they sell weapons to both parties. They have blue/green eyes, however, like flying Dragonborn, they are commonly blind due to genetic defects. They are great at making technological related items. Their Leader, the mayor, is called Drone. The Mountaineers are often named after technology and snows, so names like Elurra, Impact, and Electro are common.\n\nLight Fairy's: Light Fairy's are the most human-looking of the species. They often wear long white silky dresses/tuxedos. They live anywhere, and started the horrid war against the Dragonborn, wanting to make them slaves and take their land. They have normal eye colors, but the only hair color they have is strawberry blonde. They are evil masterminds, and few choose to resist the dictator. the relationship they have with other species is similar to that of the silk wings and the hive wings in Wings of fire. They are the hive wings in this relationship. Their dictator is named Luminess. They are often named after lights and stars, so names like Radiant, Kindling, or Moon are common.\n\nThe world is set in a fantasy-like world. The plains stretch on to the horizon, and a pair of mountains is to the west. A floating city is spread around the area. The bottom houses are humble cottages with gardens surrounded by farms. the floating islands are large cities with high skyscrapers and buzzing flying hover-cars.\n\nThe War has been going on for 3 years now, and few tribes remain. no one knows what happens to those taken by the light.\n\nThe Light Faries wants the Dragonborn's land. This is why the war was started. They have already rid the land of the druids...",

I live in the PST timezone, but my sleep schedule is non-existent. \n\nI started RPing on forums at age 11 and bounced between forums and Tumblr RPs until I turned 15. I just recently got back into roleplaying, and I'm looking for someone to write out a good 'ol romance with. \n\nIt doesn't have to be JUST romance \u2013 I'm a huge fan of a variety of genres (eg. sci-fi, historical, fantasy, and more!) so if you've had an idea, just let me know. The plot isn't really as important to me as much as the characters themselves. I'm a huge sucker for complex characters with messy relationships. \n\nI currently have a strong muse for characters that fit the \"poor little rich kid\" trend \u00e0 la Gossip Girl/Crazy Rich Asians. I have an idea for a basic plot, but I'm really looking for someone to flesh it out with me. \n\n***I have some writing samples that I'm more than happy to send you if you want!***\n\nIf that's not your speed, that's cool too! I'm open to pretty much everything (except Zombie related topics, it just doesn't appeal to me).\n\nWant to do one paragraph rapid fire RPs? That's fine by me. Want to do 5 paragraph replies? That's also cool with me. I usually have a preference for quick replies, as that's how character development really happens, but I just really want something to help me kill time over my 4-month long summer break. \n\nOtherwise, I really love partners who are honest and open with me about their preferences, their time, and how they're feeling in general. I promise I won't bite! Just send me a quick message here and I'll reply ASAP. (Currently, I have a sprained ankle so I'm going to be online essentially 24/7 for a little while.)",

My posts range anywhere from a few sentences to multiple paragraphs depending on what my partner prefers, and I'm usually able to reply multiple times a day. I don't have very many hard limits and I enjoy darker themes if the plot calls for it.\n\nI really love the myth of Hades and Persephone and I'd love to do a role-play based off of it. We could do either the original time period or something modern, but I'd like to keep the pantheon elements. You don't have to be an expert on Greek mythology for this, just the basics is absolutely fine. Ideally we'd start with Persephone being taken to the Underworld against her will and then go from there. \n\nIf you're interested, please contact me!",

The infection swept through the states and hospital admittance spiked by an alarming 250%. Doctors and scientists were working around the clock, but the fungus had never been seen before. It didn't take long for the riots to start, and with riots came looting and disorder.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Barely 24 hours later, the sick were attacking everyone in sight, inciting fear and hysteria in the streets, prompting immediate Martial Law. The military flooded the streets, shooting any possible threats, but it didn't stop the infected from outnumbering those unaffected. Quarantine zones were quickly set up across the states and people lined up for their chance at safety.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two months after the outbreak, Martial Law slowly started failing. Many of the smaller, not well manned, quarantine zones were quickly overcome by people and infected, causing the military presence to completely abandon the zones and let the people fend for themselves. Our zone, the Seattle Quarantine Zone, stands strong while maintaining a life of its own. With entrance scans and curfews, life is strongly dictated by the government, but that's better than having to live outside the fence, right?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The SEATTLE QZ, commonly known as C Hub, is the central workings for all of Seattle and the surrounding areas of Washington. Traders come from miles around to attend the market, weary travelers seek its shelter. There are even whispered rumors of immune and how the hospital is actively seeking anyone that can help in making a vaccine. So, welcome to the apocalypse - do you have what it takes to survive Seattle, 2032?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[ **ABOUT THE GROUP** \\]\n\nThis is a relatively new group that takes place on Discord.\n\nPM me if interested.",

            "selftext": "**The Fantasy Sandbox**\n\nThe Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme. Every character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\n[***http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction***](http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction)[***https://discord.gg/cb5n63C***](https://discord.gg/cb5n63C)",

I do enjoy not having limits to the roleplay experience since it allows me to fully involve myself in my character's role. I hope I don't sound too demanding!\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything that I wanted to say. If this post interested you at all, please send me a message. I look forward to exploring some comic book worlds!",

I'm 22 years old and would prefer my partner be similar in age, I've been writing for close to, if not ten years at this point and feel I'm a pretty competent writer, able to clear 500+ words if the situation allows!\nI'd prefer a partner that is able to write close to this level! I'm very open and laid back so there's no themes that are of the table from NSFW content to more mature story lines so no need to worry about anything you want to try, but it's not a necessity for writing with me! \n\nRight now, I have a few ideas mainly in the initial stage that are set in already established universes, however I'm more than happy to sit and build a world with someone if that's what you'd prefer! My preferred genres tend to vary wildly to everything from slice of life all the way to gritty horrors, just so long as we get a good story with great characters I'm more than happy to write it out!\n\nI tend to focus a lot on character interaction in my stories and as a result sometimes struggle with plot details outside of the main characters, but be patient with me and we'll get there! \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, hopefully I'll get a message from you soon and we can start talking about ideas or plots! Oh, and most of my writing is done over discord, however if you've got any other suggestions for good services to use, then feel free to suggest them and I'll have a look into it!\n\nMuch apologies if this I tend to jump from point to point on my post here, I'm writing from a phone currently, and have been editing as more points come to mind, I format much better when writing!",

Mature themes will be in my plots though limits will be discussed. write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd prefer female authors writing male characters but male writers are fine too.\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n* 21+ partners\n\n* For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and **out of character.** (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies or those who English isn't thier first language).\n\n* For you to write as an older male (Late 30s to 40+). I'm a sucker for the gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. I also love those grumpy, hypermasculine men being intimidated by darling, soft yet commanding, and pretty women.\n\n* The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n* The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n* Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\nGenres: \n\n* Mafia/Crime \n* Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n* Supernatural/Modern Fantasy \n* Southern/Mid Western/Urban Gothic\n*Western inspired/Weird West (supernatural and fantasy elements)\n*Sci-fi/Cyberpunk\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same. For plot and more genre ideas, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and writing. \n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

Mile 4 and 5 go past before he starts to sweat heavily, he is clearly not in shape yet. \n\nIt had been a long road to get to this point, the amateur ranks had been pretty kind to John. a stint of successful matches had meant an Olympic trial and even a place on the team for Rio before a broken hand in training camp put an end to that dream, he still travelled and got to experience all of what Brazil had to offer while helping out on the squad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nstaying an amateur though was never the plan so the end of the Olympics John turned pro immediately. Bulking up a little to his more natural size of 200lbs he started life as a professional boxer. a couple of quick fights under his belt within 6 months he was 3-0 with three knockouts, his power increasing with his bulk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut now comes his toughest test, training camp was almost a month in, three more months until he will fight in a stadium for the first time, yeah he isn't the main event but who cares, he is getting noticed and starting to make some noise in the cruiserweight division. A few more fights and maybe a title shot will be on the cards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi all. this is a simple prompt exploring the life of a prize fighter, its a slice of life idea so your character could be training partner, girlfriend, corner people,ring girl/boy or anything else. just let me know how you want your character to fit in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nromance is a very open option in this prompt and I am happy for male or female partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Full credit must go to nemesis and her MMA rp idea for inspiring this prompt.

Members play as original characters and may be students or professors solving the mystery enveloping the post-war Wizarding World. Joining the plot is not essential to roleplay though and  members are encouraged to also explore the lives of their characters and meet other players, whether or not they are in the same House or year.\n\nWe focus on storytelling whether it be a solo experience or with others.  To make this a completely unique experience, all canon Harry Potter characters are not present within the roleplay. This is to simplify the logistics of running the server and keep things fair for everyone. As such, we take a realistic approach to how magic would work using information taken from canon sources, though we reject the information and events from the Cursed Child.\n\nThis RP group strives to be a place to roleplay that inspires creativity and collaborative storytelling. We are a literate server with a focus on quality writing though we welcome all skill levels.   \n\n\n[Discord Link](https://discord.gg/ufPMpUd)",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. My top favorite characters will be in italics. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are *Dany*, Margaery, *Sansa*, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: *Mary Jane Watson*, Black Cat, *She-Hulk*, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, *Scarlet Witch*, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, *Captain Marvel*, *Black Widow*, The Wasp, *Mystique* and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard)\n\n**DC Comics**: *Batgirl*, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, *Wonder Woman*. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, *Vetra*, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, *Rey*, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: *Sonya*, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, *Cassie*, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. As well as a few other non-fandom ideas I have. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

I have one major idea I really want to work on, though I'm happy to discuss other ideas. \n\nMy main idea is based around a new character. Lana was the junior champion barrel racer. That was 4 years ago though. Only a month after winning that title, she was in a bad car accident and lost her brother. After she recovered, her parents moved her to the city. Now 18, she's just moved back home with her other brother. Will she get back in the saddle? Or will she always be too afraid to get back on the horse? \n\nReally hoping for romantic based threads, either with the idea above or another. \n\nPM me if you're interested.",

Only this time, the spoils of war were also its weapons: petroleum and uranium. For these resources, China would invade Alaska, the U.S. would annex Canada, and the European Commonwealth would dissolve into quarreling, bickering nation-states, bent on controlling the last remaining resources on Earth.  In 2077, the storm of world war had come again. In two brief hours, most of the planet was reduced to cinders, and from the ashes of nuclear devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise. In the years that followed, new civilizations rose, and fell, fought and conquered.  Now they've reached the East.  Life on the coast is about to get rough.  \n\n    REQUIREMENTS\n\nWe require members be *at least* 18 years old.   We expect a basic handle on grammar and syntax, and require in-character posts to be made in third person, past tense.  Activity checks happen every few weeks, though there's no minimum post count!  Friendliness is always wanted, welcome, and appreciated!  \n\n    FEATURES\n\n\\&gt; **literate, but no word count!** \n\n\\&gt; **friendly and welcoming community!** \n\n\\&gt; **faction-based and group plotting!** \n\n\\&gt; **wanted adverts!** \n\n\\&gt; **character/player-focused direction and tight progression!** \n\n\\&gt; **LGBQT-friendly and inclusive!** \n\n\\&gt; **monthly events!** \n\n\\&gt; **new Fallout lore!** \n\n    We all know war never changes\u2014 but what if it did?\n\n[***CLICK HERE TO JOIN US TODAY!***](https://discord.gg/VTHYtnS)",
