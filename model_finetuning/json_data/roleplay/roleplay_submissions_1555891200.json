My main passion has always been making characters but the story is just as great given the dynamic of two well thought out Ocs. \n\nI am looking for someone who is willing to play as and with lesbian, gay, bi, and transgender characters. But more than that, I'm looking for someone who loves to make thought out, detailed, unique characters and pair them with other thought out, detailed, unique characters. The genres can range although I'm not a huge fan of apocalypse or zombies. I mostly like modern time rps, slice of life and modern fantasy. \n\nAlso don't be afraid to ask to start a new rp if you're burnt out or not feeling the character, I can totally relate and will more than happily think up a new story with you! I'm looking for a long-term partner but long-term plots aren't always necessary. I have a few characters I'd like to play at the moment but I usually build plot based on both characters. \n\nIf you're interested, please shoot me a message! The more informative and detailed, the better the chance of me responding to you! I primarily Roleplay on Discord!",

I usually come up with OCs on the fly but usually they're based around a skeleton of a character that I have already. Here's my info:\n\n\u2022 I'm ok with it going NSFW if it makes sense in the story. However, I don't like to randomly add NSFW content if it's not necessary.\n\u2022 I prefer at least semi-literate partners and prefer longer paragraphs, but I won't nag you if your responses are short\n\u2022 I mostly just use female characters\n\u2022 I like to rp with humanoid OCs. It's just a little weird roleplaying with an animalistic or something else OC.\n\u2022 I'd prefer if you had a well thought-out OC. You don't have to give me all the information upfront, but it's good if you have some backstory ready to spice up the adventure.\n\u2022 On the topic of adventure, roleplays that stay just slice of life bore me. I like some action and adventure. I love to describe fight scenes\n\u2022 On the topic of fight scenes, I often use blood and gore in my imagery, so let me know if that makes you uncomfortable\n\nI'm flexible with plots but here's what I was thinking:\n\u2022 We're two adventurers in a tavern when we hear of a new evil superpower taking territory in the realm (I know, so original) from an exhausted messenger bursting in. Unbeknownst to each other, both of us decide to make it our mission to fight off this evil. We meet at a weaponsmith's shop, both getting our gear fixed up. \n\nPM me if you're interested!",

I make or reply to a post only to find out that there is almost no time that me and my the other partner are online at the same time. resulting in either: A very slow moving role-play, cancelled a promising role-play, Or i just don't answer to a prompt because i fear that our times don't match up (This is personal issue and dumb of me. I know, but it wouldn't surprise me if it also happens with other people.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy suggestion is simple. Include timezones and available times in the posts. It takes almost no extra effort to to this and makes finding a suitable partner way easier. It would be preferable to use one standard and work of that. Like using the GMT. just write GMT and the time difference with your zone and it is done. Then include you available times and voila. No more confusion or RP's failing from the start.  \n\n\nJust a few examples. at the time of making this post\n\n* GMT +1  \nThe time in the UK: 18:26\n* GMT -8  \nThe time in Los Angeles: 10:26\n* GMT +7  \nThe time in Tokyo: 2:26\n* GMT + 2  \nTime in the Netherlands: 19:26\n* GMT + 4.5  \nTime in New Dehli: 19:56 \n\nThen when you write this you can write 'available from XX:XX to XX:XX in my timezone' and/or 'available in YY:YY to YY:YY in GMT.' behind it.  \n\n\nThank you for reading this suggestion to the end and sorry if it seems messy. that is because i myself am also really messy.  \n\n\np.s. YAY i found a way to shoehorn my own country into this serious post.",

            "selftext": "\u201cAttention aspiring demon slayers! Nation-renowned demon hunter Jesse \u2018The Prowler\u2019 Strauss is looking for a new assistant in his endeavours with the ongoing battle against Demons, Monsters, and other Unholy Beings fighting off the western expansion. Please note that this is life threatening work against said beings, and will usually consist of 25 to 30 day travels to California, and 15 days of travel back. With that being said, all jobs bay very well with from anywhere to 10 dollars to 50 dollars, though expect around 30. Experience with slaying demons and monsters required, as well as the proper gear to do so. For inquiries and an interview, go to Blacksmith Saloon in New Orleans.\u201d\n\n\nHello, and thanks for reading this far! This is a roleplay that is similar to the concept of \u2018Deadlands\u2019. This worlds timeline is identical to the real life earth up until the manifest destiny. During the push west after the Louisiana purchase, the Native Americans soon found themselves driven to desperation. An unknown tribal leader made a deal with the spirits to protect their land by any means necessary, which soon found the land west of the Mississippi River plagued with demons, monsters, and other horrific beings. \n\nMany things happened as a direct result of this. For one, many methods of fighting the beings that plagued the west were birthed. Some learned magic while others developed specialized tools to slay these abominations. Also, the new frontier life adapted to these demons, such as bounty hunters becoming demon hunters, and ranches specializing in taming and selling the beasts instead of horses. Needless to say, the west is much more wild now.\n\nThis roleplay will take place in 1848, when the word of gold being found in california quickly traveled East. However, despite promises of striking rich with this new discovery, the risk of running into a demon was not worth the reward to many. And so with that, many demon hunters were hired as escorts to bring aspiring gold miners west in search for riches. Your character and/or characters will be enlisted to assist one of the most well known demon hunters to assure families have safe passage across the now demon-plagued western world. \n\nPM me if interested or if you have interest, questions, comments, or concerns I look forward to speaking with you!",

            "selftext": "So the idea came to me late last night and I got so carried away with it I even wrote a small sample for it. My main character(s) aren\u2019t human but rather multiple AIs with different personalities that control different systems of a 30-foot tall mech. \n\nIt acts like a tank with the armaments it carries but also a control hub for combat drones. Autopiloting the mech and assisting it\u2019s pilot is handled by one AI. Controlling any drones is handled by another. I plan on there being three to maybe four different personalities working together to operate the mech at full capacity with or without a pilot onboard. \n\nAs for plot, the general start would be a new or veteran pilot selected to test out the mech\u2019s systems and to see how well the AIs bond with them and how the mech operates with a human pilot. From there I have a couple ideas for what missions our characters would go on but I\u2019m also open to other ideas! \n\nI\u2019m looking for a more literate or advanced RP partner for the idea. Be able to type out at least a couple a paragraphs. I would also prefer a partner for the RP to be 18+. Given the idea romance is a bit of present theme so expect that. I also prefer posts to be in 3rd person. \n\nThat\u2019s the general craving for the moment. I suppose I\u2019d add that cyberpunk and sci-fi elements would also be present in the setting.",

You were locked up in your dorm stuck studying for an upcoming exam and could see a party unfolding from your window. Tired from studying and being overworked from your professors, you ignored the party and went to sleep. You slept soundly until your door opened and you heard faint steps trying to tippie-toe across, you thought it was your roommate coming to sleep off their drunken haze but it was awfully quiet for a drunk roommate and your curiosity peaked, who was really there?

The concept is simple: My character is the abandoned apprentice of a Jedi Sentinel. Stumbling across your character, she tries to survive and come to grips with the chaos of the Galaxy for a untrained Jedi. And along the way a unlikely duo starts a epic tale across the galaxy. Whether it be of joy or woe, it is a tale Cantina\u2019s tell for a millennia. \n\nRomance is not necessary, and I am usually fine with exploring the Galaxy or experiencing combat. I like to play plots with more character dynamics and intrigue. As such, I will likely play my backstory and character personality to foil your character. Whether it be bitter rivals, star crossed lovers, or a master and apprentice any dynamic is fine by me. ERP isn\u2019t really something I fixate on. However, I would be willing to explore it given reasonable in roleplay development. \n\nAn ideal partner would be open to creative ideas and is able to present their own character agency. While I can present plot threads, I like to have other players who are okay with a push and shove dynamic with plot and character progression. \n\nFeel free to contact me here if interested and discuss any characters or plot ideas. I have years of experience as a DM so I am experienced with a wide range of genres and styles of roleplay.",

            "selftext": "# The Empire of Atrocaea is recruiting new members! \n\nHome to several ruling Kingdoms across the realm, Atrocaea is a high-fantasy world filled to the brim with adventure and rich history. A war nearly eight generations ago divided Atrocaea, a terrible conflict fueled by racial, political, and religious dissensions. Issues that had been left to simmer beneath the surface had eventually erupted and the continent was left to burn. Brothers turned on one another. It was a wound dealt to their beautiful land that would never be forgotten, and in some cases\u2026 would never be forgiven. \n\nThe Inidion Dynasty, kept prosperous and stable due to the many mines that dotted their land, was spared from the horrors of this war. While other kingdoms weakened each other with bloodshed, they only grew more powerful and eventually one of the most influential in Atrocaea. And in what is now known as the Unification, their men - fresh and eager - swept over the Kingdoms. Though many resisted fiercely, in the years to come all would fall under the rule of the Inidion family and with their reach, founded the first Atrocaean Empire with their patriarch sat at the throne. The lands, once ruled by ancient families, were distributed among the branches of the family. Their holdings appropriated to those who fought and died valiantly for the cause. And in so doing ensured their rule and peace for the entire continent. A peace that has lasted for almost two centuries.\n\nWill it be you who disrupts that peace? Or the savior bent on ensuring harmony between Kingdoms? Or will you be the humble farmer who discovers a greater destiny in store? Perhaps even a survivor of the war in search of vengeance and bent on the downfall of the reigning family? The choice is in your hands and we are waiting to see what you have to offer.\n\nThe Atrocaean Empire is a Discord-based Medieval Fantasy roleplay with themes from Elder Scrolls, GoT, The Witcher, D&amp;D, and more - allowing plenty of creative freedom when it comes to races and character creation. We are looking for serious, long-term players that are active, friendly, and able to write cohesive posts as well as willing to work with others to form plot and develop characters. While this group is not particularly NSFW, there are heavy adult and mildly sexual situations that we are not willing to subject minors to, so we are only accepting players who are 18 and older. \n\nIf interested, please message u/VacareAtorium, u/the_arrows_path, or u/MadamRueRue. We look forward to meeting you!",

The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. Honestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers\n\nAnd of course, any \\*other\\* ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a very small element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need.I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two way mutual thing and it has to flow in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use discord, or kik. Mainly kik though. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can!",

            "selftext": "Okinogawa High School is a newly built school. It was built only fifteen years ago. In that time, though, they have already built up elite status in both athletic accomplishments and academic efficiency. The school overall has a high average for test scores, and both basketball teams, volleyball, kendo, and baseball teams have already won national championship games. The school itself is a typical Japanese Highschool. It is four stories tall, the first floor holding faculty offices, the gym, cafeteria, etc. The second floor holding the first-year classrooms, third holding the second-year classroom, and the fourth being for third-years. The gym and athletic facilities are top-notch and one of the best in the nation\n\nAnyways that was the information on the school. This roleplay is set in a totally original city set in modern day japan. The roleplay is a slice of life group and lets you take the role of up to four students and have them live out their daily lives in Okinogawa, the fictional city this takes place in. We are just now opening up the servers and are looking for 4-5 people to come join our server! What we offer is a really friendly mod staff, opportunity to make friends in and out of character, a setting with plenty of places to visit and roleplay in, a working classroom system, jobs, bots, etc! And plenty more to add as we go! If anyone is interested, PM me and i\u2019ll give you the server link after asking you a few questions! Thank you and I hope you stop by! This is also the last time we\u2019ll be accepting members! We close the server may 5th",

I have about 1 or 2 good roleplays at any point, but I\u2019d really appreciate having a few more so I don\u2019t get too bored.\n\nIn terms of what I roleplay, I really enjoy fantasy elements in the roleplay and this usually takes the form of medieval fantasy. But I also enjoy roleplays like sci-fi, western, or anything else really. Although I enjoy fantasy elements I\u2019m really ok for any kind of roleplay as long as it\u2019s fun!\n\nI roleplay in the third person and tend to type quite a bit. Depending on the roleplay, the partner, and the scene it can differ quite a bit, but generally I enjoy having environmental and emotional detail put into every post. I find it hard to stay interested in a roleplay where I\u2019m doing double the work, so sorry to those people!\n\nAgain I\u2019m ok with NSFW themes, but it has to make sense and involve the right character. Like if I make a sultry, bombastic character then it makes sense to have more NSFW posts and themes. But for most other characters it\u2019s not going to be happening terribly often unless we talk about it before hand.\n\nI think that\u2019s everything, I can use mostly any platform but prefer discord so let\u2019s see if we can figure something out!",

First Ill give you a little bit about myself. \n\nIve been roleplaying for 11 years now across various platforms. I love writing lengthier replies, but sometimes I can get bad and only manage a small one, but its not often. I use writing as a therapy tool, and it works wonders. Im looking for someone who is as passionate about their characters as I am. Im looking to build organic character interactions and far reaching plotlines. \n\nFor my partner, Im hoping to find someone who is interested in possibly several stories or rps, if we get along well. I have a soft spot for romance, which will be one of my major themes. Another is violence, so you must be alright with that, too. Proper grammar and spelling is a must, as well. All writing should be done in 3rd person, past tense. \n\nThe genres will most likely be either zombie apocalypse or supernatural fantasy, as im inclined to both vampires, werewolves, demons, and zombies!\n\nIf any of this sounds like it's up your alley, or youd like more information (and to see my line-up of characters) shoot me a message and I will direct you to my contact info.",

This all stopped when the World Government\u2019s Marines came along, capturing the Pirate King and sentencing him to death. However, just before he died the Pirate King spoke his last words, screaming them to the Heavens, telling all that he had hid his treasure, the One Piece, at the end of the Grand Line, and encouraged all to seek it out.\n\nThis has sparked the interest of many a generation, encouraging people to go out and become pirates to claim riches for themselves, creating \u2018The Great Pirate Age\u2019.\n\nSo for those of you who don\u2019t know, this roleplay is inspired by One Piece, the popular manga/anime of the same name, however you don\u2019t need to know anything about One Piece.\n\nNow what am I looking for? Well I\u2019m hoping to find a partner that wants to sail the seas with me as a pirate, adventuring from island to island, raising our bounties as we go and forming a mighty crew. More details can be discussed over messages.\n\nNow for writing style, I am pretty easy on this, I don\u2019t mind if we roleplay 1st or 3rd person and I don\u2019t mind about your post length as long as I\u2019m able to reply to it.\n\nI hope this post has interested you and if so please shoot me a message.",

First time posting here so I hope that the mods can point out if I make any mistakes or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking for players for a free-form Star Wars RP that takes place during the Clone Wars. You can change Star Wars history (such as killing Palpatine or having the Confederacy win). You can also be any character you want, such as a Separatist general or a long-lost apprentice of Darth Plagueis. The choices are all yours. It will be a combination of the Official Canon and Legends Canon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe RP itself takes place in Space Battles. I currently have a temporary ban but that's scheduled to end sometime tonight. Tomorrow, I'll make the OOC thread. But until that happens, I have a thread a Discord server that we can use, so we can discuss things beforehand and perhaps even plan out the stories better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to stress that I'm pretty lenient and laidback and one of the big things I want to emphasize with this RP is player freedom. Me and my co-GMs will play the original characters of Star Wars (characters like Anakin, Dooku, Obi-Wan, etc.). But you will have to create your very own character. I urge you to get creative and think hard about what you want your character to be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask me as I'm sure I might have forgotten some things while writing this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil then, you can join us at the Discord server right here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://discord.gg/Dxdunms](https://discord.gg/Dxdunms)",

            "selftext": "The man standing in the town square of the woodpand village would have looked like a beggar or madman to the average person. He was clad in simple furs and leathers, he was covered in bits of debris such as twigs and small stones, and he wore a strange headdress made of a wolf's head with impressive stag antlers and many other odd alterations. \n\nBut to the non average person, he looked like a wise old sage. His face was old, but showed signs of peaceful happieness and wisdom. His clothing was well made, and obviously served some sort of shamanistic purpose. And he seemed to radiate an air of peace and tranquility. \n\nThe people of the surounding woodlands and the people of this thriving woodland town knew him as Lalowasike, the archdruid of this land, and they would know this day as the Green Dawn. The Green Dawn was a holiday held every ten years, in which the village would all send their willing children to the archdruid, he would put them through tests and contests over the coming week, and whichever child he judged worthy would become his apprentice, and be taught over the next ten years to be a druid in their own right. It was a happy time of celebration for all in the village, especially for the children who took up the challenge in hopes to be taken as an apprentice and become a druid themselves.\n\n\"People of Falkonsted\", he said in his low voice that sounded like rolling thunder, \"you all know well what a special day this is. I look before me to see the very essence of life itself; insatiable curiosity, boundless energy, unbridled joy to be alive and in the world. These things are what make children so special, and in seven days, we will learn anew how powerful these things can be\".\n\nHe gestured for all the willing children, the youngest of whom was 7 years old and the eldest being 12, to step foward and stand in a circle around him. \"To choose my next apprentice, one of you will be taken into the woodlands, and taught the art as old as time itself. Before you commit to the coming week of challenges and contests to determine which of you will be the one, consider it carefully. The woodlands can be treacherous, and nature's might has little patience for weakness or hesitation. I will provide you with some protection, but I can only do so much. The trials will be difficult, your fellow tributes will use every means at their disposal to stop you, and I am no exception. I will be watching you all and passing judgment, and my interference, for better or for worse, will be a common occurance. \n\nBut when one victor is chosen, that person will come with me, and begin their ten years of teaching. For those that do not wish to compete, and those that are not chosen, there is no shame. Let any who wish to turn back from the challenge now take four steps backward\". \n\nHe paused his speech and looked looked around the circle with an understanding face. \n\nWill you take up the challenge and try your fortune? Will you be chosen to become the next student kf tbe archdruid? Only time and experience will tell",

            "selftext": "Hello! My name's Danny, and I'm 18 years old. I've been roleplaying since I was about thirteen years old, and like to think that I'm relatively experienced. I'm looking for a guy my age or older to be the main character in a long-term Batman roleplay, where you assume the role of the titular Dark Knight, and I guide you through a series of stories. Partners that live in GMT -4 to GMT -6 would be ideal, basically the East Coast and Midwest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe roleplay will take place early in the general DC timeline, before the Justice League is formed. You have a lot of liberties as to how you write your Batman, but figure that he's not quite at his prime yet, still learning and evolving as a hero. The general tone for the roleplay will be more light-hearted than settings like live action DC or the Arkham series, but still with a healthy amount of darkness and brooding. This IS Batman, after all!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the most part, I'll be acting as an omniscient gamemaster, setting the stage and writing the story as you progress through it. My de-facto \"character\" will be Richard Grayson/Robin, so expect him to feature frequently. If you're interested, shoot me a message here on Reddit! Tell me about yourself, your Discord tag, and why you like Batman. If I think we'll click, I'll add you! Look forward to hearing from you, Caped Crusader!",

When average people think of carnivals, they think of terrible rides, greasy food, and unfair games. The carnival in your town has those, yes, but there are other things. Namely, the attractions. Apparently, this carnival, that only comes around once every five years, hadn't gotten the memo that putting odd people out on display is no longer considered a good ticket seller. No, this carnival shows off its freaks with pride. And this year, they had more \"freaks\" than ever.

Grabbing some food and wandering past the cheap souvenir booths, your reminiscing is cut short by someone running into you, causing you both to fall to the ground.

Its got the words \"Midnight Special Attraction: See the Beast!\" In fancy white lettering....*\n\nHi there! I hope you like my prompt.

            "selftext": "Hello! My name is Daniel and I've been interested in doing a roleplay related to wrestling for a while. Downside though that it seem to be quite niche and when I do find a group or someone to do it with, it tend to not work out. Either be it for people flaking out, their character being not interesting and engaing or simply fail to discuss what they exactly want to do with their character and the flow of the plot/arc. It seem people are treating it as a game to win than a way to tell a interesting story through unconventional means.\n\nSo basically what I'm saying is that I want to find a person or group who aren't like that and be open and willing to have a discussion on how they want the RP to go and give it more meaning than \"I won a fictional fight with a stranger online.\" I want to tell a good story while having some macho fights in between, yknow?\n\nAnyhow, I enjoy writing in the third person since I find it more natural than using \"I\" statements. Personally I don't think you need to have uber long paragraphs all the time so as long I can go off with what you typed while making the text fun to read through, any length is fine. I heavily enjoy making (and drawing!) OCs so I much prefer the world/setting and characters to be completely original. \n\nIf this post caught your interest and want to do one with me or have a group looking for new people, please send a DM my way!",

            "selftext": "Dear Emperor Rhoko, \n\nI regret to inform you that the Red Arm's most recent foray into the Void has led to severe and unexpected casualties. All thirty paladins are confirmed to have been killed-in-action by the unspeakable monstrosities of the Cacophonous Abyss. Only a few unfortunate souls managed to return through the gateway with myself and barely a shred of sanity left. Even now the horrors I have seen gnaw at my mind like termites wriggling through my consciousness. The truth of us, our galaxy, that I have been told by the leviathans is too much for me to bear. Their maddening whispers speak of the Harvest and our extinction.\n\n\nI beg of you, my lord, please abandon plans for further expeditions and destroy the gateways. What we have witnessed was not meant to be seen.\n\n\n- Captain George Tarwick\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nHey there, party person, I have been working on a space fantasy setting for some time now and I'm opening the latest version to some new players! To give a brief rundown of things, it's a bit Star Wars-esque with the technology. However, there are also magical abilities that a select few have developed and eldritch beasts linked to them. Expect to encounter exotic worlds, plenty of aliens (some very strange), and interstellar governments!\n\n\nAs a GM, I'd like to know what kinds of things you're hoping to do in an RP like this. Do you want to just explore? Are you just looking to meet someone? Want to be a warrior against the corruption leaking into the galaxy from every dark corner? Or do you just want to make some cash smuggling? You're not limited by these of course, but knowing what you want will help me give you more opportunities to do those things.\n\n\nIt's also important that I know what your limits are. Please tell me if you're okay with blood, gore, battle, carnage, or dark things in general. Depending on how you choose to progress, you may encounter this stuff and sometimes I like to get pretty descriptive with it. Please also tell me if you are okay with NSFW content and if you want to include it. I'm more than happy to include NSFW content, and if you really want you can just go on some sexual misadventure to get a bunch of alien girlfriends from all across the galaxy or something like that. You'll have to play right though!\n\n\nNow, the boring part: writing requirements. Don't fret, if you're an experienced roleplayer and a good writer, this won't be a problem! All I ask is that you send me a message with substance that I can reply to. It doesn't need to be a specific length, though I'd like you to ba e capable of writing a few paragraphs when appropriate as it's not uncommon for me to do that. Third or first-person is fine, whatever you prefer. Playing multiple characters is a bonus as well. I'm going to be doing most of the heavy lifting here so I greatly appreciate a partner who puts work into their replies. Standard roleplaying etiquette applies of course, so no god-modding, metagaming, etc.\n\n\nA few other notes just as a fair warning. I don't reply very consistently due to the fact my university is very fast-paced, so keep that in mind if you want some kind of epic quest-- I may not have the time or energy to reply that often. If you replied to one of my posts previously and I never got back to you, I apologize, I hit a rough patch when I was taking far too many classes last term. Feel free to message me again, I'll try to reply to everyone.\n\n\nThat's pretty much everything. If you're interested, please send me a PM with what you'd like to include and do with me! Don't be afraid to introduce yourself. :)",

            "selftext": "Greetings, everyone!\n\nMy name is Neon, I'm 20 years old, and I have been roleplaying for almost 5-6 years now. I've taken a break from roleplaying and whatnot in the past few months, and now I'm looking for possible male partners. To be specific, my roleplays are very much adult-oriented, and usually focus on that aspect alone. Despite that, they are all very detailed and have specific, well panned-out scenarios.\n\nThus, I'm also looking for someone who has probably the same time of experience with roleplaying in general, and has a preference for literate, mostly **long replies**, usually at the minimum of two short paragraphs, as well as also being 18+. Getting even more specific, I prefer a **3rd person POV** when it comes to writing roleplay replies, both for myself, and my possible partner. Often however, I take a Game Master/Narrator type of role, playing various characters.\n\nThus, most of my roleplays are very much fantasy/sci-fi oriented, and take inspiration from various games and works of fiction. A slight disclaimer however, I only take inspirations from these works of fiction, and don't specifically roleplay them as they are. Like say, I don't necessarily use characters from a specific game, and instead just use its worldbuilding as a reference. All of the character roles are 18+ at every circumstance. That being said, if you are interested in roleplaying with me, I'd love to discuss this idea with you more. These NSFW topics will only be further discussed through personal messages. Thank you, and happy roleplaying!",

            "selftext": "So, I want to try something I haven't tried yet. I want to be the 'storyteller' for an RP. That is to say, I'm running the plot and various characters, however your character is essentially the 'Main Character' of the story. The friends they chose becoming secondary characters, choosing whatever romantic interest they want instead of being shoehorned, etc. etc. It's your character exploring a story and world they've been thrust into.\n\nIn this case; The story is that of the Witching Hour. The setting is modern day, your character is a high school / college student or working adult, whatever you prefer, in a sizable american town. One day, your character meets an old biker, and from that day forwards their life changes.\n\nAfter the stroke of midnight, every human being disappears from the world, and aberrations and monsters slip into the town they knew so well. Your character at first is defenseless, but after a run-in with the biker again, learns they can defend themselves, and that the Witching Hour ends.\n\nThe Witching Hour is an hour that happens every day, the 25th hour of the day no one is aware of except those made aware of it for unknown reasons. A time where reality seems to become warped, and anything not taken care of during the witching hour will break through and impose itself in our reality. The anomalies of the witching hour have started affecting your town. Others are awakening to it too, just as scared, just as helpless. It's up to you to help them.\n\nBut how long has this been happening?\n\nWho all is aware of this?\n\nHow will this affect your normal life?\n\nHow many others will awaken to it?\n\nWhat is the sordid history of the Witching Hour? What are the rules it plays by? What will you become because of it?\n\nThese are the trials for your character.\n\n\\----------------\n\nThis will be a long-term RP. I can't promise a post every single day, but I'll have plenty of days where I can do big RP exchanges, most of the time I can get a good session in every day. I have an EST time zone, and my day from Saturday through Monday usually starts 5:00 AM. The rest of the week is a bit malleable due to work schedules.\n\nI'd really appreciate details on your character, likes, dislikes, history\\~\\~ etc. That way I can kind of mould the witching hour around them.\n\nYour character will be developing their own powers and abilities through the RP. It should generally be based on their personality. (Very crudely, someone hot headed might have fire abilities, enjoy using an axe or a shotgun that doesn't require ammo, that sort of thing.) Don't stress on that though, your character wont know they can even do any of that at the outset, and the Biker in question should help them kind of understand how they can develop their skills and create their own unique way of fighting and dealing with the horrors ahead.\n\nThe RP will have some light horror elements too, so if you get nightmares easily I'd advise turning back now-- Buuut don't expect me to go wild with gore or anything. It's light horror elements.\n\nI'm also going to say, at least a paragraph please per post. I don't need novels but, more then one-liners. (I'll go lax on that rule for casual conversation at times if there's not much to describe in a back and fourth.)\n\nThank you for your time. Shoot me a PM and I'll give ya my Discord deets.",

Lately I've had the desire to expand those i play with and see new settings and try new ideas I may not have seen or done before.\n\nI'm not a huge stickler about grammar or post length, all i ask is for no one or two liners, it's hard to create a creative response from just a line or two and get into things. Also I will only play either over reddit or Discord, with a preferrence for Discord, so i hope that's not an issue.\n\nAs for topics, i have a lot of ideas I've been juggling that aren't based around any source material, as well as some fandoms and sources i love, my favorite being the elder scrolls, fallout, star wars, and man in the high castle, among many others. Don't let these deter you, i like many others as well, I'm just the most familiar and comfortable with these. \n\nLastly, i do ask that those interested please be above the age of 18. Sorry to those interested that might not be, but I don't know what direction the RP may take, and i just want my partner to be 18+ so it's not an issue. Thanks for understanding.\n\nIf you're still reading and interested, feel free to PM me and we can get the ball rolling. I look forward to hearing from all of you. :)",

            "selftext": " Kings don't get a choice. Most are born into the roll. Its this luck of the draw that for centuries people felt discouraged about. If you were born into the right family... you were set for life. Could want for nothing and be happy. The odds though, ridiculous. Now take those odds and make them zero and divide by one. That is your chances of being a god.\n\nHumanity had lived for a long time, and died a while ago too. The earth no longer was home to cities of man, with there technology ruling supreme. It had been struck down by something more volatile. Echo as the ancestors called it pulled many realities into one. Humans were no longer alone. The old world had fallen back in 2200. Cities once glowing now were overgrown. Oceans had dried and reformed. But the mark of the Echo remained. The nature once know had become different, taking from different worlds and producing an amazing fantastic planet of Nature, Technology, and Magic.\n\nBut the Echo did more than just that. It made the world exciting again, wild! Different species fought, made peace, rose and fell. Kingdoms sprang up again bringing back the royal family traditions of old. And with it, new gods were born. Not your average, pray for an afterlife ones. Ones with no limits that could make any dream come true with the right convincing.. and this is the story of how you met and captured one.\n\n**Good Evening everyone,**\n\nI hope you all liked my introduction to Echo! It is a High Fantasy Romance RP! There are no limits to your race here, I think the best part of this world is how open it can be. Just do not be too OP! I will be controlling the world and the God in question in this world. This is a tale that I thought of based slightly around the old movie Stardust! (Sappy I know but I love it)\n\nSo would you like to play it? If so, please send me a DM! Tell me about **YOU**! Then your character, and what you would use a god for! I really hope to turn this into something special.\n\nI respond usually in the morning and at night, I am EST so be aware of that. I look forward to seeing the people you come up with!",

I want to try this at least once.\n\nSo send me a DM if your interested and I\u2019ll get back to you ASAP. I am a busy woman after all with work and life.

Hope to find the same. \n\n\n\n-Police detective/an almost victim to the most notorious serial killer around. I was thinking 1940s/1950s ish for this one. My character somehow got away from the killer and turns to your character for help.\n\n\n\n-The d\u00e9butant/lowly worker. I was thinking 1890s for this one. I thinking two different things for this one. Either it takes place in New York among high society or maybe my incredibly rich father decided to move us out west to some small town in hopes of expanding his business. Your character could be whatever you wanted as long as there is an obvious class divide. \n\n\n\n-The Immigrant Girl. So, picture the movie Brooklyn. That's what I have in mind here. Essentially, 1950s-ish, a girl moves to New York from another country and falls in love with a local guy. In the movie, she's Irish and he's Italian but any combination is grand by me. We can really make this one whatever we want it to be and don't need to follow the movie.\n\n\n\n-Popular girl/nerdy guy. Definitely a slice of life role. The two grew up next to each other and were best of friends ever since they were small. Things changed when high school came around and the two went down two very different paths. \n\n\n\n-Innocent church girl/bad boy. Another slice of life role. The innocent girl is new in town. Her father was just hired on at a local church as the new pastor. She begins to attend the local high school and catches the eye of a character who's a bit unsavory, at least at first glance. His reputation speaks volumes. Another scenario could involve him being her tutor in college. Now, that would create some issues straight out the door.\n\n-A princess in search of a suitor to claim her rightful throne after her parents' deaths. Lots could go on there.\n\n\n\nHopefully something tickles your fancy. I'm rather easy going. I'm sure even if you aren't into any of these, we could find something that works for both of us. I'll stay tuned. :) Also, if it isn't clear, I don't want this to be an entirely smut-driven piece. I like substance, plot, character development and such. Yeah, I can get down and raunchy in my roles but if you're looking for a in-story hook up then ditching... Byeeee.",

I love the idea of a multi-world filled with orcs, vampires, humans, werewolves, shapeshifters, etc. If this sounds interesting to you, let me know in the comments below and I'll shoot you a link to the discord server and we can chat! Thanks.",

Suffice it to day, this role will have a Science-Fiction Tone and Theme to it.\n\nYou DON'T need to have any prior knowledge of the subject, so don't worry if you're on the fence because of this.\n\nWhen you message me, include in your answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat Time Periods do you Enjoy?*\n\n-Historic (1800-1945)\n\n-Modern (2019)\n\n-Futuristic (2030-2300)\n\nWhat Time Zone are you in?\n\nWhich of these, \"Character Factions,\" are you willing to play characters in?*\n\n-Military.\n\n-Police.\n\n-First Responder (Fire and Medical).\n\n-Civilian.\n\nOn a Scale of 1 - 10, how graphic do you accept violence? (1 - Blood makes me squeamish, 5 - I like Saw, 10 - I watch Cannibal Holocaust with the kids).\n\n*I will accept multiple answers for these questions.\n\n~~~~~\n\nRules for the Role:\n\n1.] No matter the role, you have to play multiple characters. A minimum of two, one being male, one being female. However many you want, it doesn't make as much a difference as some think. This is the base line for simple character creation in the role.\n\n2.] You have to play in Third Person.\n\n3.] You have to have some sort of dedication to the roleplay. This isn't meant to be a one-'n-done situation. This is an actual, full-length STORY.\n\nI'm very open and willing to discuss, if there's something that bothers you or if something is against what you typically would be comfortable doing, let me know and we can work something out.",

            "selftext": "The Tesnak Empire is a brutal, antihuman, interstellar government run by a people called the Tesnak. It has existed for over 700 years, but until 50 years ago the Republic of Mankind, a human populated nation that stretched across the stars, was still allowed to exist. The decades the humans have been under Tesnak control have been violent, marked by constant rebellion and violence against their new rulers, and crisis struck, fragmenting the Tesnak Empire into a few smaller factions, plunging it into civil war, diverting attention from humanity for a moment.\n\r\nThat distraction did not last long. The Emperorless Tesnak Empire made peace with the primary splinter fragment, the human Sovereignty of Mutual Defense, though their relationship is strained. With that front closed and the fragile cracks within the Empire revealed by its previous crisis, the Tesnak Committee for Public Safety worked its way into Imperial politics. Traitorous governors, officers, and citizens were hunted down and executed in public displays, trying to show the subjects their place, but only provoking further retaliation. Human rebels bombed the Imperial Palace during the new Emperor's coronation, and in an unauthorized response, the director of the CPS ordered an attack on the chaotic Sol system, ultimately resulting in the destruction of earth and the genocide of 23 billion humans.\n\r\nWar rages in the Sol system as human rebels on Luna and Mars fight to avenge their fallen homeworld, and danger looms at the edge of the Empire's borders as the SoMD militarizes and considers aiding the oppressed humans in the Tesnak Empire. Will you join the cause of humanity in ensuring the Tesnak can commit no further atrocities against alien races, or will you side with the Emperor in ensuring order in the Galaxy? Perhaps you watch from the sidelines as the Sovereignty prepares for conflict, playing politics and economics? Most anything is possible in this Galaxy!\n\r\nThis is a serious, group based scifi roleplay. We don\u2019t discriminate too much against newer roleplayers so long as you\u2019re willing to improve and contribute to our Galaxy. The only things we ask are that you don\u2019t be an asshole and that you don\u2019t cheat. Other than that, we are a pretty chill text based group of \u201cfriends\u201d (some are not friend material). Come have fun with us!

Most could onky do the most basic of magic. Sparks, small flames and the like. Yet a few reached the heights of reality manipulation. Of course when these magics were finally tamed to the extent that schools could be established to teach them, the people of the world were not content to remain in walled cities and under deep mountains. The power to grow an entire years worth of crops and build great monuments in a single day made it so the world would develop faster than ever conceived. \n\nNow with magic and technology working in tandem the races of earth have began to branch out into the wider universe. Planets are colonised by magic users and engineers alike as they work to spread across the universe. Star ships carry colonists to the far distant worlds. Upon these ships the next generation of magic weilders are trained. \n\nHowever not all is well. As magic is only available to a few friction arises between magic weilders and those who rely on technology, some question the morality of being born into a life long career due to your parents joining a ship, and the other races met on distant worlds do not always subscribe to the grand plan that the central planet has assigned them.\n\nWe are on board the Wander. The craft destined to go futher than any other craft before it. To see uncharted planets and new species. Are you a magic user? If so what kind? Do you enjoy this work? There are plenty of ways this can go and I am interested to hear your ideas for this roleplay.",

            "selftext": "So recently, I have found some great ideas from other people. Unfortunately I got ghosted, annoyingly. Now I'm left with the bitter taste of wanting to roleplay these ideas but can't. Anyways, I want to use some elements from those ideas and make my or may I say 'our' dark roleplay. \n\nI've been craving a really dark plot lately. Think of saw mixed with hostel mixed with Tristan and Isolde. Almost medieval. I don't have much specifics, I guess I just wanna stir curiosity. \n\n18+ ONLY PLEASE!! \n\nI AM NOT COMFORTABLE ROLEPLAYING WITH MINORS. \n\nI am very literate and I also really look for ooc and friendship. I answer multiple times a day and hope you can do the same. I am a female and don't mind who I roleplay with just as long as y'all can do a dude for me. I don't mind doubling either. \n\nSome plot ideas I'm open to and happy to build on:\n\n- arranged marriage\n- trafficked girl gets bought \n- getting kidnapped\n- gods\n- a/b/O\n- horror\n- terato\n- more horror\n- all the horror\n\nI only roleplay on discord but will make an exception for Kik, if you can convince me. Hope to hear from you. (:",

Keyboards, synthetic beats... it fit her world far better than currently popular tunes. Cigarette smoke curled past purple painted lips, whispering along to the lyrics as neon signs flashed by. Once upon a time, there were none by the highway. Then again, once upon a time, most of the highway travelled through the countryside and suburbs. Now it was all an urban, high-rise nightmare of light polution. At least, that's how it was along the messenger's usual routes.\n\nThere was more to it, of course. But if the mega-cities were dangerous, anything beyond them could be outright deadly. There were few reasons to leave one by the venerable means of road travel and the messenger was no flyer. She was content to drive along the many roads, delivering the packages as per her clients' instructions, dealing with whatever life cast her way with wits and violence, whatever was quicker and more efficient.\n\nShe took an exit that dove into the depths of the city, navigating the narrow streets until the white and black vehicle came to a stop in front of an unassuming building, squeezed between taller and newer ones. Her boot heel crushed the cigarette as she stepped out of the car and entered the building. \"About time,\" a voice greeted her, \"...they requested you specifically and boy is the package a special one...\"\n\n*The package is - you! But who or what are you? A corporate VIP? A popular performer? A one-of-a-kind AI? A bit of each? Join me on a neon lit, gritty night ride through a retrofuturistic cyberpunk world of despair and decadence. Long term partner sought.

I'd say I have at least 8 years under my belt. I can do anything you like, my interests are vast, and my dislikes small! I can play both male and female with ease, though lately I've preferred to play male. I'm also down for things.. a bit stronger than romance.\n\nPlease note that none of my stories are set in stone, and I'm happy to discuss ideas and plots with you. Anyway~ onto the fun part!\n\nI LOVE SUPERNATURAL, MODERN (or modern/medieval mix), ACTION PACKED ROLEPLAY. If you have something you want to do within that realm, I will be your best friend. Some things I know a bit about, and would be happy to roleplay in that setting; - Dishonored - Fallout - Borderlands - The Walking Dead (up to season 8) - Game of Thrones - Altered Carbon - The Witcher - World of Warcraft - Skyrim and many more! Just hit me with an idea, I'm easy to get along with! \n\nIf anything I've written interests you or you think we would get along, please PM me with a short blurb about you/your character(s) and your discord info!\n\nHappy hunting :)",

            "selftext": "Hey all.\n\nI am looking for 1-2 new partners. I do play males and females so my partner shouldn't expect to take on all guy characters himself. I tend to give around three paragraphs, often more but three is a good number I think. I can post every other day usually. I do not like people who are online all the time or expect me online all the time though. We all have stuff to do that isn't always related to writing so I respect that and want my partner to not be too clingy if I haven't gotten back online in a day or two. Sometimes stuff happens yeah?\n\nSo I can do fandoms and original based stuff. For fandoms, I do prefer canons because it's easier for me to work with characters we both know fairly well. But for original stuff, OCs are obviously fine because everything is from scratch there. I am open to putting canons in an original setting though, if it makes sense and can work. I'm pretty laid back so I'm not too strict on canon stuff.\n\nFandoms I'd be into: Game of Thrones, Death Note, Harry Potter, Final Space, Naruto, My Hero Academia, Doctor Who, Star Trek, and so on. Ask if you have a fandom in mind. There's so many out there, I don't want to list them all.\n\nOriginal concepts I love would be: slice of life, modern day, modern day with light fantasy, online virtual reality, light fantasy, time travel, knights and royalty, sweet cute stuff. I like simple plots and simple characters, then developing them as we go along. Romance is great and makes things better in my mind. I'm not too big on action/combat but I can try to get better there.\n\nI have one or two ideas but I'd love to hear from people too, I'd like a partnership where we're both heard and respected.\n\nLet me know if you wanna make something happen!",

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nI am looking for something an interesting and more character driven RP. It would be focussing on an adventure with lots of romance, with our two characters against the world, forbidden love or even just exploring the world together! There will be action as that is what i love to write and i think that I excell at it. In the slower periods with no action, there will be romantic scenes (which i also love to write) or high tense yet non-action based scenarios.\n\nI would love for this to take place in the Legend of Zelda universe. If you have any other ideas of worlds/ Eras that you want to have our RP take place in, please let me know!\n\nThe Characters we would play would be OCs of sorts that fit in the universe. This would be like a Zora Soldier or something of that caliber. Id love for this RP to be a nice mix between a burning romance and an action adventure story against the horrors of Hyrule. \n\nI am only looking for partners that are 18+. Please let me know if you are interested in incorporating some NSFW or smut into our RP with the romance. It wouldnt just be for the sake of doing it but it would make sense with the tension building and stuff. \n\nI dont believe there is anything else i really left out of this post but there probably is. If you need anything else from me, just send me a lovely red or orange envalope and i can definately answer it. I hope to have a very fun and interesting RP with you guys! And as always, all my other prompts are open to RPing too so you can just go through my post history! Thanks for reading!\n\n-Chris",

I'll let you create your own character and we will see where we can take the rp after we discuss and share our characters. I want you to create your own character because It makes is more interesting and unexpected than if I choose your role. I am both okay with you playing both Female and Male character.

            "selftext": " \n\nHi there! Im currently looking for a long tern RP partner for a semi/full Fantasy setting I had in mind. \u30fe(\u2606'\u2200'\u2606)\n\n* A little about me, My name is Kate im 22 and I love some good character interaction! I typically can go from 1-4 Paragraphs depending on what feels good in the interaction.\n* While I do have a decent bit of world built up for this RP I want to build something with you! not be in control of the whole thing.\n* I want to point out early on this isnt a NSFW story and will avoid anything sexual (violence and darker themes are fine tho), HOWEVER am looking for romance in the story. Other than that please only people 20+\n* I will say I am hoping for specific character personalities as this is a story I have been wanting to do for years now. But am willing to change it up some. In the end I don\u2019t mind anything changing but the main premise I would like to do if you want to is: *A hate eachother at first sort of relationship, my character being too uptight and serious never having a chance to enjoy life. And yours being spoiled and always doing what they want, not caring too much about people on a personal level. Both slowly growing to like/love one another.*\n* Please no Ghosting either...if something dosent work or youre just not into it or around anymore, please just let me know. I wont take it personally I promise\n* Hopefully thats everything, if you have any questions or are interested message me \\^\\^ Im really excited to create the world!  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nBelow is a prompt for one of the characters I had in mind for the rp but please if you have your own Ideas id love to hear that too \u30fe(\u2606'\u2200'\u2606)\n\n*Your family, for years, has held a spot in (name of place) territory\u2019s council, being quite proud of the wealth and lifestyle they have built up. Not only making their fortune from politics but using their power to take over trade routes to monopolize the rune industry. So one would think that with your high wealth lifestyle you would fit right in. Wrong! Never once have you been interested in taking the family seat on the council, seeing your (insert current family member in council) spend their whole life wasting their money on making more money. No, you want to waste their money on something much more interesting. For years they have tried to get you to take interest but have finally given up, turning to your (other family member) instead, and deciding to send you off to other territories for \u2018relations\u2019 with the other territories. Your new job typically making you represent the family to the lower class. You know its meant to be an insult, a way to get you out of their hair, but life is so much more interesting with the lower class. They know how to waste their money, on booze, women and some adventure.*",

I hope to find a longterm partner that wants to write a story with me, that likes to play the prince in this prompt and ofrourse make a world around it!..   \n\n\n**The prompt:**   \nYears ago the King was really happy with his queen and their little princess daughter. That all changed when the queen got very sick and eventually died. The king got depressed and made bad choices for his kingdom.  \n\n\nNow he tried to do the right things and discussed a few things with another kingdom.... If he wants to stay the king and have a strong army his daughter needed to marry the prince of that kingdom.  \n\n\nShe is going to be forced to marry this man she doesn't even know. She had to marry him to help her father and she would do it only to help her father......  \n\n\nFirst it's not love but a bit more do it because you had to.... and then slowly the time breaks trough that they fall for one another, but it needs to build up.  \n\n\n  \nThis is the prompt I set up it's a bit rough ofcourse but I didn't want to write the perfect story so nothing could be changed. That's why we can both build something up.",

I've been roleplaying the same way for all these years and i'm willing to change if someone is able to bear with me and introduce me to what people can see as the more professional way of roleplaying!\n\nI still roleplay right now but i'm interested in getting into even more roleplays, primarily Fantasy and NSFW roleplaying. I am very active and i am able to write almost all of the time, given that i'm not sleeping or having class. I will use Discord and also Kik for roleplaying and i stick to writing one paragraph or LESS unless you guys give me time to get used to your way. I am as i said more than happy to learn new ways. \n\nI will gladly text you OOC for rp and non rp related topics, but i cannot promise that i will voice chat or call. I prefer 1v1 roleplaying but i don't mind going up to max 4 people at once. \n\nI don't pick existing characters to roleplay, Only self crafted characters, i use anime pictures 99% of the time for the looks of my character, I will not do NSFW MxM roleplaying, anything else is fine by me.\n\nWhile i definitely see myself as a good english writer i am definitely not an expert since i am from Sweden. I will write in the same way that i'm doing right now and not in some super advanced way.\n\nWhen i do Fantasy roleplaying i usually put in a lot of fighting in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSend me a message on reddit and tell me a little bit about yourself if you are interested in starting something with me.",

            "selftext": "Good evening! I've been hoping to get back into RP since I do miss creating a lovely story with someone else. It helps get my creative flow to moving again as well as being one of my favorite hobbies.\n\nAs my title says, this can be based off a certain fandom or something we create ourselves with a more generalized theme! The only thing that would remain the same is an adventure full of (perhaps) drama, romance, action, bonding, tragedy, horror, or whatever else happens along the way! Doesn't have to involve all of these themes, but this is to show that I'm open to all sorts of things! I believe the story can have a mind of its own so long as we agree on the guidelines!\n\nExamples of fandoms I am interested is:\n\n~ Elder Scrolls\n\n~ Final Fantasy (Most knowledge on XIV)\n\n~ Mass Effect\n\n~ World of Warcraft\n\n~ Disney\n\nThese are just the ones on the top of my head. If you have your own ideas, please discuss them with me! I'll be happy to let you know my knowledge on what fandoms you wish to take the story in. \n\nWhen it comes to original content, medieval/renaissance fantasy is my strong point. Second being to Sci-Fi. I will say I have a bit of an interest playing an alternate of my character where she is a mermaid, however this isn't necessary. She will almost always be a young human adult. \n\nI do give brownie points to those who play non-humans. Be it (for example) orc, vampire, elf, alien, android, dragon, or werewolf. \n\nPreference for characters who play as someone older and wiser. A nice calming contrast to my happy-go-lucky young lady. Stoic or just relaxed. Again, this is just more icing to the cake. Play whatever you wish!\n\nPlease contact me for my Kik or discord so we can set something up! I look forward from hearing from you!",

            "selftext": "&gt;Madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, it is said the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land. \n\n&gt;The Seven Kingdoms have been held in regency for over a decade by the Queen Mother and the Lord Hand, her lover. It was widely expected that King Rhaegar II Targaryen would continue to be a docile puppet even after he reached his majority. The boy always seemed far more interested in tournaments, women, and carousing with his friends than in the affairs of state. This conventional wisdom has proven entirely wrong, and has left the lords of Westeros scrambling to get the measure of their sovereign and divine his future intentions. Less than a moon before the King\u2019s twenty-first name day, the Lord Hand has resigned suddenly and returned home to the Westerlands. The Queen Mother has left the capital to take up residence at Summerhall (under heavy guard). The former Lord Hand\u2019s heir remains in the Red Keep as the King\u2019s ward. Several other formerly influential courtiers have fallen from grace for being too close to the previous regime. \n\n&gt;Into the simmering tensions in King\u2019s Landing now comes the rest of the realm, invited for a Grand Tournament planned to celebrate the King\u2019s impending name day. What awaits the lords and ladies of Westeros in the capital?\n\n---\n\n**GoT: A Ballad in Blood** is a brand new, community-driven role-play set in the same fictional world as the popular literary series, *A Song of Ice and Fire*, by George R. R. Martin, and the HBO show, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The roleplay, while technically utilizing the same setting, is meant to be considered an alternate universe as the lore, timeline, and events in our story will diverge from those outlined in canon.\n\nOur goal is to create an intriguing, player-driven story with no set end-point, but rather a dynamic living scenario woven together over time by the threads of the community members\u2019 stories. With exciting lore and a ready story just waiting for you to put your mark on it, our role-play is waiting for one thing, and one thing alone: you. \n\nWe are opening up the server to accept the applications of like-minded writers eager to post their chapters as a part of a never-ending tale where characters are limited only by their writers\u2019 imagination. A Ballad in Blood will be opening its role-play channels on Sunday, May 5th.\n\n---\n\nTogether we can craft a tale worth remembering and have some fun doing it!\n\n---\n\nThings to note:\n\n* We value paragraph and multi-paragraph responses with attention given to what your character does and says, since those are the main things to which other characters can react. We want to promote collaborative writing/storytelling and cannot do that with one sentence replies.\n\n* Due to mature subject matter found in the setting, this server is 18+ only.\n\n* A writing sample/past role-play sample will be required as a part of any character application. \n\n* We will accept original characters only.\n\n---\n\n[**Click here to join us on Discord!**](https://discord.gg/sV3zmRX)",

I like to go from the ground up when building a world, so don't be afraid to get creative and throw out some crazy ideas when talking it! I generally go for high fantasy, but that can be discussed. I'm available most of the time, but do have college so don't be surprised if I have some stretches of no replies. Pm me for my info/any questions, and I hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Greetings, all. My name is Ash, I\u2019m 21 years old, and I\u2019ve been in the roleplaying game for about seven years. What I\u2019m looking for is pretty simple. Over the years I\u2019ve had very few roleplaying partners who haven\u2019t eventually flaked out on me. So I\u2019m looking for a partner, maybe a few partners, who would be willing to stick it out with me. I\u2019m involved in a number of fandoms and am interested in making a roleplay on most of them (listed below), but I\u2019d be up for making a more original story, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. If there\u2019s a fandom you\u2019re interested in that\u2019s not on this list, feel free to ask me about it. I might be up for roleplaying it. I just want to roleplay with someone. \n\nFandoms:\n\nRWBY\n\nRed vs. Blue\n\nFairy Tail\n\n\nWriting stuffs -\nI write exclusively in past-tense, third-person limited, with proper grammar and punctuation. I\u2019d prefer you write in this style as well, as I think it makes the story flow better. I\u2019m very literate and I would prefer a partner who is more or less the same. If you are interested, I would like a sample of your writing, just to make sure it\u2019s alright for me. As for post length, I tend to write somewhere between two sentences and two paragraphs, usually matching the length of my partner\u2019s posts. I\u2019d be glad to provide a sample of my own writing, if you wanted. \n\nCharacter stuffs -\nAs indicated in the title of this post, I\u2019m seeking someone who will play female characters. I can play either male or female, but I prefer to play male characters. I don\u2019t particularly care if you play canon characters or original characters, but I prefer to play OC\u2019s myself. If you go with an OC, I will ask for a character sheet of sorts, with a description of their appearance, personality, and bio. Nothing too detailed is needed, I just want to get to know your character. \n\nGenre stuffs -\nI prefer to write romance stories. Plain and simple. I\u2019ll do other genres, but I\u2019d like for them to have elements of romance worked in. I also like to have a bit of smut, which is why I\u2019ll label this post as NSFW. I don\u2019t necessarily need to go into exacting detail, but I prefer to play it out than \u2018fade-to-black\u2019. If you\u2019re interested, please give me a list of your limits so I don\u2019t step on any toes. \n\nOther stuffs - \nAs I indicated in the title of the post, I prefer to roleplay on Discord. It doesn\u2019t matter to me if it\u2019s in dms or on a server. If Discord isn\u2019t your thing, never fear. I\u2019m pretty flexible. I can work with Skype or Kik as well. This summer I\u2019ll be working full-time, 8-5 five days a week, but my work is pretty flexible and I can usually get in some rp, but evenings and weekends will be better, most likely. Come fall, however, I\u2019ll be moving back to a part-time job while I\u2019m a full-time student, so my schedule will be a lot different. I try to get in as much rp as I can throughout the day, and I try to let my partner know when I\u2019m about to get busy. If you need to know more about my schedule, I\u2019m willing to provide. \n\nConclusion - \nThat wraps it up. If you\u2019ve made it this far, congratulations. Please give me a pm or a message of some kind, and say \u2018Mistborn.\u2019 Just so I know you read this whole thing. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Mankind has not been alone on Earth, not for millions of years. Ever since pre-historic times, they've shared the planet with a vile race, the Trins. Millions of years ago, between the Ice Ages, a large comet struck Earth, its impact not only creating a massive crater in what is now Australia but also releasing millions upon millions of particles into the Earth's atmosphere. These comet-originated particles weren't fatal for the humans, but they weren't exactly helpful either. The particles, as they entered the human organism, would mutate it, painfully, darkening the subject's skin, increasing its physique and strength but giving it a grotesque, creature-like look. This was how the Trins came to be.   \n\n\nFrom the beginning, this new race displayed tremendous violence, something little higher than a pure beast. They roamed the continents, forming packs, then tribes, then armies, all with the purpose of hunting their original form, humans. Despite their animalist behavior, the Trins are not deprived of conscience, each and every single one of them is well aware of what they are doing. They think, plan, adapt and kill. Unlike humans, however, it was common for a pregnant Trin to give birth to five to eight new-born, their growth rate far superior to mankind.   \n\n\nFor centuries, mankind lived in fear of the Trins, living at their mercy, being hunted down just for their hunter's sake. Their numbers were low, humans unable to match the Trins' enhanced physique. Then, it was as if biology said \"no more\". The thick particle cloud was now but a thin layer. Trins didn't appear anymore because of the particles, their concentration too low to cause any change. However, a mix of Trins and humans began appearing. Pregnant humans would occasionally give birth to blessed babies, the combination of the Trins' enhanced abilities without losing their human appearance or gaining the unending thirst for killing. This was how the Guardians were born.  \n\n\nThanks to these enhanced humans, mankind began fighting back. They took back lands they had lost but the battles weren't easy. Life on Earth was accompanied by the constant war between the Guardians and the Trins, even to today's time. Over the centuries, each side formed their own hierarchy, the Guardians distancing themselves from the humans they protected so to focus on their always present enemy. Because should the Guardians lose, mankind would surely perish.  \n\n\n**If the idea interested you, send me a PM and I'll answer any questions you might have about the world as it is. I'm looking for a small group of players to dive into this world and explore as you go about.**",

            "selftext": "\n\nI\u2019m looking for a long-term roleplay partner for either a fandom plot, or an original one we decide on. If fandom, I only rp OC\u2019s, but I have no preference whether you play an OC or a canon character. If an original story, I am comfortable playing female or nonbinary characters (I am nonbinary, but don\u2019t feel comfortable playing males, typically). But, again, I don\u2019t have any preference for what gender you play. \n\nFor fandom, I can do the following:\n\n\u2022Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts (the one I\u2019m most experienced in by far, and probably most comfortable with) \n\n\u2022Some Disney (if you\u2019re interested in a certain one, ask. I have a specific plot for Frozen that I\u2019m interested in, but am open to others)\n\n\u2022Hunger Games (haven\u2019t rp-ed this in a while, but had some good plots in the past and have a few ideas for new ones)\n\n\u2022Just about any Maggie Stiefvater universe (haven\u2019t used any in an rp before, but I am very familiar with her books and would be excited to try it out)\n\n\nFor Original plots, I\u2019m very much into action/adventure with some possible romance, but also don\u2019t mind including some slice of life parts. I really like any sort of urban fantasy/small-town horror stories, and have the following plots in my head: \n\n\n-Character 1 is a part of a long bloodline that has close ties to a local vampire coven/werewolf pack/other supernatural group. That group is suddenly facing conflict with another coven/pack/etc. and calls on Character 1 to hide away and protect the child of the leader in order to keep them from being targeted. This child (not actually a kid, just child as in offspring) is Character 2. \n\n-Character 1 is a struggling artist of some kind (painter, musician, writer, etc.) and is desperate for their big break. With a friend/friends one night they half jokingly call on some kind of deity they don\u2019t really know about (probably just googled one) for luck/help. Nothing happens in the moment, so they laugh it off thinking that obviously it didn\u2019t work because that kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen. But they later are met with a lesser demon (Character 2) that they actually managed to contact, who is now bound to them. \n\n-Character 1 meets Character 2 in some mundane romance-seeking way (online, dating app, etc). They hit it off, but after more and more encounters, something is definitely off. Character 2 won\u2019t meet any of Character 1\u2019s friends, and doesn\u2019t seem to have any of their own. They also have a surprising lack of traceable information, and doesn\u2019t share any specific personal details, like a job or place of residence. Which makes sense, considering Character 2 is actually a ghost/spirit. \n\n-Character 1 has newly moved out on their own into a quaint, quiet town. After a visit to a local caf\u00e9, they meet Character 2, a barista who is absolutely unlike anyone they\u2019ve ever met. Typical coffee shop romance would probably ensue, if it didn\u2019t turn out that Character 2 is actually one of the local fae that manipulates most of the town. (I actually have a pretty big interest in fae/Fair Folk lore and such, so if you don\u2019t know much about it I could definitely point you towards some awesome info sources)\n\n\nI don\u2019t have a strong preference about which character I would be playing in any of these plots, so I\u2019m flexible. And if you have any ideas/want to change or build upon one of those ideas, I would love to discuss!\n\nA little about me:\n\n\u2022My name is Kit\n\n\u2022I am nonbinary and use they/them pronouns\n\n\u2022I am 21 years old\n\n\u2022EST\n\n\u2022I have 6+ years of rp experience\n\n\u2022I am a very experienced fiction writer, and am currently an English student at university\n\n\u2022I\u2019m an avid reader and major nerd\n\n\nI\u2019m not super particular when it comes to who I rp with, but of course I have some preferences:\n\n\u2022MUST be over 18. Not even necessarily because of adult themes, but just for my own personal comfort. \n\n\u2022Uses paragraph-style responses. I\u2019m not looking for page-long messages, but a few sentences minimum would be great. And NO asterisks for movement and such. \n\n\u2022Someone who will write in third person, past tense. (If you have a strong preference towards present tense, we can discuss that.)\n\n\u2022Is able to respond at least once a day, preferably a few times if possible. I totally understand that our lives are busy, and things come up, so I\u2019m not going to abandon the rp after a day or two without a response. But if you know you are going to be gone for a day or more, a heads up would be perfect, just so I know you\u2019re not ghosting or something. \n\nI am perfectly fine with romance in the story (and sometimes even prefer it) as long as it\u2019s something close to natural, not forced. As for smut, I\u2019m definitely not interested in that being the focal point of the rp, and honestly wouldn\u2019t mind it not being included at all. (That can be in the form of asexual character(s), fading to black, etc.) I\u2019m not totally against it, though, and am willing to add it in if it flows naturally with the story. But, since I don\u2019t have much experience writing it, I can\u2019t say how good I\u2019ll be (but, as in all subjects, I\u2019m willing to learn! Just be patient.)\n\n\nI think that\u2019s all I have for now. If you are interested in rp-ing, or have any questions at all, shoot me a message here on reddit!",

I've read a few interesting stories, and saw a trailer (years ago) about a modern twist on the world, and I fell in love!\n\nSo, if you're interested hit me up. I either play on Discord or here on Reddit.",

Done...it'd be a ghost town thought...and that was the problem, what you had gained back in your body...you had lost what you had as a human... you couldn't interact with your friends like you could before... you had no one to lean on when the PTSD hit you... it was *Lonely*.\n\n\nAs you were staring at the blue explosion, thats where you saw it... the black chasis... standing on the hill behind the Second Suns forward assualt base...it was looking down at the field, its eyes... it wasnt an AI, it wasnt a mech... it had to be... you begged that it was...

The sanctuary's tall, stone walls that surround its exterior are only there to keep those who live there inside, but the powerful, magical barrier that surrounds the perimeter is there to keep the dangers that lurk outside away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe residents of this sanctuary are the Demigods, the children of the mighty Gods and Goddesses who seemingly cannot help but to mingle with the mortals, creating hybrids of people that are constantly being sought after by the most menacing, treacherous beings and monsters that exist. Because of this, people have found a way to protect themselves from the constant dangers by using a mighty artifact to power the barrier that only allows mortals or Demigods to pass through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese people have been living in peace for decades, as they have found a way to make their community mostly self-sufficient through the usage of their own abilities, making the people strong and proud of their heritage, and only trading with the mortals that have proven their trustworthiness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, this all had seemingly changed one day when a body was found... a child of Apollo, whose corpse was discovered in... suspicious circumstances. The sanctuary, now in an uproar, began to demand a war council to seek for who, or what had done such an atrocious act to one of their own. The people were beginning to suspect one another, as no monster could have ever possibly come in through the barrier, so it was the only logical explanation, as they believed that a mere mortal could never kill, or even harm, a Demigod.  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey there! I hope you enjoyed the little introduction to our roleplay group! We are a brand new group looking for new members that are interested in being some of the first people to develop an established character within the roleplay. We do not have many people right now, but it's the perfect opportunity for those who like active members!   \n\n\nOn a side note: we are an 18+ server! There are adult themes such as violence and gore that would not be appropriate for younger writers.   \n\n\nWe are also literate!

Jack is a introverted guy who spends his most of the time alone until he met Reggie at the age of 13. She changed him for the better or worse but she did. They became good friends. They used to hand out together. They fight. They tease. They annoy the other until the cute friendship turned romantic at the age of 19. It was Jack's idea but it didn't last long. They were happy having the best time of their lives for the 2 years when they were together until Reggie accused Jack of cheating on her and Jack accused her of the same. They eventually broke up and parted their separate ways. The truth is neither of them didn't cheat on the other. \n\nIt's been 2 years and Jack now runs a publishing company and a active editor. An art that he picked up spending all those time with Reggie. Now, There is a new assignment on his table. An anonymous writer under the name '______' is into her new book and Jack had been arranged to be the editor. He doesn't know who the writer is but all he knew is that she is good at what she does. \n\nToday, Jack was supposed to meet the author in a hotel and booked the table no. '568'. He was dressed on his best, nicely trimmed and very professional waiting on the table for past five minutes. But his cool in his face instantly disappeared as Reggie walked in the restaurant. She was in talk with receptionist and Jack doesn't even want to be on the same restaurant as she is. Fortunately, the tables are separate. So, He may not have to see her every minute in this long meeting that he had signed up to.\n\nI see this a potential build of up story between two lovers who despise each other and take it from there.

I would then play the canon character for your OC. \n\nI want to keep the dark, sexual and tense feeling given by G.R.R.M in the books and early in the show, so NSFW may be gratuitous but also necessary.\n\nIf you're interested, PM me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy OC:\n\n*Name:* Tiyana Flowers\n\n*Age:* 15 (also called ten-and-five)\n\n*Alliance:* [Tyrell](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dumbledoresarmyroleplay/images/5/50/Tyrell_sigil.png/revision/latest?cb=20140416162004)\n\n*Description:* She has long, flowing brown her, tumbling down her back in thick waves like water. Her eyes are blue like hydrangea's, striking and deep. She has flawless, porcelain skin without any scars or cuts; her father ensures that. Her lips, full and thick, shine red like roses beneath the sun.\n\nShe often wears a light lilac under-dress with a blue corset over the top, with matching sleeves attached. She sometimes likes to wear ribbons on her corset or on the hem of her dress too, but she rarely does this. The dress and corset was a gift from her half-sister Margaery for her 14th birthday (as she had recently turned 15 herself) and she truly loves it. margaery is the only Tyrell other than Mace to show her any kind of acceptance.\n\nHowever, during any formal occasions, she wears a [green dress](https://imgur.com/muqxU0m) that her mother made for her before she died. She uses make up to look even paler and attempt to look like her royal blood, but alas, nobody acknowledges her and even Mace and Margaery will ignore her unless they are in private.\n\n*Personality:* Tiyana is very optimistic; she loves tales of knights and princesses, but is grounded enough to understand that her base-born status denies her such tales. She loves to work hard and will even volunteer to work. When at formal events like parties of weddings of fellow small-folk of Bitterbridge (her hometown), she will offer to help wait on guests and will even sing for them.\n\nShe works in the inn as a waitress and chambermaid and earns some fair money for it. As yet, she hasn't been assaulted or touched inappropriately, as everyone knows who she is and the sworn knights and allies of the Tyrells haven't allowed anyone to harm her. She always spares these men, forgiving them and serving them the same, as she believes 'kindness is equal' and will refuse to be cruel to someone.\n\n*Bio:* She's the bastard daughter of Mace Tyrell, and despite her base-born status, she's aware of her father's connection to her as he raised her for a year when she was 5 and her mother was ill and being cared for by the maesters. In that time, she was educated and met her half-siblings. Loras, Willas and Garlan refused to acknowledge her and even ignored her, but 6 year old Margaery was kind to her and befriended her, teaching her to sing and telling her stories.\u00a0\n\nAfter that, when she returned to her well mother at the age of 6, Mace regularly sent maesters and Septa's to teach her basic writing, reading and mathematics and even a teacher to help\u00a0her sing. Margaery and Tiyana wrote one another letters regularly and have even snuck out together to ride horses. They were very fast friends (and still are, if the RP takes place prior to the Red Wedding).",

If you read this and are still curious or have questions please do not be afraid to ask. Let us begin. \n\nFirst and foremost what I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\n-Posts at least once a week but once a month will also work if you have a lot going on and are able to keep me in the loop. \n-I shall repeat, keep me in the loop! I don\u2019t mind asking but I will only ask once, where have you been, before I delete/leave the server. Everyone has a life and other very important things to do I get that so please just let me know. \n-respect my needs. I\u2019ve been doing this since I was 13 so please understand that I have a style and a form of writing. If I feel that our styles will not mesh I will be asking you to change or it\u2019s not going to work. I know it\u2019s kind of rough to say that but I rp because it\u2019s fun, and having to decipher someone else writing or having myself pulled out of the story because our styles don\u2019t work together just isn\u2019t what I want. \n-Let me know of concerns or problems. Every Rp I do had an OOC channel for that very reason. Voice your concerns please. \n-understand that I have a rather hectic life. And posting everyday sometimes just isn\u2019t possible. I post a minimal of three times a week when my schedule is light but that can reduce to once a week if things get really crazy. \n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in my Rp\n-grammar doesn\u2019t have to be perfect and neither does spelling. As long as I can read it we should be fine. \n-I have no post length. But I need enough to work with. One liners don\u2019t just magically work all the time. \n-details are my crack so please be descriptive if you can. \n-romance, adventure and drama are all musts. \n-I don\u2019t to spin off of shows or anything like that originals only. Setting are alright though. Like the fallout universe for example works for me. \n-currently I\u2019m drawing a blank with any specific plots that I\u2019m looking for so please message me with your ideas.",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been having a real bad creative block since the beginning of the year. Usually I can power through it and the ideas start flowing again but this time it\u2019s taking a little longer and I figure the best way to try and shake it off is to RP!\n\nI\u2019ve taken a bit of a hiatus from it but now I want to get back in the saddle! I suppose I should lay out my partner preferences. I\u2019m looking for a partner who is literate, +20 years of age and active when it comes to plotting. I also prefer to write in the third person perspective!\n\nThe plots I have in mind are few but things I\u2019d like to attempt and change things up.\n\nRDR1) This idea I\u2019ve been thinking about off and on the past couple weeks. It\u2019s the setting of RDR2 only modern day so instead of horses, people typically travel by vehicle. Smartphones and the internet are a thing. Towns like Strawberry and Valentine are still around but have grown much larger over time. And finally, criminals and outlaws are certainly still around.\n\nRDR2) This plot is a bit more open-ended and intends to serve as more of a challenge to myself. I\u2019ve often avoid writing as Canon characters out of fear of getting them wrong, but recently I\u2019ve come around to the idea. I\u2019d be role playing Arthur Morgan and the RP would take place over the events of the game but in AU where Arthur figures it\u2019s time to maybe try and get out of being an outlaw while he still can. I\u2019d prefer this plot to be an Arthur x OC pairing but I\u2019m not hard-set on \n\nNPC) This idea was inspired by too many sources to count but it\u2019s one I\u2019ve enjoyed trying out with previous partners. Essentially our characters would be NPCs in a video game that become self-aware. However, instead of it being more dramatic and Westworld-y with a sort of revolution, the focus is more on humor and avoiding the insanity that comes with human players.\n\nI\u2019d love to give one of these three ideas a shot but if they\u2019re not your thing then I\u2019d love to maybe hear out other ideas we could do!",

The demons, led by the seven sins, fought for power, and the angels fought to protect the surface world, but in all that time, the war had been little more than a stalemate. The purity of the angels perfectly matched the viciousness of the demons, so the solution was simple; recruit a human.\n\nYour character led the angels through numerous victories and forced the demon generals back into their castle; their last defense before total annihilation. Behind these walls, it was rumored that the demons were creating a new weapon, a dangerous creature that could turn the tide of the war. They called it \u2018The Eighth Sin\u2019.\n\nIt was time for your character, and a warrior angel by their side to protect them, to infiltrate the castle to defeat the seven sins once and for all, and destroy the Eighth Sin, whatever that might be.\n\n- This is an rpg-type roleplay similar to a dungeon crawler, where your character is placed in a small world to explore and level their stats while figuring out how to defeat each of the sins\n\n- Because of the possible nsfw themes in this roleplay, I won\u2019t be roleplaying with anyone under the age of 18\n\n- I am advanced-literate and I\u2019ve been writing for over a decade, meaning I can write a couple of paragraphs per response, but I\u2019m a believer of quality before quantity so don\u2019t fret if you can\u2019t always match the amount that I write",

I'm open to RPing on discord, PMs, twitter, email, whatever's easiest for both of us.  I'd prefer to write in third person and only interested in partners who are 18+.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have a written out plot or anything, just an idea. It's mostly romance mixed with thriller. Ten years ago, when my character was only 18 years old she became the sole survivor of a brutal massacre that took the lives of five of her friends and boyfriend. The aftermath of the massacre was highly publicized, leaving her labeled a 'final girl' and her photo plastered in the news. She likes to believe that she's mostly gotten over her trauma, and convientently doesn't recall most of that night's events. But her Xanax and wine dependency, aloof behavior and complete unwillingness to talk about the murders say otherwise. Your character would be the first cop that shows up on scene and saves her life (his backstory and where he is now is totally up to you). The event bonded our characters and yours feels protective over mine. They keep in touch, but mostly over text/email, rarely a visit because your character prefers to keep things professional. Anyway, I was thinking what brings them back together is my character recieving a threatening letter. So now we can pretty much decide where to go from there! I have a basic idea of what happened the night of the massacre but I'm open to suggestions/ideas once we're in discussion. :) If this sounds like something you're interested in please message me!",

You get up and dust yourself off as you walk to the edges of your tiny piece of debris from your past and see stretching out across your vision, chucks of varying sizes of land each harboring it's own bubble of life.\n\nThis is your home now, what you choose to do is up to you.\n---\nWhat makes us unique from other Dragon Ball servers?\n\nWe don't rely on annoying power levels or grinding trivial training passages. We have a tier system, which rewards good RP  and  character development.\n\nWe have a group of dedicated role players who strive to make the role playing experience as enjoyable, emotional, and powerful as possible.\n\nWe allow transformations for role players, a variety of races and custom races, and roles of divinity such as Kai, (although no canon characters.)\n\nCome and have a look and have fun, we have many dedicated role players who love the server!

As for post length, I am semi-literate/literate, and I typically write a few sentences per post depending on the scene, but at times can go as far as a couple of paragraphs. My post length tends to vary, but overall I do not mind what my partner's post size average is. I am in the EST time zone and would love it if I could find someone close to that time zone as well. I do have an original world set aside for this plot as well, and I hope to hear from you all soon! I am excited to make some new roleplay partners and possibly even a friend or two!",

So I'm looking for a male to play the role of the Alpha Werewolf in a pack setting.  My character is very rebellious and has a tendency to break the rules.  This in turn angers the Alpha and he decides to punish my character in a way he finds fitting....(To be discussed in DM's)\n\nI also want a story to go with this.  I imagine the Alpha character would also have a softer side that he doesn't show others and maybe in time my character would see that and fall for it.\n\nThis is just a rough idea I had.  I'm hoping with the right partner we can fluff this out into something bigger.  I'm not a stickler for post length.  I'm more quality over quantity.  I also understand if you can't post back immediately.  I have a life outside of RP and there are times where I won't be able to respond for hours at a time.  If it's anything over a day, I will let you know.  As I said before this will have smut and NSFW themes, but I don't want that to be the the whole story.  Please be willing to play other characters as introduced.  We can build the whole setting as we see fit.\n\nI'm a fan of OOC chat and bouncing plot idea off of each other, which is why I love Discord and their channels.  I'm OK with 1st or 3rd person writing, currently I do prefer 3rd.\n\nIf you have made it this far.  Send me a message and we can discuss some ideas and see if we would be a good fit for each other.  Thank you for your time.",

            "selftext": "Howdy, roleplayers! I'm on the search for a roleplay set in the Elder Scrolls universe. Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind, and all that. I just love everything about this setting, and have been re-reading an Elder Scrolls-themed webcomic, I'm starving for a roleplay set somewhere in Tamriel!\n\nIf you're not too familiar with the setting, that's alright, I can tell you about it. Just a warning: I may start nerding out. It's a great fantasy world, and we could have basically any kind of RP we want. Which is good because I'm flexible on genres. Wanna play an assassin rising through the ranks of the Dark Brotherhood? An Imperial noble who has to deal with Game of Thrones-esque court intrigue? A whole group of characters going on a D&amp;D-style adventure? A peaceful slice-of-life set in a little bucolic village? Or just going along a questline from one of the games? I'd be down for any of it! I don't have a set plot in mind, or a set character for myself. We can discuss about what we do beforehand, as I like talking with my partners OOC. We could each control our own character and share control of the rest, or you could play one character with me as the \"GM\", controlling the rest of the characters and world, or vice versa.\n\nAs for the tone of our RP, that's open for discussion too. I think it's best to establish that upfront. I'm very versatile with this too. I'm open for anything from a dark, depressing gorefest to a saccharine fairy tale full of sunshine and cuddles. Or, most usually, somewhere in between. I'm certainly open to romance in my RPs, but that's not at all necessary. As for more adult themes, I won't bring it up unless you tell me you're interested in having that in the RP. And please, let me know if there's anything that makes you uncomfortable that you wouldn't like to include in the story. The best roleplays are ones where the partners are transparent with each other. Personally, I'm hoping to find something long-term. I know not everyone is compatible when it comes to RPs, but if I can find even one person who is, it's all worth it.\n\nAnyway, time for the boring housekeeping stuff. I'm in the CST time zone, but you can be from anywhere. It doesn't matter to me, as I'm not usually available for hours-long stretches of back-and-forth roleplaying. Sorry if that's what you're hoping for. I can promise at least one response every day, though, and usually more. I'm not a stickler for reply length, and I'm hoping I can find a partner who understands that different situations call for different reply lengths. It's so goddamn intimidating when people ask for a \"3-4 paragraph minimum\" or something. There is a time for shorter replies, like when our characters are talking. I don't want to be pressured to write two paragraphs of filler about how the grass smells just because I'm afraid of making you mad. So please understand that. If you're interested in roleplaying with me, send over a PM! And please, say a little more than \"Hey, I'd like to RP!\" Like whether you want to focus on adventure or romance or something else, or any ideas you had for a character. Just anything that shows a bit of thought or enthusiasm, and I'll be a lot more likely to reply. We can keep the RP on PMs, or take it to Discord, or you can suggest somewhere else. Hope to hear from y'all!",

            "selftext": "The kingdoms of Veltara and Asalen have been at odds and on the verge of war for generations. The strife between the two stems from their opposing views on magic. In Veltara, magic is seen as a curse upon humanity and those who have the misfortune of being born with magic are seen as lepers among the Veltarans. Veltaran nobility place great pride in proclaiming how long they have maintained a magic-free bloodline, with the royal family tracing their \"purity\" back nearly  20 generations. Veltaran soldiers are fierce, efficient warriors often trained in the use of multiple combat and weapon styles, with the greatest among them earning the title of Weaponeer. Though they have never gone to war with Asalen, it is not uncommon to hear the claim that they would easily best any Asalenian battle-mage.\n\nTo the west of Veltara in Asalen, the view on magic is completely different. Here magic is viewed  no differently than any other science. Neither good nor evil, magic is a force used by many in the kingdom. However, even among Asalenians certain branches of magic are considered forbidden, in particular the use of necromancy and hemomancy are considered criminal acts. Asalenian battle-mages focus on the perfection of the mage-craft with the greatest of them earning the title of Warmancer.\n\nNow with the basic background for this world laid out here is what I had in mind for our roleplay. My character will be an Asalenian Warmancer, who has been sent with a message for the Veltaran nobility, warning of a group of bandits who have assaulted villages along the border of both kingdoms. Your character is a Veltaran Weaponeer, chosen to accompany me on my mission. Naturally our characters will initially be angry at having to work together but over the course of the roleplay they will become closer and grow to rely on and trust one another, perhaps even developing a romance.\n\nI prefer to post in either Discord or Google Docs.  I do my best to post daily, and generally multiple paragraphs at a time, but I do work full-time so if you are looking for someone who will write constantly through out the day than we may not work well together. If anything about this idea sounds appealing to you, or you have other ideas you\u2019d like to talk about feel free to PM me.",

I have built a secure cabin in remote woods, haven't seen a single human being since explosion. \n\nIt is a lonely world, but the will to survive trumps all other feelings. You stumble upon my compound, you also haven't seen another person. You are capable, not hungry, but could use a drink. You don't smell very pleasant, but that's an easy fix, just not important to you. \n\nI would like this to be a romance based roleplay, instant attraction, but mistrust for a long time at first, we are nervously trying to trust one another, eventually it will get better once we devide task and learn to live as a pair. \n\nThere will be sexual actions, I do not wish this to be all about that. Of course tension right off, but we keep feelings in check. You can describe your own character, based on whatever you like. \n\nI am in my 40's, you can be whatever age you choose, I am not particularly picky about that. I would like someone that can write a paragraph each reply, I do understand some situations may be shorter. \n\nThis will take place on this platform.",

So today I'm coming at you with a idea that I had just come up with, since that I have just recently gotten into the game Monster Prom that's where it all begins! So please read and see if your interested! \n\nSo M/C samantha had just transferred to the monster school and heaven forbid in the middle of prom season!! And as the rules go there we've only got 3 weeks find a date and make them fall for you!. Samantha being a very cute and petite yet trouble maker and silly and clueless vampire girl steals the hearts of many boys at the school without even meaning too or trying..yet she just wants to be friends with most of them..but these boys won't let that stop them they will try all their hardest to win her heart..and maybe she will fall for them too..who knows..anything can really happen in 3 weeks before prom..what will happen? \n\nAnd that's it! For now! If you've gotten this far I just want to thank you for your interest in my prompt. Anyway as you read on the total I need a male literate partner to play any of the boys who might want to win her heart, Scott , Damian etc.. so please before choosing please know how to write more than 5 sentences and know the character!. And that's all I'm hoping to find an interesting and wonderful partner! \n                                                         Thank you",

            "selftext": "With trying to think of a  roleplay idea, I wanted to do one with a tad bit of a supernatural twist to it and had then came up with this idea.\n\nIn short the premise is that one day after getting lost in a forest and coming across an old abandoned shrine, my character had also came across a girl with fox ears and many tails laying on the ground in a weakened and possibly dangerous state. With a bit of hesitation and thought, he decides to bring her back to his home in hopes of trying to heal her and regain her strength. After waking it, it is revealed that the girl is a kitsune from a forgotten period in Japan and had slowly lost her strength due to losing prayers and also just being forgotten about along with thanks to the lack of offerings to the shrine with its location being forgotten too. So having no where to go, my character decides to take her in in hopes of helping the kitsune in some form along with just giving her home and food.\n\nNow the roleplay itself could be a slice of life one with it just going about the daily life of the two or it could also go the route of having action thanks to adding malevolent things like just people or youkai.\n\nFor myself, I do best with writing in third person and at least a paragraph for replies. And though not needed, I find it more fun to play more than one character but that one is up to you.\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",

            "selftext": "**Reddit PM ONLY** No other apps are acceptable, please don't send Reddit chat request. \n\nI am an adult female, seeking a fun and dedicated adult male role play partner.\n\nI am from the United States, Central time zone. I usually play between 7am and 5pm weekdays and weekends. I am looking for someone that can play in those houses **DAILY**.\n\nIf you have to go for a couple of hours or need to be off, let me know! I will do the same in return.  An estimated time of return is a good thing. Simple communication is all I ask.\n\nDid I mention playing on the weekends? That is a thing. \n\nI play in first person, make random typos sometimes grammar mistakes happen. I am not looking for perfection, just someone with some imagination, a sense of humor and loves a good apocalypse. \n\nI will play the main two female characters, not helpless bimbos. I can also play some random bad guys and generate story to keep this fun. \n\nSome shooting and looting, exploring the apocalyptic world....Maybe some romance and some NSFW fun when the time comes. \n\nThere will be a twist about my characters....They are not human, not zombies either. I will use some legitimate sounding backstories for them if you decide you want to jump into this with me.\n\nI like to play hard all day...The communication thing goes both ways, as long as I am not waiting around for hours, thinking I might get a reply while I could be doing other things I am good. \n\nI am not formal at all, just playing like this is real, really happening in the moment and read the reply my partner sends before I make my reply, taking your input into every decision I make. \n\n____________________________________\n\n\n\nThe zombie apocalypse happened! It started about a month ago, worldwide. The infected were spreading it like wildfire, at first it was hard to tell who was infected until the tried to munch on you. \n\nThe infection was deliberate, secret societies and the elite are all safe in their bunkers. Population reduction. With automation and technology what they are now, the working classes are just a burden. Overpopulation and pollution are killing the planet.\n\nNow that the zombies have been roaming around for a while, attracted to sound, movement, they are pretty easy to spot. Dirty and gross, a wild look in their eyes. They will eat most anything. They also go by sense of smell. The infected don't attack each other.\n\nNeeding supplies is the biggest issue, having to go out to gather what you can when you can. Living alone when this all started has been a good thing for you since this started, not having anyone close to you that would turn and attack you was the key to your survival. Trusting just yourself.\n\nOne of the sucky things, the power grids are all offline. No online gaming that you used to enjoy, no Netflix...No TV or human contact at all. Cars still start, can power devices with them....But, the roads are jammed with abandoned cars, the engine sounds attract the zombies. \n\nBefore the complete loss of control, the Military forces of the world bombed most all of the major cities with conventional ordinance to try to contain most of the mass mobs of the infected. \n\n*That was the official story.* It was actually to get rid of the crumbling infrastructure and bury the dead along with it, let nature take those areas back. \n\nLucky for you, you live in a smallish town. \n\nThe bad side of it is, you have not seen an uninfected person for almost two weeks and that guy to a few shots at you. He didn't want to be friends. It is starting to get really lonely and super depressing. \n\nSurviving is just that, it isn't really living, what are your options at this point? Being dead doesn't really seem like a good thing right?\n\nToday, you are out, scavenging supplies from a normal neighbor hood not far from what you call home now, being all ninja, not seeing anything moving around YET! As you work your way to some houses you have not searched yet, you start to hear voices, female, laughing and talking to each other. \n\nThere is a wooden privacy fence around a back yard...As you get closer you can tell that is where the voices are coming from. \n\nTrying to catch a peek through the slats of the fence you can see two females sitting in the middle of the backyard, one has long black hair, the other really long pink hair and holding a book she is trying to read while her friend is annoying her playfully. \n\nThey seem unconcerned about anything...Because they don't have to be!",

Currently we have 3 people and would like just a few more. We are all in our late teens, so I ask that you be 16 or older please. \n\nIf you're interested, read below:\n\nWe have a couple rules for whoever decides to join.\n-You have to be able to write in 3rd person, literate. \n-You have to be SOMEWHAT consistent. I'm a very busy person, so if you can answer a few times a day that's just fine. \n-you DONT need to write 1029339 paragraphs every time you respond. Maybe a paragraph or a few sentences will do, but try to be somewhat descriptive. \n-be friendly! We want to make friends here too.\n\nAnd finally, if you havent left yet, we need someone who can play an OC. And I'd like to see them before you do. We are striving to keep our OCs as balanced as possible, and not OP. Because when your character is over powered, it doesnt make the rp fun for anyone else. \n\nThank you for reading! PM me with your OC or ask any questions that youd like down in the comments!",

            "selftext": "110 A.D. is the year, and the Roman Empire has expanded its borders as far as they will ever extend. It encompasses over 6 million square miles and 70 million people. Emperor Trajan, dubbed *Optimus Princeps* (\"the best ruler\")  by the Senate, currently rules. It is the era of *Pax Romana*, with peace and prosperity resounding throughout the Empire. \n\nIn Neapolis, a bustling port city, stands the ludus of Marcus Augustus. Augustus has made vast profit from the many games taking place around the empire, and yet still seeks to swell his fortune to an even greater extent.  With a storied history and prestigious reputation for producing some of the best gladiators Rome has ever known, his ludus is most certainly fit for the task. \n\nHowever, Fortuna has recently seen fit to douse his growing efforts with a bout of great affliction. Marcus\u2019 champion, Atillius, and a number of his other famed gladiators were overcome by great sickness, with many, including his champion, succumbing to death. The gladiators that remained were disfigured or weakened beyond use in the arena, and Augustus had no choice but to rid his hands of them at auction. This tribulation did not weaken the Dominus\u2019s resolve, though. It had much the opposite effect, in fact. Still sitting on a comfortable sum of aurei and denarii, it was time for him to begin rebuilding a suitable class of gladiators. Of course, he would need a new champion as well. Not to mention, whispers and rumors were beginning to circle of Emperor Trajan\u2019s plans to hold one of the greatest games the Empire had ever seen in a year\u2019s time. \n\nSo there Marcus Augustus sat, dutifully planning out the months to come. The coastal breeze blew foggy mist across the city and up the small mountain the ludus sat upon, giving its great marble walls an ominous and imposing atmosphere. It was these walls your character now looked up at, pushed through the crowded streets, flanked by guards and lined up with a number of other captured slaves.\n\n Will they be up to the task of becoming a gladiator/gladiatrix? Perhaps even resolve to climb the ranks and claim the title of the champion of Neapolis? Or will they take a different path entirely?\n\n[OOC]\n\nHey there! First, a couple of things I wanted to touch upon regarding the starter above. First of all, I am not an expert on Ancient Rome and I most certainly do not expect you to be one. The starter is also intentionally open-ended, so whatever interesting idea you have for a character, I'd be happy to hear you out!\n\nSecond, a couple of specifics about how and where I prefer to RP. I can handle both pages-long and paragraph-long replies, so either one you prefer works for me. I write in the third person. Frequency of replies isn't really important to me, within reason. While this starter isn't smut based and wouldn't be affected if it was excluded, I'm happy to write it if its something you would like to eventually included. That said, I'd prefer if my RP partner was a female in that scenario. As for where, I like to use discord, email, anything- just let me know what is easy for you.\n\nAnd finally, a little bit about myself. I live in the EST timezone, and available at a variety of times throughout the day. I do not write professionally and I am not formally educated in terms of fiction composition, so please excuse any mistakes or other missteps in terms of plot or story. \n\nIf you are interested, please send me a Reddit PM.",

Done...it'd be a ghost town thought...and that was the problem, what you had gained back in your body...you had lost what you had as a human... you couldn't interact with your friends like you could before... you had no one to lean on when the PTSD hit you... it was *Lonely*.\n\n\nAs you were staring at the blue explosion, thats where you saw it... the black chasis... standing on the hill behind the Second Suns forward assualt base...it was looking down at the field, its eyes... it wasnt an AI, it wasnt a mech... it had to be... you begged that it was... Another Gladiator.\n\n\n****End Plot Starter****\n\nHello Everyone\n\n*THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!*\n\nIf you got this far and read the whole post, im a honestly grateful, i literally sat down for a solid 3 hours writing this on my computer, thinking on how i could come up with a new RP... and then i thought of Gen-Lock, and im like, how can i put a interesting and dark twist on this... and then i got it... and the result is what you see above.\n\nIf you would love to explore this more, feel free to DM, im still getting everything together such as reference pictures for the Chasis's and all that, so bare with me if i havent found them when you DM.\n\nBut yea... my platforms are Kik, Discord &amp; Reddit, however i really do think it'd be best to use discord for this cos of the size of the RP so yea...\n\nAgain thanks for reading my post.\n\nHave an awesome day \ud83d\ude01",

            "selftext": " **This will be a persistent request. If you see it up some time after it's been posted, feel free to contact me on it. Until my tastes change through a different post, this one may be followed up on at your leisure.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\nI am 33 come May, East Coast United States (EST/EDT), and I work a full time job during the week. I love RP when I can get it, and there's been a bit of a dry spell lately that's been going on since the holidays (yes, even now 3 months later, there's still been a dry spell). I am seeking to change that.\n\n*Please don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you may ask? Look below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (**Medieval (vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era**), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC, **Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and Fire, Harry Potter, Vikings, The Last Kingdom**; others need ask. But PLEASE ask me on the possibility of playing canon characters from these shows. There is no guarantee I may be able to play what you want. Feel free to ask on others!)\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me. Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art.\n\nI favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. Give me the romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that know what this means will get it :) ). I also enjoy players who like to talk OOC.\n\n***The catch?***\n\nPlease, please, please be someone who can RP and talk on a daily or near-daily basis. This is a big request. I will understand if you let me know of anything in a timely manner! Also, be sure to check Discord at times. It LOVES to screw with notifications.\n\nAnd one last thing...please be someone that doesn't let much bother them or likes blocking for small or stupid things. Be someone who is open to a lot, and doesn't let much bother them, and we'll get along easily!\n\n*Special Note: I am meeting too many ghosters lately. If you don't want to talk after a single session, find your guts and say something. I give everyone I meet a week to get back to me if IRL stuff happens, then I move on. All I ask is you let me know something so I can give you some time to catch up or so I can move on.*\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours. I apologize for the long winded post, but it's the best I can do. Any interested folks who PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!",
