The Virus has acted by inflicted everyone within that district and is slowly spreading out across the continent in a slow and painful manner - it affects humans, wolves, bears, and dogs.   \n\n\nIt acts by reanimating the brain of the recently deceased and takes approximately two days for the body to be up and moving.   \n\n\nIf you're interested, let me know!",

Long time roleplayer here, and for the time being, I'm looking to find potential partners who are interested in roleplaying in the Goblin Slayer universe.  \n\n\nI'm open to both using in-universe characters, and original ones, so long as they are in the confines of the setting/world. Ideally, I'm looking for an adventure style of story here, akin to the premise of most of the show/manga's episodes. - Goblins or other similar ilk of monsters causing trouble at X place, go ahead and investigate, and deal with the situation.  \n\n\nGenerally speaking, I am fine with NSFW content, as well as romantic plot lines, but they are not crucial whatsoever, so if you're not up for that bis - It's perfectly fine.  \n\n\nIf you're at all interested, shoot me a PM with your Discord tag, or any questions/dilemmas you may have, and I'll try my best to get to it ASAP. Once we get in touch, we can discuss the structure of the roleplay in greater detail together.  \n\n\nA big thank you to all who have read my post, I hope it's interested you, and I wish you a good day!",

You begin as a brand new recruit, and it\u2019s up to you to decide how you\u2019ll carve your name into the concrete streets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExplore New Antetime, a metropolis mirroring cities you know and love with residential project districts, financial centers, and sprawling commercial malls. Or, go to any of the three other cities surrounding it, all of which have their own unique spin to what a city is made of and where it can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake on different missions for Succubus Wing. These\u2019ll require you to chase the gang\u2019s enemies, flex the riches you get from the dark underworld of crime, and even help out the community whose misfortune gave rise to the gang to begin with. You\u2019ll even have the opportunity to meet, albeit with some friction, the major gangs of the other cities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a Succubus, you get the opportunity to rise through the ranks of the gang and become the gangbanging devil you\u2019re meant to be. Earn Succubucks, the organization\u2019s currency, and exchange it for more power and prestige.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside the roleplay itself, the server\u2019s management makes getting into the action easy with a simple sheet which merely requires a list of abilities, and lax rules which expand creativity while ensuring a safe and fun environment for participants. There are also bots to play with during downtime, and simple chatting servers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, put on your heaviest chain, pull your rifle out from under your pillow, and join the Street Gods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://discord.gg/uTVPznS",

It's a very simple concept of four heroes called to save a world from destruction, gifted with legendary weapons to do so. Knowledge of the series not required! \n\nThe plot can be as close or as far from the Canon storyline as we like! The rules of the forum, plot line, etc, will all be a communal effort!\n\nI find that small roleplay groups are the premier roleplay experience, and am very excited to recruit some top tier roleplayers to join me on this quest! I hope to create a casual group of friends that has a great time together roleplaying. \n\nIf you are interested, please send me a PM!",

It's something else. Some people might call it Fate but I know them and it wasn't their fault.

Inside you are the embers of an ancient legend. Maybe a god from an ancient civilization, maybe a legend told over centuries, maybe a monster that's kept people up at night since before recorded history. Either way, you've got a Mythos inside you and the Mist don't like that much. It hides that part of you from yourself and even the world around you. It makes people forget strange things that have happened around you. It makes people see mundane things that didn't really happen to cover extraordinary things that did.*  \n\n\n*One day though, you'll wake up to that power inside you and find yourself in a whole new world. I'll be here to greet you but I can't promise I'll be able to help much, try as I might. There are many more powerful Rifts than me but maybe power ain't all it's cracked up to be.*  \n\n\nAlright!

Roleplay really gets my creative juices flowing and helps me escape my writers block, and is honestly just a really good way to escape from real life. i prefer to roleplay with guys just because it\u2019s a really good counter role for the types of females i like to \u201cpretend\u201d to be. \n\ni prefer long based roleplaying, where it\u2019s more than just one sentence written per \u201cpost\u201d i guess? \n\ni\u2019m really into supernatural based roleplay a, dramas are my absolute favorites though. i love a partner i can brain storm with!! \n\npreferred means of communication: i\u2019m not a big fan of reddit\u2019s messaging system, so i prefer snapchat,discord or imessage.\n\ni really don\u2019t want to be ghosted! i\u2019d love to get to know you and possibly form a friendship, but for now i\u2019d prefer to strictly roleplay. \n\nplease message me if you\u2019re down to brainstorm or if you already have a great plot decided!!! thank you all so much!",

Feel free to message me with any prompt not included here or alter the one I have. Im looking for a good mix of Action/Adventure. With romance being optional. \n\nA young Ranger is assigned to the princess' protection detail to a dangerous part of the world. With this being his first assignment and her first major trip out of the safety of the capital. Tensions rise about the best way to handle situations here in this war torn land. \n\nIm looking to discuss with you, how long they've known each other, why she's visiting the place she is, and why the place is so dangerous.

I\u2019m going to let you know I\u2019m patient enough to let you go at your own speed, to let you find your comfortable pace and place in the story.\n\nI\u2019m looking for long term partners, (Ideally, that means up to 2 weeks, though that doesn't mean every day). I really expect some growth and communication between us. If you\u2019re going to be absent, or need a break to catch up with your life? Please tell me and don\u2019t leave me hanging.\n\nI\u2019m going to let you know- if you\u2019re looking to jump right into smut, that's not happening. Anything close to intimate scenes happens after our characters know each other well enough to be comfortable (So probably 4\\~5 sessions).\n\nI\u2019m in the mood for fan stuff- The Elder Scrolls. Original Characters preferred, Elven ladies especially!  If you want to play a custom or modded race, you\u2019re more than welcome to.\n\nSet at any point before, during, or after the game of Skyrim, though we can set it literally anywhere on the Continent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I ask of you-\n\nInclude your Time Zone (I'm CDT)\n\nInclude a name I can call you for OOC, (real names need not apply)\n\nA character is good to have, though you can make a fresh one on the spot. I can send you my character sheet if you'd like a look at what mine look like.\n\nFirst Person perspective.\n\nAn understanding that this is a long term roleplay, with genuine connections between characters, not a short term fling.\n\nAnd really wanting to enjoy a collaborative story telling experience :)\n\nI am 18+ and all participants *and their characters* must be 18+ \\[Don't even try me on this\\]",

I started to think of her as my little sister. \n\nOn my eighteenth birthday, her parents died, and she became an heiress to billions. She was shipped across the country to her only relative - an aunt, and I lost all contact with her. \n\nFive years later, I get an assignment rumored to be one of the worst assignments.

            "selftext": "**General Theme and Feel of the Roleplay**\n\nFor the longest while, I\u2019ve been looking for a roleplay that will pull my heartstrings and let me experience two soulmates falling in love. I want the roleplay to be emotional and raw. People usually expect the roleplay to be a little sappy when I say it like that, but honestly, I want it to be about their personal journeys. I\u2019m not saying that it won\u2019t be a little sappy at times, but I also want it to be sad when our characters struggle, fail and make mistakes.  I want our characters to experience highs and lows because we\u2019re playing out lives of characters that are real to us. They don\u2019t always succeed in whatever they want to accomplish because they\u2019re only human.  I want to see how they walk through their lives together. I want to be able to experience moments in their life that allow us to cry, laugh, smile, cheer and truly feel for these characters on a personal level. I want this roleplay to be a character drama and a slice of life romance that truly grabs my heart and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\n**Plot &amp; Setting**\n\nI don\u2019t have a fixed plot or setting that I want to try since I\u2019d like to be able to discuss it with my partner. I do have a lot of ideas though, but it\u2019s really all up for discussion.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThis is definitely something I think my partner and I should spend a lot of time on. I want to make sure our characters have great chemistry. They should have an interesting dynamic, and they should be able to build off each other. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll always get along. Fighting, arguing and going through hardships is what makes things fun. I want to have a good balance. I do want them to feel like real people after all. I would prefer to play with an older female character.\n\n**Closing Notes**\n\nI believe half the fun is a good roleplaying partner. Being able to talk and enjoy each other\u2019s company is a great part of roleplaying. It\u2019s cooperative storytelling, and that\u2019s what I love about it. Plus, it helps build friendships, so I\u2019m definitely up to chat, discuss the roleplay and simply just spend time together as we fanboy/fangirl about our characters. If you're not into being friends and enjoying each other's company on top of role-playing, you should probably move on to someone else.\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far and you\u2019re interested in roleplaying with me, please, send me a message! I\u2019m excited to go on this journey with you. \n\nI'm heading off to bed as I post this, so I'll reply to all of you when I get up!",

My requirements are 18+ as I am and would like my rp partner to be the same, literate and able to keep up a good word count. I understand there are exceptions I just don't want text talk or responses that are only two lines. If either plot, which I will describe below, interests you PM me and we can discuss details. I am ok with romance in either, but only MxF and if it doesn't feel forced.\n\nGladiator \nThis plot has a lot of wiggle room as far as the details go. The central idea is my character is a gladiator in a multiversal collesium where warriors across dimensions come for the thrill of battle, glory, profit, or for some to hone their skills. You're character could be another gladiator from any number of dimensions or possibly a benefactor of the collesium where my character acts as their champion to represent them in combat. This will obviously include fantasy elements like magic and the like and if we want there could be scifi elements as well since there is the whole infinite multiverse  to being warriors from.\n\nReformed Barbarian\nAgain this plot has room to change in order to fit preferences. The main idea is my character is an infamous barbarian mercenary coming to your town for whatever reason. Maybe he was hired to wipe it out or maybe he is just passing through either way it would be up to your character to ensure he does not wreck the place.",

            "selftext": "A little over 22 years ago, a great pirate owned the sea, living life to its fullest as he and his crew did whatever they wanted and whenever they wanted. This all stopped when the World Government\u2019s Marines came along, capturing the Pirate King and sentencing him to death. However, just before he died the Pirate King spoke his last words, screaming them to the Heavens, telling all that he had hid his treasure, the One Piece, at the end of the Grand Line, and encouraged all to seek it out.\n\nThis has sparked the interest of many a generation, encouraging people to go out and become pirates to claim riches for themselves, creating \u2018The Great Pirate Age\u2019.\n\nSo for those of you who don\u2019t know, this roleplay is inspired by One Piece, the popular manga/anime of the same name, however you don\u2019t need to know anything about One Piece.\n\nNow what am I looking for? Well I\u2019m hoping to find a partner that wants to sail the seas with me as a pirate, adventuring from island to island, raising our bounties as we go and forming a mighty crew. More details can be discussed over messages.\n\nNow for writing style, I am pretty easy on this, I don\u2019t mind if we roleplay 1st or 3rd person and I don\u2019t mind about your post length as long as I\u2019m able to reply to it.\n\nI hope this post has interested you and if so please shoot me a message.",

Overall, I write in third-person, past tense, and usually stick between a solid paragraph to several depending on the forum. Kik and Discord are my general platforms of choice, but if a case can be made for somewhere else, then I may consider it.\n\nI'm a sucker for a good romance with dynamic characters wherein I write a strong female antagonist. If you're looking to write a basic character without goals or desires of their own, I'm likely not the one to write with as I don't enjoy one-sided story-telling or stories without any development or forward motion among the characters. Even trashy romance stories have room for depth. \n\nMy only real hesitation when writing is SciFi - I'm newer to the genre and while I can manage superheroes, when you start getting into robots and AI, I'm at a loss. \n\nIf you have an idea and want to build something, feel free to reach out. \n\nA.",

            "selftext": "Hi, everyone. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for years now, and since I write stories on my own, I\u2019d say my literacy level is pretty decent. I\u2019m looking for open-minded people who have an interest in my listed fandoms, as well as people who can keep up with Lit - Adv. Lit roleplays. \n\nThe number of partners I\u2019ve had has dwindled over the years and i am currently down to two consistent partners and one or two other inconsistent ones that i rarely see. Everyone else I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting on this subreddit, either becomes a small-time partner, doesn\u2019t work out, or they ghost. If I\u2019m looking for anything in a partner, it\u2019s definitely someone who can be honest about their feelings, thoughts and opinions without just getting up and leaving. \n\nSorry for the lengthy introduction, let me discuss everything I\u2019m interested in doing and what I\u2019m looking for :\n\nPartner: As I said, an open-minded person, preferably someone who plays F characters or both F and M characters. Typically I like doing straight MxF pairings, where I play M. Canon character or OC depends on the plot itself. I have a lot of free time and hope to find someone like that as well, but i don\u2019t mind somebody who is busy, either. Someone who is okay with NSFW themes would be preferred as well, as I don\u2019t shy away from gore/violence and or dirty scenes. \n\nTypes of roleplays: Romance, action, adventure, tragedy, science fiction/fantasy, AU\u2019s, etc.\n\nFandoms: \n\n\u2022 Dragon Maid. \n\n\u2022 Re:Zero.\n\n\u2022 Undertale/Deltarune.\n\n\u2022 Steven Universe. \n\n\u2022 Watamote. \n\n\u2022 League of Legends. (AU.)\n\n\u2022 Kill La Kill.\n\n\u2022 Adventure Time. \n\n\u2022 Overwatch.\n\n\u2022 Edd Ed n Eddie.\n\n\u2022 Invader Zim. \n\n\u2022 Mass Effect.\n\n\u2022 Dark Souls. (AU.)\n\n\u2022 Goblin Slayer.\n\n\u2022 Spider-Verse. \n\n\u2022 Tanya the Evil.\n\n\u2022 Doki Doki. \n\n\u2022 My Hero Academia. \n\nThese are the fandoms I\u2019m currently interested in roleplaying. I know many games, movies, anime, etc \u2014 So if you don\u2019t see something you typically do, feel free to ask me. I look forward to your messages and hope to find lengthy, worthwhile partners whom I can also be friends with. Thank you for reading.",

            "selftext": "The Fantasy Sandbox is a collaborative, medieval-fantasy story writing and world-building game in which all players have an equal input to the story and its effectively crowdsourced setting. This creates a unique, community-designed but cohesive roleplaying world and experience that allows a vast number of different fantasy themes in one place. You can play as any character or race--a king, a knight, an adventurer, a petty criminal, a mastermind villain, a commoner, a wizard or mage, a dragon, a fairy, you name it, provided they are presented in a medieval fantasy theme. Every character has a unique role and contribution to the game. In this freeform roleplaying setup, players create all the civilizations, stories, characters, and world geography within a casual rule set that maintains balance. As a result, interwoven stories emerge. The game world depends on that very emergence and has been developing its identity from a completely blank slate over the course of two years.\n\nThere's no telling who of the many currently active characters you'll meet or where you'll go. Player-designed factions have formed kingdoms, player-written quests drive entire adventures, and politics shape the land.\n\nThis has always been an open community game. If you like to roleplay in medieval-fantasy themes, we invite you to join us in helping maintain our novel continuum alive with new characters, plots, and settings!\n\n[***http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction***](http://thefantasysandbox.boards.net/thread/5/introduction)  \n[***https://discord.gg/cb5n63C***](https://discord.gg/cb5n63C)",

            "selftext": "Hopefully this post finds you doing well. I\u2019m going to start off with a bit of what I\u2019m looking for with this post before getting into myself, since I don\u2019t want to go and waste anyone\u2019s time with reading the whole thing. If, by the end, you think you are still interested, then please send me a DM here on reddit and we can exchange some more contact info.\n\nLike the title says, I\u2019m looking for a someone to write with. Some particular things I\u2019m searching for\u2026\n\nFantasy/Science Fiction are strongly preferred.\n\nI\u2019m specifically looking for someone over 21 who is comfortable with mature and NSFW themes. \n\nSomeone with experience writing and telling stories.\n\nI hate to use the term \u2018literate\u2019 in posts like these. I mean, if we are here and reading this\u2026We are all literate to some degree. But, I\u2019m looking for someone descriptive. Who likes to fill a page with detail. I want to be able to step into a room with the characters and learn about it as they do. Does the misshapen leg of the tavern chair wobble as its sat upon? Or does the light from the fire not stretch across the entirety of the large room, leaving the corners shadowed and foreboding? Does the smell of stale smoke cling to the furniture still, or does the uncertain odor of whatever is cooking back in the kitchens cover it up? Now, I\u2019m not trying to say every single detail of every single location needs to be fleshed out and defined\u2026But, I think a little bit can go a long way in terms of bringing the story to life.\n\nAnother aspect I\u2019m looking for is the desire to create a world. I love telling stories in an original setting which both writers can shape and form. There are settings I have used in the past that I would love to share and have another writer help grow. But, I wouldn\u2019t mind starting fresh with something new. I think learning and developing the story of a place can be as interesting as the story of the characters built to inhabit it. Places and peoples have culture and histories to explore and interact with. \n\nAs for the characters themselves and the story they share, I\u2019d say I\u2019m very open. I tend to play one character as a main and take up the role of side characters and \u2019NPCs' as often as needed. The far ranging, epic adventure can be just as interesting as a small-scale tale of survival and braving a hostile environment. \n\nSo, that\u2019s a bit about all the stuff I\u2019m looking for with this post. Hi! Glad you stuck around this far. I\u2019m Peter, I\u2019m 26, and I\u2019ve been roleplaying through either online MMOs, D&amp;D, and other mediums for a bit over a decade now. I work a normal job, so I\u2019m busy during the day on any given weekday. I\u2019m a big fan of back and forth posting when time permits, and so I generally tend to get most of my RP in during the late evenings. That\u2019d be like 9PM CST onwards. \n\nIf you have any ideas you want to throw at me, or any interest in talking at all, please go ahead and send me a DM on reddit. Tell me a bit about yourself and what it is you are really looking for when it comes to an RP.",

Running off for places and chores that he never goes to, or even places he names that don't even seem to exist! One day he claims he's going off to \"The Nexus\", a place he says he goes to all the time, and after following him into an alleyway you see him entering a portal on the wall of the alley. He hops through, and just as it's about to close you manage to hop in and are greeted by Collan, who is acting rather sheepish since there are several men and women around him who are all looking down at you with curious stares. With what appears to be a half-baked excuse he claims that you are his \"Girlfriend\" and \"Long time Lover\". They all buy it and dismiss his sheepish nature, as though in awkward situations these things were to be expected. He leads you to his room, apologizes with such a nervous sounding voice and body language, and tells you that he can't get you back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a nice little prompt for an RP, basically a world-travelling mage who goes between timelines seeking out relics accidentally picks you up and is forced to look after you due to his mistake. Of course this is romance, being stuck with someone you can tolerate for long enough can blossom into beautiful love, although with him it seems like it could be just him being needy for hugs and kisses.

(1 - Blood makes me squeamish, 5 - I like Saw, 10 - I watch Cannibal Holocaust with the kids).\n\n*I will accept multiple answers for these questions.\n\n~~~~~\n\nRules for the Role:\n\n1.] No matter the role, you have to play multiple characters. A minimum of two, one being male, one being female. However many you want, it doesn't make as much a difference as some think. This is the base line for simple character creation in the role.\n\n2.] You have to play in Third Person.\n\n3.] You have to have some sort of dedication to the roleplay. This isn't meant to be a one-'n-done situation. This is an actual, full-length STORY.\n\nI'm very open and willing to discuss, if there's something that bothers you or if something is against what you typically would be comfortable doing, let me know and we can work something out.",

            "selftext": "I don't want to go into too much detail simply because the RP may vary depending on my partners wants. However, I am going to say a few general things to get them out of the way.\n\n1. I'd like to play out a Game of Thrones story with a decent writing partner. I only ask that you be creative and contribute to furthering the story as much I do.\n\n2. I'd like to roleplay on here if possible. I don't really like to share any extra information with people until I know they're at least somewhat decent, however, I'll make an exception for email if you absolutely cannot play here.\n\n3. This is not a smut roleplay. Intimate scenes can certainly happen and I'm not opposed to it, but I'd like it to be plot driven more than anything else.\n\n4. I'd like us to play already existing characters, but OC's are fine. However, I will tell you ahead of time that I will probably be playing a character from the show.\n\n5. Continuing from number 4. I do prefer we play characters from the show, but it would be in more of a what if scenario for the story. I obviously don't want to just replay what has already happened on the show. I want to write our own version of the story. One where different characters find different fates and such.\n\n6. I have not read the books. Shoot me. I plan on reading them, but I haven't yet. So if that is going to deter you, feel free to stay away.\n\n7. As the title suggests, this is for absolutely anyone. I'll play out storylines with any other fan out there. I don't care if you're female, male, or anything in between. And if you're a male that wants to play female or vice versa, feel free. Just let me know.\n\n8. Because this will be longterm, I don't expect quick replies. Take as much time as you need. But, if you think that it may take you longer than just a few days before you can get back to me, please tell me.\n\n9. I'm not going to be mad about post length unless you come at me with a one-liner. Please do your best to be a little bit descriptive. I'm not the best at writing, but I can still put out at least one paragraph per post. (This won't apply all the time. Sometimes a conversation between characters might be quick responses of dialogue back and forth, but I expect you to know when it would be appropriate for that.)\n\n10. Let's have fun. I want this to be an enjoyable experience for my partner and I. I want us to fulfill every scene we've ever imagined for this awesome series.\n\nOverall, I'm open to anything so long as it pertains to Game of Thrones. So shoot me a message and we can start discussing our characters and what kind of adventure they might take part in. And even if this post is months old, message me anyway. I'll play with anyone and everyone that enjoys GoT.",

Plenty of ideas actually. Seeing as the TV Show itself is geared more twords a younger audience, im looking for more adult themes such as what a human mind can actually be capable of, not just simple negative emotions like jealousy. Instead of just Miraculous, there are evil versions that can prey on the human psyche and turn them into actual evil, wanting nothing more than wanton destruction. Of course we wouldnt be complete without young adult angst over balancing superhero life over civilian life. Let me know if you are interested at all or have any ideas you want to share!",

It can be literally anything, or if you\u2019d like, we can reverse the roles. \n\nThe baseline would be that our characters spend all of their time together basically, so they end up getting really close. Do they become best friends for life? Fall in love? We\u2019ll figure it out. \n\nMessage me if you have any good ideas! Looking forward to hearing from you!",

First and foremost, partner-wise: I'd like somebody who does third person past tense, although that's not a requirement by any means. For reply length, I'll be happy as long as you put your heart into it! A quality reply doesn't have to be super long. I'm in the EST time zone and work during the day Sunday through Thursday most weeks, so my replies will be much faster on the weekends! \n\nI have one premise that I'd really like to try today: in a medieval fantasy world, I'd play a mage that takes on your character as an apprentice, and I teach you to the best of my abilities. We can talk out fine details over Kik or Discord (either is fine with me, so ask for your pick), such as how the characters meet, and we can do some world building at the same time. \n\nIf that doesn't tickle your fancy, don't worry! I have some other ideas I can pitch depending on your likes, or you can bring any ideas of your own. Ill.be happy to give really anything a try, I'm not too picky!  I'm also kind of interested in a group roleplay, but I've never really dipped my toes into groups before. If you happen to be searching for new members, feel free to come talk to me about it!  \n\nIf I caught your attention, please pm me or start a chat! For one-on-one partners, tell me a bit about yourself in your first message; time zone, how long you've been roleplaying, etcetera. I think getting a feel for new partners is never a bad thing. Thanks for reading, hope to see you all soon!",

            "selftext": "Hello there! \n\nI'm going to try this again. It's been a while since my last request. I'm looking for MxM and MxNB roleplays. Your personal gender does not really matter, as long as you're friendly and patient. I prefer OC's, as I feel like I'm terrible at fandom Roleplays. But, if you ask, I will let you know what fandoms/characters I play.\n\nAnyways! I've recently had a ton of my characters become available again, and there are a few I miss playing as. My characters are all male that are either homosexual, bisexual, or pansexual. Their ages range from 16 to 24. Most of them are 17 or 18. Three of them are supernatural/fantasy beings; a dark/light elf mix, vampire, and a demon. And three of them deal with dark and sensitive topics. Aside from Zeke, who can see spirits and sprites and such, the rest are pretty normal humans.\n\nHere's a bit about me and my roleplay style. My time zone is CDT (Central Daylight Time), but I really don't mind what my partner's timezones is. I prefer my partners to be 18+, since I myself am 24. I write in 3rd person past tense, and would rather my partner do the same. I can't roleplay 1st or with others that do. It makes me uncomfortable. I usually write 3-4 paragraphs, but sometimes I write more than that. So, 3+ paragraphs please. \n\nNow, I do a few plots for certain characters, but that doesn't mean we have to do those plots. Coming up with plots together is completely fine with me! I don't mind mixing genres either, but I don't think I'm very good at sci-fi and medieval. I usually stick with romance, drama, angst, horror, and fantasy. Most of the time it's a mixture of all of these. With romance, however, it needs to be slow-burn. Or else I will lose interest almost immediately.\n\nIf you are interested, please message me and we can exchange Discord tags. And PLEASE do not ghost me. Let me know if you can't respond, or don't want to roleplay anymore! Anyways, hope to talk to you soon!",

Make allies and enemies, solve puzzles and search for buried treasure, and make your own story as a pirate!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mechanics are based on D&amp;D. You will be able to make a customized character with skills and weapons that provide different advantages for rolling. After you make a character, you can look for a crew and join a narrative or storyline. For now, because we're so few, there's only one crew to join, though hopefully in the future that will change, along with the addition of regular events or passive events like storms.\n\nFeel free to hop on if you're interested!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://discord.gg/XWMnejx](https://discord.gg/XWMnejx)",

The purity of the angels perfectly matched the viciousness of the demons, so the solution was simple; recruit a human.\n\nYour character led the angels through numerous victories and forced the demon generals back into their castle; their last defense before total annihilation. Behind these walls, it was rumored that the demons were creating a new weapon, a dangerous creature that could turn the tide of the war. They called it \u2018The Eighth Sin\u2019.\n\nIt was time for your character, and a warrior angel by their side to protect them, to infiltrate the castle to defeat the seven sins once and for all, and destroy the Eighth Sin, whatever that might be.\n\n- This is a \u2018game-master\u2019 roleplay, where I\u2019ll be playing all other characters but your character will be driving the narrative, and the world will be reacting to their decisions\n\n- Throughout the roleplay you\u2019ll be leveling stats and collecting items that help you whenever you\u2019re in combat (I\u2019m still experimenting with a turn-based system for that but it\u2019s not perfected now)\n\n- Because of the possible nsfw themes in this roleplay, I won\u2019t be roleplaying with anyone under the age of 18",

            "selftext": "The roof leaked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat just about summed up this tavern. Old, faithfully used, and second home to more than one local priest, it was still as good a place as any to lay low. The best part was, it was far away enough that most officials and soldiers wouldn\u2019t frequent it. Perfect for the three strangers placed in plain sight, hiding in a booth with water dripping off them like miniature waterfalls. The fire tried to warm them, but it could only do so much.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two taller, broader figures sat in quiet debate, sending verbal blows off each other\u2019s hide as they hissed words under their hoods, often shaking their heads. A third figure merely watched like a sentinel, taking in everything it saw. Smaller and visibly frail, she would occasionally glance up, looking around the tavern at it\u2019s patrons before being brought back to her table whenever the whispers got too loud. This time, her attention snapped back to the bulkier of her two companions, letting out a snort of laughter. \r\n\r\n\u201cI told you, no. She\u2019s the true heir to the throne, her cousin is a usurper. We both know that. But we shouldn\u2019t be going south!\u201d he hissed, bringing his tankard down on the table with a loud clunk. \u201cHer people are here! The lords are here! The king seized power in a palace coup, so the armies are undamaged! Gather support from lords,  build an army and march on the king!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich won\u2019t work.\u201d The other companion shot back, mildly annoyed as he ran a finger around d his bowl. \u201cI told you Boothe, he bought the lords with coin, of which we have none. They\u2019ll never support us now. We go south, gather resources and riches, then return home. Easy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBoothe spat on the floor, watching the hay soak it up as he shook his head. \u201cPah. The words of a chancellor. So we return at the head of a foreign army, an invasion, so everyone fights us! It\u2019s idiocy! It\u2019s...\u201d \r\n\r\nBoothe\u2019s voice died as he watched the heavy door at the front of the tavern swing open, revealing the night and the torrents of rain that lashed down. However, his flinty eyes were focused firmly on the figure that stepped over the threshold, fleeing the rain.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother traveller? Marshal, you don\u2019t have to examine them all.\u201d\r\n\u201cQuiet, Soren. This one is different. \u201c Boothe hissed back, observing. \u201cWatch him.\u201d\r\n\r\nSoren rolled his weary eyes under the hood and turned laboriously before he swallowed hard, instantly seeing precisely what Boothe had pointed out. The hoded stranger elegantly carried himself to the bar of the tavern, covered over almost completely by a heavy, dark blue cloak. Mud clung to the bottom of it, as well as holding on to his dark leather boots. Most curious of all, however, was the three bumps on his back, standing like three ridges. One of them ended in an ugly, misshapen lump, the other two ended in beautiful curves, as though they were enlarged shoulderblades. The stranger walked to the bar, every stem deliberate and elegant, before placing a pale, alabaster hand on the counter.\r\n\r\n\u201cFood. And a bed.\u201d He asked, not unkindly. When he spoke, it was clear, sharp and yet perfect. It felt like the voice of a Sergeant, more used to parade grounds and battlefields, had met with a midsummer dawn\u2019s chorus of birdsong.\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re full. Unless you fancy sleeping with the horses.\u201d The innkeeper grunted, unimpressed by the figure and the curious oddity he represented, before turning to signal to one if the serving girls for another supper to be brought out.\r\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Was the stranger\u2019s only reply, moving to an isolated table, sitting himself down. For the briefest second, the cloak slipped, revealing a flash of brilliant white, before it was swiftly hidden again. It had left an impression on the minds of everyone who witnessed it, however, and stood as an invitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn invitation that was accepted all too eagerly by one of the local drunks, lurching from table to the as he made his slow, lumbering way to the hunched figure.\r\n\u201cYou. Wossat on yer back?\u201d The stranger turned his head monotonously slow, careful not to lift it and reveal his face. \u201cPersonal items. The kind you have no wish to delve into.\u201d, He shot back, watching tirelessly. The drunk laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve got every wish, sonny. See, I thinks we got ourselves an angel. You know what we do to angels round these parts?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger stayed quiet for a moment, almost lost in thought. \u201cYou rip-\u201c\r\n\u201cWe rip their little wings off and burn the little bastards!\u201d, yelled the middle aged man, glaring at the stranger\r\n\u201c-Rip the wings off and burn them, yes. I thought so. You\u2019ll be pleased to know I\u2019m not an angel then.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe drunk growled and kicked the table, sending it careening to the centre of the room as he yelled, grasping the newcomer by the neck, spitting in his face as he yowled incomprehensively. Out of nowhere, then innkeeper was there, tugging the two apart as he held back the boarlike drunk, the stranger rising gracefully to his feet. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna gut you, little angel! I\u2019ll \u2018ave you screaming for abandoning us in the elder war! I\u2019ll smash yer face in!\u201d, howked the drunkard, to the raucous cries of most people, including Boothe. Many stood, booing the innkeeper as the newcomer walked to the door, pulling it open as a tankard crashed into the wall next to him. With a forlorn shake of his head, the door closed with a reverberating thump as somewhere, music started and people shouted defiance, or muttered curses.\r\n\r\nSoren frowned, glancing at the door warily. \u201cAn angel! I thought they\u2019d all been killed after the elder war, in all the pogroms and riots. But one in the flesh, two hundred years after the war?!\u201d He exclaimed, looking around the table as Boothe sneered. \r\n\u201cAngels... Pah. Even if he is one, he abandoned us. They all did. Filth. We need to kill it! They left us to die, watched as we stood tall, then cowered when we hunted them down and drove the bastards extinct!\u201d Boothe snarled, watching the door with malice written in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoothe...\u201d Soren whispered, watching the older man. \u201cThey were said to be flawless soldiers, and found a single demon no trouble. They were only hard pressed when facing hordes or grater demons, possibly even demon lords! If he joins us... We\u2019ll be able to return to the throne, all three of us...\u201d Soren watched his companions, Boothe glaring at Soren in disbelief.\r\n\u201cNo, we won\u2019t. Tonight, we\u2019ll kill the rat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n(Hey! So, guess what my character might be, and what humanity hates most! Anyway, if you fancy medieval/low fantasy, action, adventure, big battles, romantic affairs characters really shouldn\u2019t be having, and all that comes with it, drop me a line and we\u2019ll start planning! I\u2019m open to modifying the plot, too!)",

            "selftext": "  Stripped to her white Shirt and a pair of tight leather trousers, her sleeves rolled back and leather riding boots on her feet, Eleanor knew that this look would cause many of her friends in the city to possibly disown her. But none of that mattered as she moves slowly in the dawn air, her eyes darting over the man stood in front of her. Her concentration total as she lets her hand lower just a fraction of an inch. This simple motion was all the man needed to lunge forward to try his luck, this of course was expected and Eleanor dances back quickly and swiftly brings the cut and thrust sword up. Holding the point inline as she ducks. \n\n  The sickening wet crunch of her opponents body driving itself on to the point just below his rib cage echoed around the quiet field. His momentum carried him maybe 2 or three inches on to the sharp point before he realised he had been hit, the pinky red stain blooming across his white linen shirt as he falls, rushed to by his seconds and the doctor. Eleanor doesn\u2019t care A jot for this. Walking back to her own second she hands them the sword and mounts her horse riding back for home, the whole affair had taken all of 25 seconds.\n\nShe can\u2019t remember the man\u2019s name, she didn\u2019t care, she remembered the insult and that was enough for her to have come here this morning for the satisfaction she had demanded of him. She didn\u2019t know if she had killed him, and again she didn\u2019t care, he wouldn\u2019t be the first if he died. He wouldn\u2019t be the last either she was sure of that, her nature seemed to encourage these people to not take her seriously until they had been taught a lesson. \n\nFinally arriving home she looks around the entrance to the small townhouse and how empty it seemed. Widowed by the war Eleanor no longer wore her ring but the pain of her loss was still acute and this only added to her attitude and the nickname she had earned in high society when people thought she wasn\u2019t listening, lady nemesis, the person who would avenge any insult with violence.\n\nshe wouldn\u2019t suffer the fools who thought because she no longer had a man she was less than capable. She was the fighter and she was sure to make this known to anyone who crossed her, those who were coming for her husband\u2019s businesses now he was gone would find that them, and their wealth was defended, she could not inherit his lands and childless she had no one to pass it on to but she would make sure that as long as she lived they would be made to work for her and keep her in a manner she was accustomed. She had to fight hard to make sure of this. But fighting was what she did best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi All, something a little different to my usual faire but this is another prompt that I really love. Based on my love of the film the duellists as well as my interest in historical fencing and weaponry (an area of study from my university days) I thought I would write the idea around a woman who was trying to get by as a high society widow but also one who was far from the typical woe is me helpless woman of novels and films (god I hate that stereotype) but rather one who fights and argues and duels, so more of a woman trying to make her way in a mans world and all of the snootiness and problems that may bring. \n\nSo who are you ? an old friend? A new lover? I see this as a romance but also it is open to men and women but each taking on the role would affect the rp differently after all her own behaviour and then carrying on with a lesbian lover would cause more scandal than with a man but a man failing to rain in her personality may also cause friction in society, this is what I want to explore. \n\nI am looking for detailed rp and ideally something long term.\n\nI have left the period purposely vague in the prompt so we can fit it to a historical period or even fantasy settings as you desire to a degree but what this isn\u2019t really is an early medieval castles and kings type rp it is more high medieval/renaissance/regency style rp so bear in mind if you wish fantasy elements this is going to be much more the feel I was going for.\n\nSorry I know the above is a lot of information but unlike a lot of my prompts I have more of an Idea of what I want from this.\n\nDespite all this I hope to hear from you wonderful men and women, and anyone in between also though true trans play in this period may be a little more difficult to work in but that isn\u2019t to say we cant try. I am an equal opportunity roleplayer so message me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis is obviously a mature rp and requires all to be 18+\n\nEllie xxxxxx",

They had not been exposed to Hamon, so their bodies are very weak; as a result their stands having followed suit.\nJoseph passed away not long after the dealings with Kira. He has been immortalized at the foundation headquarters. \nJotaro has long since retired, having a fortune set aside from both his time as a marine biologist, and as gifts from the Speedwagon foundation for stopping Dio all those years ago. \nJoskue has stayed in the little town of Morioh, watching for strange things that are bound to happen. He does not communicate much with the Foundation, nor Jotaro, much as of late. \nDescendants of the Joestar bloodline are found all across the world, but this story will focus on the Kujo bloodline. Not long after his dealings with Kira, Jotaro settling down in New York City, ready to enjoy a semi quiet life. During this time, he found a wife and had one child. A son named Joshua Jones Kujo, or JoJo for short. Jotaro was confident that their blood line could enjoy a quiet life, as Joshua has yet to develop a stand.\n\nAll of that changes, though. A week before summer vacation starts for Joshua, the star-shaped birthmark that represented the Joestar bloodline started to give his serious pain. He tells his father about the birthmark giving him pain, and Jotaro shows a weird characteristic for his personality; fear. He informs him of how the birthmark gave him trouble once, many years ago. He tells him he developed a stand not long after, and that he thinks that Joshua's stand is on the horizon. He tells him to finish the school year, before they will handle it further. Jotaro has an idea of what could be causing the trouble, but he does not want to think what it could mean. Could the enemy of the Joestar bloodline be back? Not long after this conversation, Jotaro takes off for the Speedwagon Foundation Headquarters in New York City. \n\nHi, there! We are looking for a small number of people around 5-10 to join our Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Roleplay! We are all inclusive and the only requirements are that you have watched/read JJBA and have an under*stand*ing of it. I hope you'll have a great time!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/r6DYdfY",

I\u2019ve been roleplaying for almost a decade now and it\u2019s a hobby I\u2019ve mine that I\u2019ve fallen out of. that makes me sad. so I thought I\u2019d see if I could catch a new writing partner and potential friend! \n\nWhat I want to write: mentioned in the title mostly; I like a lot of genres! I mostly do fantasy and supernatural, but I like modern slice of life too - many of my OCs are fit for any situation. I\u2019m also interested in sci fi plots, since I rarely ever do them but it\u2019s a genre I love! I love to ship and write romance like a madwoman but shipping also means that I love good friendships too! \n\nWho I play: I would prefer mostly OC based and I\u2019d be happy to discuss ours together! I have a lot of both male and female OCs and one agender character that like I said can all work everywhere one way or another. I\u2019m happy to ship anyone with anyone though I admit I do prefer M/F romances. I\u2019m HAPPY to double or triple or whatever up as side characters and other characters etc to benefit our story, and I\u2019d hope you would be too! \n\nHow/where I write: 3rd person present tense is preferable, but past tense is also okay. I write in paragraph form but don\u2019t tend to go above one or two paragraphs unless the situation calls for it. I\u2019d like to chat and rp on Discord, or we can rp on another platform if that\u2019s better for you. But keeping in touch would be best through Discord. \n\nI have a backlog of plot ideas but would love to discuss with whoever drops me a message!! Swing by if you\u2019d like a new partner who\u2019s up for pretty much anything, I don\u2019t bite! Thanks for reading :)",

I know this is probably a shot in the dark, but I\u2019m really obsessed with Ant-Man and Scott Lang right now and I\u2019d love to do a roleplay! My own character is very well developed and a mutant, so the two could be partners in crime! I also am willing to play other MCU characters, but that can be discussed further in DM\u2019s. I don\u2019t care what sex or gender you are, as long as you play Ant-Man! We can for sure double up, but that\u2019s like.. my main thing right now! \n\nI\u2019m living in the EST time zone, and with summer quickly approaching, I\u2019ll be able to reply often during the day and evening. I\u2019m literate and multi-paragraph and match my partners responses in length. I DO NOT GHOST! If you are going to ghost me or are not looking for something long term, please do not waste either of our time\u2019s! My main platforms are discord but I\u2019m open to other platforms as well.\n\nHope to hear from you!",

Presently  I'm seeking  to write assertive female characters with weaknesses and  secrets, and  I'm seeking anyone who's able to write a male counterpart  to such a  person. Preferably someone with similar confidence and  assertiveness. I  do enjoy romance and NSFW elements in my stories, so  please be prepared  to do that. But this isn't the only thing I'd enjoy  having in our  stories. We could dabble with darker elements, angst,  crime, action,  whatever.\n\nThird person  past tense,  please. I'm a very experienced writer that enjoys writing  poetry and  prose, so I can ensure I deliver no run-on sentences,  appropriate  character development, proficient use of English. In terms  of length,  quality over quantity, always.\n\nI'm in the GMT+1 timezone, but I'm not overly fussy about what time zone you're in.\n\nPlease   be happy to use FCs. These play a massive role in my enthusiasm for a   story. I'll make specific requests, if that's alright, and try to   satisfy your interests also.\n\nPlease drop a line if interested. I'll happily share my Discord with you.\n\nCarpe Diem\\~",

I've been RPingfor nearly a decade now and my writing style is **3rd person paragraph form**, **no OC'S**  so theres no need to worry about one word responses. This usually ends up ranging anywhere between 3 paragraphs upwards to 6, depending on the scenario currently going on.\n\nSince my work schedule is hectic, I'm either available all day or after 6pm. If you're looking for someone who does rapid fire replies 24/7, I might not be the right pick for you. I sometimes need a break from writing and time for myself, and I totally understand if my partner does as well. I like to get to know my partner before we start as well! Even casual talk and idea throwing is fun!\n\nI'm on the look-out for anyone looking for a little more adventure, a bit more drama and \\*way\\* more romance in these specific properties.\n\nThe first one is the **She-ra reboot**. After binge watching the entire series in one weekend, I've absolutely fallen for the new She-Ra cartoon and its widely big cast. I would love to do canon or and AU involving any of the characters or ships, though I'm open to pretty much any ship! Plus, with the new season recently released, I'm sure more ideas are on the way!\n\nNext is **Kingdom Hearts**, and while I'm ok with different ships/multiple pairings in a ship, I really had one specific idea in mind, and it has to do with the KH characters in a Disneyland cast members in a normal au! I have a real fondness for Disneyland, and having these characters run around in this setting would be an absolute wild ride if given the chance.\n\n**Friday the 13th The Game:** well, I'm just looking for anything with to play Tiffany or Adam for my AJ. that's it. Plain and simple. Could be a regular AU, could be a in-game idea or even something based off another horror property like Scream or other 70's horror.\n\nWith **Dead By Daylight** I'm ok with any character, but I would love a Dwight, David or Ace for my Jane, Kate or Meg.\n\nI'm also looking for partners for **MCU, Life is Strange, (S1 and BTS) CXGF, Riverdale** and more! I'm open to anything with these!\n\nIf you have any questions or are interested in starting up a roleplay, feel free to PM me!",

            "selftext": "*Hello, hello, and thank you ever-so-much for clicking on my ad!* My name is Mira, and today I'll be walking you through some of the things I'm looking for. Below, you'll find out a little bit more about myself, what I'm looking for in terms of role-plays, and what I'm looking for in a partner. \n\n\n\n**So who am I?** I'm a person who's had over a decade of role-play experience. Couple that with my ambitions as an aspiring author, and I'd like to think I'm a fairly decent role-player. I adore fantasy in all its many facets, to the point where some of my favorite genres are medieval fantasy, and modern fantasy (Bright, anybody?) I greatly enjoy fandoms, ranging from The Elder Scrolls (are you surprised yet?) to Avatar: The Last Airbender/Legend of Korra. \n\nIn my spare time, I love to write short stories, play video games, and try my hand at cooking/baking. This isn't relevant, but I feel like people who get along together as friends are even better role-play partners. \n\n\n\n**What am I looking for?:** This section will be in roughly four distinct parts. As I've attempted to elude towards in the title, I'm looking for more than just one single plot-line. I have a number of so-called \"cravings\" I'd like to try and tackle, so if any of them tickle your fancy outside of The Elder Scrolls prompt, then by all means, shoot me a message! Now then, without further ado; \n\n&gt; #1: The Elder Scrolls: Ad Mortem\n\n&gt; *It is the 220th Year of the Fourth Era. Just as quickly as the Dragonborn came about, he vanished all the same. No traces, only a hole in the hearts of many who felt he might be their salvation. When the dragons came about, people prepared, but did not find them a threat. They retreated to the furthest corners of Skyrim, and the Nord's ignorance determined they were no longer an issue to contend with. This was fifteen years prior.*\n\n&gt; *Four years prior to the current setting is when all Oblivion broke loose. The Dragons, in their infinite wisdom, were biding their time until the right moment to strike. The Civil War had ended, though it was unclear what exactly happened (see; up for discussion.) What is known is that shortly afterwards, the Dragons rose up. There weren't many of them, but their strength was such that they could level an entire city in a single day. These Dragons--these airborne monsters--had different plans.* \n\n&gt; *At this point, the ocean of events became muddied. (Read; up for discussion.) It isn't entirely clear what caused it, whether the Dragons rose them up from the dead, or the tombs that held them were broken, but the Draugr that once lay under the land of Skyrim began clambering up to the surface world. It was slow at first--a small band of guards could head to the ruins and keep them at bay. The next year, and guards were busy guarding the walls and borders to try and strike at the heart of the Draugr. The next year, roads were nearly empty aside from the shambling monstrosities and caravans armed with a dozen guards. Most people refuse to leave the cities, and for good reason.*\n\nI hope that little prompt piqued your interest! In a nutshell, it's a post-apocalyptic Skyrim setting. I love the idea of different cities adopting their own ways of managing this outbreak, as well as the possible reasons for why this outbreak has occurred. I feel like there's so many facets of it to explore, both in role-play and outside of it. \n\nThis setting will also have some slight differences to it, though that's definitely open to discussion. I had envisioned this setting being a little more grounded in realism (cue the irony) in comparison to how The Elder Scrolls usually is. That is to say, magic would play a less prominent part than it usually would. Magic is still a factor, but mages as a whole would be less common, especially the kind that can fling fireballs from their hands. These mages would be scholars who have spent years studying arcane literature, armed with scrolls, tomes and staves to supplement their natural mystical abilities. Mages would be rare outside of certain locations (for example, Winterhold would obviously have a number of mages. I also imagine Solitude might, as both the capital of Skyrim, and the main stronghold for the Imperial Legion (and its Imperial Battlemages.) \n\n\nThe following \"prompts\" will be brief descriptions in comparison. They are not fleshed-out, they are simple cravings I'd like to try out. \n\n\n&gt; #2: Star Wars: The Following Years\n\n&gt; **Disclaimer: My knowledge of Star Wars is somewhat lacking, but I enjoy it all the same. I'll try to remain as competent as possible, but please bear with me.**\n\n&gt; *The setting is somewhat simple, in all honesty. It's been a short time since the formation of the Galactic Empire and Order 66 being executed, and naturally, the galaxy is in disarray. I'm fond of the idea of following the story of a padawan that's on the run (totally not stealing it from Fallen Order,) but I'm open to just about any other types of characters and plots.*\n\n\n\n&gt; #3: The Village is Under Attack! \n\n&gt; *That's my clever way of giving the medieval fantasy setting a title. Granted, it could totally involve attacking a village. I absolutely adore fantasy settings; the wide variety of races, the mystical spells and the political factions vying for supremacy. Even the more mundane aspects, such as the rusty blades, growling brigands and wheat farmers. It also helps that I've been playing a lot of For Honor, Mordhau and Mount and Blade: Warband, so all of those have influenced my desire for this sort of setting.*\n\n\n\n&gt; #4: DC vs. Marvel\n\n&gt; *This one is somehow even simpler than the other two. In a sentence, I'm wanting to try something regarding superheroes, or similar. It could be a canon setting, or it could be a custom setting. It could be canon characters, or custom characters, I'm up for anything! Granted, I am pretty fond of the idea of delving into a more slice-of-life situation within this setting. Not just that, but I love the idea of seeing these larger-than-life figures living their day-to-day lives, as well as demolishing criminals and world-enders.* \n\n\n**Now that we've covered that, I'd like to talk a little more about what I'm looking for in a partner.** Above all else, I'm looking for a certain degree of literacy and competency. I crave partners who can weave together sentences and paragraphs in a way that really makes me imagine what's going on. I'm not overly fussed about length, not to the extent that I am about descriptive writing, but I would prefer it if you can at least come up with a couple of paragraphs at a time. \n\nIn terms of some of the tags, I'm looking for someone who is 18 and up in terms of age. There will most likely be some degree of NSFW themes (of the lewd variety, which can be discussed further in private messages.) I'm not a fan of major gore, but I am fine with certain NPCs being killed or similar. These are some harsh settings, after all. \n\nI'm certain there are more things to discuss, but I'll try and keep it relatively short. That, and I'll need to spend the next while tweaking the undoubtedly horrid formatting so that my wall of text is at least somewhat presentable. If you've gotten this far, thanking you does not even begin to describe how thrilled I am, but I thank you all the same for reading it! Feel free to drop me a message on Reddit, and we can figure out a more appropriate means of messaging one another (I am very much partial to Discord, but am open to other means of communication.) I hope to hear back from some of you soon!",

My job is extremely demanding and I\u2019m always on call when I\u2019m not standing duty (bad guys don\u2019t chase themselves and drowning people don\u2019t save themselves, lol!). \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been writing my OC James since 2013 and I love him to death. He\u2019s currently a CIA operative but I can alter him in the occupation sense to fit the plot. Looking for anybody at all to write some actiony plots with me. He\u2019s a straight male, so if you\u2019re looking for romance/smut, please write as a female.\nI\u2019m fine with slice of life too! Pretty much any genre is fine with me. We can incorporate lots of drama and angst too. They can be friends, coworkers, allies, enemies, lovers, family, you name it. I don\u2019t care too much what we write because I just want to write more as him. \n\nI\u2019m in the eastern time zone and I write third person past tense. All I ask is that you do too, and you write 2-3 paragraphs per response depending on what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m not super picky about grammar and spelling but I do appreciate someone close to my level. \n\nThanks again! I look forward to writing with yous guys. PM me if you\u2019re interested! :)",

I'd prefer to play them in their teenage years at Hogwarts and slowly develop a relationship through the various issues all teenagers seem to have. I'd like to build a lot into their relationship, and not sort of rush into it. Slow burn is my weakness.\n\nI have a strong preference for playing Remus, and would adore if someone could play Sirius for this. I can be swayed to swap, but it's simply personal preference at the moment.\n\nIf this at all seems interesting to you, please shoot me a PM!

Like saiyans kind of.). The human and alien get stuck together somehow and develop a romance while trying to learn about each others' lifestyles. \n\nHere are some plots for the rp. \n\n- The classic \"crash landing\" scenario where the alien character crashes on earth, and a human takes them in.\n\n- Earth and another planet have become wrapped up in diplomatic affairs, pulling their people into the fray of a possible treaty or a war. Two beings get caught in the middle of this when their planets depend on the triumph of their relationship. \n\n- An alien invader comes to take over earth, but they end up falling for a human while disguising themselves as one. \n\n- \"Crash landing\" but inverted. The human is a space traveler who gets lost and crashes on an alien planet where they are taken in by an alien.\n\nTo Read:\n\nI'm looking for 18 and up partners!\n\nThe preference for the couple is same-sex.\n\nI prefer to be on the bottom.",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. My top favorite characters will be in italics. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are *Dany*, Margaery, *Sansa*, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: *Mary Jane Watson*, Black Cat, *She-Hulk*, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, *Scarlet Witch*, Gamora, Nebula, Elektra, Jessica Jones, *Captain Marvel*, *Black Widow*, The Wasp, *Mystique* and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard) (I have an absolute assload of ideas surrounding Endgame and the aftermath, including fitting some non-MCU pieces into the MCU) \n\n**DC Comics**: *Batgirl*, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, *Wonder Woman*. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, *Vetra*, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, *Rey*, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: *Sonya*, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, *Cassie*, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. As well as a few other non-fandom ideas I have. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with.",

Hunter/Assasin for the Imperial Empire? A survivor of one of the raided villages?\n\nIts up to you.\n\nIf your interested in giving this RP, feel free to DM me.\n\nI RP mainly on discord, but i also use Kik and Reddit.",

            "selftext": "I've got a pretty specific idea in mind, but I don't want to give it away here! I figured I'd just give an outline and see if anyone is interested. This idea is very dark and very twisted, so don't expect something light hearted and fun. With that being said I need you to be 18+ because the themes are way too mature.\n\nSo! My idea will involve murder, romance, explicit sex scenes, explicit murder scenes, and triggering scenes as well. I don't want to offend anyone.. So if you are triggered easily please do not contact me! I just don't want to upset anyone. My idea is basically along the lines of being so in love with one another that nothing is too much to be asked and there are no lines that can't be crossed to protect the love. As I said though, no specific details will be given here. ;) \n\nI can use either kik or Discord, but I prefer kik for sure. I would like this to take place in first person. If you would like to hear my idea then feel free to shoot me a message! I should respond back fairly quickly for the rest of the night.",

We have our community and roleplay set up in a Discord Server. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019re a literate roleplay with some touches of tabletop and hopes of becoming more and more open world styled. In a way, we\u2019re trying to build a literate roleplay mmo! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now, we\u2019re very small but we\u2019re looking to take in new members who are willing to grow with us and add into our community and lore with their ideas and participation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIrithia has a framework of all the usual races, tropes, and themes of a High Fantasy setting which we have built off of to add our own unique twists and spins on them. Our lore will continue to be added onto and developed further all the time by Staff with help and input from all of our members. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world itself is set to run parallel with real time so that its events are easily mapped and tracked and to fully immerse ourselves in the experience. The time period is not set but rather a fluid mix of medieval to around the 1700's (with some give and take as far as what technologies are available in this world). Irithia is rich with religions, cultures, and various ways of life which a character may become wrapped up in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMembers who join us will have a direct affect on the community and the events of our world (provided they participate and give feedback for us to work with). Actions which characters take in the roleplay as well as feedback or items submitted by the player are taken into account and used to shape events and the world. Aside from more major events that players may take a role in there is also plenty of room for more a more personal focus and doing smaller plots which affect your character/those involved with them alone or even taking up more mundane parts, like shopkeepers or other business work, which help bring the world to life even more so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite our ever-growing lore, we obviously do not expect it all be memorized or even read right from the start! Getting involved is made easy with our handy character creation page which will walk you step by step through the information needed to create a character- all the rest can come after you've dipped in your toes. Once you have a character, the rest of the lore can be learned as it comes up/as needed, or you can start in on it however you please- after all, it will always be there for your reference. Jump around from part to part or hunker down and become an expert on a certain race- whatever works for you! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe look forward to making new friends and helping new stories unfold! Hope to see you, soon!\n\nShoot me a message if you\u2019re interested and I\u2019ll send you our site of lore!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I'm Doe and I'm looking for partners that are at least 21+ as that's my age range. Mature themes will be in my plots though limits will be discussed. write multiple paragraphs/novella style (200-500+ words). I love to write detailed descriptions and delve into a character\u2019s head/emotions as well as surroundings. I compare it to writing a novel together.\n\nI understand if the scene doesn\u2019t have alot going on and therefore requires less. I adore having long, thoughtful replies where we truly immerse ourselves in the world. I'm hoping to find a partner whose as enthusiastic about the plot and writing as I am. When I get invested in a story, it\u2019s 100% dedication. Getting a reply is the highlight of my day.\n\nI'm a big fan of romance and using face claims. I\u2019m the type to make pinterest boards, spam you with gifs, headcanons, and send you songs that remind me of our characters and/or ship. I'll get excited if we come up with a great plot idea or if our characters are being cute or going to get into trouble. I live for this kind of stuff honestly.\n\nLast but not least I only do MxF and don\u2019t double, but I\u2019m more than happy to write side characters of either gender to help move the story along. I'd prefer female authors writing male characters but male writers are fine too.\n\nDesperately Searching For:\n\n* 21+ partners\n\n* For you to have an excellent grasp of grammar, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. Both in character and **out of character.** (Literate to advanced writers only, please. I'm not looking for newbies or those who English isn't thier first language).\n\n* For you to write as an older male (Late 30s to 40+). I'm a sucker for the gruff and tough men who secretly have a soft heart. I also love those grumpy, hypermasculine men being intimidated by darling, soft yet commanding, and pretty women.\n\n* The more description, the better! I'm looking for someone can write as much as me (2 to 4 paragraphs or more) and really bring the story to life. I lose interest if I'm the only one that's invested/enthusiastic or coming up with plot ideas. Quality writing makes my heart happy, as does world building together.\n\n* The use of real life face claims and joining me in the wonderful world of ship/character development isn't a requirement but I'd sure be delighted if we were on the same page in this regard. (I won't use anime faces, only art if you're uncomfortable with real life)\n\n* Someone who won't leave without warning or explanation after sending the first post. I'm looking for the long term here, and I have been greatly saddened by how many partners have left me high and dry recently.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! You won't be disappointed in writing with me. I tend to be online daily and I'd like it if you were too. Please let me know if you're going to be inactive, long days/weeks of silence make me nervous.\n\nGenres: \n\n* Mafia/Crime \n* Post Apocalyptic/Dystopia\n* Supernatural/Modern Fantasy \n* Southern/Mid Western/Urban Gothic\n*Western inspired/Weird West (supernatural and fantasy elements)\n*Sci-fi/Cyberpunk\n\nAll my characters will be adults and I require my partners to do the same. For plot and more genre ideas, please message me ^^ I prefer to write over email but use discord for chatting and writing. \n\nPlease be detailed when you message me, let me know why you chose to contact me. Seeing \"hey do you wanna rp?\" is a guaranteed way to turn me off.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you!",

I\u2019ll be playing the other characters around the Estate that you\u2019ll be meeting and developing relationships with as you see fit.

My goal is to make a setting that feels realistic and believable as well as fun to explore and deep and detailed in content and lore for even the smallest, most obscure trinket in the Estate.\n\n- Because of the possible NSFW themes, I only rp with people 18 and older\n- I have been writing for a little over a decade\n- I am advanced-literate and write a LOT, and while I don\u2019t expect you to match my length every time, I do require complete sentences and basic understanding of English grammar\n- I only roleplay on discord.

They paid him well, because they knew he was fierce, and they feared what might happen if he joined their enemies.\n\n\nThey stalked like a poisonous cloud through the town, leaving gore and screaming in their wake. A little later, the men began to make an effort to protect their homes and their families, but they were nothing compared to the raiders.\n Where Heart-Eater went, carnage followed, and the other men did well to stay out of his wake, when the bloodlust was in him, he didn\u2019t differentiate between his prey and his \u2018allies.\u2019\nHe knew what he was searching for, and found it when the smoke was high in the sky and the lights of the fires had drowned out the sunrise. A large, fine house at the highest part of the city. There were guards, of course, and Heart Eater made quick work of them, even as one took out a small chunk of his left upper arm with the tip of a sword as Heart-Eater barreled into him with the strength of an ox.\n\n\nInside, he took a moment to listen to pounding footsteps coming from the floor above him, and to observe the decoration of the house. There was also a scent in the air that expelled the sharp metallic blood, and was replaced by lavender, beautiful and feminine. A man stormed down the stairs dressed in a priests attire, and Heart-Eater tore out his throat with his teeth. Bright red blood stained his mouth as he climbed the stairs, dripping down to the floor.\n\n\nHe found wooden double doors at the end of the hall. The scent of lavender was more concentrated there. He opened one door, swinging it open almost delicately. His eyes roved around the master bedroom, finding luxurious furniture and a row of perfume fragrances on the table beside the bed. \u201cI know you\u2019re here.\u201d He said, his words short and stunted, but menacing and thick with his accent.\n\n\nHello there! I\u2019m a female playing male, with years of experience in roleplaying, specifically Viking RP. I\u2019m literate, and write in third person, past tense. And I would prefer if my partner would be able to write in third person as well. As you can tell from the prompt above, I\u2019m searching for a female partner that will play the character \u201cHeart-Eater\u201d is going to capture. When you add me on discord will have to discuss what will happen beyond the point of your character finding mine. You can choose what and who your character is. \n\nMessage me for my discord, where you can ask me anything you\u2019re unsure about. I\u2019ll happily answer!",

            "selftext": "## The Antium Empire\n\nAntium is a medieval fantasy roleplaying server set in a land ridden with conflict. A land forcefully taken over by a former military general has left the kingdom and it's towns in a state of disarray. Corruption and crime riddle the land both on the surface and beneath it. Even where it seems peaceful, deep within the roots of every nation corruption runs deep. Set in this world, its' to your character to pick what they wish to do. A land full of opportunity, whether to take advantage of the many in need, or to provide them with the help so desperately seek.\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What is Antium?\n\nSo, let's break down to what Antium itself really is! Antium is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is The Antium Empire. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more! \u00a0\n\n## What makes it unique?\n\nSo, what exactly makes us different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, we run off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Antium's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Antium is. This server is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What are the 'requirements'?\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to! \u00a0\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\nAntium is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community of players within the Discord. While new and small, we hope to build up a playerbase that will allow for the best experience and a large diversity among the characters. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj](https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj)",

Most of the plots I\u2019ve done have been romantic stories with drama and other elements. \n\nToday I have a plot in mind and I\u2019d be so ecstatic to find a suitable partner for me to play it with (: \n\nMuse A is surgical nurse and also a single mother to a 3 year old little girl. She takes her work and her motherly duties very seriously and sometimes forgets to have fun, she\u2019s pretty guarded especially to someone who could be a potential love interest only because her husband left her in the middle of her pregnancy causing her to be pretty untrusting of anyone. \n\nMuse B is just the opposite he is a free spirited person, likes to have fun and such a ladies man. Despite the fact that he\u2019s a surgeon, he\u2019s honestly so careless outside of work. He\u2019s had his fair share of girlfriends and has never thought about settling down and having a family. \n\nThey both meet on a Friday night when muse A\u2019s sister drags her out for a fun time at the club while muse B is obviously there for a fun time and mostly to hook up with someone. They both bump into each other, he buys her a drink, they flirt, then it leads to a one night stand. The next morning muse A freaks out and leaves thinking that she\u2019s never going to see him again, turns out he\u2019s the new hired surgeon at her hospital. \n\nSo the idea is that our characters end up sleeping together and the next morning they just go their separate ways until they find out that they\u2019ll be working in the same hospital. Like I said your character is a very nonchalant person but for some reason he can\u2019t help but be attracted to my character so will he be willing to quit his party life and settle down with a woman who already has a child?\n\nI\u2019m looking for a partner who is literate, that can write multiple paragraphs in third person. I only use kik or discord, I\u2019m not a big fan of using Reddit to roleplay. Sorry :// \nBut if anyone is interested please send me a message. I won\u2019t replay to just \u201chey, rp?\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m interested.\u201d Introduce yourself or say something that will catch my attention please. \n\nPS: if anyone watches greys anatomy you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s similar to how Meredith and Derek met.

Unless it is dialogue and the character is standing completely still and not emoting at all like a robot, you can make it more than a few sentences.\n\nScheduling: I can post +3 times a day if it happens to be a lighter day for me, but life happens. I get it. I expect at least one post from you a day unless you are going through a life or death situation. You feeling a bit ill should not hamper your RP abilities. If you feel that once a day is too restrictive, leave now.\n\nContent: I prefer to play straight male characters, and I expect my partner to play a straight female. However, I do not force romance or smut between characters, as I feel that romance needs to naturally evolve between two characters. I also follow book canon, but can adjust to show canon if necessary\n\nPlot: I am most flexible with plot, and will compromise heavily on plot points. I have RP'd just about every role in Game of Thrones, from Flea Bottom thief to a Lannister Lord.\n\nHere are some of my more specific interests:\n\nMargaery X Robb\n\nOC X OC\n\nIf any of that interests you, shoot me a PM.",

This is what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a partner or partners who would want to rp in the setting of Assassin's Creed. The time era and even the side we take are completely negotiable. All I ask is that those who are interested be at least literate (Being able to post at least 3-4 sentences each reply) And understanding of time delays between posts.

I love attention to detail and a cute roleplay would be wonderful to me! I want someone interesting, who doesn\u2019t mind a busy schedule or someone who will communicate me on what they want or need. I usually don\u2019t roleplay with people who give me one liners. I love multi paragraphs! I love love love them!!! I need sometime to satiate my hunger and thirst so an amazing roleplay!!!! How many times have I used the word \u201croleplay\u201d so far...? You\u2019re not keeping count? Okay good! But here\u2019s my requirements \n\n\u2022I do ask that you be 18+!!! It\u2019s not fun do a NSFW scene with 14 year old kids\n\n\u2022I ask that you please please PLEASE, try and give me two paragraphs. I love a lot of length, and I\u2019ll try to match your energy if you give me enough stuff to work with. \n\n\u2022Please communicate with me. I don\u2019t want to be the only one controlling a story. If it\u2019s your arc or mine, I could understand if we control our own arc, but it\u2019s fair to us both if we both contributed. \n\nI know, I know. This is a lot to read and I\u2019m sure there are typos here and there, but I would love to roleplay with someone! I\u2019m always interested in doing a Princess roleplay! I mainly stick to fantasy and romance roleplay, but dabble in Slice of Life sometimes. I only do one fandom too, like Emiya Archer and Rin from the Fate Franchise. I am also interested in doing a group roleplay if anyone would like to give me a good group to join! But that\u2019s enough of that! I mainly roleplay on discord, so feel free to shoot me a message so we can discuss! Thanks!!!",

I'll keep it brief here because I'll no doubt reveal more when we RP!\n\n**So that means EU timezones?**\n\nIdeally yes. I'm happy to work with others but it's about how much our times cross and allow us to roleplay. Generally speaking i'm free most of the time, especially on weekends. I have tried to make it work with people in other timezones before, and it just doesn't work out long term. Maybe you're the exception? Who knows!\n\n**Enough faff, what about the roleplay?**\n\nSo what I want is long running story. I want something that is two people doing things. Are they heroes on an adventure? Criminals escaping the law? Explorers establishing a planetary colony? Soldiers in the Roman Army? Any of the above!\n\n*That's a bit vague*, I hear you saying. And you're right! I want our RP to be collaborative. I want it to be a long term combined story. Any good writer will tell you that the best stories focus on development. That's usually character development, and should be in this case. The RP should be about our characters and how they evolve together.\n\n**Okay that's still too vague, settings?**\n\nAny really. I'll list some favourites below;\n\n* Star Trek/Star Wars\n* Modern\n* Historical\n* Futuristic\n* Lovecraftian\n* Lots of game ones! Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, Fallout\n* My own homemade fantasy world used in my D&amp;D sessions and novel writing. Does that sound exciting? It bloody well should! ^^It ^^isn't.\n\n**You actually any good at RP? Can you spell proper n stuff?**\n\nI like to think so! Been RPing for close to 2 decades in some form of another at this point. I write novels for fun with a view to publish as a career, so I can write. I can weave a web of a world for us to crawl across, or you can take me for a ride in your ideas.\n\n**So... do I fit the bill? What do you want?**\n\nI want someone who is good at heart and is reasonable with English. If you are European, and your English is passable, that's 10/10 in my book. We'll practise it together! I have a preference for the female persuasion, because for me RP is escapism but I'm honestly happy either way.\n\n**What about dirty stuff? Violence? Swear words?**\n\nYeah to all the above. I'm pretty open. I want my character to evolve with yours. \n\n**So how do I get in touch?**\n\nPoke me here or in private and I'll give you my discord and we'll go from there.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you all!",

            "selftext": "Hey there! Back again looking for some long term roleplay partners, as is the norm with RP quite a few of my partners have either disappeared or other issues have stopped them from being able to continue but that's part and parcel with this, right? I would love to start on some involved and interesting roleplays. I'm always interested in starting new roleplays with exciting partners! I've been looking over the past few weeks but I'm still hoping to get some more long term partners to build some interesting stories with. \n\nA bit about myself, I'm a big fan of reading, gaming, movies and writing and find roleplay to fit nicely in as a hobby alongside a most of them. I also like reading comics, especially Marvel and would be interested in doing something based on that world and characters, it could be as loosely accurate as we'd like. \n\n I'm also interested in a wide range of genres from science fiction, to more generic fantasy and espionage style roleplay just to name a few. My favourite genre overall is cyberpunk but it is quite niche and very rare to find a partner interested in it, so bonus points if you are! Other genre's / settings I'm interested in are Lovecraftian, Apocalyptic, Fantasy, Noir, Futuristic Sci-Fi and honestly anything fictional I'm most likely to be interested in it! Just give me your suggestions or idea's and i'll be happy to discuss and see what works for both of us. I'm honestly open to just about anything so don't worry about suggesting ideas!\n\nI also have numerous prompts on my profile, but they all lean more to an adult setting. I don't mind with our roleplay being more adult orientated or not. I'm fine with either, although I would like the roleplay to be somewhat mature in tone. Any sexual aspect would be depending on your preference. \n\nMy timezone is GMT (UK) and I should be free to talk and roleplay most days, if not then I'll try to make you aware as I feel communication is key. I work 24hrs so depending on my shift I can be online at various times. If I don't message back after a day or two then just fire me a message to get my attention, it's more than likely something IRL has come up and I've just forgotten to respond. \n\nI'm open to any ideas or discussions, just fire me a PM and we can see if we work out. Hope to hear from you soon!",

            "selftext": "I was having trouble sleeping and out of nowhere, this idea told in the title appeared in my head. In short, the roleplay takes place with the characters being in highschool when my character one day wakes up to a ghost claiming to be a childhood friend that had died when he was young. She brings up a promise that had as kids that when they were adults, they would be marry each other. So in short, the roleplay is about my character now living with the ghost of his childhood friend claiming and acting to be his wife.   \n\n\nFor myself, I do best with writing in third person and at least a paragraph for replies. And though not needed, I find it more fun to play more than one character but that one is up to you.  \n\n\nIf you're interested or have any questions, just message me and I will send you my discord stuff.",

From Elves, to humans, to orcs, I love everything fantasy. Now, we don\u2019t necessarily have to follow the typical fantasy norms. We can of course create our own world, it\u2019s own rules, and all of that jazz. \n\nSo, I prefer to roleplay on discord, as it\u2019s much easier than all other mediums out there. I really like descriptive people, who are into the whole idea and really want to get into it. They take the roleplay seriously and will be down to do it and create it!\n\nOther than that, there is much to this. I\u2019ve been in a funk lately and roleplay helps me out of it. So please, if you\u2019re interested don\u2019t be afraid to shoot me a pm so we can discuss. \n\nAnd on that note, that\u2019s pretty much it. As stated before, pm me and we can discuss and swap discord\u2019s. Hope to see some of you lovely people there!",

Micheal was relatively short at only 6'2'' most men working in this sector were either born tall or had spent so long in zero gravity that they had lost reasonable proportions. But not him.

Between him and the automated repair system the artical gravity had held for the past six years.\n\n(I always loved the Aliens ascetic of CRT screens in a state of the art space ship. I have an idea for a long term Roleplay on board a deep space research vessel. A small crew of NPCs and us go about years at a time together, we develop friendships and grudges yet they also have new unexplored worlds to contend with. We also have the option of adding alien races into the mix depending on your preference. However for now I like the idea of you being new to the ship and pur characters developing a bond.)",

            "selftext": "  \n\nYou had never known your mother. Dad often spoke of her though, that rare dreamy tone in his voice. A 'great and beautiful woman'. The \u2018Most intelligent person he had ever known\u2019 and \u2018as Kindhearted as a saint.\u2019  It was becoming difficult to continue believing that. She had to have been around for your birth of course, but as soon as you turned two she left you, as dad explains, and returned to her homeland far to the West. The Spirit Valley. Otherwise known as Elin Hal. Dad had made her out to be some kind of incredible, all powerful witch who was needed by her clan, she had a great duty to fulfil and leaving the sleepy island town you had spent your entire life on, leaving you, was a small sacrifice in the name of the greater good.\n\nStill, it would be difficult not to resent her. A childhood that had been stripped away before you even knew it. Dad had attempted to raise you on his own. A doctor by trade, a pleasant man, well respected by loyal patients within town. But a doctor has a lot of work and, despite his best attempts, for the most part you were left to your own devices. There wasn't much to do on the island nation of Hanstrasia. It was populous enough not be a wasteland, busy enough so that one could work as any job they wished as long as they were qualified. But nothing seemed to happen. One would go through school, attend college, get a job, find a partner, get married... It was a simple stable uneventful existence. And that was how you always thought it would be.\n\nUntil you received the letter. A request to meet, sent from your mother, who signed the brief document by the name Cecile Vengi. It was the first time you had experienced her actions directly. After much debate and encouragement from dad, who didn't seem to mind Cecile had changed her last name, you decided to rent passage on a merchant airship to the mainland and travel to the Spirit Valley, the famous, but distant, pilgrimage site. The homeland of witches.\n\nAs soon as you left your boring but safe, island things started going wrong. The crew who maintained the airship proved to be lazy and uncooperative with you. The 'War of the Lions' between the great democratic Northern Federation and expansionist Southern Empire had spread to the east of the mainland and the fear of winding up in the hands of either nation had petrified the crew. To make matters even worse, you had just been boarded by pirates. Or at least, you thought you had. rustling and shouting from up on deck and foreign, unfamiliar tongues echoed through the steel corridors of the airship. The vessel itself had slowed, merely floating sluggishly within the sky, a desperate attempt at escape seemingly halted. Out the port hole window you could see a small, streamlined black vessel, its float dust vents emitting a slight purple haze. A triplet of winch harpoons preventing any hope of your merchant ship from breaking away, and even then, it would have been quite impossible to outrun the pirate hunter.\n\nLeft alone in the sky, nothing but the open ocean several thousand feet beneath you, the world seemed totally silent for a brief moment. Then the unmistakable sound of footsteps crept faintly from behind your cabin\u2019s door.\n\n\\--\n\nI am looking for a partner to RP with on discord. The RP would revolve around the story of an 18 year old woman in a fantasy world on a journey to meet her mother for the first time. Along the way she would meet many interesting characters, discover much more about the world she inhabits, and solve the mysteries surrounding her mother. To a certain extent this is a coming of a age story, with a young woman leaving her home for the first time, discovering what kind of person she is and what kind of person she might become. \n\nI normally write two or three paragraphs a response and can ordinarily make one response a day.\n\nWe shall discuss your character and how the roleplay is going to work over discord.\n\nI eagerly await to hear from you.",

            "selftext": "So I'm looking for something a little different involving perhaps quite a bit of world and character building. I want to build a world that blends Cyberpunk and Fantasy, starting in the vast sprawling city of Valengow the epicenter where Magitek is innovated. Magitech is, as you've probably guessed, a fusion of magic and technology. Would would deemed to be contemporary conveniences in a more modern/common setting enhanced with many millennia of development of the arcane arts.\n\nMy character is more or less your typical youthful, feminine Elven lad. Mouthy, arrogant, and a bit naive. He may have a soft core, but do you really want to get to know such a brat to find out? He's stuck doing odd jobs around the city to scratch out a living, but he has dreams of venturing outside the neon walls to hunt the wilds and bring fame and fortune to himself.\n\n-----\n\nMe:\n\nLady person, 33, 15+ years of RP experience, starting to feel kinda old around here.\n\nMy requirements are pretty straight forward:\n\n- Be 21+. I guess I'm guilty of wanting something NSFW/mature focused, but also I just tend to get along with people closer in age.\n\n- Just be decently literate? I'm not the best myself, so I like to set myself as the bar so if you can match me you're good.\n\n- Third person narrative only.\n\n- Semi-Para to Paragraph would be nice, but I'm okay with anything above single sentence posts.\n\n- Like to chat! I love to chat and make with the friendlies with people I RP with, it makes things more fun.\n\nThat being said, I'm pretty casual and laid and get along with others who are similar. I understand life can get hectic though and I'm cool with that. I also realize that sometimes things don't work out or you can lose interest, that's cool too, just let me know before you go so I'm not left worrying.",

            "selftext": "Novus was a world that possessed much in the way of natural resources and beauty. Its surface was home to great oceans dotted by reefs and tropical islands and lush ancient forests that teemed with life. The oceans provided bountiful harvests for those that could brave its storms but its cavernous depths and trenches harboured dreadful horrors that could only be imagined in nightmares. The expansive old growth forests provided endless lumber and there was no shortage of wildlife for local hunters but the primordial beasts that stalked the undergrowth meant that sometimes the hunters would become the hunted.\n\nThe main bastion of civilisation on the otherwise untamed and feral world was the burgeoning city of Felton's Point. The city blended nature and technology, producing electricity cleanly through a mix of renewable sources such as tidal, solar, wind, and natural gas power. A mighty wall bristling with defence turrets provided more than enough firepower to drive off most of the beasts native to the planet and torpedo turrets as well as patrolling submersibles ensured that nothing rose from the depths to wreak havoc upon the city. The outlying settlements did not have the luxury of security like Felton's Point did. Most of them were left to fend for themselves although many developed their own ways to survive and even thrive in the wilds. \n\nAlthough Novus' future is bright just like the light of its one sun that shines warmly upon the world, nothing is set in stone and the tapestry of fate is ever-changing.\n\n\n\nHey hey everybody it's your local Canadian just looking to get back into RPing after a very long break due to university.\n\nWhat I have for you today is a world that is an open sand box for plots, ideas, fantasies, whatever works. I do have a plot in mind but it is Warhammer 40k based. I left the description of the world purposefully vague in some areas though so that it doesn't have to only be for 40k and could instead be completely original or anything in between.\n\nHopefully we can use this world as a testing ground to see how each of us RPs and see if our styles are compatible.\n\nI usually type out 2 paragraphs minimum although I won't force my partner to do the same. As long as it's not a one liner and there's enough substance for me to make a proper reply I'll be a happy camper.\n\nThis post is probably long enough as it is so I'll be more than happy to discuss potential plots an any other details with whoever is interested over Discord. Have a great day/night and I look forward to hopefully meeting some new and chill people.",

The most famous case was where a member printed fake identification papers from a library computer and printer.  \nhow to join:  \nhave an untraceable computer and ask nicely  \n**Legionnaires**  \nThis group profits off of its kills as hitwomen  \nThis group is exclusive to females, and only females can join.  \nThey are given funds by the pedigrees for guns and such.  \nhow to join:  \nfight the weakest, then the strongest, you will be placed in a group based on how you do. of course, you have to have a good reputation and be useful  \n\n\n**Bases**  \nThe Wildwoods have no base, they just hang out in the forest  \n\n\nThe greenbacks gather in an abandoned warehouse that they tidied up and furnished, along with whoever's mansion they wanna sit in and party.  \n\n\nThe pedigrees have a few city blocks and neighborhoods as their territory\u00a0  \n\n\nthe partisans claimed an abandoned apartment and don't pay rent since the owner likes them  \n\n\nthe legionnaires simply just gather in whoever's basement is available(within the group of course) and sometimes the pedigree territory  \n\n\n**Rules**  \nNo controlling the ocs of others  \nNo god-mode/godmod idgaf  \nbe semi-literate  \nUse \"\" for speech, '' for thought, and nothing for action  \nYou must roleplay in the 3rd person( example: Mary had a little plate of muttonchops, she took a bite. \u201cDid you burn this?\u201d)  \nDon't abandon the rp, nothing will happen but just know you made someone salty as heck  \nsmut is allowed but do it n the respective forum  \nno spam  \nidfk what else  \ncontact me for the invite",

An attack on the home base of any species, let alone one that harbors that an Army filled of a race that is ready to fight at all times.  However, the planet and Army under King Sadala were ill prepared for what had come. Two individual creatures, of unknown origin, at least to the Saiyans, appeared in the sky before the Palace. In moment, it was in rubble. These two creatures were able to attack and defeat the majority of the Saiyan army. When the Palace was lost, a code went out, instructing all Saiyans to evacuate the planet.\n\nThe number of survivors is unknown.\n\nOne Saiyan who was able to escape, was known as Cabba: A member of the Sadala Defense Forces. Sustaining injuries himself, the young Saiyan sat in his ship, with no real destination in mind; the only thought that rattled within his mind was the need for back-up.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo, not the best prompt start, but its roughly what I am searching for. Dealing within Universe 6, I'd like to craft a story that takes inspiration from both: GT and Dragon Ball Super Heroes. Basically, the idea of Tuffles/ Tuffle Created beings causing trouble. For this, I'd like to have **Oren** and **Kamin,** from Super Heroes, be the main antagonist. \n\nAs the main Protagonist being, Cabba, Kale, and Caulifla. Simply because I enjoy the Universe 6 Saiyans quite a bit! Though, I am open to having them try to get Universe 7's assistance at some point.  As for who writes who, totally up to debate! Though, I'd like us both to take one of the Antagonist.When it comes to writing Canon characters, I don't ask my partner to be 100% accurate all the time, just close enough. Also, feel free to mention any little head canons or quirks you think a character might have.\n\nPlot/Story ideas and beats can be work-shopped.\n\n\n\nWith this being within Dragon Ball, due expect some intense fighting, screaming, power-level raising, and what not!If interested, please feel free to send a message to me, I'll respond as soon as possible.",

            "selftext": "The title hero is often overused. People that take on trials for their own personal gain use it, as a way of sweeping their intentions under a thin cover. Others, use it as a title to be revered, and looked up to. Many heroes aren't the genuine article. Most of the time, they are just people, looking to set themselves aside from others.\n\nTrue heroes are often very rare, and very short lived. Well, most of them, at the very least. The primal mages of the Arcanum coast...well, they're a bit of an enigma. You could ask almost anyone in the kingdom about them, and you'd probably get a smattering of theories of what they are. Some will say primal mage is just a title, taken up by the next person in the line, others will say they're immortals, slumbering away until they're needed again. But out of all the theories, one bit of information is constant. The mage of storms was a coward, and abandoned his companions when they needed him the most.\n\nMost people sneer when that title is brought up. Even more so when people have the gall to utter \u201cStorm Raven\u201d, rather than boil it down to a simpler, more insulting title (although that was about as far as anyone could take it). What he did to earn that vilification wasn't exactly known, either. Most just left it with what they knew. Probably because it was the easier of the alternatives to accept.\n\nMost people wouldn't dare digging into his past. It would only be met with nasty looks and various other unsavory things. A few people were crazy enough to try and hunt down what happened, though.\n\nWho knew? Maybe someone would find the elusive \u201cStorm Raven\u201d slumbering, in some unmarked shrine, waiting for his companions to wake him up once more.\n\n)(\n\nAnd with that brief introduction, allow me to start this off with a brief explanation. This is, obviously, a fantasy rp, set in the country of Arcanum, aptly named because of all the magical happenings that fill the land. I'm planning on making this a rather expansive world, with plenty of lore and mysteries sprinkled in (if the above starter wasn't any indication). \n\nWith that, some ground rules. I'm looking for an 18+ partner, that can keep up with posts around 2-5 paragraphs. I am planning on some romance being included, hence the 18+ requirement. Other than that, some action and drama as well, along with three dimensional characters, all that jazz.\n\nI'm awful at these closing notes bits, so honestly, if I've caught your interest, shoot me a PM. Please add some detail in your introduction, I can't stress this enough. We can definitely work something out. Before I leave, though, I'll ask that if you do message me, put the word stormcloud in your message- it helps me know you read the entire prompt.",

When it comes down to roleplay and post length I don\u2019t expect paragraphs just enough for me to bounce off, otherwise the roleplay would fall flat.\n\nIf this sounds like your cup of tea please send me a message, or if this prompt has interested you at all, please just send a message.",

To make this post short and sweet, I'll just make a list of things which should make it easier for people to see what I like.\n\nGenres I like: Medieval, Post Apoc, Dark, Gritty, Horror, Low Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Superheroes, Grim-Dark (pretty much every NSFW tag), Greek, Roman, some Fandoms (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Warframe, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, and Alien Vs Predator are some which quickly come to mind, admittedly, there is a lot which I like, but these are the main few).\n\nWhat I hope (though am not limited to) to do RP wise however, is play a character in someone's world, basically exploring about and doing stories whenever the character stumbles upon them or happens to fall into one. A GM/DM is who I am primarily looking for as a partner (BUT not required!). And hopefully one who has no limits, like me. And yes, I'm fine with playing female characters too.\n\nIn terms of RP, I have no limits, so any story can go with me or anything can happen in RP and i'm fine with it.\n\nSo if you're interested in a partner with no limits, i'm up for it!\n\nIf you want to ask anything, make sure of anything or anything of the like, feel free to PM me or ask me with the Reddit chat system, though I do prefer the PM option more.\n\nThough please, don't just remove me while we're setting things up or whatever else. If you have the urge, please tell me why so we can work on it or so that I'd at least be aware. :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

If you reply two or three times a day, I'm not the one for you.\n\nI usually only do m/m and always have, but I have decided to expand on that a bit. If you would like to do m/f, I can compromise if you can and do both m/f and m/m. I tend to play more than one character because one plot between one couple is boring, so I require at least two pairings to be played. If it makes it easier, we can always start with one couple and use side characters until they naturally develop into a main relationship. My characters have been developed over time and they're all pretty different so there are plenty of plotlines we can come up with. \n\nI only do modern/realistic/slice of life plots. My favorite setting is high school, but if that's not your thing, we can always come up with something else. If we do end up doing high school, some of the pairings I have in mind could be:\n\nBest/good friends \nLove triangle\nIn the closet relationship \nTeacher/student \n+ Whatever else we can come up with together\n\nI expect the roleplay to be NSFW, but not all the time. And I would rather not use my email as I have way too much spam. If there's a messenger you like, let me know. \n\nI don't do fandoms. I don't write lengthy responses (again). I don't only write or play against tops or bottoms. I like variety. If I forgot anything else, just ask. \n\nShoot me a message for my info!",
