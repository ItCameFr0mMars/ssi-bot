            "selftext": " Introduction\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreetings all! I\u2019m new to the site and am currently looking for a long term role play partner. However, before we get to that let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am twenty-one years old with about eight years of role play experience under my belt. My first taste of role play came from a game called Gaia Online and that love only grew when I played my first session of Dungeons &amp; Dragons back in high school. I\u2019m currently a college student who also happens to work part-time which means my schedule can be chaotic. That being said I might not post as often as some of the young people but I am constantly exceeding the two thousand word limit on Discord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a lot of plot ideas that I am ready to test the waters with. When it comes to genres I have done classic fantasy stories in both high and low settings. I have been a runner in a cyberpunk dystopian future raging against the machine. I have walked the hot sands of an irradiated post-nuclear apocalypse wasteland. A captain controlling a star ship in the last free regions of the universe. As you can see I have a lot of interests when it comes to genres. Anywhere there is a story to be told that\u2019s where my heart longs to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tend to create big stories with side characters as I feel it makes the world more lively. I'd ask that you be okay with the idea of having multiple characters involved even if you don't play any of them. I started out as a game master for tabletop games so I feel very comfortable bringing multiple characters to life. When it comes to romance I prefer it to be slow burning and will write fade to black unless discussed privately. I'm also looking to have stories focus on a central plot with side stories showing up occasionally. If romance is a running theme in the story I will only do it if it's secondary to an actual plot. I'm open to stories without romance as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I ask in a partner is that they be active and interested in the story. I find the collaborative writing process to be thrilling so I don\u2019t want to have to handle the whole story alone. I am big into talking out and planning story arcs ahead of time in out of character chat! I also ask that you be nice and friendly as I tend to be a soft sensitive noodle just trying to have fun! My preferred writing style is the third person past tense and I\u2019d like someone who can at least write one or two paragraphs. All partners must be 18+ as I am twenty one and would like to write with other adults.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I prefer playing hetero male characters as my main characters. If we do an RP with multiple characters I am open to portraying side characters that are females and LGBT+ characters as I am all for representation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**General Pairings and Plot Summary**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #1 (Sheriff x Mysterious Stranger)**\n\nA lawless town has elected a young man to serve as sheriff. The young man is tasked with navigating the various trials and tribulations of bringing law and order while facing down his own personal demons. Just when he thought things couldn\u2019t get any more complicated a mysterious young woman drifted into town.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #2 (Bodyguard X Client)**\n\nA bodyguard begins his first day with a new client. He was assigned to protect a new female celebrity who recently rose to fame. All different types of rumors had begun to swirl about her. Some people claimed she was a diva and a nightmare to work with. Others said she was a delight and pleasure to be around. He was about to find out the truth about who she was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #3 (Vigilante X Hacker)**\n\nAfter being thought dead for years a city\u2019s lost son returned home. The city he returned to was but a hollow shell of its former self. Where there once stood a symbol of justice and order there was now a hive of injustice and chaos. It was worse than he thought but it didn\u2019t change his mind. He would lead a crusade against those who had corrupted his city and harmed its people.  However, he couldn\u2019t do it alone. He needed to find an ally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #4 (Vampire X Muse)**\n\nAn immortal creature of the night has become bored and uninspired after spending centuries walking the path alone. One can only watch mortals go to war and lead their civilizations to destruction so many times. A life he once spent reading and practicing his arts had now turned into one he lived for fun. He used his vast wealth to buy himself anything his heart desired but yet something was missing. He had to find it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #5 (Viking X Witch of the Wilds)**\n\nA young Viking with ambitions of rising to rule comes to a decision. He will travel to the vast wilds of the north in search of unmatched power. As a young lad, he heard tales of a beautiful woman who called the wilds to the north her home. Rumor had it that she could shift her shape and some claimed she could vanish into thin air. Nobody knew the truth but he was determined to find out. He hoped to convince her to aid him. However, he had no idea just how beautiful she\u2019d be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #6 (Hero X Villain)**\n\nA young hero battles corruption and injustice in his city. His days filled with maintaining the careful balance between his public persona and his alter ego. Things were going good until she showed up. Nobody claimed that evil had to be ugly well at least not on the outside. She was crazy and unpredictable not to mention emotionally volatile. However, he found himself enamored with her for better or worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #7 (Prince X Witch)**\n\nAn exiled prince stumbles upon a witch\u2019s cabin deep in the dark woods. He\u2019s injured and on the precipice of death when he finds her. She takes him and heals him but the reaction she received was unexpected. A natural sense of fear came over him as he was faced to face with a sorceress. Magic users are supposed to malevolent evil souls yet she saved his life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #8 (Bodyguard X Princess)**\n\nA young knight finds himself assigned to the task of protecting the princess. The two had practically grown up together within the castle's walls. Now it was time for her to begin meeting with potential suitors. She must marry well to protect her family and do what\u2019s best for the safety and security of the kingdom. His job is to make sure she is safe and when the time comes to escort her secretly to her betrothed lands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #9 Warrior X Empress (Inspired by the film Warriors Gate)**\n\nA gamer wakes up to find himself in a strange new world. He is the embodiment of his video game alter ego in a land reminiscent of feudal Japan. He is quickly introduced to the exiled Empress who he is instructed to protect. He doesn\u2019t have time to argue as the warrior disappears leaving him and the Empress alone in a small village. This didn\u2019t seem like a game anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #10 (Pirate Captain X Duchess)**\n\nAn exiled prince finds a new life on the open sea as a pirate captain. He finds most of his enjoyment in being a thorn in his father the king\u2019s side. One day while raiding a ship he stumbles upon the daughter of one of his father\u2019s enemies. It seemed she was being secretly transported out of her kingdom out of precaution for the coming war. The captain seeing value in having such a valuable pawn offers to house her on board. Allow the sword fights, naval combat, and moonlit romance to begin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot #11 (Trapped in a Virtual Video Game)**\n\nAfter going on a recent binge of anime where people get trapped in video games I'm longing for it! My main inspiration for this is the anime Grimgar, Ashes and Illusions. I love the more mature dark take that it took on the genre opposed to the other anime based on the same subject. I know this probably a long shot but thought I'd add it just to try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fandom**\n\n***When it comes to fandom I am open to it but will only do stories within the world. I prefer to use my own characters and stay away from canon as it's easy to make people upset. I'm not looking to have my narrative freedom restricted. I'll list some of the fandom I have done stories in for reference.***\n\n1. Dragon Age\n\n2. Mass Effect\n\n3. DC\n\n4. Marvel\n\n5. Fallout\n\n6. Supernatural\n\n7. Resident Evil\n\n8. Conan Exiles\n\n9. Destiny\n\n10. Firefly\n\n11. Stardew Valley\n\n12. Harvest Moon\n\n13. Mad Max\n\n14. Shadow of Mordor (LOTR Included)\n\n15. Red Dead Redemption\n\n16. Witcher\n\n17. XCOM\n\n18. Borderlands\n\n19. Wasteland\n\n20. Log Horizon/SOA\n\n21. How To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon Anime\n\n22. How To Train Your Dragon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI have more but seeing as this is the first post I don\u2019t want to scare people away. I hope that you all enjoyed this post and that I didn\u2019t bore you to tears. Thanks to everyone who took time to read this post in its entirety. If you are interested just let me know by posting in the thread or send a PM.  I hope to hear from some of you soon! If not I wish you guys all the best in your searches. Goodbye friends!",

Yes, my husband is fully aware of my role playing, there is nothing sneaky about it in my life. Roleplaying just is not something that he is into. I am over 18, and I would prefer my partner to also be over 18.\n\nHere is a list of roleplay topics that I am absolutely into. \n\n* Vampires\n* Demons/angels\n* Batman\n* Superman\n* Military (Special ops type stuff)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have storyline ideas for all but the Vampires, but I am open minded to hear whatever you have in mind. I am looking for action, adventure, and romance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am usually around to respond, however....like I said, I am a mom of 2. Stuff happens. I am also very patient, I understand life happens to people other than myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am open to using google docs, kik, discord....and if we get to know each other well enough, possibly text. If you have any other methods, just ask....the worst that could happen is that I say no. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat am I looking for in a partner?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A decent writer\n* Someone who is willing to write in 3rd person. I always feel like I can paint a scene better from 3rd person\n* Speaking of scenes, I LOVE A DESCRIPTIVE WRITER....you have no idea how excited I get when some one writes in a way that I can visualize\n* Some one who is patient and kind, yet unafraid to ask if he needs me to do something different\n* A male\n* I will accept a partner who can only reply once a day, but I do prefer at least a few back and forth sessions\n* Grammar DOES NOT HAVE TO BE PERFECT....but at least try.\n* 18 and older please \n* I need some one who can really get into the character\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDM me and we can discuss our roleplaying future together LOL!",

            "selftext": "This story takes place in a land where two kingdoms who once were at peace have started war over a stolen magical artifact called the Prism Stone which has the ability to control the emotions and motivations of whomever the holder of the Prism desires. The Prism was originally in the possession of YC's kingdom, your kingdom blames the kingdom of my character, Adornia; and has declared war between the kingdoms. This ruins the budding friendship of the two heirs to the kingdom Princess Serena of Adornia, and Prince [YC] of [your kingdom]. \n\nThe prince is raised to have a seething hatred towards the kingdom of Adornia and a bloodlust for the royalty's heads. He trains for most of his childhood to become an extremely gifted swordsman and leads the army of [your kingdom] with great pride. He is respected by his men and subjects but can never gain the approval of his father.  Meanwhile in Adornia, Princess Serena has dedicated her life to her studies and has decided the war is useless because she assumes the Prism was never stolen by her father or anyone from Adornia, but rather was either stolen by someone from [your kingdom], or has been kept by the prince's father in secret. \n\nAfter 12 years the princess and prince are destined to finally meet again when [YC] leads a raid on one of Adornia's outlying cities which Serena and several others are traveling on business. They do some damage to the group before the prince opens the carriage and pulls Serena out, as he lifts his sword to kill her they lock eyes and [YC] hesitates a moment to long, shocked to see her his childhood best friend, and is wounded and captured by Serena's remaining guards. \n\nSerena, seeing an opportunity, does everything she can to stop her father from having the prince executed and frequently visits his holding cell trying to make friends with him again but she is met with the prince's harshness for whatever reason you decide and is unsuccessful at making peace with him. Serena pleas for the prince\u2019s release, but is hindered by her Father\u2019s Hand, who presents the idea of a Life Debt. \n\nIdeally, this is a religious or spiritual concept in the prince\u2019s kingdom which states that if a life is saved by direct action of another, the rescued party must repay this action. Even if that means remaining beside their rescuer until the end of their days.  Knowing that it would be social suicide, not to mention possibly damnation of his soul, the prince agrees, vows his sword to Serena, and begrudgingly is forced into social interaction with her. \n \nFrom there, Serena begins work on trying to mend their friendship in hopes of finding a permanent solution to the war and ending it forever. The longer the two are together, the more they remember the friend they once had, and now see the person beside them; falling in Love all over again. \n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, please send me a PM. Looking forward to hearing from you.",

I\u2019m 24 years old and operate on EST. \n\n* I usually write about 400- 500 words per post, but I do my best to match, so I\u2019m willing to be flexible on length as long as you give me something to work with.\n* I can probably get you around 1-2 posts per day.\n* If for some reason I can\u2019t, I\u2019ll always let you know and I ask you try to do the same (except in like extreme circumstances, obviously).\n* That said, I\u2019m very patient. If you need time or are just feeling uninspired for a few days, just let me know.\n* I **LOVE** to chatter in OOC about our characters, life, pop culture, whatever. But it\u2019s cool if you don\u2019t.\n* **ROMANCE AND SMUT:** Romance is cool, sexual tension is cool, but as soon as we start getting into smutty territory, I\u2019d prefer a fade-to-black kind of scenario. \n* **PAIRINGS:** I almost exclusively write MxF with me playing the F. \n\n**Characters**\n\n* I almost exclusively write female characters. I\u2019ve tried writing males before and I didn\u2019t feel I was good with it, but I\u2019m willing to try if you\u2019re willing to be patient with me.\n   * **EXCEPTION:** I\u2019ll happily double though. Especially if there\u2019s gonna be romance involved. But again, you\u2019ll probably need to be patient with me!\n* I don\u2019t mind what your actual gender is, as long as you\u2019re willing to either double or play a male. \n* I write characters for each roleplay to make things easier for plotting. I have a basic character sheet I use, but I\u2019ll put in as much or as little effort as you do. \n\n**Cravings (in no particular order)**  \n**NOTE: Prompts from** [**http://plotsforall.tumblr.com**](http://plotsforall.tumblr.com/)\n\n**Victorian Era plot (MxF) -** I\u2019d be happy to play either muse A or B.\n\nWhen their successful, merchant father amasses enough wealth to afford a valuable piece of property, a rather unrefined **Muse A** finds themselves thrust suddenly into the upper class. Though they have no title by birth, Muse A is now considered eligible for courtship by noble sort. Now more than ever, it\u2019s of great importance that **Muse A** learns proper deportment- how to conduct themselves in society-from a professional; **Muse B** is hired for this purpose, to prepare **Muse A** for their debut to society at a grand ball. Every day **Muse A** attends etiquette lessons, in which **Muse B** attempts to teach essentials such as how to dress, how to ride a horse, and how to behave at a formal banquet and so on. **Muse A** proves to be an exhausting student, never quite behaving as they should, questioning every rule. \n\n**Music Fluff (MxF) -** I\u2019d play Muse A\n\n**Muse A** has just received a generous gift of a baby grand piano from a well-off relative who\u2019s passed. Every day **Muse A** marvels at the gorgeous instrument and runs his/her fingers along the keys wishing he/she could play the thing. After some time, **Muse A** finally resolves to take piano lessons in honor of their dearly departed. **Muse B** is giving piano lessons to earn some extra cash. There\u2019s an instant physical attraction between **Muse A** and **Muse B**, but the relationship stays professional at first. Over the course of several lessons, an honest, sweet affection between the pair grows. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Other Genres I Like (in no particular order)**  \nI live for someone who can GM and worldbuild because I feel like I am not good at it myself. So, if you have any ideas for any of the below, please let me know!\n\n* Medieval fantasy \n* Any kind of rivalry/ love-hate relationship plot\n* Slice of life\n* Historical with touches of magic\n\nIf any of this sounds interesting to you, DM me and we can chat!",

            "selftext": "You had never known your mother. Dad often spoke of her though, that rare dreamy tone in his voice. A 'great and beautiful woman'. The \u2018Most intelligent person he had ever known\u2019 and \u2018as Kindhearted as a saint.\u2019 It was becoming difficult to continue believing that. She had to have been around for your birth of course, but as soon as you turned two she left you, as dad explains, and returned to her homeland far to the West. The Spirit Valley. Otherwise known as Elin Hal. Dad had made her out to be some kind of incredible, all powerful witch who was needed by her clan, she had a great duty to fulfil and leaving the sleepy island town you had spent your entire life on, leaving you, was a small sacrifice in the name of the greater good.\n\nStill, it would be difficult not to resent her. A childhood that had been stripped away before you even knew it. Dad had attempted to raise you on his own. A doctor by trade, a pleasant man, well respected by loyal patients within town. But a doctor has a lot of work and, despite his best attempts, for the most part you were left to your own devices. There wasn't much to do on the island nation of Hanstrasia. It was populous enough not be a wasteland, busy enough so that one could work as any job they wished as long as they were qualified. But nothing seemed to happen. One would go through school, attend college, get a job, find a partner, get married... It was a simple stable uneventful existence. And that was how you always thought it would be.\n\nUntil you received the letter. A request to meet, sent from your mother, who signed the brief document by the name Cecile Vengi. It was the first time you had experienced her actions directly. After much debate and encouragement from dad, who didn't seem to mind Cecile had changed her last name, you decided to rent passage on a merchant airship to the mainland and travel to the Spirit Valley, the famous, but distant, pilgrimage site. The homeland of witches.\n\nAs soon as you left your boring but safe island things started going wrong. The crew who maintained the airship proved to be lazy and uncooperative with you. The 'War of the Lions' between the great democratic Northern Federation and expansionist Southern Empire had spread to the east of the mainland and the fear of winding up in the hands of either nation had petrified the crew. To make matters even worse, you had just been boarded by pirates. Or at least, you thought you had. rustling and shouting from up on deck and foreign, unfamiliar tongues echoed through the steel corridors of the airship. The vessel itself had slowed, merely floating sluggishly within the sky, a desperate attempt at escape seemingly halted. Out the port hole window you could see a small, streamlined black vessel, its float dust vents emitting a slight purple haze. A triplet of winch harpoons preventing any hope of your merchant ship from breaking away, and even then, it would have been quite impossible to outrun the pirate hunter.\n\nLeft alone in the sky, nothing but the open ocean several thousand feet beneath you, the world seemed totally silent for a brief moment. Then the unmistakable sound of footsteps crept faintly from behind your cabin\u2019s door.\n\n--\n\nI am looking for a partner to RP with on discord. The RP would revolve around the story of an 18 year old woman in a fantasy world on a journey to meet her mother for the first time. Along the way she would meet many interesting characters, discover much more about the world she inhabits, and solve the mysteries surrounding her mother. To a certain extent this is a coming of a age story, with a young woman leaving her home for the first time, discovering what kind of person she is and what kind of person she might become.\n\nI normally write two or three paragraphs a response and can ordinarily make one response a day.\n\nWe shall discuss your character and how the roleplay is going to work over discord.\n\nI eagerly await to hear from you.",

I\u2019m also married and dinner time tends to be my most hectic time so my replies during that time will be sparce until the kids go to bed. \nI love zombies, pirates, Harry Potter, GoT.

As we approach the body to investigate it vanishes in a black mist.\n\nConfused and dumbfounded we go to report the deed, only to find the deceased party alive and well, leading to further confusion.\n\nSo this first plot is a nice little conspiracy, shapeshifters are invading and taking over positions of power, this will lead to us trying to uncover and the plot before the shapeshifters take over.\n\nMany years ago the world was ruled by the demon king Satanael along with his seven deadly sins and demon armies. The only thing that managed to stop his iron tight grasp was the combined forces of ten great wizards who managed to seal away the demon king and his underlings, however this came at a great price for the wizards, they each sacrificed their bodies becoming keys for the seal which holds the demons.\n\nWe now jump forward in time, worshippers of the demon king have began to gather the 10 keys, having four within the grasp, they plan to release Satanael and have him rule once again.\n\nNow in this prompt we would ether play as the king\u2019s elite squad, sent out only on the most dangerous of missions or a group of adventurers coming across the plot and feeling a need to stop the resurrection of the demon king.\n\nThe third and final prompt involves us playing as already existing adventures who have suffered their most devastating defeat, this leads to us being sold off to some foreign island where we work as prisoners trying to find some way to escape the island and captivity.\n\nSo those are my prompts.\n\nNow what do I expect from you? Well not too much actually, all I ask is you be enthusiastic and for your post length, just give me something to work with, that\u2019s all. \n\nI enjoy using 3rd person however I am always fine with playing in the 1st.\n\nI\u2019ll mention once again I\u2019m not married to these ideas. I hope at least one of them has tickled your fancy, so please just send me a message, I\u2019m friendly and don\u2019t bite :)",

            "selftext": " Hello there!\n\nI\u2019m Tams, an avid roleplayer who has been writing in some form or another for so long that I\u2019ve practically lost count. (This is just a diplomatic way of calling myself 'old'. As such, I definitely need you to be 18 or older.)\n\nI don\u2019t get too into word counts or anything, but I\u2019m definitely the type of gal who tries to balance quality and quantity. I want to give my partners plenty to work off of and hope they are willing and able to return the favor. The introductory posts that I write to start off a scene can, at times, be particularly prolific, but I swear, I\u2019m relatively easy-going.\n\nThat being said, I do have a career and family and an organization that I volunteer with. These things will, of course, always take priority, but I have been making time for writing practically my entire life and don\u2019t plan to stop anytime soon. Usually, I get out at least one post a day (generally either at the start of my day or in the evenings when things are winding down).\n\nI\u2019m really only interested in Female x Male pairings, and I am definitely more interested in playing female. However, I do have a couple of male characters I wouldn\u2019t mind reviving for the right scene and character.\n\nWhen it comes to NSFW content, I\u2019m cool with it if it fits in the plot. I\u2019m definitely not going to go out of my way just to have characters boinking for the sake of boinking, but I\u2019m no prude either. I\u2019m just as comfortable Fading to Black.\n\nSo, on to some general interests:\n\n* Anything Emotionally Charged\n* Modern Fantasy/Supernatural\n* Dark &amp; Gritty\n* Fairytale Retellings - Modern or Otherwise\n* Age of Sail/Pirate Inspired\n* Slow Burn/Sexual Tension\n* Fantasy\n* Historical\n* Powers/Gifted Individuals\n* Slice of Life (So long as there is some sort of tension to keep it interesting)\n* Rivals Turn Lovers\n* Star-Crossed\n* Cop/Mark x Criminal\n* Old Sweethearts or Friends Reunited\n\nI\u2019ve only dabbled in a small handful of Fandoms, and you would be hard-pressed to talk me into anything other than OCs. I\u2019m most comfortable/interested in the following (but feel free to suggest others if you think we might be a good fit):\n\n* Hunger Games\n* Harry Potter (Especially love Marauders\u2019 Era)\n* Game of Thrones\n\nIf you have something you want to try that isn\u2019t on this list, then please, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me, as this is hardly an exhaustive list! I would love to hear your ideas and see what we might be able to think up together!",

            "selftext": "^(*skip past the horizontal lines if you want to read boring information before exciting story*)\n\n___\n\nA thousand tiny points of light, flickering alone in the inky darkness around it, each so far away. Some shone brighter than others and among them, something truly special: a cluster of brightness among many scattered individuals, calling out into the void for the others. Vindictus opened her eyes, returning herself to her material senses. The Force had let her peer out into the galaxy and catch a mere glimpse of those who too could sense the power of the Force. It showed her where to find Skywalker, and his latest collection of padawans.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe lights switched back on from a mere gesture. Such a trivial use of the Force required hardly a thought from a Sith as aged as she. She reclaimed her lightsabers, each set delicately at her side when meditating, and rose to her feet. Her typical dress had become rather uniform-like over time when in the absence of her cloak. She replaced it with an officer\u2019s uniform coat, unbuttoned, with a fleet admiral designation whenever she was aboard the *Relentless*, or any other navy warship. She drew her mask back over her nose and headed for the turbolift.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe slipped onto the bridge without a sound. Were it not for the doors of the lift opening, her arrival would go completely unannounced. The commanding officer of the *Relentless* had served under her for over ten years, with another eight in previous stations. He was not long for the Imperial Navy and soon she would have to undertake the arduous task of selecting a new commander for the flagship of the Imperial Navy battlefleet. \u201cSir?\u201d the graying admiral addressed his elder.\n\n\u201cAdmiral,\u201d Vindictus offered an uncommon acknowledgement, \u201cis it too far out of the way to bring *Relentless* to Ossus?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cOssus ...\u201d the admiral turned from the shadowy woman and consulted the holotable for a star chart. The distance from the battlefleet\u2019s present station at Fondor to the outer rim sector including Ossus was substantial. \u201cTo take one of our most powerful dreadnoughts, and flagship nonetheless, so far out would pose ... a strategic risk, to say the least Sir. Does your endeavor require the firepower of this ship specifically?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlikely. My quarry is small.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould an *Imperator* class be sufficient then, Sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cProviding it has troop transports, it should be.\u201d\n\nAgain he consulted the holotable, querying the available ships in the system he could provide to the Sith lord. \u201cI shall contact the *Adjudicator* and have them prepare for departure if that is acceptable Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cContact Hangar 2 as well. Have them prepare a shuttle for transfer.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight away Sir!\u201d He snapped a salute and turned towards the forward to make the necessary preparations.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVindictus creeped off the deck yet again without a sound, on her way to the hangar bay to begin her hunt. This was the game they played. The Empire would find Skywalker and hunt him until he slipped away again. Skywalker would hide for a while, and then go back to training a new set of Force sensitives in the ways of the Jedi. The Empire would find him again and the cycle continued over and over and neither the great Luke Skywalker, nor the mysterious Darth Vindictus could bring the loop to an end. The Sith lord walked out onto the gargantuan flight deck of Hangar 2, making for a small shuttle that would take her to a cruiser perfectly suited to her task. This hunt was special. Not only would Skywalker be there, but one of his padawans had drawn her attention in her meditation. A second prize was up for grabs beyond the satisfaction of finally claiming Skywalker\u2019s head.\n\n___\n\nWhat can I say. I've always been a fan of the dark side. I've written this character as an apprentice to Lord Vader before but now, after the Battle of Endor claimed the lives of the Emperor, Lord Vader, and most of the Imperial Navy chain of command, she has become the master. This prompt was originally written for someone else intending to write a captive Jedi padawan, and while I am by no means restricting myself to that exact pairing, I very much want to explore the dynamic of the training of a Sith Lord, this time from the perspective of the master rather than the apprentice. The exact timeframe of this is flexible, existing somewhere in the empty space between *Return of the Jedi* and *The Force Awakens*. It takes the new-canon material as a loose guide (*some commentary about altering the past affecting the future*).\n\nThat intro is about 600 words, which is only slightly above average for my usual posts and uncharacteristically brief for a typical starter. I prefer to write in some medium that works well with long-form of that nature, which is to say that Discord or other IM-style platforms are right out. I've learned well enough to force Reddit markdown to do my bidding and PMs are a generally preferable avenue. If anything about this strikes your fancy, you know where to find my inbox. I especially like reading mock-replies to these example starters and while we may not use the above post word for word as the actual start of a roleplay, it's a fantastic way for me to get a feel of your writing, ideas, and inspirations. It's so incredibly hard to say no to good writing these days.",

But the board of directors, and even my overbearing mother, insist I get one.* \n\n*None of the applicants look good. No, seriously, none of them LOOK decent enough to stand by me (or in the background) in news articles and interviews. The ones that look like they have a chance don\u2019t have the experience I\u2019m looking for, or they look like they\u2019re saving themselves for God himself. Hundreds of them\u2026 I\u2019ve been sorting through, looking them up on Instagram and Facebook. No. Absolutely not. This one was a Girl Scout for her entire life\u2026 That\u2019s awful.* \n\n*I\u2019m not sure who I need, but I\u2019ll know them when I see them. I have a nose for these things - a gut feeling. I\u2019ve relied on my instincts thus far and I\u2019ve managed to make a multi billion dollar company out of five thousand dollars so I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty good at my job.*\n\n*They say I\u2019m immature, difficult, and cocky. I do what I want when I want. I indulge myself, and apparently I\u2019m one of the most eligible bachelors in the world. Top five, but who really reads those things? I\u2019m also know for getting into some serious PR trouble, and I love the spotlight. I like showing off and I enjoy my money. I drive fast motorcycles and throw money at charities and good causes because that\u2019s what Jesus would do,* \n\n*So, where\u2019s my perfect assistant?* \n\n*This resume looks promising\u2026 and his Instagram makes him look cute\u2026* \n\n*Speaks three languages.* \n\n*Graduated top of their class.*\n\n*Has a master\u2019s in interpersonal communications.*\n\n*Bachelor\u2019s in HR management.*\n\n*Years of experience.*\n\n*Knows various office programs - everyone does, that\u2019s nothing new.* \n\n*And, wait a minute, they want to someday have my job? Oh, that\u2019s rich! Let\u2019s get them an interview.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nLooking for someone to apply to be my character\u2019s chief executive assistant. I\u2019m looking for  M//. You must be over eighteen, preferably over 21.   \nI write in third person, past tense, multi paragraphs. I\u2019m looking for someone who can keep up and write fluidly and well, great with detail and description.  \nThis will be slice of life, drama, angst, romance, and possibly violence. I want to focus on the romance - the secretary being the only person that can reel in my character and get him to care, bend, and soften. It can go the NSFW route as well.   \nWe can add some elements of fantasy as well, if you wish. Probably make my character a superhero or your secretary a superhero. Something like that.   \n\n\nWe can also add other options as well, such as:\n\n* The secretary is a spy for a competitor \n* The secretary is homeless.\n* The secretary moonlights as a stripper/prostitute/famous novelist/etc. \n* The secretary has been crushing on my character since the dawn of time. \n* My character has been crushing on yours since the dawn of time (seeing him at the same coffee shop, stalks his social media, maybe your character saved him, or vice versa on the streets).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout Me: \n\n* GMT -5 or CST\n* female in her 20s\n* not always avaialble\n* Discord\n* may consider gdocs\n* long term\n* ooc chatter welcome / open communication\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe administrative assistant would probably have to approach my character in one of two ways: innocent, determined, hardworking, naive, and loyal. OR equally cocky, sarcastic, tough, loyal.   \nIf you\u2019re interested, please message me.",

I've been roleplaying for quite a few years now and this is just my preferred medium.\n* FxM pairings, willing to play either\n* OC characters and worlds\n* NSFW content is alright with me but cannot be the main focus of the plot, and prefer non-graphic\n* Someone chill and willing to discuss plot ideas or share Pinterest boards OOC\n\n**Plots I'm Interested In:**\n\n* **Medieval Fantasy**\n* **Heists and thieves**\n* **Western Fantasy**\n* **Slice of life set in post-apocalyptic/medieval/historical settings**\n* **Post-apocalyptic**\n\nThese are just a few of the things I've been craving lately. Feel free to bring up any other plot ideas, I'm open to anything. I'm pretty chill and I like the collaborative process that comes before and after the plot, so if you think you can vibe with someone like that as a partner, feel free to shoot me a message (:",

            "selftext": "With shining lights on your skin you left the stage. Sweat ran down your skin, the crowd outside was cheering and louder than any crowd you had ever seen from your stage ever before. As you looked around the backstage area you knew everyone was a bit shook by the performance you had given with your band. Leslie, your bigger sister, was sitting on a case with her guitar between her legs, staring into the nothingness of the cables behind stage; Kylie, the drummer was nervously tapping her fingers on a metal bar; Jenny, your second guitar player was walking up and down trying to handle the weight of the performance that lay behind you. That all was interrupted when your manager rushed inbetween your little group. \"Jesus Christ girls, you just rocked that monster stage... Imagine the press after this! You will be the faces of this festival tomorrow! I already...\" at this point your focus shifted. Something on the stage had changed. The crowd was silent, but an incredible tension filled the air. Then the whole audience erupted as a bone shaking hit of the kick drum came from the backside of the stage, directly by the airfilling harmony of a distorted guitar and a haunting bass. The guys on the stage were instantly known to you. The biggest band of your era had just taken the stage after you and they looked like they hadn't done anything else in their life ever. You noticed how everyone had bunched up behind you to watch from backstage and get mesmerized by how incredibly mesmerizing the singer stood in front of the audience, playing with them a bit only to get back to his guitar and unleash a lion like raw from it.\n\nAfter the last monument of a song had finished they waved goodbye and left the stage, directly towards you. The others of your band mumbled a shy congratulation while you just stood there paralysed. The last one to walk past you was the singer. He looked at you with a generous smirk on his face. \"You guys really rocked the crowd out there. Not bad.\" This small comment made your eyes glow as if you just had won the lottery...\n\n\nHey, if you managed it this far congratulations for listening to my basic idea. A very normal love story with the only difference being that you're part of a new and upcoming girl band while I'm part of the perhaps biggest band of our time.

As the legends say a Dragonborn rises, but no one was accounting on two Dragonborns arising. \n\nA thief hides with her guild, taking up her duties as a Nightingale in secret, refusing to lead the Thieves Guild, and turns her back on the way of the voice after being called upon by the Greybeards. Evel refuses to face her future as a Dragonborn and no one can pressure her into taking the position if no one knows...\n\nInterested? 15 or over? Please DM me and we can discuss more about the rp. Also I'm not a professional on Skyrim or The Elder scrolls games in general so if you have information to share with me please do tell! I always love to know more about the games and hear about all types of lore. \n\nI use Discord only btw!",

            "selftext": "Hello there friends!\n\nI am currently searching for long term RP partners for some interesting RPs.\n\nA little bit about me:\n\nI am a 20 year old female with about 7 or 8 years of experience and even longer writing experience (~9 or 10). \n\nEST time zone\n\nI RP third person and my responses range anywhere from a paragraph to even a page depending on what is happening in the RP.  (I also do try to match responses) \n\nIf for some reason you grow bored or disinterested please do let me know and we can fix it or try something else completely. \n\nI love chatting outside of RP whether it be about our characters, future plot points, coming up with characters in AU\u2019s or just general chat! Although if that\u2019s not your thing then no worries!\n\nI do have a full time job and have responsibilities after so my responses depending may be a couple responses a day to a couple every other day. \n\nFor fandom RPs, I can do canon and OC characters (although I am more used to canon), and I can play both males and females. I also love to RP multiple characters (more plot devices and interaction that way after all!  Character interaction, development, and world building is a must! I love building things to it\u2019s full potential. \n\nAlso, I do quite enjoy looking at characters from different angles even if that means switching between character POV in the RP, but if you\u2019re more of a one or two character interaction type of person that\u2019s fine, but I certainly don\u2019t mind playing side characters or extras to bring the world to life.\n\nSome games I have played:\n\nI will put asterisks next to ones I am inspired for or that I know the most about.\n\nUndertale\n\u2014Detroit: Become Human *\n\u2014Spider-Man (PS4 2018) \n\u2014Final Fantasy (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 13, 13-2, 13-3, 15 and Kingsglaive, Dissidia, Crisis Core) \n\u2014Tales (Berseria, Xillia, and Graces f) \n\u2014Legend of Zelda (MM, TP, WW, SS, BOTW) *\n\u2014Telltales The Walking Dead \n\u2014Fire Emblem (Awakening, Warriors)\n\nShows/movies:\n\n\u2014Marvel (most movies including Spiderverse and also daredevil, not so much comics) \n\u2014Sherlock * \n\u2014Miraculous LB *\n\u2014RWBY * \n\u2014Sword Art Online Arc 1 &amp; 2 (more the universe)\n\u2014Sword Art Online Season 2 (more the universe)\n\u2014The Seven Deadly Sins \n\n\nBooks:\n\n\u2014Percy Jackson\n\u2014The Chronicles Of Nick\nWarriors\n\u2014Maximum Ride\n\u2014Antigoddess *\n\u2014Beautiful Creatures\n\nOriginal ideas I enjoy:\n\n\u2014Fantasy (medieval, magical elements, kingdoms, different races, even adding in tech like airships, modern weapons, and exploring more than one and a variety of aspects as well. There\u2019s so much more I could add but it would take forever.)\n\u2014\u2014&gt; war themes, royal themes, different aspects of life themes\n\n\u2014Romance (MxF and possibly FxF and I don\u2019t do smut. More of a fade to black sort of person) I also thoroughly enjoy building it up over time rather than it simply happening! \n\n\u2014Action/Adventure\n\n\u2014Angst/Drama\n\nI am sure there are more things I am forgetting. \n\nI would be fine exploring any other sorts of themes/plots genres except Sci-Fi and Slice of life (normal themes would need some convincing as I find it difficult to keep it going) as I like some sort of magical or fictional aspect to it. \n\nIf you have any other suggestions/ideas/plots/settings as to what you would like to do then please shoot me a PM with a bit about you and your interests and we can discuss! Give me a bit about your interests and preferences! I am open to nearly anything!\n\nIf you need a sample of my writing, please do not be afraid to ask! \n\nMy platforms are Kik, Discord, Skype, Email, Google Docs and Reddit PM\n\nThank you and I hope to hear from you soon!

            "selftext": "I'm looking for someone who would be interested in roleplaying as characters from, but not limited to, these universes. This does not necessarily need to be sexual in nature. Totally up to you! \n\nTO BE CLEAR, THESE ARE CHARACTERS I WANT MY PARTNER TO PLAY AS. There has been some confusion lately as to what this list is for. My top favorite characters will be in italics. \n\nG.I. Joe: obvious choice first, Baroness/Destro or Baroness/Cobra Commander. I'm also open to Scarlett and Lady Jaye.\n\nGame of Thrones: Pretty much anything goes here. Any characters and any scenarios. My preferences are *Dany*, Margaery, *Sansa*, Cersei and Arya. But I do prefer a more romantic type of scenario, like a courtship. That being said, I'm open to a lot more. \n\n**Marvel Comics**: *Mary Jane Watson*, Black Cat, *She-Hulk*, Jean Gray, X-23, Susan Storm, Kitty Pryde, Rogue, *Scarlet Witch*, Gamora, *Nebula*, Elektra, Jessica Jones, *Captain Marvel*, *Black Widow*, The Wasp, *Mystique* and Gwen Stacy are my favs. However I am open to all sorts of characters and ideas on this one. (If you do this or DC, I'll jump right onboard) (I have an absolute assload of ideas surrounding Endgame and the aftermath, including fitting some non-MCU pieces into the MCU) \n\n**DC Comics**: *Batgirl*, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Zatanna, Power Girl, Super Girl, *Wonder Woman*. Again, open to all sorts of characters here.\n\nMass Effect: This is the only one I have a preference on who I play. I prefer to play either Garrus or BroShep. I'm open to pretty much any female character here, but my personal faves are any of the Asari, *Vetra*, Tali or FemShep. Also willing to do something Andromeda related.\n\nStar Wars: Open to anything really. Especially EU characters. Leia, *Rey*, Padme, and Phasma are the top choices as of now. Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke\u2019s character in Solo) is of particular interest to me as of now. \n\nMetal Gear Solid: Anything involving Big Boss or Solid Snake. Particularly drawn to The Boss and Quiet right now. \n\nMortal Kombat: *Sonya*, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, *Cassie*, and Jacqui. \n\nStar Trek: No one really specific. The three I'm personally interested in are Janeway, Seven of Nine and Troi. But I'm pretty much open to everyone, including OCs.\n\nThere are also a number of celebrities that I\u2019m open to using, including many of the actresses that portray the characters I\u2019ve listed here. As well as a few other non-fandom ideas I have. Feel free to ask about this option as well! \n\nAll roles are 18+ and to be played as adults. \n\nIf none of these options feel suitable to you, feel free to name your favorites and I can see what I can work with. And if you come across this post at any time, it\u2019s still open for responses!",

I'm pretty familiar with comics (I've read quite a bit), but I base most of my characters off of whatever show/movie they're in. I've been roleplaying for about 8 years now, and writing is one of my passions! Now, let's get down to business. :)\n\nSome characters I play (and who I would be looking for to ship them with):\n\nWanda Maximoff (Vision preferably, Steve Rogers, Stephen Strange, Loki Laufeyson, Natasha Romanoff, and maybe a couple others).\n\nJean Grey (Scott Summers).\n\nKaren Page (Frank Castle and Matt Murdock).\n\nElektra Natchios (Matt Murdock).\n\nJessica Jones (Luke Cage).\n\nI'm a pretty simple woman, but I do have some rules:\n\n1. NO OCs! Please only contact me if you want to play a CANON character and please adhere to how the character acts and speaks. I don't want someone who plays Vision to act like a normal man. He's a robot, he's gonna be a little awkward!\n2. Please have correct grammar, punctuation, etc. and be willing to write more than one or two sentences, depending on what is happening. I'm fine with shorter responses, but only if there is a good amount of detail in it!\n3. I like to do pretty NSFW stuff, so please be a little bit older and mature. If you're not comfortable with that but still want to rp, please just tell me! I'll be fine without NSFW material.\n4. Please keep everything in 3rd person pov. Nothing bothers me more than someone writing in 1st person pov.\n\nIf you want to roleplay with me, please message me and I'll be more than happy to give you my Kik, Discord, Tumblr, email, etc.!\n\nThank you for taking your time out of your day to read this!",

I love moment to moment RP where one day our characters could be fighting for their lives against hordes of undead and a few days later they could be going about their day together shopping for items or Dinner. \n\nI'm a sucker for romances that are drawn out and have a slower build that leads to explosive passion, and I'd rather not fade to black. So if that sort of thing sounds good to you please let me know. My intention is to play a male but you might convince me otherwise. Doesn't matter to me what your gender is or what you'd like to play. I'm open to all types.\n\nPlease come with ideas! I'm discovering that my favourite way to play is when my partner and I collaboratively DM for one another and share the responsibility of crafting the narrative and playing NPCs and it's something I'm not flexible on. \n\nAnd lastly I prefer to play this on Discord.",

Though they aren't considered kings or queens of their mage classes anymore, the royal families are believed to be the first blood lines to develop their particular kind of magics. As such, royalty have always been the law-makers for mages worldwide. In the late 1800s, a rebel sect of mages rose up to attack the royals and all of their complicit, loyal subjects - resulting in a Mage Civil War.\n\nMany mages and their royal families were killed off, while the beast mage class disappeared entirely. From that war, the High Council was formed. A collection of the remaining royal houses, electing one member of their family to represent them in the governing of the mage community.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the original eight royal families, only five are alive in present day. Additionally, two new mage classes have been discovered. Without a way to track the new class's lineage, Mythics and Necromancers have been left without a representative in the Council. As a result, many laws passed since their discovery have been created seemingly for the purpose of keeping Necromancers and Mythics at a disadvantage. While the newest class, Mythics, are sigil-bound at a young age to feel an automatic pull toward royal families, they often grow up to be employed as maids or servants for the royals.\n\nSince 2016, another uprising of rebels has been seen. Between then and 2019 (present day), many royals and loyalists alike have lost their lives in terrorist attacks by these Rebels. In the last year of the group story on Discord, students have been attacked both on and off campus, leading many to believe there are Rebels among the ranks of Rookshaven, despite the school being run by the Council.\n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n\\- Monthly events in which your character can earn points to put into their dice, making them stronger.\n\n\\- Lots of lore.\n\n\\- Outlined mage classes, as well as factions to push their own agendas (Royals, Loyalists, Rebels, Sympathizers).\n\n\\- Friendly players willing to work with new players to create backstories and social networks.\n\n\\- A secondary server only viewable to applied and approved players where you can post playlists, aesthetic images, social media posts, journal entries, as well as having 1-2 private channels specific to your character for housing and training.\n\n\\- Active Staff willing to help new players any way we can and get players immersed in the story faster.\n\n\\- Patience. It's a lot of lore. It's okay if it takes a while to get through it all.\n\n\\- An NPC Library to check out characters for scenes when your own characters are locked down.\n\n**What we expect:**\n\n\\- literacy\n\n\\- a 3 paragraph minimum per post (there are exceptions to this, but the majority of players should strive for this)\n\n\\- realistic characters that fit the server lore\n\n\\- activity every 2 weeks, or communication with the Admins if you need to take time away\n\n\\- read the FAQ\n\n\\- a drive to grow as a writer\n\n**Classes Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Water\n\n\\- Darkness\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n\\- Earth\n\n\\- Necromancy\n\n**Locked Classes:**\n\n\\- Beast (planned to be unlocked in early 2019, only available as secondary characters)  \n\\- Hybrid Mages (mages born from opposite classed parents, or from one Mirskoy parent)  \n\\- Mythics (available as secondary characters, due to them being difficult to play)\\*\n\n\\*Are available presently under rare circumstances, talk to an Admin.\n\n**Royal Families Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Dark\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n**Upcoming/Ongoing Events:**  \n\\- Hybrid Relations Act Event (abduction &amp; experimentation on hybrid mages)  \n\\- Forest Games  \n\\- Internment Arc  \n\\- Summer Trips  \n\\- Sigil Exclusion Arc  \n\n\n[Link to Rookshaven on Discord](https://discord.gg/64HWFYy)",

I like to say of myself that I'm a rather advanced/good writer but I don't expect you to be a virtuoso of the words.\n\nI would like you to try tho as what I have in mind is a dark/horror type story that doesn't focus on direct interaction but is more like writing a story together. I would give you a starter that sets the tone and should be good enough to capture your interest if you like the same type of stories as I do.\nNow this starter will not have an introduction or any characters, it is basically a description of a general scenery and mood. I would like you to try and catch up on the horror type of feeling and continue the story for one or two paragraphs how you would like it to. This way we create something together that draws its fun from reading the others parts and thinking about how to carry on with what happens.\n\nIn case anyone should be interested I would like you to send me a PM. I will await you behind the fog of mystery, stranger",

I love strange pairings and unexplored avenues.\n\nI have no limits within the law of the US, play mostly female characters, and write third person past tense. I haven't written in a looooong time, so I dont know what my post length is going to be like. It used to fluctuate between 2 and 6 paragraphs. \n\nI'll world build and develop characters forever if you let me, so feel free to interrupt, always.\n\nWe can communicate with whatever just let me know what you prefer.

English isn't my first language so I'm not too strict on grammar. Post-wise: As long as it has character, and not a one-liner, I'll be happy. \n\nI am defintely looking for some NSFW elements, so like I said, 19+, and we'll discuss more on that in private.\n\nDisclaimer: I do not support any anti-semetic ideas. This is just an RP. There will be dark themes, so be warned.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDuring the Battle of Britain, the Germans took the radar systems of the British to be their number one priority. And after a week of day and night air-raids, the British advanced means of reconnaisence was destroyed. Leaving them blind as to the movements of the German Luftwaffe, giving the RAF (Royal Air Force) no time to prepare for the next targets. Airfields &amp; Naval Ports.\n\nWithin a month, the RAF was crippled, the Royal Navy at the mercy of the Luftwaffe. A coupe was held in London, Churchill was outsted as Prime Minister, and Great Britiain surrendered to the Third Reich.\n\nSoon after, Germany declared war on the Soviet Union. The United States doubled down on isolationist policy after losing both if its key allies in Europe. Leaving the Soviet Union without any Lend-Lease benefits, and without it, they were unable to properly arm the Soviet War Machine that awaited the necessary resources to fight off the German invasion.\n\nOntop of that, Turkey, through backroom deals and a coup, joined the Axis forces, assisting the Germans with their invasion of the Caucaus Fields, securing two-thirds of the oil supply from Russian hands. It took an entire year before the Bear surrendered to Germany. Who established the grand-plan of Lebensraum, puppeting the rest of the Russian area to the Ural Mountains. \n\nAmerica, having never 'officially' entered the war, lays in wait of an invasion by the Axis. Standing alone against tyranny.\n\nYou are/could (if you have a different idea, I'm all ears) be a deep-undercover agent of the Allies, posing as an SS Guard to my character after learning that she had been working on a massive project that could completely annihilate the allies, or be used to turn the tide of the war in favor of freedom.",

I\u2019m looking for someone- anyone- to help me with a monumentous task.\n\nI\u2019m currently world building a setting for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I want to give it some history. It\u2019s a low fantasy setting, of which I plan to have more written from its ancient era all the way to its industrial era. That\u2019s where you come in!\n\nMy current focus is the medieval era. I need someone who wants to take on the role of either\n\nA. A great, legendary hero\nB. A great King/Queen\n\nI have two stories I want to tell, of how this great hero saves a region from destruction, and of how this great Monarch used their charisma, wit, and sheer cunning to conquer a certain region and bring it to glory.\n\nThe hero story will involve lots of traditional RPG stuff. Adventuring, traveling, great baddies, and everything in between. Again, it\u2019s low fantasy, but there\u2019s still enough there for it to be fun!\n\nThe Monarch story is more about political intrigue, diplomacy, courtship, as well as grand battles on a sort of huge army vs huge army scale (eventually).\n\nWe can also do both! But preferably only one at a time. Whatever comes of this grand tale I plan to incorporate into my setting to bring it to life for my players.\n\nPlease PM me for more details if you\u2019re interested! I have maps of my world, as well as very specific stuff in mind for my definition of \u201clow fantasy\u201d. Hope to talk soon!",

I am looking for a long-term active and experienced roleplayer that would be interested in building an awesome story with! I have a few ideas but would like to hear some of yours as well.

I like to put my characters through tough situations and challenges. I like relationships to go from disliking each other and grow from there.**(+18 writers only)**\n\n# What I am not looking for:\n\n* **Ghosting.** If you have to take a short break, just say so.\n* **Powergamers**. People who never ever have anything wrong happen to them or intentionally try to steer a story to benefit them.\n* **Short responses.** Of course it's going to happen occasionally, especially with conversations, but I appreciate at least a paragraph for most responses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, shoot me a message if you're interested so far! I'd love to chat about some character ideas and scenarios with you. **If you have a few plot ideas that would be a bonus. I have a few of my own but I tend to enjoy incorporating them into yours.**\n\n# I look forward to hearing from you :)\n\nPlease to not comment on this post, or send instant messages on Reddit.

Preferably someone with similar confidence and assertiveness. I  do enjoy romance and NSFW elements in my stories, so please be prepared  to do that.

In terms of length,  quality over quantity, always.\n\nI'm in the GMT+1 timezone.\n\nPlease make an introduction. Don't just come and tell me you're interested and expect me to tell you what to do.

I'd love to do a prompt where a couple have a substantial fanbase who watch their videos, we'll RP their life, before during and after the vlog, fan meetups, events, and everything else. It can either be similar to the PH series I mentioned where the NSFW content is filmed or not. But I'd like to have more plot than anything, so more time spent around the city they're in, building their relationship and such! Ideally the couple are 18-21. I RP on K and D\n\nThanks for reading and look forward to chatting! :3",

This roleplay idea has been thought out through several times and now I'm wanting to finally do it with someone. In a very short description of it, it is a roleplayed based in a fantasy world with a few Japanese themes to it revolving around a village with the two main characters being the daughter of a noble who doesn't get along with her father and a blind butler butler along with bits of magic in it. There will be very intense moments to it along with action and bits of drama with it being pretty story based. Many of key events have been thought out for it but there is still plenty of room for new ideas too. I'd prefer to roleplay with someone who can write at least a paragraph, even more if you'd like and write in third person.\n\nIf you are interested, simply message me and I will send you my discord stuff.

Political intrigue is a heavy portion of the RP and most have the goal of stabbing their way to the top.   \n\n\nThe story so far\u2026..The king is dead,   \n\n\nFound dead in his bedchambers from unknown causes. Known viable wounds -- no sign of illness -- no poison that can be detected by the physicians. As a High Pvethian, this is a strange death as they do not die of age like others do. There bodies do not shut down on them. They live until someone kills them.   \n\n\nAitor DeAlmieda has been called from his services a sellsword to take the throne. Surrounded by suspicion of the new king, it is unknown how many allies versus enemies he has at court and if he is capable of being the king he was grooemd to be.   \n\n\nThe lowborn begin to question why they serve a king, murmurs of revolution fill the air at taverns and inns. Strange folk are seen moving to and from villages at night, their number gradually growing.   \n\n\nAnd of course there is always the threat of the hordelands. There are talks of a powerful orc Chief conquering and uniting the tribes of the hordelands.  \n\n\nCan you survive Pveth?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJoin us here: [https://discord.gg/BmgRMGx](https://discord.gg/BmgRMGx)",

I can give more info as well as photo reference when we're planning the rp. I'd prefer the plot to be slice of life, romance, and/or modern fantasy. I'm not a huge stickler about length but I do like 2+ lines if it's not just dialogue. Send me a message with a brief summary of the character you wanna use and/or plots you have in mind!

But before long something happens that plunges your character into a world of mystery, and it soon becomes clear that not all that is in this estate is as simple or straightforward it seems, and not everyone is who they say they are.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is a different kind of rp from anything else you\u2019ll see, and it\u2019s a game-master roleplay. I\u2019ll be playing the other characters around the Estate that you\u2019ll be meeting and developing relationships with as you see fit. You\u2019ll be exploring the Estate, completing quests, discovering rooms, and solving puzzles on your own accord, while I play the other characters and nudge the story in the right direction only when necessary.\n\nThink of this as a choose your own adventure game, where the actions you make affect the world around you, other character\u2019s perceptions of you, and perhaps even the ultimate outcome of the story. My goal is to make a setting that feels realistic and interactive as well as fun to explore and deep and detailed in content and lore for even the smallest, most obscure trinket in the Estate that becomes more and more clear as the game progresses.\n\n- Because of the possible NSFW themes, I only rp with people 18 and older\n- I have been writing for a little over a decade so have a lot of experience with this.\n- I am advanced-literate and write a LOT, and while I don\u2019t expect you to match my length every time, I do require complete sentences and basic understanding of English grammar.

From there, we can have things progress to where he follows her alongside Avallac'h, or they go their separate ways, only for them to once again cross paths.  I am also open to someone playing as Triss or Yennefer, though those I do not have a ready idea.\n\nRegardless, hope you all have a good one and I look forward to hearing from you all soon!",

Also if you have an aversion to telling a partner things aren't working for you and you ghost, you need not apply.  \n\nI'm mostly looking for fandom stuff.  F/F Pairing only.  Most of them I can deal with it being OC/OC but there are some I don't list I prefer the other writing canons for ~~since most OCs are very barebones~~.  Said fact also keeps me from playing canons for other OCs, so don't expect it.  Also I'm looking for high fantasy/over the top action-adventure plots with BITS of slice of life.\n\nFandoms in Most Interested to Least Interested (but still an option):\n\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid (this is the only fandom I prefer my partner playing a canon for me for if they want to that I will actually list.  It's a cute indulgence that can easily due to the dragons become also a good action-adventure story)\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\nMob Psycho 100\n\nSplatoon\n\nLittle Witch Academia\n\n~~I have a demon girl OC I can use for original stuff but it'd still be anime af~~\n\nThere are others I didn't list but that's cause most people just want to use their OCs anyway and they're ones I'm not so keen on rolling with other people's OCs on.  Or it's things I've had to leg all the work on progressing as they lied around like a corpse doing nothing and it just burning me out on it.  Oh right, and literacy, no one liners unless the moment in the scene becomes back and forth chatter.  I prefer detail and proper grammar.

As we approach the body to investigate it vanishes in a black mist.\n\nConfused and dumbfounded we go to report the deed, only to find the deceased party alive and well, leading to further confusion.\n\nSo this first plot is a nice little conspiracy, shapeshifters are invading and taking over positions of power, this will lead to us trying to uncover and the plot before the shapeshifters take over.\n\nMany years ago the world was ruled by the demon king Satanael along with his seven deadly sins and demon armies. The only thing that managed to stop his iron tight grasp was the combined forces of ten great wizards who managed to seal away the demon king and his underlings, however this came at a great price for the wizards, they each sacrificed their bodies becoming keys for the seal which holds the demons.\n\nWe now jump forward in time, worshippers of the demon king have began to gather the 10 keys, having four within the grasp, they plan to release Satanael and have him rule once again.\n\nNow in this prompt we would ether play as the king\u2019s elite squad, sent out only on the most dangerous of missions or a group of adventurers coming across the plot and feeling a need to stop the resurrection of the demon king.\n\nThe third and final prompt involves us playing as already existing adventures who have suffered their most devastating defeat, this leads to us being sold off to some foreign island where we work as prisoners trying to find some way to escape the island and captivity.\n\nSo those are my prompts.\n\nNow what do I expect from you? Well not too much actually, all I ask is you be enthusiastic and for your post length, just give me something to work with, that\u2019s all. \n\nI enjoy using 3rd person however I am always fine with playing in the 1st.\n\nI\u2019ll mention once again I\u2019m not married to these ideas. I hope at least one of them has tickled your fancy, so please just send me a message, I\u2019m friendly and don\u2019t bite :)",

I'm Jon and I'm currently looking for a long term partner or two to create a slice of life taboo romance.  I have a few ideas but instead of hampering you with them I'd like us to truly build a story together.\nFor platforms I'm open but prefer here.\nI have some limits but truly open to what you are looking for in that respect.\nI use reference pics for characters and include background and bio for introduction.  \nI'm not a word counter and at times I understand that replies can become quick and easy to keep conversations going but detailed creative writing is key for me and a necessity.  One liners = not cool. \nSo if your up for building a true story let me know.  Hope to hear from you soon.",

            "selftext": "Who knows how you did it, but you somehow managed to catch a girl who attempted to steal something of immense value to you. Quite the feat, and in an even stranger turn of events, you find yourself in a lair with her. The young woman reveals to you she's taken quite the criminal fixation towards stealing a variety of items to offer the demon that resided in the lair. In exchange, the demon offers her powers and abilities - a fringe benefit, she claimed, as the true thrill was in the thieving process. You are then given the invitation. Would you like to join her in this madness and open yourself to a world beyond the one that you've so intimately known?\n\n \\--\n\n So the story may go and even start in different ways. The girl may be inviting your character to join her in stealing for the demon so you can have your own piece of the fun. Or, she never invited you to begin with and you simply tailed her. You could accept the offer and engage in that 'hobby' with her in your shared spare time, or you could refuse and even attempt to get the authorities involved. \n\nIt can go in a multitude of directions, really, and I'll be happy to discuss with you the gist of what we both want to happen. This story will likely include the existence of other supernatural beings, so we have an even more expansive room to play in. Maybe your character is a vengeful creature who thinks that having these powers is the key to achieving his plans. Maybe he wants to use his powers for good. Maybe a different being discovers what the two are doing and decide to put a stop to their shenanigans. Again, there are a lot of directions to work with. \n\nI would ask that you're over twenty years of age with who can:  \n\\- \"Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation,\" OP muttered. For a second, she wondered if she has the right to request these things in spite of her horrendously written post. \"Gentle reminder to note the comma before the dialogue tag.\" \n\n\\- Flesh out characters well. We're in the business of writing people with their own motivations, histories, aspirations, and flaws.\n\n \\- Pull your own weight in the story. Introduce characters as you see fit, inject more obstacles as you see fit, or even offer a hilarious deus ex machina once in a purple moon. I'm not looking to be a GM, nor am I asking that of you. This is a joint effort, my guy.\n\n I believe that about covers it. My primary preference as far as platforms are concerned is Discord, but the Docs and e-mail are viable options.\n\n Thank you for reading.",

The horrid, horrid weather. You were greeted just as warmly as usual, but suddenly there was a loud clap of thunder \u2014 and the lights went out.\n\nNow you're alone with the woman, with no electricity and a weather so terrible she won't let you go back outside... let's just hope she doesn't accidentally poke one of your eyes out with her horns while it's dark.\n\nHey there!

            "selftext": "Metropolitan cities were standard in the states. While they certainly had unique feats of engineering in them, they were mostly substandard monstrosities of capitalism and corporate greed, or so people said. Specifically, it was the Cult of the Tower who said this. In the sprawling city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where cheese supposedly flowed like water, there existed a not-so-secret order of people who were dedicated to returning the world to its original state before the industrial revolution. Many people wrote them off as harmless crazies; after all, they were no Westboro or KKK. Still, they had quite a few in their numbers and did enjoy the publicity of the news every so often. It didn't seem like anyone really took them seriously. However, when you tout freedom of speech and religion, everyone gets to have a voice. So, as deranged and insane as these people were, they were given a voice every so often.   \n\n\nThat's not what brought people in, though. No one actually knew how they were gaining members. The standard conspiracy theorists shouted \"brainwashing\" any time The Cult of the Tower was brought up, but that just did not seem likely. The Republicans said they were just a bunch of \"millennial liberals who would rather get angry than get jobs.\" The Democrats replied that the Cult most likely consisted of a bunch of \"backwoods, racist hicks that would sooner cling to their guns than to a diet.\"   \n\n\nTurns out, they were both quite wrong.   \n\n\nLater research would reveal that the Cult was older than most people thought - originating in Europe some time in the early 1400s. Apparently, there will always be dissatisfied with the way things are heading. They had only recently been brought back into the limelight because of the resurgence of fringe groups. They were not the loudest at all, but they were one of the weirdest. No one seemed to be a member, but everyone knew someone who knew someone who knew someone who was supposedly a member. In the end, it did not really matter who was a member or not.   \n\n\nOn March 14th, 2010, at 3:17AM CDT, the world as we knew it shifted. Reality folded in on itself and became something completely different. Gone were the sprawling city-scapes. In their place were castles and towers made of cobblestone, adorned with banners and crests. The modern amenities that people had come to enjoy were gone; in their place were crude, medieval substitutes. It was jarring and it sent the world into a panic. At first, it was impossible to communicate with other nations the way we had before. There were no telephones, no computers, no internet- it was all gone.   \n\n\nIn each of the new kingdoms established, a member of the Cult of the Tower reigned, bringing about this new age of simplicity. His or her loyal followers would come down hard on anyone trying to recreate the \"old ways\" of technology. They were either jailed or killed as a show of force to prevent people from stirring up such ideas. Soon came the hierarchies, serfs, lords. ladies, and the classes, such as paladins, blacksmiths, and so on. People were required to choose a class and, using some sort of magic, they were given a sort of progression system. Well, it seemed like magic, but many theorized that the Cult still used whatever remnants of technology were left to fulfill their plans. Many younger people related it to a video game, but it was far from a game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen came the mythical creatures. It seemed the cult hadn't just changed the people and environments, but had actually created entire species of animals. Dragons, chimeras, nues, what have you - they all existed and were all as terrifying as one would think. However, those that had chosen some sort of adventuring class saw them as a new aspect of their life. Their job was to hunt these monsters and take requests from the people. Due to this, Guilds (licensed by the rulers, of course) began to pop up to group the adventurers together under one roof.   \n\n\nAt the heart of it all, in Milwaukee, Wisconson, stood the tallest tower in the world - the structure that was the namesake of the accursed cult. Rumors surrounded the building, claiming that it housed terrible beasts inside of it. Some claimed it held magnificent treasure. Only the cultists seemed to know what was in there, but they had been sworn to secrecy. More than that, it appeared that not even they could reach the top. Many adventurers had thrown themselves at the tower only to fall to its machinations. But everything seemed to point to the tower being the cause of all of this. Perhaps the secret to the cultists' powers lied within. If that was the case, did that mean there was a way to reverse this?  \n\n\n\\------  \n\n\nHello! If you made it this far, take a break, get a cookie - you've earned it. I know what you're thinking: \"I didn't come here to read! I came here to write!\" Apologies, friend. In a sudden burst of inspiration, I pulled out my tablet and typed up this RP idea.   \n\n\nAbout me: I have been writing for 16-or-so years now. I am an LPC-I (almost) and am a guy. However, when it comes to this roleplay, I am comfortable with player either a male or a female.   \n\n\nThe idea behind this roleplay is that we are fellow adventurers; we take on different requests, fight for those that need saving - all that jazz. However, one day, something causes us to take on The Tower. This can have as in-depth of a system or as light of a system as we want. For example, we can play this as a straight roleplay, or incorporate different DnD elements into it. Whatever the case, if you're interested in this at all, please send me a message and hopefully we can talk more! I look forward to it!",

The cloak pulled overhead, when paired with the dark night sky, proved to work wonders. Except, of course, for the sigil embroidered in gold. But she never ran into anyone, anyway. \n\nShe\u2019s Katherine Agron the Princess of Diman, a Southern Kingdom, the stronghold of bustling seaport trade, and one side of a great war lasting decades. The land boarded the great sea, an expanse untamed. The girl, however, was practically born from it, and she snuck out often to rejoin it once more. However, she\u2019s nearly 23 now, and her curiosity has piqued beyond the expansive sea. The forest is her new curiosity, and nightly she comes to spend time alone exploring its endless depth. \n\nThe forest borders the Northern lands, the enemy territory of those in Diman. The war has raged for decades and Katherine has been reigned in and subjected to stay mainly within the castle grounds. Still, she was never one to follow directions and thus her nightly escapades became routine.\n\nTonight was different. While she normally only heard the rustle of leaves and the distant crashing of waves, tonight she heard a voice. Or, perhaps, voices. Who it was, she had no clue. She hid behind a tree and drew an arrow from her bow, pointing it in the general direction of the sound and waited. \n\nHi! My name is Katherine, but my friends call me Kat. I\u2019m from Nice, France and am 23 years old. I have long honey coloured hair that falls in waves down to the midpoint of my back, high cheekbones, full lips, tanned skin, wide catlike green eyes, and a petite and fit body frame, standing at 180 cm (5 foot 9). I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nFor this role-play, you can be whatever character you so please, anything from Northern royalty scouting the area for more attacks to a local Shepard. I\u2019m looking for a creative storytelling experience where we shape this world around us. Please be detailed, have good grammar, and paragraph-length responses. We can do this over kik or discord.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! Im currently looking to so a long term superhero/vigilante roleplay the story will center around your character being recruited to join a team of heroes of various ages and backgrounds, and slowly becoming the greatest heroes the world has ever seen.\n\nIve done many roleplays in the past, hut this is one I'm particularly excited for, as i love superheroes/mythology. I love building a universe and building lore for for it, and i especially love stories about people rising up to do good in a world where people tell them that they cant.\n\nSo what can you expect from this roleplay? Action, drama, romance, and much more. As the GM I will he playing multiple characters, all of whom will be unique and interesting, and I'm not just talking about powers. Ill be taking lots of inspiration from other comics, and I will do my best to keep you hooked. \n\nThe stories will be divided into chapters, each chapter will focus on character development; characters will die, and others will be introduced, and the villains will test the heroes in ways you cant even imagine.\n\nIm purposefully being a little vague here... for more details, dm me! I can roleplay on discord or kik, and i look forward to hearing from you soon!",

            "selftext": "Hi, everyone. I\u2019ve been roleplaying for years now, and since I write stories on my own, I\u2019d say my literacy level is pretty decent. I\u2019m looking for open-minded people who have an interest in my listed fandoms, as well as people who can keep up with Lit - Adv. Lit roleplays. \n\nThe number of partners I\u2019ve had has dwindled over the years and i am currently down to two consistent partners and one or two other inconsistent ones that i rarely see. Everyone else I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting on this subreddit, either becomes a small-time partner, doesn\u2019t work out, or they ghost. If I\u2019m looking for anything in a partner, it\u2019s definitely someone who can be honest about their feelings, thoughts and opinions without just getting up and leaving. \n\nSorry for the lengthy introduction, let me discuss everything I\u2019m interested in doing and what I\u2019m looking for :\n\nPartner: As I said, an open-minded person, preferably someone who plays F characters or both F and M characters. Typically I like doing straight MxF pairings, where I play M. Canon character or OC depends on the plot itself. I have a lot of free time and hope to find someone like that as well, but i don\u2019t mind somebody who is busy, either. Someone who is okay with NSFW themes would be preferred as well, as I don\u2019t shy away from gore/violence and or dirty scenes. \n\nTypes of roleplays: Romance, action, adventure, tragedy, science fiction/fantasy, AU\u2019s, etc. Mostly looking for fandom canon RPs, however. \n\nFandoms: \n\n\u2022 Dragon Maid. \n\n\u2022 Re:Zero. *\n\n\u2022 Undertale/Deltarune.\n\n\u2022 Steven Universe. *\n\n\u2022 Watamote. *\n\n\u2022 League of Legends. (AU.) *\n\n\u2022 Kill La Kill. *\n\n\u2022 Adventure Time. \n\n\u2022 Overwatch.\n\n\u2022 Edd Ed n Eddie.\n\n\u2022 Invader Zim. *\n\n\u2022 Mass Effect.\n\n\u2022 Dark Souls. (AU.)\n\n\u2022 Goblin Slayer.\n\n\u2022 Spider-Verse. *\n\n\u2022 Tanya the Evil. *\n\n\u2022 Doki Doki. \n\n\u2022 My Hero Academia. *\n\nThese are the fandoms I\u2019m currently interested in roleplaying. I know many games, movies, anime, etc \u2014 So if you don\u2019t see something you typically do, feel free to ask me. I look forward to your messages and hope to find lengthy, worthwhile partners whom I can also be friends with. Thank you for reading.",

Some of the things I've been known to RP and enjoy in the past include: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Time travel scenarios\n\n\\-Apocalypse/post-apocalypse (for some reason I really enjoy the sentient zombie trope, I just find it really interesting for RP  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af )\n\n\\-Supernatural (the concept, not the fandom)\n\n\\-Fantasy/Pirate\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFandoms:\n\n\\-Red Dead Redemption\n\n\\-The Evil Within\n\n\\-Skyrim (TES)/Dragon Age/Fallout\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously this is a pretty short and non-exhaustive list, (and I very well may add more as I think of it!) but if this sounds like the kind of stuff you have ideas for/may enjoy go ahead and shoot me a PM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am currently a Game Master for a Discord server that hosts a 'Pathfinder/DnD' lite system for adventure in a large kingdom filled with humans, demi-humans, humans and demons. The server has hit a bit of a snag in active population recently, and I'd like for new people to join up and participate. The main restriction is that I don't accept human male players - all of the characters in the main hub of the roleplay are non-human to begin with. We are okay with elves, dwarves or any non-human male characters however.\n\nI generally run a lot of the NPCs with another moderator, of which all are non-human. We generally use \"Monsterkin\", as in monstrous humanoid races from fiction/player books. This can include minotaurs, mermaids, lamia (or yuan-ti), all the way to centaurs or drows.\n\nAs a player, you'll always start as a new adventuring recruit that's part of the guild, a neutral entity on the war-torn continent of Veren. You will be paired with other players to depart on adventure. Exploring dungeons, killing dangerous creatures, saving the common folk. As you complete more quests and gain more acclaim, you will get paid more and get promoted within the guild and face harder tasks. Will you join a single group? Or will you move between groups as a vagrant? Are you going to fight massive monsters or explore caverns deep with no light but your own? Maybe a little bit of both?\n\nYou'll have to make a short character sheet (as part of your application. Don't worry, you don't have to roll actual stats.) before being allowed within the rest of the server. Then, the adventure may start!\n\nMain rules:\n-No Human Male characters\n-No Lewds on the server (Take it to PMs)\n-Third-person heavily preferred.\n\nI look forward to roleplaying with you!\nDiscord link:\nhttps://discord.gg/cC8CHw",

I'm currently really interested in a Stucky (Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America x Bucky Barnes a.k.a. the Winter Soldier) RP. These would be going off the MCU versions of the characters. I could do something based off canon (though not Endgame, since I haven't gotten to see it yet unfortunately) or a complete AU or anything in between. I'm more in the mood for AUs now, or where only one of them is a superhero and the other is a regular modern person. I can play either Steve or Bucky; I tend to play Bucky more, but it's not super important to me. I'm ok with getting into NSFW territory, but I don't want the RP to be entirely about that - I want drama and action and romance and all that to take precedent. I'm looking for a long-term partner, so if we run out of things to write for one storyline we can start a new one. I don't usually write super long responses, though my intros tend to be on the long side, because I like there to be a lot of interaction in the RP and I'd rather not try to force a lot of length. So I tend to do around one to two paragraphs per response. I prefer to RP over Discord, but I can also do Email if you want. Send me a PM if you're interested, and let me know if you've got any particular plots you're interested in doing!",

Skyscrapers stretch infinitely into the air, flying cruisers and spaceships are not a rare sight in the skies, cyborgs and androids walk freely among the streets, and now these aliens and humans are living alongside each other here. Become a citizen, carve your path and enter Kalinn City. \n\nWe offer\u2014\n\n- Many channels to roleplay in!\n- Friendly staff!\n- An ever-growing community of wonderful people!\n- A fun place to hang out and chill! \n\n https://discord.gg/PmHCtYM",

            "selftext": "After The Recall is a semi-literate, canon-based Overwatch role-play. Taking place approximately six months after Winston issues the recall, the former agents of Overwatch are making their decisions on where they wish to stand in this conflict with Talon and over villainous organizations around the world. Our goal is to expand the universe and lore using canon characters (including minor ones, like Maximilien and Sojourn) and a host of original characters to tell stories and, most importantly, have fun. \n\nWe offer:\n- A brand new, relaxed discord with friendly members. As of posting this, role-play has only just officially started.\n- A large amount of freedom regarding characters. It\u2019s your choice what factions (if any!) characters are involved in. Former original Overwatch personnel are welcome. Canons have freedom as long as it makes some sense as to their character. \n- Mission events that will have characters use their wits and skills to complete objectives. Some of these missions will even pit factions against each other!\n- Future upcoming events that include things like flashbacks to the days of Overwatch\u2019s glory, AUs, and more!\n\nTaken Canons: Genji, Mercy, McCree, Sombra\n\nOriginal Characters: Open!\n\nFeel free to join and check around! A lot of the in-character channels will be hidden until you\u2019re assigned roles. We do require a brief (one or two paragraph) writing sample once you\u2019ve decided on your character, mostly just to get the feel for your character, whether they be canon or OC. For OCs, we also require a small bio for everyone\u2019s easy reference.\n\nLink: https://discord.gg/BgEe5nE",

It\u2019s my main passion and I have characters from it that I miss writing as and truly enjoyed playing. So please, if anyone has anything let me know? I promise I can more than hold my weight as a writer and am open to literally just about anything.

            "selftext": "Hello discord!I'm Kanuth and i'm a big thinking and a huge world builder. I was coming out of the cinema after watching Endgame (no spoilers dw dw) and thought of a great idea. I thought a superhero roleplay would be cliche, but something more imaginative might not be. So here's my pitch, i'll talk about requirements and that jazz in a second:\n\n**At the beginning of time, four elemental rocks were formed and two elemental energies were created, each with a living embodiment.**\n\n**Fire was created.** It was red and burned hot. It was brilliant, exciting and warm. It was famous and outgoing. It was a guiding flame, illuminating our path and sharing the light, all while maintaining enough equilibrium to prevent burning out. It was joyous and passionate. Maybe, just a little bit reckless and abandoning of the rules. It's consequences were anxiety and restlessness.\n\n**Water was created.** It was blue and filled everything it touched. It was cool, calm and collected. It showed us where we were going and where we had been. It was forever alive and moving. It reminded us to expect change and movement and to go with the flow. It was fearful and curious about all the unknown diversions that could carry it of course. It was curious, calm and collected.\n\n**Earth was created.** It was brown. It connected all of the elements together. It was healthy, intelligent and outgoing. It was protective of its friends and home. It nurtured all living beings. It kept everyone centred, connected and grounded. It reminded everyone that boundaries are necessary to prevent obsession. It was melancholy and balanced, with a concern for everyone.\n\n**Air was created.** It was white. It flowed through everyone and everything. It pushed people to the edge and kept everyone afloat. It was the wisest and the most controlled. It kept a watchful eye on the actions of others and kept control of the people that strayed towards the darkness. It was peaceful and neutral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then the glue that held them together. Dark and light. They never were present in person, but had always been there in soul, guiding each towards good or towards bad.\n\nOut of the first of the men and women, two men and two women were chosen to be the form of the elements. The embodiments took their bodies and lived as gods. They were not tyrants, they were not nice, they were not bad, they were definitely not rulers, they did not pass judgement. But they did keep the peace. This is until the darkness took hold. It overpowered all of them and cast them into the universe.\n\nThey were kept secret and hidden, for thousands of years. This is until, in the 21st century that they were discovered by the descendants of the original four. Although they were not aware of each other's existence until now, they sure did now.\n\n**These four descendants are you, the people reading this.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFour people, two men, two women had each uncovered the stones and with that, absorbed their powers and their memories. The collective goal of all of the stones was to destroy the darkness. **Everyone had gone, disappeared.** The stones now had a new goal, to return peace to the land by returning everyone to the earth. There was just one problem, the darkness had began to summon creatures to destroy the stones.\n\n***The elements will have to survive, thrive and beat back the dark.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach of the stones came with unique abilities. **These are decided by you, and since this is only slice of life/action, they will all have to be balanced and within the element.**\n\nThis roleplay is set in an abandoned America, starting off in the fictional town of Oldine, where each of your characters have somehow managed to get a stone each. This is your choice how they got the stone. Tomb raiding in Northern Ukraine? Jewellery shop? Bank heist? Hand me down in the family? They all were drawn to Oldine for a strange reason just before everyone disappeared. In the middle of the city square, as everyone suddenly disappeared, only they stand and that is when the elements activate, they gain the elements memories and powers.\n\n**Your character is either the living embodiment of fire, earth, air or water. This will mean you'll have to play them like that element. Take that as you will.**\n\nThis is going to be a small group (4 people) with me running it as the GM **and** as a player. This is incredibly open ended, we're all together gonna develop the story and where it goes. This is one of the first group role-plays I have admin'ed for and been in, so it may be a little rough to start.\n\nHere are some requirements that'll need to be met to join:\n\n1. You need to be 18+ as there will be mature themes, violence, sex, ect. however that will not be the main focus. Romance may be a theme, if the characters choose that, so be prepared for that.\n2. You need to be in a timezone that will accommodate the BST time zone. I repeat. **British Summer Time**. A few hours ahead or behind, that's fine. 8 hours behind? 10 hours ahead? We can't have that as we need everyone to be **fairly active at the same time** but you need not put every hour into it.\n3. The minimum reply length is a paragraph and a half, with the maximum being three paragraphs. This is so everyone can interact without someone saying too little or too much. This also means replies can be somewhat quick fire. You also need to be fairly experienced in role-play and literate.\n4. Absolutely no abusive, racist, sexist or discriminatory behaviour. This will result in an instant ban and removal from the group.\n5. If someone says no. **It means NO.** If you're not comfortable with something, say so immediately.\n\nI currently work a 9-5 Monday - Friday job so I won't be active a lot of the time during the early hours of the day/afternoon. Although, I'm a quick typist and a quick trigger finger so I can reply very quickly.\n\nThis will be a first come first serve basis. Within characters, there needs to be two men and two women. I'll be playing a male character, so that leaves us with one male and two female slots. Message me to see what is available. Below will be a list of elements that have either not been taken or been taken, along with an amount of people.\n\nFire - Available\n\nWater - Available\n\nAir - Available\n\nEarth - Available\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMale slots - 1\n\nFemale slots - 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions, message me on Reddit. **This roleplay will take place on discord and on discord only.**",

Maybe you want to track down some hidden treasure with your pirate crew? Perhaps figure out what is happening to the animals in Taishan? No? You would rather help bring down the barrier of the hidden Kingdom? Well come and take a look to see what sort of fun you could get into!***\n\n# Welcome to the Realm of Dwelrur!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere in this realm we have many different kingdoms that encompass many different races, stories and characters. In this realm we have adventure, traps and mystery around every corner. This is a medieval fantasy style rp.\n\nIn this group we are about creativity and pushing further to make a great rp. We collaborate together coming up with ideas for different parts of the realm that have been created as well as helping one another create new characters. In every post we are descriptive and detailed so you can almost see the character and the surroundings they are in. We strive to make the roleplaying experience enjoyable for all parties involved and encourage ideas that could keep pushing the rp forward. Of course we have an over all plot concept for the rp but with each kingdom in the realm we have flourishing stories and character backgrounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**We are looking for new members to at to our little group but we do have a few guidelines.**\n\n1: We ask that you be at least 18 or older.\n\n2: We ask that you be committed to this rp. If you intend to join and then ghost please don't reply to this post. We are wanting serious members.\n\n3: We ask that you be a para rper as we do have a post limit of 2-3 well written paragraphs.\n\n4: We ask that you be a team player. We help each other with ideas not only for the rp but with building new characters. If you are not a team player and do not work well with others then this group may not be the place for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested in joining the group or learning more about it please shoot a message to me. From there you will be added to the recruiting server. In said server you will learn more about the group right along with trying out to see if the group is for you right along with letting the leadership team seeing your skills. Not every group is for everyone and that we understand. That being said we look forward to meeting all you new people!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This group is roleplayed over DISCORD.**\n\n**If you have made it this far thanks for taking the time to read!

Nor was it like any other she had been before. This ***was*** Earth, though. Just not hers. She had no doubt about that. *Is this one of those alternate realities that Stephen was always going on about?* Carol pondered. Then again, it didn\u2019t really matter where she was. Carol was more interested in coming home. At least, this was the case for the time being. *It shouldn\u2019t be that hard to find help, right? If this is a copy of Earth, there should be a copy of the Avengers, or S.H.I.E.L.D, or even, me...*\n\nHello! I hope you\u2019re all doing well. I\u2019m looking for someone to do a romance plot between Spider-Woman of Earth-65 (aka, Spider-Gwen!), and Captain Marvel of Earth-616. If you\u2019re interested, please feel free to shoot me a DM. If you have a different plot in mind, feel free to include it, I\u2019d be down to hear it. I just ask that we keep it between these two characters (unless you make a really good case), and we keep it romance oriented. As for which character we play, if you have a preference, please let me know. I prefer playing Captain Marvel, but am totally flexible, as I am very fond of both characters. I prefer Discord as my main communication platform, so please include your username in your initial message. \n\nThanks for reading, and I hope to hear from some of you soon!",

If I do not know ahead of time, *life comes first.* I have had a few snags recently, but I am sincerely hoping that I've seen the last of that sporadic behavior for some time.\n- I prefer that you don't mind OOC chatter.

It may take a little while to get back to you from your initial message.\n\n\n**Play Style:**\n\n\n- I play male or female characters in any setting. I don't mind side characters, but I do not *normally* double mains. I could be persuaded otherwise for a good enough plot.\n- My character is not me, your character is not you. I don't really care about your gender. All that matters is that you want to write with me. If you want to tell me, that is up to you. (I also do not play myself, nor in first person.)\n- Heterosexual pairings are my first and foremost preference. I can be talked into other relationships for the right story. \n- If something is not working for you, please tell me. I am a mature adult and I can handle rejection. I do not intentionally disappear on my partners, and it would be nice to know what can be improved or changed in the future \u2013 or we can work it out and try an entirely different plot that meshes better. (This being said, I *will* stop responding if you seem to be uninterested or consistently do not help drive the story forward. I will give you feasible chances to change and if you still don't help to continue \u2013 I'm not going to waste my time.)\n- Be willing to plan. A little world-building can save a lot of floundering later on, and I'd like to sketch out at least a little bit before we begin. This includes both the setting, surroundings, plot and characters. Nothing has to be set in stone. Story lines or general ideas can also be discussed.\n- **I will politely decline to keep responding to you if you cannot produce anything over one line or incomplete sentences.** The purpose of this long, thought-out advert is to deter you from wasting my time and your own.\n\n\n**Posting:**\n\n\n- I'm almost completely unavailable on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. There are very few exceptions to this. Each Friday of the month, for 2 days after or so, I will be slow in responses. (You may absolutely ask why my schedule is so hectic if you're curious.) \n- On a good day, I may be able to get in 2+ posts or more. Sometimes I can rapid-fire something in return. For the majority of the time, I can commit to two to four posts per week. *Please be patient.* That being said, if it has been 3 days or more since I have responded, feel free to send me an OOC email to remind me. Your email may have been one I opened on my phone and did not reset as unread. \n\n\n**Post-Length:**\n\n\n- I range anywhere from three to six paragraphs plus, depending on inspiration and necessity. My intro, description or detail posts will obviously be longer than simple conversation. I am *not* asking you to mirror me.\n- My posts will include internal dialogue and conflict. I am hoping for at least three or more paragraphs from a potential partner. Anything less just feels like it will not drive the story forward unless we are heavily into quick-fire territory. (I have never seen a situation where a couple of paragraphs was too hard to muster even when doing dialogue, though).\n\n\n**Platforms:**\n\n\n- I use email only. It is the easiest way for me to keep track of everything. \n- (I may also be persuaded to use Google Docs, but that is also a less convenient platform. It will take longer to give you a reply this way. I usually reserve Gdocs for shared notes) .\n*My apologies, but I will not be changing to any other platforms, it is simply too inconvenient for me. You will, unfortunately, not be convincing me otherwise.*\n\n\n**Genres**\n\n\n- Darker themes \u2013 complicated relationships,* gore/survival horror,  drama,* high,* low or dark fantasy,* sci-fi,* steampunk,* dystopian,* crime noir, crime drama,* law enforcement/criminal,* diamond in the rough,* space adventures,* piracy/seafaring,* historical fiction, western/fantasy,* slice-of-life elements.... a vibrant mix of several, you name it and we can talk it over and see if we can find something we will both enjoy. \n- Romance is a highly preferred subplot, but things should develop organically. I do not want this to be the main focus of any RP. It is likely I will get disinterested if we do not include romance in the plot to a greater or lesser degree. It's just something I enjoy writing and I enjoy the complications it will inevitably bring.\n- NSFW content is not necessarily off-limits, but please be aware that I would like to discuss things first and don't really prefer being bullied into anything.\n- I reserve the right to say no. It's nothing personal\n\n\n**Ideas/Craving:**\n\n\n- John Wick-verse \u2013 OC/John Wick or OC/OC.\n- Marvel MCU\n- DC universe\n*Suggest a fandom, I may know it. If not, we can take the basic premise and run with it.*\n\n\n- Male/Female Pairings: I am basically willing to play male OC's in various storylines in any setting/genre/universe. Suggest something to me, I may have a character for it, or I may be willing to . I'm much better playing a male in a fantasy-oriented setting. (Even as simple as a vampire living next door).\n\n\n**Time Periods:**\n\n\nAny. Let's talk it out. I prefer anything with an element of fantasy, which means I will prefer any offers for it over completely realistic. (Of course, two human characters fighting dragons is not completely realistic, I will accept that.) That being said, I am more than willing to incorporate slice-of-life as well. It just cannot be the main focus, as I will get bored with hyper-realistic play. \n\n\n**Need Not Apply:**\n\n\n- I can and will refuse any RP I want, but it is likely that I will give it a shot first if we mesh well together in our initial conversations.\n- Do NOT contact me with a situation in which you are (or you want) a DM/GM type.... I do NOT like this type of RP and you will not be changing my mind. Thanks.\n- Do not expect rapid-fire posts or conversations from me constantly, I will reply when I am able, I promise.\n- Anyone seeking nothing but NSFW roleplay can keep looking, I prefer rich story, characters and worlds. Anyone seeking to play ourselves in an RP can keep on looking as well.\n\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\n\n- Please contact me via **message,** I do not respond to comments. I will provide you with my email after we talk a bit and start to get more comfortable and settle initially on something to do.\n- If I seem to have missed your message or email in 2 or max 3 days, send another and I will reply right away.",

I prefer multi-paragraph, advanced literate, detailed RPs that incorporate interesting characters with quite a lot of development. Romance does not need to be a central plot point, but it can be a fun addition to any good story. To that end, I am comfortable with (and enjoy) playing both male and female roles, but when playing with female partners, I generally prefer to double (one M and F each) for fairness' sake.\n\nWhen it comes to the RP itself, I like Google Docs for a lot of reasons, but I'm pretty happy to work with any medium, especially for the right partner. I have a lot of RP samples, as well, and can provide them on request.\n\nI enjoy fandom and original RPs; if you don't see anything you like in the lists below, feel free to ask for another genre if you have something particular in mind.\n\n**Fandoms** (Bit old-school here.)\n\n* Harry Potter\n* Sherlock Holmes (various versions)\n* Pride and Prejudice\n* Robin Hood\n* Eragon\n* Walking Dead\n* Beauty and the Beast\n* Final Fantasy X\n* almost anything Stephen King, Tamora Pierce, Naomi Novik, etc.\n* *really, the list goes on...*\n\n**Originals**\n\n* Medieval/fantasy\n* Sci-fi\n* Vampires\n* Pirates\n* *no, seriously, just about anything interesting will work here...*\n\nJust drop me a message if you're interested.

            "selftext": "**This   will be a persistent request. If you see it up some time after it's   been posted, feel free to contact me on it. Until my tastes change   through a different post, this one may be followed up on at your   leisure.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\nI   am 33 come May, East Coast United States (EST/EDT), and I work a full   time job during the week. I love RP when I can get it, and there's been  a  bit of a dry spell lately that's been going on since the holidays  (yes,  even now 3 months later, there's still been a dry spell). I am  seeking  to change that.\n\n*Please   don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more   context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do   is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat   I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any   of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you  may  ask? Look below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (**Medieval (vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era**), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC, **Friday   Night Lights, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and   Fire, Peaky Blinders, Harry Potter, Vikings, The Last Kingdom**;   others need ask. But PLEASE ask me on the possibility of playing canon   characters from these shows. There is no guarantee I may be able to  play  what you want. Feel free to ask on others!)\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs   for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking   imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the   years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me.   Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art.\n\nI   favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. Give me  the  romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that  know  what this means will get it :) ). I also enjoy players who like to  talk  OOC.\n\n***The catch?***\n\nPlease,   please, please be someone who can RP and talk on a daily or near-daily   basis. This is a big request. I will understand if you let me know of   anything in a timely manner! Also, be sure to check Discord at times.  It  LOVES to screw with notifications.\n\nAnd   one last thing...please be someone that doesn't let much bother them  or  likes blocking for small or stupid things. Be someone who is open to  a  lot, and doesn't let much bother them, and we'll get along easily!\n\n*Special   Note: I am meeting too many ghosters and flakers lately. If you don't  want to talk  after a single session, find your guts and say something. I  give  everyone I meet a week to get back to me if IRL stuff happens,  then I  move on. All I ask is you let me know something so I can give  you some  time to catch up or so I can move on.*\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel   free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours. I apologize for the   long winded post, but it's the best I can do. Any interested folks who   PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was   read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!",

I'm also a short guy like 1-2 paragraphs but I do usually start off with a big starter. I got discord and i prefer that to roleplay. Anyway onto the topics.\n\nLife is Strange! \nThis is one my favorite game series and i would love to do a roleplay set in Arcadia Bay in 2013 or further. I only do OC characters however or i should say main OC characters. I can do canon but only on the side. OC x OC would be neat. But if OC x Canon is sorta your thing then that's neat too. I would prefer doing this one but however...\n\nHighschool role play.\nIt's a generic topic, why would i possibly want to do this? Truth is I kind of think a cool universe could be built here. Here I'm cool with like MxF or MxM. Clarification:I ONLY DO MALE CHARACTERS. I'm sorry i used caps for that but it does get old having guys message you asking if you can be a female for their fantasy or whatever. \n\nAgain Life is Strange is strongly preferred but highschool is cool too.",

As such, I'm looking to find a long-term partner to help take my mind off it all. \n\nI'm largely open to ideas, though I prefer to write opposite male characters. But that's flexible.  \n\nI'll list a few things that I typically enjoy.\n\n- Roleplays where I write as Lara Croft; either opposite OC's or crossed over with canons from other franchises. \n\n- Anything involving the MCU.\n\n- Post-apocalyptic scenarios. \n\n- Urban fantasy stories. \n\n- Slice of life, romance, fluff, etc. \n\nOther than that, I'm open to proposals and ideas. I'm not committed to anything 100%, so I'm flexible. NSFW elements can be included, though they're not necessary at all.\n\n**What I _do_ need is for you to be:** \n\n- Polite\n\n- Creative.\n- Enthusiastic. \n- Available on Discord.\n- Over the age of 20.",
