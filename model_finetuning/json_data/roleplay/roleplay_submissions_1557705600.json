            "selftext": "So, probably a bit of an odd and niche idea, but I've had it bumping around in my head and, hey, why not! Bit vague as of now as I'd like to develop the idea better with someone, but overall what I'm thinking is something set after the typical magical girl hijinks. Those sorts of shows generally follow younger girls, so evil is vanquished, plot is over, life moves on--girls grow up basically retired. Now older (late high school or college), a new/old threat rears its ugly head yet and, welp, gotta do something about that.\n\nTonally, I'm not necessarily looking for anything too light or dark, though perhaps leaning a bit more towards the latter. But, I do want the whole package! Transformations! Magical items! (Staves, compacts, etc.!) Cute mascot/animal companion! Just with older protagonists who have been down this road before. Maybe they don't look back fondly on their former experiences and want nothing to do with this anymore, thank you very much. Maybe friendships fell apart, just isn't convenient at all for their lives--I don't know! I'm pretty open on stuff; all I'm set on is the overall idea of \"former magical girls having to do it again but now older.\"\n\nJust some other quick details: I write in third-person present tense, generally give a few paragraphs or so per response, and am located in EST. Totally down for romance (f/f or m/f) and playing multiple characters!\n\nPlease PM me if you're interested!",

            "selftext": "In this world of swords, magic, and chaos, there are numerous kingdoms and nations. The largest and most infamous of these nations is the Elysian Empire. For centuries, the Elysians have expanded across the world, conquering kingdom after kingdom and absorbing these beaten and broken lands into their Empire. Every kingdom that has fallen to the Empire has been forced to relinquish everything; their castles, their culture, and their people.  \n\n\nWhen the Empire seizes a land, their royal bloodlines are slaughtered and a new ruler is installed; either a loyal imperial officer or a noble citizen of the conquered land who betrayed their people for a higher station. Either way, the Empire owns them. To further break the spirits of the conquered people, half of the children, both boys and girls, under the age of six are taken and brought to the Elysian Heartlands, to be trained as soldiers who will conquer future kingdoms. As the years pass, a fallen nation slowly loses its sense of identity and culture until its old name becomes nothing but a page in a history book.  \n\n\nThe expansion of the Empire has always been a slow, yet steady endeavor until three decades ago, when their current Emperor, Artorias Fellghast Victorium Elysias, rose to claim his father's throne. Possessing keen ingenuity and one of the sharpest minds for military strategy the world has ever seen, he increased the rate of the Empire's expansion exponentially, reaching coasts and lands beyond. Growing up in your far distant kingdom, you heard countless stories of the violent and warmongering Elysian Empire. Most of them were no more than scary stories to frighten ill behaved children. You never once believed such a thing could happen to your land or your people.  \n\n\nUntil it did.  \n\n\nYour home put up a better fight than most. The war lasted just over a year, and it ended when Emperor Artorias himself stormed the capital with his army, personally executing your father and every male heir in your family. With their king slaughtered and people broken, your land surrendered, becoming yet another land that had succumbed to the might of the strongest force the world had ever known.  \n\n\nIn the weeks that followed the fall of your kingdom, you had been kept under close guard, wondering why you had not been killed. Yesterday, however, you were informed of your fate: you are to be wed to one of the Emperor's children, Prince Leon Elysias. Now today you are being hastily prepared for a wedding to a young man you have never met, to be his Queen and rule over your broken kingdom.

I am open to most Roleplay styles. I mostly am a paragraph RPer and can play in either in third or first person. I am open to any kind of RP from slice of Life to more explicit darker motifs. I just ask one thing in that you have a small measure of patience with me. I am coming back into the scene and I can feel the rust in my fingers as I type.

I invite you to be the player, the one who interacts with it all.\n\nMild planning is required. Your character is to be someone coming of age and raised amidst an isolate little family set apart from the realm\u2019s matters. This is to give you a \u2018fish-out-of-the-water\u2019 experience without an amnesia plot. You can make up some family elements, childhood memories, etc, but the world and setting is described and taken care of by me.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSo what\u2019s the plot? Your character is descended from deposed royalty and a danger to the current monarch. If they\u2019re a male, you\u2019re ill-conceived offspring that\u2019s been tucked away in the countryside out of their father\u2019s shame. If they\u2019re a female, they\u2019re a danger all the same.\n\nOne could imagine your character would live out their entire life and die without ever knowing their true father. That is not the case. One day, you are discovered by enemies of the monarch, and whisked away to a life of nobility- and war. \n\nMake up your character\u2019s appearance- I will see to it that the deposed dynasty your character descends from will be based on their features and traits. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHow will your character take this news? You tell me. Will they seek justice for the realm? Fall to greed, cruelty and bloodlust? \n\nI use discord. I can use Skype, but it isn\u2019t preferred. Sexual content isn\u2019t necessary- I mention this is NSFW because there will be violence and mature themes. Preferred length is between 1-4 paragraphs and rapid fire is the only style I am using. 3rd person is a definite. I am a **male** but I play both genders and don\u2019t have a preference toward either.\n\nSend me a brief profile and description of your character and your discord tag, and I\u2019ll message you back.",

            "selftext": "Why hello there! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy name is Abstract, and as the title states, I am dreaming about long term plots. Or well, long term writing partners at least! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat am I looking for you say? Well, generally I would not consider myself a picky person - but recently I seem to have found my niche. My little corner of the vast, beautiful world of roleplaying that just makes me tick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that is\u2026 character driven slice of life plots, with romance being a must. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharacter development is what I live for! The way characters can drive a story, their inner thoughts, and what makes them, well them - it\u2019s my absolute favorite. I just love watching a character unfold in a plot. Getting to know them. Watching them grow and develop. So I am not looking for a specific prompt, but someone who is as excited about exploring characters as I am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can of course build a plot or a world for the characters to live in. Or, we can just toss two characters together and see how the plot builds based on their backstories, lives, personalities, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few starting ideas, but I very open to other ideas! If you have a craving, come at me! Suggest it! I may love it! I also may be open to adding elements of crime, fantasy or science fiction. Cause I mean. That\u2019s just fun sometimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OKAY!** So to get to the point (somewhat) here are a few rules. I know know, but in the words of Monica Geller  - \u201cGuys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 21+ only (23+ preferred) please. As I get older I find that writing with people closer to my own age helps in the collaborative writing process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 3rd person. Past tense. Paragraph format. Discord or email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Two to three paragraphs minimum per post, unless we agree to do quick dialogue snippets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Understanding of real life obligations. Some weeks I can reply multiple times a day, sometimes once or twice a week, it will depend. I will always let you know if I will be away for more than a day or two. Ghosting is, in opinion, the worst issue plaguing the roleplay community right now. So I promise never to just disappear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Doubling, or male characters. I love to double, and when I do I will play a female and a male character. But if we are not doubling, I do want to play the female character. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 MxF dynamics. But if there are platonic relationships in the story, any orientation is welcome for those characters, it is just in a romantic pairing MxF is my preference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Literacy. While I am not going to get out my thesaurus and word count ... I adore long, detailed posts with intricacies. I love reading a post that I can tell has been thought out and edited. I am happy as a clam if you put in effort and excitement. Of course, I also love shorter back and forth posts for dialogue or certain scenes. It all depends. If you give me something to interact with, activity and interest, I will be a happy lil' lady. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Long-term. Please! Let us dive into a story and get lost. Have our fingers itching to get that ding of an email or Discord message. It's like a crush. And it's great - or I am crazy, who knows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Short-term. I am also open to shorter stories as well! Maybe the two characters don\u2019t click, or one of us is not feeling it, or maybe a story finds its perfect ending quicker than we intend. That is fine! Let\u2019s communicate. Talk to each other. Be honest. End the story and create something new! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Be excited about OOC chatting, plotting, planning, sharing images, and asking little \u201cwhat if\u201d questions about our story. If those little writing additives do not excite you, I will probably annoy you. I might be old these days, but I do still have the excitement level of a small child sometimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Be upfront about any limits or desires that you might have. I have a few limits myself, but not many, and I am looking to include adult content in my stories. So I always want to make sure we are on the same page, traveling down the same path with ideas. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Please introduce yourself in your PM to me. At least a little! While I will do my best to reply to everyone who sends me a message, I will be much more excited and happy to get a story going if you do not simply write \u201cwanna rp?\u201d and press send. Please include your email or Discord handle in your PM, just so I know you perused everything in my post and so we can get going on a great story :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is really it! Have more questions? Need more specifics on genres, limits, samples of my writing \u2013 all that jazz, feel free to ask! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope to hear from you!!!",

However, this will not be a LOTR roleplay, this will be an original roleplay set in an original world. Sure, there will be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs, and other magical creatures, and the concept of good vs evil present in that universe will be in this roleplay, but the approach to these topics will be completely different.\n\nI\u2019m mostly looking for someone who has a basic understanding and knowledge of Lord of the Rings, someone who has high vocabulary skills, and someone who is literate. Long paragraphs are not necessary, but the ability to be creative and descriptive is a necessity. While this roleplay will definitely have romance, and may well indeed have lewd scenes, I would like those aspects of the story to grow organically, just like with romance in real life. \n\nThe setting of the story will be Terra, a mythical planet full of magical beings, where unexplainable and wondrous things are considered completely normal. It follows the story of brave adventurers fighting against an evil -- still unnamed -- threatening to destroy everything pure and good, while at the same time trying to prevent the kingdoms from destroying each other. The only problem: they can\u2019t seem to get a long at first. Fortunately, through teamwork, they will learn to get along with each other, and eventually start having feelings for each other. My character will be a human, but you have the choice to decide what race your character will be. Obviously, both of our characters will be from different countries within the same world, with different motives as to why they want to save it from imminent doom.\n\nIf you\u2019d be interested in writing this story with me and brainstorming some ideas together, feel free to DM me! (You must have a Discord account, since that\u2019s the platform I mainly roleplay on.)",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s like this: I have a bunch of ideas I can bring to a story, but it seems like the posts that I\u2019ve read are looking for a very specific character in a fandom, or a very specific setting and style, and I\u2019m not sure if what I have will work for anyone else. So I\u2019m going to post about how I play and some of my character ideas and go fish.\n\u00a0\nAbout me: I\u2019m a good writer and a pretty experienced roleplayer. I can usually respond at minimum once a day. My responses run a couple of paragraphs, depending on what\u2019s going on, what I\u2019m working with, and so on. Email or Discord only - sorry, no Kik. I like to share control over the course of the story and the worldbuilding rather than dictate it or just react to it. I love OOC chatting and getting to know the other player, and OOC planning about the direction of the story, free exchange of ideas, talking about what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, is very important to me. I prefer stories with romance subplots and NSFW themes and scenes, so I always ask that anyone I play with be an adult. If you are not looking for any of that, or you aren\u2019t comfortable writing it, just pass me by. I\u2019m just looking for someone I can be a good fit with. I talk about my OC\u2019s below but I am not opposed to playing canon characters, I just prefer to make up my own stories, so I\u2019ll probably want to double with OC\u2019s.\n\u00a0\nThese are a few of my favorite things: sci fi, Lovecraftian horror, urban fantasy, high fantasy, Marvel, DC, steampunk, Harry Potter\n\u00a0\nI am allergic to: slice of life, high school\n\u00a0\nA few OC\u2019s for your perusal:\n\u00a0\nMarie-Catherine Taffanel \u2013 the plucky pilot. Taffy is a preternaturally gifted young space pilot, quirky and kind. She has a sad backstory, but she hates to be serious. Taffy would make a good partner for a swindler or smuggler in a sci fi plot.\n\u00a0\nEhlana \u2013 a mysterious woman looking for transport to the outer rim of the galaxy, where the ruling empire is weakest. She says she was a courtesan but she certainly doesn\u2019t seem like any courtesan you\u2019ve ever seen, reserved, thoughtful, and seems to know a lot about the royal family and military strategy.\n\u00a0\nEvadne Whitman \u2013 a beautiful heiress from the 1920\u2019s whose passing interest in the occult has led her down dark paths with no hope of return. Lovecraftian horror is what I\u2019m after with her.\n\u00a0\nRemy Sinclair \u2013 an urban fantasy character, but one with quite a lot of story around her for anyone wanting to take on the world building. Remy and the other side characters I have in development around her are descended from the Nephilim, the children of angels and humans. She could be fun for anyone who wants to try to school me about Constantine beyond the films, or if someone wanted to try out their Lucifer (I\u2019ve been watching the show). Remy also has a bit of a superhero build, she\u2019s unnaturally strong and tough. She could be a fun sidekick for a superhero, or we could go the other way and have her pair up with another of her \u201ckind\u201d for a noir mystery.\n\u00a0\nAlice Asamore \u2013 a steampunk demon slayer and monster hunter. She has a lot of companion characters in my mind if anyone likes to double.\n\u00a0\nAlix Stratford \u2013 a Potterverse auror, a goofball with a big heart and a penguin patronus.\n\u00a0\nIf any of this sounds tempting, or if you have something else you think I might be good for, please send me a message!",

            "selftext": "**Requirements**: 18+ in age, no exceptions. Literate. F/F romance with nsfw themes. Third person. One paragraph reply minimum, ideally as long as it\u2019s something to work with, we should be fine. I tend to write para/multi-para. I use Discord with a separate server. The only other platform I might use is Google Docs. I like worldbuilding, details, relationship and character/plot development, so if you\u2019re not into contributing to that, please look elsewhere! \n\n**Summary**: Fiend fighting evolved from a time when the ancients on Earth used to place wagers on unregulated dog fights. As the centuries passed, technology only fueled its depraved entertainment. Earth fell after the greed of over-industrialism and harsh realities of climate change brought it to its knees. \n\nMars, this time a world much loved and preserved by its occupants, took longer to be overcome by human setbacks. This world fought a new battle with the fine-tuning of cloning and the ethics of genetic and biomechanical modifications of animals and humans alike. It wreaked more havoc on the ecosystem than Mother Nature ever could. Even a planet so well protected couldn\u2019t stop the creatures from their own ignorance.\n\nSet in a futuristic society, long after the fall of Earth and shortly after the fall of Mars, humans have been absorbed into their third planet of habitation. One on which modifying organic species for sport is outlawed and humans coexist with other alien species. The introduction of Fiends became the new standard of personal protection, and personal gain, that rose up in its place. \n\nI\u2019d like to build upon this world, inspired by the grit and visuals of the animations Sonnie\u2019s Edge and Fairy Gone. How your fiend looks/acts/fights is completely up to you. I do like to draw in my spare time so I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to drawing our fiends if we hit it off :) \n\n**Prompts**\n\n* A disgraced surgeon turned ripperdoc to help pay off schooling, she began a foolish foray into underground fiend fighting as a way to make extra cash. She loses a match and bet to your character, now owing you a sizable debt she can\u2019t afford. \n\n* The country\u2019s annual fiend fighting tournament is a nationwide event spanning six months. It is known for its brutal rivalry in singular combat for the first three months, and forcing you to work in pairs for the last three months. We are rising fiend fighters in our own right, currently taking over the legal tournament scene; knowing of each other, but very little about. We are paired together in the first week of the second half. \n\n* My character is a general tinkerer who fixes fiends and salvages them for parts. Someone sabotages your fiend with a deadly virus during a match causing it to be destroyed in combat. You enlist me to source and build you a new one according to your design. \n\n* I\u2019d also be down to do some weird alien drugs and race on the backs of our fiends through a field of flowers... or just hold your hand. I\u2019m a pretty open person, just sayin\u2019 \n\nEverything here is just an idea, something to spark an interest and get your creative thunder rumbling. I\u2019d love to hear your ideas as well and can\u2019t wait to brainstorm together and collaborate. If this sounds like something you\u2019d be interested in, please send a private message! \u201cHey, can we rp?\u201d type of messages are kindly ignored. Your interest is reflected in your effort. If the post is still up, it\u2019s still open. Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "  \n\nHello all, I'm new to the role-playing scene here. I\u2019m interested in starting a story with one of my male characters in a unique world. Growing up I was fascinated (pretty much obsessed lol) by LOTR and other olden time RPG type stories and I was hoping to re-create something like that as far as the world goes. NSFW aspects are welcome, but I\u2019m trying for that not to be the focus. Also, I would like it to be for a longer RP so storylines can develop, and characters can grow so the action might not come right away. I\u2019m not a stickler about where you go with the story and I won\u2019t get all bent out of shape like some people do when you don\u2019t adhere to their exact style or the direction they want to go in. Just a chill laid back RP that we both can enjoy and be proud of. \n\nAs for the writing style I usually write between 400-700 words at a time in the 3rd person, but you can write in whatever person you\u2019d like. I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m the greatest when it comes to grammar, formatting, or even writing, but I try my best so please try too. We don\u2019t have to be too frequent, maybe once or twice a week or more if you\u2019re really interested. OOC conversations are very much welcome as we can brainstorm ideas to develop characters and bounce ideas off each other.  \n\nFeel free to Message if you're interested. Cheers!! :)",

            "selftext": " Lush is a discord roleplayer community that offers a world in which resides a wide array of fantastical beings. We are first and foremost a mature community of 18+ literate roleplayers looking to add more quality writers to this world! We write anywhere from novella to a minimum of paragraph length, offer clean organised OOC chats, and a team of dedicated and responsive staff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though our lore is fairly extensive, it is split in a way to ease access for new characters in must-read and optional sections. We welcome original characters who are looking for a natural progression through Lush be it through learning magic, acquiring magical items or accessing high society in a moderated way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the pitch : \"Lush, a magocracy established in the eye of what the council named 'The mist'. A complex, self-sufficient chain of guild-ruled mega districts. It floats amongst a dense fog, held by magically powered devices lining the city's edges. Since it is made of an agglomeration of different districts connected by large magical bridges, there isn't a direct way in, or out of it. Anyone that comes or leaves must be either summoned, or banished by a mage. The arcane arts play a major role in the life of nearly all of its inhabitants, and while tech in itself was never really let aside.. most innovations combine a certain amount of engineering, and spellcrafting. As a result, Lush is stuck in an era of its own, replacing most of today's convenience with magical means, yet dropping any significant tech past the medieval era in the process \\[...\\]\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, here's the invite link: https://discord.gg/hQVRyZd",

Living in our one bedroom apartment I\u2019m not the best part of the neighborhood but it was all two broke college students could afford anything besides the cup noodles and Netflix. You were fed up and didn\u2019t want us to struggle so you went off to the military hoping you\u2019ll earn some extra cash with hopes of returning and giving me the \u201cthe perfect life\u201d.\n\nThe first year, we\u2019d send endless letters and talked almost every night. The second year we talked but it slowed down the letters got distant and the phone calls were either once every two weeks or once a month. Year three was the toughest the letters and phone calls stopped completely.\n\nNow you\u2019re back in town you\u2019re ready to pick up where we left off but a lot of things have changed since we last talked, since we last seen each other.. Am I going to be open arms? Will I have moved on? Endless possibilities \n\nSo this will be about a couple who\u2019ve been together since their senior year in high school\nand together through most of their college years. He wants to give her the perfect life, wants her to see that she deserves more. She didn\u2019t feel that way she loved their life before he left and she wasn\u2019t so sure she liked the new one he was trying to put her in.\n\nThis will be very heavy on emotion and drama so if you\u2019re interested please have a character bio ready! I know this post is kinda patchy and missing a few this but just made this up on the spot would really love to elaborate more with someone and see where this goes.",

I've RPed for about roughly 10 years so I have extensive experience in telling a story and writing.\n\nAs for the RP i'm seeking, it can be anything other than a regular slice of life RP. I prefer adventure, downfall, rebellion... sadly, those are things you cannot achieve in a slice of life scenario. I have ideas (Not prompts because my mind is always changing) that we can build into a story. You even can bring your ideas to the table too! Whether it's for a Fantasy story, SCI-FI, Thriller, Horror.. I would love to hear them.\n\nAnother thing I would like to note on is when I say Romance and NSFW, I'm not talking about purely smut... Yeah, I like those types of scenes as much as the next guy but what's the point if our character's don't mash well together. There has to be build, yearning, love between them.\n\nSo enough said/rambled. PM if you have any other questions!\n\nHappy roleplaying!",

            "selftext": " \n\n**Rookshaven** is one of the longest running, lore-intensive group role playing storylines on Discord right now.\n\nBased in present-day northern Scotland, Rookshaven Academy and University is a school for mages, though the storyline only allows for university students and professors to be applied.\n\n**A bit about our lore:**\n\nThe mage community has always held their royal families above the rest. Though they aren't considered kings or queens of their mage classes anymore, the royal families are believed to be the first blood lines to develop their particular kind of magics. As such, royalty have always been the law-makers for mages worldwide. In the late 1800s, a rebel sect of mages rose up to attack the royals and all of their complicit, loyal subjects - resulting in a Mage Civil War.\n\nMany mages and their royal families were killed off, while the beast mage class disappeared entirely. From that war, the High Council was formed. A collection of the remaining royal houses, electing one member of their family to represent them in the governing of the mage community.\n\nUnfortunately, out of the original eight royal families, only four are alive in present day. Additionally, two new mage classes have been discovered. Without a way to track the new class's lineage, Mythics and Necromancers have been left without a representative in the Council. As a result, many laws passed since their discovery have been created seemingly for the purpose of keeping Necromancers and Mythics at a disadvantage. While the newest class, Mythics, are sigil-bound at a young age to feel an automatic pull toward royal families, they often grow up to be employed as maids or servants for the royals.\n\nSince 2016, another uprising of rebels has been seen. Between then and 2019 (present day), many royals and loyalists alike have lost their lives in terrorist attacks by these Rebels. In the last year of the group story on Discord, students have been attacked both on and off campus, leading many to believe there are Rebels among the ranks of Rookshaven, despite the school being run by the Council.\n\n  As of January 1st, 2019, the light binding Royal family in its entirety was wiped out in an attack from a hybridized spell known as Shadow Fire. \n\n**What you can expect:**\n\n\\- Monthly events in which your character can earn points to put into their dice, making them stronger.\n\n\\- Lots of lore.\n\n\\- High Activity.\n\n\\- Outlined mage classes, as well as factions to push their own agendas (Royals, Loyalists, Rebels, Sympathizers).\n\n\\- Friendly players willing to work with new players to create backstories and social networks.\n\n\\- A secondary server only viewable to applied and approved players where you can post playlists, aesthetic images, social media posts, journal entries, as well as having 1-2 private channels specific to your character for housing and training.\n\n\\- Active Staff willing to help new players any way we can and get players immersed in the story faster.\n\n\\- Patience. It's a lot of lore. It's okay if it takes a while to get through it all.\n\n\\- An NPC Library to check out characters for scenes when your own characters are locked down.\n\n\\- Full transparency. We hold honesty and clear communication above everything.\n\n**What we expect:**\n\n\\- literacy\n\n\\- a 3 paragraph minimum per post (there are exceptions to this, but the majority of players should strive for this)\n\n\\- realistic characters that fit the server lore\n\n\\- activity every 2 weeks, or communication with the Admins if you need to take time away\n\n\\- read the FAQ\n\n\\- a drive to grow as a writer\n\n**Classes Available:**\n\n\\- Air\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Water\n\n\\- Darkness\n\n\\- Light\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n\\- Earth\n\n\\- Necromancy\n\n\\- Beast (small wait list)\n\n\\- Mythics\n\n**Locked Classes:**  \n\\- Hybrid Mages (mages born from opposite classed parents, or from one Mirskoy parent)  \n\\- Variant Mages (mages descended from hybrids whose abilities manifest as a variation of two classes)\\*  \n\n\n  \\* *Available as a secondary character with Admin approval, or as a check-out from the NPC library.*\n\n**Royal Families Available:**\n\n\\- Air ( 1 open availability slot left)\n\n\\- Fire\n\n\\- Dark\n\n\\- Spirit\n\n**Upcoming/Ongoing Events:**  \n\\- Hybrid Relations Act Event (abduction &amp; experimentation on hybrid mages)  \n\\- Internment Arc  \n\\- Summer Trips  \n\\- Sigil Exclusion Arc  \n\\- Alumni Formal  \n\\- Tattoo Arc\n\n[Link to Rookshaven on Discord](https://discord.gg/64HWFYy)",

I have the ability to reply at least once, if not more, in a day. Please don't let this be a deterrent. Another thing -- I absolutely love OOC chatter and I try to communicate regularly even if we aren't writing back and forth.\n\nI only write using Discord!\n\nMy style of writing is third-person, past-tense paragraph(s). My quantity varies with the plot and the scene in the plot. Dialogue is generally shorter; however, I am not against writing three to four paragraphs if the moment in the plot calls for it. I will not write with anyone who uses first person.\n\nI will write any gender in any pairing. I am comfortable with writing NSFW themes but I ask that you are eighteen or older because I don't particularly like the idea of going to jail.\n\nMy plots will always include romance because I absolutely adore it and I will never tire of writing it. However, I am particularly fond of slowburn romance as frustrating as it can become! The genres I am searching for are post-apocalypse, dystopia, slice-of-life, and others. I don't shy away from the dark and gritty themes either. Throw me all the angst and pain. I absolutely love discussing plot and characters so I don't have any particular plots in mind as of now. It's something we should create to become our own.\n\nI'm currently searching for some plots but I'm open to more but I will absolutely LOOOOVE you if you give me one of these --\n\n\u2022 Young single mom (18-21) going to school and working all on her own that catches the eye of a male classmate who quickly falls for her but doesn't know about the kid\n\n\u2022 A study abroad trip where the one studying abroad is paired with a native to the country\n\n\u2022 A 'country boy' romance aesthetic because I've been listening too far too much Taylor Swift recently\n\n\nI don't know if I missed anything. Chances are I did. However, if my post intrigues you, feel free to send me a little orange envelope! Try to intrigue me, too, please, where I feel more compelled to reply.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello there. I'm looking for a partner for some longterm roleplaying. I love immersive, story-based roleplays with a strong focus on plot and, especially dialogue. I don't mind crafting and leading the story per se, but I enjoy things with a partner or partners who can become immersed in the world or storyline we create together (playing things somewhat realistically, with consistent characters for example).\n\nI usually write original plots but lately I've been trying to get out of my comfort zone and write within fandom. It's not something I find particularly difficult but it's a welcome change and I've found the fandom community to be way more invested. That's been a good thing so far.\n\nThere are, unfortunately, few fandoms where I feel completely confident in utilizing the universe to create a story:\n\nNaruto (I know pretty much everything up to Boruto's storyline. Just never got around to watching it.)\n\nWorld of Warcraft\n\nMonster Hunter (There isn't a lot to be fair, but I can make it work)\n\nBleach\n\nOthers that I'm familiar with, but not necessarily fully knowledgeable are:\n\nThe Witcher\n\nStar Wars\n\nOf course, if you really want to we can create a universe only loosely-based in these or any other setting. I don't particularly mind that.\n\nI'm versatile with regards to the characters I can play and can play multiple characters for story purposes if needed. I can play characters of any moral alignment in plots ranging from vanilla and romantic to dark and angsty.\n\nI prefer to play characters at my own age (28) and older (up to 50). I generally don't play younger characters than myself, though I'm not necessarily opposed to it if the plot requires it.\n\nI do enjoy playing the 'everyman', though. All this means is that if we were to play in the Naruto universe, I wouldn't be a ninja; in the Star Wars universe, I wouldn't be a Jedi or Sith. In that regard, I'm kind of boring but consider me the kind of idiot who only plays human warrior in fantasy games. Just how I roll.\n\nI do like to talk a bit and set up a plot and characters before we do the roleplaying, just so I know my partner and how they'd like things to go. I'm imaginative and quick to adapt so plot twists and unpredictable outcomes of events should be expected. Not one to shy away from misfortune or bad ends, either so things should be spicy.\n\nOther than that, I'm laid back and I'm looking for someone chill, who can take things in stride and genuinely enjoy spending some time. You don't have to impress me and I won't expect you to be perfect.\n\nHit me up if you're interested.",

I don't have the attention span for long, slowburn things, and i have too many ideas for those anyway, but what i do love, is full lit one shots. I'm looking for someone who knows a bit about, or is willing to learn about, d&amp;d worlds and write some oneshots with me with some characters! Romance, adventure, or just a fun tavern scene then something else, I'd love it. We can just set out any characters we'd like to use for things, and pick and choose who we want to use for each idea. Message me on here and of you're interested, I'll give you my discord.",

            "selftext": "Hey there! Quick intro: I\u2019m a 26 female interested in deep, character driven stories. I am adept at playing female and male characters as well as playing multiple characters/side characters. I tend to lean towards m// when it comes to romance but also may do m/f and f// depending on the plot and characters. Let me know where your head is with this. My usual genre wheelhouses are cyberpunk/sci-fi, supernatural/horror, modern/psychological, and fantasy. I\u2019m very patient when it comes to replying \u2013 I get busy, everyone gets busy. I generally use Google docs or Discord and I enjoy using Discord for OOC chatting in particular.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone to build ideas off of -- who comes with lots of ideas and is easy to plot with -- and has an excellent grasp of the English language. When you DM me, please be specific with what you want and are interested in. It helps a lot in determining if we'd be good together. \n\nI'm currently looking for something either supernatural/horror or fantasy that is very character driven. World building is always necessary but I'm more interested in how our characters play off each other. Just throwing our characters into a sandbox isn't really what I want. \n\nSome concepts I\u2019ve been kicking around in my head:\n\n\u00b7 A dragon rider order akin to the Jedi. My thought is that the order transcends birthright and status\u2014somewhat like monks or the Jedi in a way, where everyone is equal under the organization as long as you\u2019ve been deemed worthy by a dragon. The caveat? You must give up your old life and possessions entirely. I have a noble born rider who was forced to give up his birthright but may still have lingering ambitions but could probably swing another character as well. Want to play a shapeshifting dragon? Another dragon rider? This is flexible! Bonus: add in some political intrigue and tight character development ** Craving the most\n\u00b7 An episodic roleplay focused on two characters going on their own unique journeys while traveling across a magic-touched dreamscape...or sharing a ride in a classic car while battling monsters from town to town. Drama, darkness, and a touch of humor. Basically, a preternatural twist on partners in crime.\n\u00b7 Two supernatural creatures from the time of old gods and ancient rituals coexisting across the ages, waxing and waning with belief and magic, alternating between fondness and resentment and snarking the ever loving heck out of each other. \n\u00b7 \"One day they'll write stories of the\nterrible things we did for love.\"\n\u00b7 \u201cWe\u2019ll survive. Somehow we always do.\u201d\n\nOr feel free to throw your ideas at me and I'll build on it if I think I can work with it. I\u2019d be down with incorporating an element of darkness and psychological emphasis to any of these. \n\nThanks!",

Though I can write male secondary characters and NPCs.\n\nNo novels for replies or one liners. I can usually write a paragraph or two per response but long replies take too much effort and the RP usually dies. I hate endlessly plotting also and prefer to let the characters unravel the story for themselves. \n\nI imagine this as an original high fantasy world divided into realms based on the seasons/four elements with the typical tropes and maybe some steampunky vibes. \n\nHere's Nephele's bio:\n\nNephele Surmount: A former serving wench and Apprentice Ranger of the Realm. Rangers in my world are part monster hunters, beast masters, elemental summoners, shape shifters, woodsmen forest sages who can telepathically communicate with their animal mounts. \n\nShe uses a combination of archery, alchemy and elemental magick but still has yet to tame the wildness within herself. \n\n\nNephele is 19. Her flying mount is a chubby lazy peryton\u00a0 (avian being that's half Barn owl, half stag with a serpents tail) named Cornelius (or Corny) who thinks he's a unicorn and embarrassingly tries to mate with unicorns.\n\n\nSo far Nephele can only summon lady bugs manatees and gnomes to aide her in battle and she can use divination with cloud gazing. She can shape shift money into leaves but frustratingly not leaves into money.\n\nThe Ranger has bad habits including gambling, illegal flying mount racing, and bedding sky pirates instead of arresting them.\n\nShe's a cocky foul mouthed tomboy with a soft spot for misfits and creatures of all kinds.\n\nI'm not sure where to start, but her Ranger apprenticeship causing her to travel opens some possibility.\u00a0\n\nMessage me if you're kind, creative and interested in RPing with Nephele and of course Corny",

I\u2019ve got a Roleplay idea that I\u2019ve been dying to try out, a fantasy romance concept that really interests me.\n\nI have a character who is of orcish blood and who is generally a warrior and blacksmith. He\u2019s a veteran of war and has a lot of baggage from being a warrior and seeing most of his friends and family die to war. He often struggles to reconcile his skill at fighting and the adrenaline rush of combat with his distaste for wider-scope violence and war, and he does have a sort of survivors guilt thing going on. \n\nI\u2019m down to pair him with many medieval aged characters, canon or original. I really wanted to explore themes of societal pressures between the two main characters, mainly to fulfill the masculine, straight warrior trope (for my guy) and whatever theme you were interested in for yours. \n\nWhen it comes to expectations, I\u2019m looking for a slower, more mature Roleplay with good description. 1-3 paragraphs per post is my preference. I am cool with nsfw stuff (I\u2019m 20, so I\u2019m good on that front.) and a more mature Roleplay will likely include it. I\u2019m also looking for deeper themes like trauma, societal pressures and discrimination to have a part in the Roleplay, so if any of these things tend to trigger someone I don\u2019t think this is a great Roleplay for that. (Of course, I wouldn\u2019t want slurs of any kind being used, but I did want to be realistic in issues explored in Roleplay) \n\nIf anyone is interested, please message me and we can talk about plot and ideas for characters.

            "selftext": "Sup sup!\n\nI've been in, I suppose, some serious need a good RP, something fun, something I look forward to since all my partners left or are very rarely around. I'm a 21 year old female in real life, but I can RP FxM, or MxM relationships. (FtMxM, FtMxF, MtFxM, are also acceptable! Sorry, no FxF \ud83d\ude14) If anyone here happens to play the game, or watch playthroughs of, Choices: Stories You Play, I'm quite interested in doing something based off of some of their stories! I'm a RPer who LOVES using faceclaims, or character references is another term, and as a warning, I use real life ones. Anime and art refs can be used by me, but i highly prefer the former. I also RP in third person, semi-literate, although I don't have an average reply length. Sometimes I can write a couple paragraphs+, or only one down to a few sentences. It varies and depends! But definitely no one liners! All I ask is my partner avoids texting language, uses punctuation and grammar. You don't need to be an English major, as I'm certainly not! I highly doubt I put commas in all the right places. My timezone is EST for reference!\n\nNow for the genres! Fantasy, possibly sci-fi, mystery, slice-of-life (typically mixed with other elements for me, otherwise it's boring), romance (but _not_ as the main focus), supernatural (not the show), paranormal, psychological, horror (never quite attempted). There may be others I haven't listed.\n\nFandoms: I don't exactly have any.. \ud83e\udd2b\n\nSorry for the length;;this is longer than intended. I DO NOT have Discord, and DO NOT plan to make one any time soon, so unfortunately my only platforms are Kik and PMs. The former is significantly faster and preferable. I know I'm limiting myself but I just don't have an interest in Discord.\n\nLastly, I can write smut, but I'm not doing so constantly and without a plot. I would really like it if my partner was over 18 if I am to write such things! To anyone who made it this far, or even just skimmed to here, thank you for reading and acknowledging my post;; if anyone is interested, just PM me!",

This server does not have a standard plot attached but rather the plot is shaped by the members. As I stated in the server itself:\n\n\u201c [\u2026] What this means is, this server is one where the characters can essentially do whatever they please (to an extent). It is not mandatory for characters to go on missions but they may. Characters can build relationships with whomever, do whatever they please, and the plot molds from that. Events can and likely will pop up for the server\u2019s inhabitants to participate in. There WILL be moments where we plot something to happen. It\u2019s essentially a sandbox.\u201d\n\nSince the server is new (I created it last night), there is not much to add to this post yet. In fact, as in this moment I\u2019m the only member. But I\u2019m happy to work with whoever joins. New features will be added in the future when more people join and suggest things. I\u2019m a friendly mod who intends to make this server just as friendly, perhaps even more so! \n\nThe MEE6 bot will direct you were to go upon joining the server. I hope you guys check it out and plan to stay. I\u2019ll see you there!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/GqkYqUJ",

            "selftext": "  As the light starts to fade so does the sound of the skirmish, it had been a small one by anyone\u2019s standards with perhaps a dozen or so men per side. The screams of injured men littering the field and the stench of it is everywhere. This is the bit that no one ever tells you thinks Eleanor, the poets and heralds don\u2019t write about the dying screaming and the smell of death, it isn\u2019t glorious to anyone but a true warrior as it is what they live for, and Eleanor was a true warrior. \n\nPulling the hounskull helmet from her head, the padded hood under it is soaked in sweat and pulling that off to reveal the shorn hair of her head it isn\u2019t hard to see how she can pass for a man when required to do so. Her skin is tanned from the summer of campaigning across France, a longsword at her left hip and warhammer in her right hand still is dripping with the remains of the skull from the crossbowman who had until a moment earlier been harassing her. Her whole body is encased in Milanese plate armour, the breastplate hidden behind the red surcoat emblazoned with her device of a black dog flanked by 2 golden bees. The armour was the finest available anywhere and had cost more than most men would see in 2 lifetimes but it has kept her alive as it will continue to do so it had been worth every single coin paid for it. \n\n\u201cLoot the bodies quickly I want to be away from here and encamped within the hour.\u201d Her voice carries strong and steady to the men who surround her already looking through the dead for things of value. She was used to giving the commands and her small company of men at arms knew both who she was, what she was, and didn\u2019t care they followed her because they knew she could make them rich. \n\nAnd as such Lady Eleanor Fitzroy, the fils de bast daughter of Humphrey duke of Lancaster and Illegitimate granddaughter to Henry V King of England looks across the field of France, the year was 1414 and winter was setting in. Soon the weather would prevent her raiding and plundering of the French and she would have to retreat with her men to Calais for the Winter. But for now she will continue to make herself rich and prosperous, and curses be to anyone who thinks that this isn\u2019t a womans work. Because this is what she loves to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi all. Not a great post but another one from me. This is based on a few different ideas but also my love of high medieval history and the wars and conflicts of its kings. So Eleanor is the illegitimate daughter of royalty and has Cast off the idea of being a lady in return for being a warrior. She has shaved her hair short wears armour and could pass for an effeminate man in many situations which is what she relies on. But her men (and women) of her retinue know different and serve her anyway.\n\n So who are you. Are you one of her retinue? Another lord or lady? Men and women can fit in this pretty easily I think and I would love to see what we could come up with. \n\nEleanor is obviously going to have to be white/tanned from the sun due to her Medieval European status but if you have preferences for her looks please let me know and I will accommodate as much as possible.\n\nI want this to be a long term rp and detailed. Romance, warfare, politics, all those lovely things.\n\nThis is set in 1414 the year before the battle of Agincourt and wrote it to be in france as this is a period and area I know well from a historical point of view, if you want to bring anything different to it let me know.\n\nI roleplay almost exclusively through reddit Pm\u2019s so please message there rather than chat.\n\nThat all said I really hope to hear from you all.\n\nEllie xxxxxx",

            "selftext": "Hiya!! I'm Tiny! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been wanting a Hero RP ever since I saw the Endgame movie! But instead of doing something entirely hinged on Marvel / the Avengers I'm looking more for something involving a hero and a villain. It can still take place in the Marvel / Avengers universe if you so desire, but I want the main dynamic to be between a villain and a hero.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially, one of our characters is a hero and the other is a Villain. I have an OC I plan on using, but she could be refitted for either role, so I'm happy playing either.  You can use an OC or a canon character from a superhero universe, but I would prefer to keep it in the realm of things I know, namely DC and Marvel. Not too well-versed on X-MEN or Mutants.   \n\n\nAs for the plot, I was thinking these two would be notorious rivals and a seemingly even match, both of them having their fair share of wins and losses. Just as it seems as though these two will always be butting heads and never putting an end to this spat, a third party shows up that puts everything out a wack. Now I'd like to discuss with my partner what this is but a few ideas:\n\n* A new hero organization that captures the villain with ease (possibly ruining the heroes rep) but are actually shady. This would lead to the hero 'breaking the rules' to free the villain and teaming up with them to put a stop to this new hero org. \n* A villain arriving that's a bigger threat than the current one, forcing them to work together to put a stop to them since it's THEIR town. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be using my OC who goes by the alias \"Bunny\". A new hero / villain with a bit of a memey, online following due to her antics and lively social media account. Very much a class clown, doesn't take much seriously and often gets herself into trouble. Her powers include what you typically associate with a rabbit: speed, fast reflexes, high jumps, etc. She's also very cunning and smart, knowledgeable of technology and the internet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- DISCLAIMERS -\n\n* You'll have to be OK with time-skips or jumping around in points of time since initially our characters can't always be together seeing as how they're sworn-enemies. By this I mean you'd have to be OK with RPing an interaction, then ending the interaction and skipping to another plot point where they're together again.\n* If you want this to be a rivals to lovers RP, they'll have to be around the same age as my OC, but I can ret-con her to something closer to whatever character you want to play. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- RP Rules -\n\nThese are just some general guidelines I have for RPing. Most of these are common sense and decency, but take a look.\n\n1. 3rd person RPing and Discord only, please!\n2. Stay calm and open! You have no idea how many partners I've found on this platform that are so uptight. This is all for fun!\n3. Hand-in-hand with the rule above, do not belittle ideas or characters I toss up into the air, and I'll do the same for you. If you think something I put out honestly won't work, let me know! But there's no need to be rude.\n4. No real post or experience minimum!\n   1. Since post-length is all based on what's going on in the RP at the moment, I'm not expecting full-length novels during slow spells but a few sentences at least! Something to work with.\n   2. Novices and experienced alike are welcome! I'm very patient, so don't be scared to ask for an RP! I won't nit-pick your grammar, spelling, etc. We all make mistakes! :)\n5. If you want certain themes in an RP, you need to be old enough. \n6. You need to be OK with chatting and OOC, I like talking with my partner and exchanging ideas with them. Additionally, please toss in ideas and help me with the plot! Not looking to GM, I want to write this with you!\n7. This is a silly rule but, I find that a lot of these partner encounters involve in-depth plotting and never actually getting around to the RP. So I'd like to get some base lines down and just jump in and let characters unravel the story! If you ever wanna change something, add some zing to the story, or have an idea, feel free to talk to me OOC!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Genres -\n\nIf you've got ideas for genres, lay them on me when we're chatting. I'm open to pretty much everything! My only caveat is that strictly slice of life RP's can't keep my interest, so hard-pass on those. I'm looking for adventure/action, laughs, romance, etc!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested, please PM me to discuss, thank you!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys!  First post here.  I'm a 24 year old long time RPer looking for someone who can RP with me over email or potentially Discord, though I prefer to use Discord primarily for OOC.  I prefer writing third person novel format, and can generally put up just as much content as I get back, though I default to a \"4-6 meaty paragraphs\" kind of guy, so we'll have similar expectations if you're kind of naturally in that ballpark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a huge interest in sci-fi/near-future plot devices and worlds, have a deep interest in worldbuilding, and am tired of doing roleplays where our characters face no real challenges or struggles in their lives.  For me, determining whether or not our characters truly \"win\" the roleplay should be a determination of our writing direction, and not a given plot device.  I am totally comfortable \"maining\" a character who winds up dying in the middle of the story only to main another character, so long as it serves the plot properly.  I'd be fairly interested in attempting an RP with randomized battle mechanics (e.g. probabilities to get hit, connect a hit, etc. etc.) if that's something you might like to discuss, as well, but totally optional.\n\nI enjoy sexual content and violence in my RPs, so long as the subject matter/world can tolerate it.  As far as sex-related topics go, we can talk limits in private.  I don't mind RPing as far as you want to go, but an RP centered around sex as a plot-device isn't what I'm looking for in the slightest.\n\nI really don't have much else to say to describe exactly what I'm interested in.  I'm pretty open to the types of worlds we could construct.  I have a pretty deep interest in things like mecha, near-future tech (technologies that are so close to being insanely powerful/efficient at what they do but just aren't fully figured out yet), and themed power sets within a universe (e.g. Tokyo Ghoul's implementation of Kagune, or any universe where powers have a viable explanation/reason to exist and aren't just OP for no reason).  Totally not opposed to doing some worldbuilding inside of a pre-established setting if you have a general anime/game/movie universe that you'd like to try something in, but I heavily prefer OC characters and OC-ish plot devices if you want to go there.\n\nMessage me and we can chat over Reddit for a bit and figure some stuff out!  Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello there! This is actually my first post on Reddit, although I have known about the site for a while. Anyhow, let's get down to business.\n\nI'm looking for some a fun and interesting MxM roleplay. I guess I may as well lay down some basic information.\n\n***A little about myself***\n\n* I am from the PST timezone\n* I'm pretty active when it comes to posting and will try to do so multiple times a day\n* I absolutely love fantasy. Be it the possible settings, the magic, or just the numerous different creatures that one can play as, I just can't help myself.\n* I really only do MxM ships, so really sorry for those looking for FxM or FxF. This also applies to characters that identify as males since that's a whole separate situation and one that I am not personally willing to get into.\n* I am literate. When replying, my posts can vary in length from anything like one to two paragraphs, upwards of two entire posts on Discord. It really just depends how into the RP I am.\n\n***Things I expect from a partner***\n\n* I want someone that is also literate\n* I want someone that can write a good and compelling story, not just leaving all aspects of the plot to me\n* I'd like someone who I can volley posts with, someone who's active and has the time to have fun with these characters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes down to it, my wants are pretty basic. I just want someone who I can sit down with and have a good time with both of our characters. I have a plethora of characters, all vastly different from one another. From towering centaurs to ferocious werewolves, or even the charming demon I can play just about anything.\n\nHopefully, we can plan something out and get to know each other a bit better. If interested, feel free to leave a comment or shoot me a message, we can discuss things and exchange discord information there.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! I'm looking for one or two more roleplay partners. Preferably someone more chill. I work a full time job and can generally only reply during the evening times once I get home from work. I need someone okay with that. Plus I'd love someone who is up for chatting! Some days I'm to tired to reply and just wanna talk. So if you love that then awesome! A few things before I get down to the obvious bits  \n   \n\\- Please be 18+. I like a few adult themes in my roleplay, including smut and prefer to roleplay with someone of or above the legal age limit.   \n\\- Be able to write at least a paragraph. One liners drive me nuts!  \n\\- If you have something come up and will be gone for more then a day please let me know. This has been an issue lately with people just leaving for weeks on end and then getting mad about me dropping them (When i've sent messages asking if they are still around) So just let me know please!  \n\n\nAs for what I'm looking for I'd love, love, love you if you were interested in an MxM roleplay, specifically Harry Potter related. I'm really into Draco x Harry and Sirius x Remus. For the Harry and Draco pairing I generally like post war/Hogwarts setting, anywhere between 3 to 5 years after the war has happened, but I'm open to other ideas. Remus and Sirius I generally like to not follow the canon story line to much and sorta do my own thing with them but I have no set idea for those two. Any ideas are welcomed for either pairing!\n\nDespite the fact that I'm looking for someone more on the chill end of things I would like that you be able to write well. Basic grammar and spelling and no one liners if at all possible would be great. I don't need a novel but a good few paragraphs would be awesome!\n\nThat a pretty much it! PM me if you're interested and put a little detail about yourself into your message! Thanks!! =)",

Over the years, humans have learned to fight back and protect what is of value to them. Creating holy weapons of silver to keep the evil masses at bay. They appointed a general to lead them to a safe victory, hoping that they would once again reclaim their peaceful home. Seven soldiers within the human army rose to the top, showing great strength during battle, so much so that others took notice and praised them as heroes. These seven heroes fought on to become captains beneath the general him/herself, only ever taking their direct orders. But, right when the humans thought they had a chance of victory, Satan released his seven sins, his personal generals into the human world. The sins were able to combat the seven heroes, soon enough hope of victory began to fade. Little did both sides know, Death was watching, deciding. Being the peculiar creature he was, Death felt a great sadness in watching the human race die out. So, in a bizarre attempt to help, he has offered his unorthodox gifts to the general and his/her heroes. But, Death is not invincible, if the humans are not careful not only can they lose the war, but they can make Satan unstoppable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmenities:\n\n\\- Bots and open to suggestions  \n\\- Staff positions open\n\n\\- Active and caring owner\n\n\\- NSFW channels for 18+\n\n\\- Detailed and Organized Layout\n\n\\- Custom Emojis  \n\n\nLink:  \n[https://discord.gg/9hvHKcm](https://discord.gg/9hvHKcm)",

Anyways, I'm looking for a long-term partner. Even if it's not one big scene, several smaller scenes could be cool too.\n\nOne idea I had for an RP would be a military scene. Perhaps we are a couple who met while deployed and need to hide our relationship. Or we could make it a little more story driven and be part of a special forces unit on a wild mission \n\nAnother idea I had is a sports scene. My character would be an up and coming female athlete who has been making a push to enter the male leagues of professional sports. We can discuss the sport but I was thinking either football or hockey.\n\nSo those are my two ideas. If you like one, message me here and we can discuss what platform to use. I prefer Kik but can use Discord.",

So you might have guessed from the title that this is a Tate no yuusha no nariagari roleplay (shield hero anime)\n\nI was thinking that this would be set around 150 years into the future, and our characters are the cardinal heroes as well as two other cardinal heroes who are NPCs (4 cardinal heroes like canon).  But I was thinking that we could have different weapons. It would still follow the general theme of the anime as in: long melee weapon, normal melee weapon, defensive and ranged. The waves had come back and were stronger than before. One of the kingdoms summon the cardinal heroes to protect their own kingdom in a selfish manner like melromarc. Filo is still the felolial queen, and the previous cardinal heroes are still being praised to this day, especially the shield hero. The rp will start when they are summoned and are in the castle\n\nI have a basic idea for my character, so contact me in any way on reddit and we can exchange discord tags",

            "selftext": "The Street Gods is a roleplay where you have freshly joined the largest criminal organization in New Antetime City, Succubus Wing. You begin as a brand new recruit, and it\u2019s up to you to decide how you\u2019ll carve your name into the concrete streets.\n\nExplore New Antetime, a metropolis mirroring cities you know and love with residential project districts, financial centers, and sprawling commercial malls. Or, go to any of the three other cities surrounding it, all of which have their own unique spin to what a city is made of and where it can be.\n\nTake on different missions for Succubus Wing. These\u2019ll require you to chase the gang\u2019s enemies, flex the riches you get from the dark underworld of crime, and even help out the community whose misfortune gave rise to the gang to begin with. You\u2019ll even have the opportunity to meet, albeit with some friction, the major gangs of the other cities.\n\nAs a Succubus, you get the opportunity to rise through the ranks of the gang and become the gangbanging devil you\u2019re meant to be. Earn Succubucks, the organization\u2019s currency, and exchange it for more power and prestige.\n\nAside the roleplay itself, the server\u2019s management makes getting into the action easy with a simple sheet which merely requires a list of abilities, and lax rules which expand creativity while ensuring a safe and fun environment for participants. There are also bots to play with during downtime, and simple chatting servers.\n\nSo, put on your heaviest chain, pull your rifle out from under your pillow, and join the Street Gods.\n\n[https://discord.gg/uTVPznS](https://discord.gg/uTVPznS)",

(or, his parents have already found him a bride and the escort is escorting him to his soon-to-be bride's kingdom) the prince really isn't looking to marry some girl he just met, and believes in love blossoming through a deeper connection, not marrying someone just for the sake of it. while the prince and his escort travel to several kingdoms, maybe some romance develops along the way, along with some crazy shtuff. \n\naside from the whole fantasy thing, i had something a bit more modern. two ex's are at a party, and they come accross one another. maybe there's a fight, maybe it gets emotional, and maybe they start off as friends and it branches into something more again. this one is just a little more dramatic. \n\nbut, if you have any ideas, and are just interested in the mxm part, i'm totally up for any ideas that you have!!! if you're looking for something more simple, that's okay too! you can also add your own suggestions and stuff to my two ideas! also, as far as rp experience goes, i honestly don't mind how much experience you have, it's okay. just as long as you're not gonna leave me hanging mid through the roleplay like some people do, haha. i've had trouble with that recently, but it's okay. \n\nas far as NSFW goes, i don't mind it as long as it's not too extreme and creepy, and it still sorta falls withing the story. and it can't happen right away, it takes time. \n\nokay, sorry this was so long, but if you're interested please feel free to pm and we can discuss characters, scenarios, what platform we will rp on, and maybe chat a little bit! :))",

This all stopped when the World Government\u2019s Marines came along, capturing the Pirate King and sentencing him to death. However, just before he died the Pirate King spoke his last words, screaming them to the Heavens, telling all that he had hid his treasure, the One Piece, at the end of the Grand Line, and encouraged all to seek it out.\n\nThis has sparked the interest of many a generation, encouraging people to go out and become pirates to claim riches for themselves, creating \u2018The Great Pirate Age\u2019.\n\nSo for those of you who don\u2019t know, this roleplay is inspired by One Piece, the popular manga/anime of the same name, however you don\u2019t need to know anything about One Piece.\n\nNow what am I looking for? Well I\u2019m hoping to find a partner that wants to sail the seas with me as a pirate, adventuring from island to island, raising our bounties as we go and forming a mighty crew. More details can be discussed over messages.\n\nNow for writing style, I am pretty easy on this, I don\u2019t mind if we roleplay 1st or 3rd person and I don\u2019t mind about your post length as long as I\u2019m able to reply to it.\n\nI hope this post has interested you and if so please shoot me a message.",

The desert stretches far and inside it's boundaries sporadic communities of people eke out a living under the scorching sun, the desert holds many mysteries some say, for who knows what lies beneath it's surface. One thing that has always been a constant is the helmet, nearly ten metres high and nearly the same in width, the colossal bronze structure is pitted with scratches and scrapes, rust fills it's cracks and any original shine has been worn away by the elements, a relic of an age long gone. This is where our story begins with the inside of the helmet being our character's only protection from the sun, they wake with no memories of how they got there or who the other person is and will have to work together to search for answers.  \n\n\nHey everyone I'm Morokei or Moro for short and I've recently found myself short of RP partners and I decided to come back here to look for some more, as you can probably tell I have a few ideas knocking around but I am open to suggestions and discussion, I am looking for other people who would want to partake in a fantasy romance story set within this desert. A couple things to clarify, yes I am over eighteen and would like my partner to be the same, I have been roleplaying for four years now but I'm not an expert by any means, as for writing I have always preferred quality over quantity, half a paragraph of good writing is better than two or more of just waffle. I am fine with NSFW content as long as it comes from the story reaching a suitable point and not just for the sake of it. As I mentioned in the title I mainly use discord as my roleplaying platform but have experience with others.  \n\n\nWell I hope to hear from some of you soon, bearing in mind that if you have other ideas for a different story or setting if this one is not to your liking then feel free to PM me and we can chat about it.  \n\n\nKind regards,  \nMorokei.",

I write in third person and can get a paragraph or two out per response (give or take). I prefer to use discord, but I can also message over reddit.

(I have to abuse what little artistic talent I have somehow)\n\nThat being said I'm hoping to create an original story based on the franchise and would prefer to use OCs over canon characters since their stories have already been told. Whether action/adventure or slice of life focused, I'm very flexible and we can find a happy median that fits us. What I am shameless hoping for however is a story with a bit of romance, be it between masters or servants or master and servant, I'm happy with any.\n\nAbout me:\n\n- I am a 25+ year old adult woman with a full time career and a home life, so sometimes I might not be able to post for a day. Though I will always try to give a heads up because being left hanging is lame.\n\n- I have 15+ years of RP experience, prefer writing in third person, and typically post between 1 and 2 paragraphs.\n\n- While I'm not looking for anything NSFW, I'm not against it as long as it's not the focus.\n\n- I am LGBT and would like the RP to have an LGBT romance, but I'm not unable to play a f/m romance. Likewise I'm able to play any gender identity, but obviously I'd prefer to play female.\n\nAbout you:\n\n- Be 21+. Sorry, I just get along a little better with people closer to my age. \n\n- Willing to write in third person, contribute equally to the story, and be literately competent.\n\n- Enjoy chatting between posts and being the friendlies, I find it helps the RP when people click and enjoy each other's shenanigans.\n\nIf you've read all that and would like to help flesh out a new story and explore character development, drop me a line! Please don't use reddit's chat though, I... uh, don't use it.",

I've RPed for about roughly 10 years so I have extensive experience in telling a story and writing. I prefer discord but am open to other means of communication.\n\nA fellow roleplayer and I came up with this Slice of Life Futuristic roleplay that revolves around the idea that every person has an actual soulmate. And how your soulmate is determined is through an algorithm system created by the government to lower the number of divorces within the nation. In this society, the Amoura System is everything. Those who go against the Amoura System and marry for love are casted out into society/looked down upon.\n\nThe idea is that our characters fall madly in love with one another in despite not being each other soulmates and desperately try to get away with only loving one another even though society tells them not too.\n\nAnother thing I would like to note on is when I say Romance and NSFW, I'm not talking about purely smut... Yeah, I like those types of scenes as much as the next guy but what's the point if our character's don't mash well together. There has to be build, yearning, love between them.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of cheesy, I know. But it something that I\u2019m looking to explore and I hope you are too.\n\nThank you for reading!",

Characters from other franchises including but not limited to DC are an absolute no. We can set up a starting point from there together that works for both of us, because it's really dependent on who you choose to portray.\n\n\nLong-term or short-term, well-thought-out plot or no plot at all, doesn't matter to me! **All I ask is for you to be somewhat literate** as I usually write a couple paragraphs each message, though I can settle for a single paragraph if it's detailed enough and gives me something to work with.\n\n\nThis roleplay will be building up to and include smut, though that's not the be-all, end-all. How long we take to get there can be decided on before we start. \n\n\nShoot me a Reddit PM with your Kik username if any of this intrigues you, then we can talk specifics on there.

            "selftext": "I am looking to roleplay a dramatic story about injustice with a focus on detail and realism. It has violence but it is NOT a dumb sequence of action, instead it has dialogs and violence is just a way to add grittiness to the drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading this summary is not enough to play with me, you need to read ALL the ad. It is a long text, but everything is important. On the upside, being so long and full with details actually streamlines and makes quicker the brainstorming process in comparison to discussing all the details one by one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also open to proposals for changing things in my ad, so if you wanna change/add anything, tell me (and then I will tell you if I am fine with the change or not). If you don't tell me, I won't know, and I will assume the story everything is unmodified. Please be clear and straightforward if you want anything. Whenever there are different options, please tell me which one you prefer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## BACKGROUND\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story is set in a near future dystopia (no sci-fi or gadgetry) with great wealth gap and laws that favor the wealthy. My character is a young woman whose brother is heavily indebted with her bank. The bank threatens with sending him, his wife and kids to jail for many years, and the conditions in jail mean they would suffer and eventually die there. The bank offers her the possibility to work for a manufacturer of military equipment of which is the bank is a main stakeholder, in return to cancelling the debts. However, the \"work\" is that she will be used as guinea pig for brutal experiments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she is offered this, it would be stressed if she wants the debt to be cancelled, she has to be fully cooperative during the experiment and not produce any problem. This would ensure that the person carrying out the experiment has an easier job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## THE WEAPON\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like the experiment to be about testing a particular weapon called a \"gauntlet\". It would look similar to a medieval gauntlet, but plain (no decorations) and made of a very hard titanium alloy. Each (movable) joint would have a sensor and a driver. The sensor would detect the movement produced by the wearer and the driver would follow it, but with more strength. So it would work like power steering in a car: the gaunlet lets the wearer move each finger freely, but moves with a force up to 50 times stronger than what the bare hand could do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to allow handling regular objects with precision, the force amplification would be non-linear. This means that when the user applies little strength with the fingers, the gauntlet does not amplify the force. As he applies more force, the gauntlet starts amplifying progressively by a factor of 2, 3, 4, 5... with a smooth transition, not step-wise. The maximum amplification would allow each finger independently to apply 50 kg of force (compare with the maximum of 4-9 kg that a regular finger can apply).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe don't need to go into details of how the technology would work, but just assume it's advanced enough that the sensors, the drivers and the power source would be very compact, so overall the gauntlet looks like just a smil-fitting metal gauntlet without any considerable extra bulk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe tester could use two gauntlets simultaneously, one in each hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## THE PLAY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to start the play where she knocks the door of the lab. The lab is in a big building outside the city. She was given an appointment to come to the building at 8 am, her purse was taken and she waited one hour until she was told to walk on her own to a specific lab, which is where we start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are two options here, please tell me which one you prefer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- At the moment when we start, she has just been told that it's about an experiment that implies serious risks, and that she will have to fully cooperate if she wants her family to get the help. Once in the lab room, before the experiment starts, he will give her a contract to sign that specifies in more detail the test with the gauntlet and the kind of damage that she is exposed to. She will have to sign it right there. The scene where she signs is meant to have a strong symbolism about her acceptance of the situation. However, it also makes the story longer and it's not a must.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The other option is that she has already signed the contract some days before she comes to the lab, and she already knows the details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the whole story, I would like if there are dialogs and things are played in detail, without hurrying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## ADDITIONAL NOTES\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following points describe my general preferences for roleplaying, regardless of which story I am playing. Some things may already be mentioned in the previous part but others not, so please read everything here as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPSYCHOLOGICALLY REALISTIC CHARACTERS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINJUSTICE. I like my character to get an underserved ill fate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCOERCED COOPERATIVENESS. My character is never, EVER, going to enjoy her own ordeal. At the same time, I tend to avoid stories based on restrains or physically pushing the girl around for her to do things. What I DO like is her to be coerced or manipulated into cooperating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBRAINSTORMING. I enjoy brainstorming some stories for longer than other people, but I can also keep it short if it is necessary. If you have some limit, you have to tell me in advance! If you don't, I will assume there is none. Also, please tell me the word banana if you are new talking to me, I use this as a first measure to filter out the people that didn't read the whole ad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBE ABLE TO FOCUS ON A TASK. I like to focus on stories so I can produce something as decent as I am able to, given my non-native skills. Of course, RL happens to everybody and it can obviously take priority over RP, in which case things may be slower or interrupted. But I come from pre-smartphone-era roleplaying, when people could focus on things. If it always takes you ages to reply because you \\[i\\]cannot conceive\\[/i\\] doing something without multitasking 5 other conversations or social media feeds, then we are not compatible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTART THINGS THAT YOU CAN FINISH. A lot of people here eagerly and enthusiastically plan stuff they later don't have commitment to play. It's a waste of time for both of us. Of course, RL happens, and one is also free to stop being interested in something (and communicating it like an adult). But serious, mature people with responsibilities in life are used to asking themselves: -Do I have time to finish this task I am starting? Will I \"not be in the mood\" too often?- Please do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQUALITY OVER QUANTITY. I play with detail: to play one in-story hour can take one RL hour, easily much more. No time-warps where a conversation in a 30-min car ride lasts 3 turns, thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTORY LENGTH. Therefore, the INTERNAL time of my stories tends to be short, so they can be played in a manageable amount of RL time. Something between half an hour to a few hours that can heavily affect my character's life, but at the same time can be played in proper detail. I DON'T try to cram the story with too many things that later will have to be played in a crappy manner, or not even played at all because of lack of RL time. I DON'T try to play weeks and months of her life at a s-standard level of detail or making constant time-jumps that neglect all the important details and nuances. In RL time, my short-terms usually take \\[u\\]between 2 and 6 RL hours, assuming full time (no multitasking)\\[/u\\]. This can be divided in one, two, perhaps three sessions (if you have little time in the first, it can be limited to brainstorming). Note for people that are not available often: if more than three days pass between two sessions, we will have to re-read logs to get the details fresh enough; if your availability patterns make this liekly, please ask yourself if you can deal with this overhead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVARIABLE TURN LENGTH. A lot of people feel like post length defines them as roleplayers. No. Turns can be long or short depending on the situation. When a situation is interactive, turns may need to be short (down to even just one sentence) so one doesn't start assuming the other character's behaviour. But these turns are also much quicker so overall speed of play should be equivalent! At the same time, certain turns can be up to several paragraphs if there are relevant details that can be detailed in a single block without interaction. But filling a simple reply from one character with useless verbosity doesn't make one a better roleplayer.",

            "selftext": "Hi! Thanks for reading this. I've been wanting to do an RP based on Jojo's Bizarre Adventure for awhile now. However I'm interested more in going the AU route rather than canon. What I really want to do is something that involves a \"realistic\" scenario with Stands thrown in as a monkey wrench. Here are the two I've devised so far:\n\nScenario A:\n\n*The night sky was dotted with glowing stars as the sun retreated. A soft, cold breeze whirled along the air. The sleepy little town was beginning to collectively shut down as stores closed and people went home to their families. It was one out of thousands of quiet nights here in the town of Pottersville, Nebraska. Maize grew on the town's northern flank, while livestock  were gradually herded into their barns in the south. The only thing breaking up the flat horizon was a small copse of trees about two miles wide. Nothing here had ever happened out of the ordinary...*\n\n*So few people even noticed when a meteor came blazing through the sky. It crashed into the trees, avoiding any casualties. It barely knocked a few trees down. However, two people in town did notice. They felt... drawn, almost compelled, to go to the meteor and see what it was, not knowing that it carried a strange virus that could awaken the Stands of living beings...*\n\nScenario B:\n\n*Lyon, France. Interpol Headquarters. A crime wave has struck across Europe and is beginning to spread to other continents. Robberies where entire trucks are stolen. Murders with no traceable weapons or clues. Stories of people flying, or being in two places at once. The nations of Europe and the Americas have formed a coalition to find any kind of pattern in these crimes. Two agents have been assigned to work together, each from differing backgrounds.*\n\n*Finally, a lead pops up. A sighting of a man who can seemingly breathe fire in Sicily. The agents are sent with a task force to apprehend this individual and bring him in, hoping to interrogate him to get a clue as to where these strange powers are coming from.*\n\n*Plans are laid, resources brought together. A strategy is formed. The task force begins their sting operation... and are woefully unprepared. A group of these mysterious empowered beings attack the task force and decimate it. The two agents are cornered, but rather than being killed, one of the criminals strikes them both with a strange Arrow. Both agents fall unconscious...*\n\n*When they wake up, each one sees a strange being at their side. They have both become Stand users, and have to escape...*\n\n\n\nI'm open to doing something more in line with canon too (as long as I don't play something weird like Speedwagon's secret grandson or the Lulz the forgotten fifth pillar man), but I'd REALLY like to try one of the two above ones. \n\nMedium: Discord/Reddit PM\n\nAvailability:\n\nI am available in the afternoons and evenings mainly on weekdays. Weekends are a bit of a toss up. I usually aim to reply 3-5 times per day.\n\nRating: I typically like to keep things around a PG/PG-13 level. I do NOT do NSFW stuff.\n\nGateway profile:https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayGateway/comments/bp4ggy/turiannerevarine/\n\nPM me if interested! (please be 20+)",

However, just before he died the Pirate King spoke his last words, screaming them to the Heavens, telling all that he had hid his treasure, the One Piece, at the end of the Grand Line, and encouraged all to seek it out.\n\nThis has sparked the interest of many a generation, encouraging people to go out and become pirates to claim riches for themselves, creating \u2018The Great Pirate Age\u2019.\n\nSo for those of you who don\u2019t know, this roleplay is inspired by One Piece, the popular manga/anime of the same name, however you don\u2019t need to know anything about One Piece.\n\nNow what am I looking for? Well I\u2019m hoping to find a partner that wants to sail the seas with me as a pirate, adventuring from island to island, raising our bounties as we go and forming a mighty crew. More details can be discussed over messages.\n\nNow for writing style, I am pretty easy on this, I don\u2019t mind if we roleplay 1st or 3rd person and I don\u2019t mind about your post length as long as I\u2019m able to reply to it.\n\nI hope this post has interested you and if so please shoot me a message.",

If you would be interested in this, please leave a message here! Please also note whether you'd prefer to take on a canon role or an oc role.   \n\n\nOtherwise, since I've tried to pull this together a few times and failed, I'd love to get some 1x1 roleplays going, still set in NITW.

I\u2019m very open-minded and imaginative!\n\nAlso, all characters I\u2019m requesting are, or will be as of our story, over 18 years of age.\n\nBelow in the prompts, you'll see that I put \"MC\" instead of my character's name.\n\n-The Canon Anime and Video Game characters of main interest are:\n\n-Final Fantasy XV [The Chocobros and/or Arden] (Prompt: MC finds a portal that leads out of her own dimension and into a different. Curious after a large daemon comes out of it, she decides to find the cause of the disturbance in time and space, sending her into her final fantasy.)\n\n-Final Fantasy XIV [Your WoL/Warrior of Light, Zenos, Nero, Lord Hien, Leofard, Haurchefaunt, Sir Aymeric, Estinien, Estinien Taken Over By Nidhogg, other members of the empire.] (Prompt can be discussed in PM or Kik.)\n\n-Kingdom Hearts [Terra, Axel, Xemnas, Terranort, Roxas, Riku, or Vanitas] (Prompt: When accidentally opening a door that she was blatantly told not to during an important mission, MC finds herself on a strange island after a blinding light came from the open door. She had no idea what the door did, but it wasn't there when she looked behind herself. And she had now idea how to get back...)\n\n-[Persona 4: Tohru Adachi:] (My character finds herself in Inaba after escaping a town a ways away (could be Tokyo or another rural town), and Tohru Adachi finds her. The Accomplice route will be mandatory for this storyline. How he reacts to finding out that my character isn\u2019t human is up to you.)\n\n-[Persona 4: Yu Narukami/Souji Seta:] (When coming to Inaba, my character decides to find a home to \u201ctemporarily\u201d stay in, and finds Yu/Souji\u2019s home after being run out in a few. Yu finds her, and what follows can be discussed in PM.)\n\n-[Persona 5: Akira/Ren:] (Since I already have a background story for My Character\u2019s P5 version, I believe she should be found in Mementos. Where she is found in Mementos and during what time in the P5 story depends on you.)\n\n-[Persona 5: Goro Akechi:] (This route could go the same way of Adachi, however, not much is known about his normal life aside from him getting ordered around by Shido. My Character could possibly find him in Mementos, or in one of the victims\u2019 palaces.)\n\n-Boku no Hero Academia [Kacchan, Todoroki, or Izuku]  (Prompt: About 25 years had passed since MC's story (which won't be stated but, just know she already has a story made), and after thousands of odd cases showing up with youth having unique and inhuman abilities, MC had traveled to Japan as a normal monthly occurrence. But when she did this time, a villain had decided to arrived and try to take her body over. Accidentally triggering her inner daemon to come out in front of others which made her look like a villain as well. Being the man who is always on time, All Might arrives and questions MC before taking her to the police station for more in-detail questioning. After finding out that she isn\u2019t actually a villain but one in neutral standing, and sees what power she has, he asks her to attend U.A to see what the heroes have to offer. That\u2019s where our story begins.)\n\n-Owari no Seraph [Mikaela or Yuu] (Prompt: After a virus outbreak had nearly destroyed humans on earth, MC woke from a rather long, five year slumber. Only to find that her forest had been completely destroyed by ice and hideous creatures called: The Horsemen Of John. Coincidentally, vampires find her outside her now ruined home and take the demon to their home, wanting to know why the creature was in the middle of no-where and why her blood had smelt more delicious than the finest human...)\n\n-Tokyo Ghoul [Kaneki Ken] (Prompt: MC has finally gotten a chance to travel away from her home land to vacation in Japan. Choosing Tokyo as the best option, she rather enjoys her time there with the many delicious foods and courteous citizens that helped her find her way around the areas like Shinjuku, Harajuku, Asakusa, and the various areas around. However... Upon finding some \u2018creature\u2019 eating a human within an alleyway, MC immediately realizes that this was probably the worst decision of her life, and with the creature turning it\u2019s gaze to her, she hoped there was a chance of escaping.)\n\n-Blue Exorcist [Rin Okumura] (Prompt: MC had just gotten a call from Mephisto from Japan while all the way North East in Canada. Apparently, she's up to no good yet again, so MC didn't have a choice in the matter other than to travel straight to Tokyo. Only to find that the Devil's son, her mortal enemy, is there.)\n\n-Deadman Wonderland [Crow or any OCs would be great for this] (Prompt: After being accused for a crime she hadn't done, and getting humiliated publicly, MC was thrown into a type of amusement park for psychos. Instead of any normal prison, these prisoners had to entertain people that attended the carnival and attractions by properly getting through the traps and courses. Without dying. And to keep themselves from dying, they had to get some type of bitter-tasting candies and survive their sentences. Her sentence wasn't the only thing she had to worry about however, as there was more to fear underground.)\n\n&gt;-For OC users, my base plots of this post are currently Omegaverse/ABO.\n\n\nPlease discuss prompts with me in private! I have many ideas, however, they might not be agreeable so I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts and input, please and thank you! (Ideas that I have in mind will be sent in PM.)\n\nThat aside, I plan on writing as my main character, who is a Hybrid species, so you\u2019ll get their information from a link and references. In depth information will be sent upon request. :)\n\nHopefully I\u2019ll get some interest in this, but thank you in advance for taking the time to read! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "Hello all - I'm looking to do a rp with a sorta specific storyline idea I've come up with, though I'm open to brainstorming more on the subject! I would play Darcy Lewis (weird choice, I know, but I for some reason dig these pairings?), an OFC of mine, or possibly Peggy Carter, but I've never written her so it might take me a little bit to dial in to her frequency. I would like you to play Steve Rogers and/or Bucky Barnes (had one person suggest both and if that's your thing, sign me up). The storyline I had in mind is as follows: Darcy or Peggy or the OC, we'll call just MC (for my character) and Steve or Bucky (S/B) meet in the 1940s, right after the 107th has been rescued by Cap and the Howling Commandos unit is formed. MC is one of the nurses assigned to the unit, where she meets S/B! Cue a few sparks, a budding friendship/relationship, and hopefully a slow burn? And then, of course, a little tragedy. Bucky goes into the ice, and then it's Steve's turn, and then, finally, MC gets grabbed by Hydra and gets the Soldier treatment. The time frame in which MC goes under will probably change depending on the character you would want to play. If Bucky is the character being used we can include a fun little dark interlude with them both working for Hydra, not knowing each other but there's still SOMETHING there - til eventually they are separated again. Everyone ends up in the 21st century, and I was thinking of our characters meeting perhaps a year after the events of TWS - but before CW. Honestly? Kinda throwing CW and everything after it out the window. OUR canon now. So, a year: long enough I think for Hydra programming to have been broken through enough to allow MC to recognize S/B and for Bucky to recognize MC if we're using him. And then from there we can have them take down Hydra and other baddies as we come up with them - this is just a foundation! I would prefer romance to be a decent part of the story, but not to make it all about that INSTANTLY. I think things need to build to a realistic place. From there, NSFW scenes are A-Okay for the most part, but not the core of the story, please.\n\nAbout my writing: I write in third person and past tense, and my reply length varies depending on the current story situation. There are times for long introspection or lots of details, but sometimes all you need is a couple lines of dialogue to keep the story moving. I pretty much always want to mainly play a female character and have FxM pairings, but I'll play side characters of any gender as needed throughout the story. I don't really like doubling, I find it overwhelming. I don't love pairing my characters with other OCs unless it's in certain fandoms (or out of fandoms) and the OC is like... a realistic person, you feel? I prefer to rp with people who have good spelling and a decent grasp of grammar - though playing fast and loose with the rules for the sake of style is totally understandable.\n\nI'm good with writing pretty much anything, but I prefer to rp with those that are 18+, mostly because I'm CERTAINLY not writing smut with a minor. And it's also NOT primarily about the smut. I'm not interested in fulfilling your long line of dirty nonsense that several people have brought to me that have nothing to do with the fandoms I've listed. Sick of that, lads!\n\nAbout me: I'm a 21 year old rper who has been going maybe 7 or 8 years now. I like drama and romance (and some smut) in my rps, and I think rps thrive on good arcs of conflict. Interpersonal drama, dangerous threats, and the (very) occasional dash of lighthearted fun. Again - I mainly play females - but I'll do side characters who pop in and out.\n\nI would like you to be: literate! I don't need purple prose but I'd like a little detail - I like my rps to feel like a good book - it's not a race! Reply frequency does not matter to me - I understand that real life is inevitable!\n\nSend me a message if you're into this idea!",

            "selftext": "**Who We Are**\n\nAs the title says, we are the Demigod Files. We are a fast growing, small community of Roleplayers, living out the lives and adventures of demigods in a modern day Camp Half-Blood. The sub went public just over three months ago and it has blown up with activity. We just wrapped up our second plot, so now is a good time for new writers to join and get their characters settled before we launch anything else . You can read more about our sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DemigodFiles/wiki/welcome) or any of the other links found in our [wiki index](https://www.reddit.com/r/DemigodFiles/wiki/index). \n\n\n**How It Works**\n\n\nWe only have a short character application to fill out before you get started, just to ensure the requested powers are reasonable and fair. Our list of gods can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DemigodFiles/comments/amqmru/godrents_and_powers/), or you can request a god not found on this list. These are just the major and minor Olympian gods, and found within the Riordan Wiki, so these are the ones listed. You may request a god outside of those listed, given they are Greek and make sense. You may also request a child of the Big Three, but understand that they will be rare; rare, but not impossible, you just have to be willing to work through the process of getting them approved.\n\nWe have a built in Experience System, that tracks the progress of your character. As they partake in lessons, camp activities and plots, they will gain experience points which can be found in our XP Tracker. This is to help make decisions during character to character conflicts, should one character never want to lose, and to prevent \u2018Mary Sue\u2019 characters who want their characters to be the best.\n\n**What is there to do at camp? What about outside it?**\n\nThere is a weekly schedule where campers can sign up to host meals, activities, or lessons. There are also a number of activities, such as campfires, cabin meetings, and even camp games like capture the flag!\n\nOutside of camp there will be quests as well as chances for personal plots. You are free to have your own adventures through storymodes, as long as you abide by the rules of the subreddit. If you ever have an idea for a camp-wide plot, or need help with a personal plot, send us a mod mail and we will do our best to help you along your way.\n\n**Never read the books or roleplayed before?**\n\nThat\u2019s okay! Many of our writers are new to roleplaying as well as a few who are new to this universe. We have plenty of references to the Riordan Wiki, which will help guide you along the way. And the mod team is always one click away should you have any questions.\n\n**OOC Chat**\n\nWe have a [discord channel](https://discord.gg/QHwftkB) for OOC chat and fun. If you want a chance to meet the writers and see what the community is like before joining, come on in. A testament to our community here are some quotes from some of our writers:\n\n&gt;btw just wanted to say i haven't been a part of this community for long but you've all been super welcoming and nice so far and theres like no OOC drama and i love it\n\n&gt;this server &amp; community has been the highlight of my day since i joined ngl\n\n&gt;I legit didn't think I'd enjoy it cause I knew nothing about the lore, but I love it here\n\n&gt;I love it here already. I also don't see any of the toxicity\n\nFeel free to jump in and check us out. We\u2019d love to have you :)",

I also like to be supernatural characters, but I would prefer you be a human. \n\nEven though I like to add elements of the otherworldly, I like to keep it realistic. By that I mean if our characters get into a fight, your character instantly attempts to kill themselves or something. Keep the reactions reasonable. \n\nHowever, I want you to have just as much fun as me! If you are bored or uncomfortable, PLEASE let me know! This is a two way street! \n\nP.S. \n\nI like to draw characters I rp with, simply because I get inspired. If we rp, I\u2019ll most likely draw your OC!",

            "selftext": "Hi! I've been wanting to do a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure RP for awhile. However, I am not really interested in playing as a canon character or as Speedwagon's surprise grandson or something, so I would rather have a more original, non-canon scenario. Particularly, I am interested in exploring what it would be like for a Stand user to exist in a more realistic setting. Here are two scenarios I've devised thus far.\n\nScenario A:\n\nCrime is on the rise throughout Europe and the Americas. However, these crimes are being committed through strange and exotic ways that are seemingly more out of a comic book than a case file. Walls with gaping holes, scorch marks littering the ground, even reports of people flying away. In response, Interpol has ordered Agent (your OC here) and Agent (my OC here) to investigate these crimes and determine if there is a pattern. Little do the agents realize that they are about to enter a world where the rules do not apply, people can use strange and bizzare powers, and where a certain arrow has marked them both...\n\nOn the first sting, their task force is almost wiped out. In a desperate shoot out, Agent A gets locked in a desperate struggle with someone almost supernaturally strong. Agent B likewise is hounded by a criminal who seems to be in two places at once. They are both pierced by two arrows, and they fall unconscious...\n\nScenario B:\n\nA small town lies in the sleepy hills of the Great Plains. Char A has recently returned from college on a break. Char B currently works with their parents at the local inn. One day, a meteor falls into the woods outside of town. Both Char A &amp; Char B go out to see it. They meet each other at the landing site, vaguely recalling each other from high school. However, they both fall unconscious in the woods. When they wake up, they are stalked by strange creatures that are only visible to them. Worse, some nefarious individuals have rolled into town, seeking to claim the meteor for themselves...\n\nIf you have something similar to suggest, feel free and I might just say yes!\n\nNo matter which direction we take it in, there are 3 things that would (possibly) carry over into our plot:\n\nStand arrows exist, but they are scattered across the world. They function the same way as in canon.\n\nStone masks may or may not exist depending on how we steer the RP.\n\nThe Ripple or Spin may exist. I'm flexible as to which one we could use. Or we could just not use either.\n\nAbout me: I've been roleplaying for about two years now. I am in my 20's and live on the east coast (so EST). I would also prefer my partner be 20-30. I am usually active in the afternoon/evenings and always try to give at least one response per day. I usually will do 3-7 sentences. Anything more and I repeat myself or just give \"hot air.\" I don't really care about face claims.\n\nPlatform: Discord/Reddit PM\n\nRomance: I only do straight MxF romance. I do NOT do NSFW.",

I'm 16 if that makes a difference? I've been role-playing for a few years. Also here's my favorite things i like doing\n\nHorror, I really like horror genre but like nobody does it. If there's a way we can figure this one out that would be cool! Original universe or borrowed (like silent hill) is cool!\n\nLife is strange, i don't do canon characters as a main character. But I really love Arcadia Bay and Blackwell. I also really the dark elements in it as well. This is one I'd really like to do.\n\nI don't really like Sci Fi or futuristic roleplays or fantasy. I used to but it isn't my thing anymore. I just like that realistic, modern take with dark themes. So if either of those two interest you, totally message me. I also got discord, and if you got any ideas you might wanna try just shoot em at me!",

There is more to read, and more to see, but if I've captured your interest, you are more than welcome to join, ask your questions, and see what Pariah has to offer.\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope to see you all in Pariah, home of the outcasts! https://discord.gg/gsj3g5X",

            "selftext": "Hey there. I'm looking for someone to create an amazing, gripping story with. The main theme I like to play is romance but we can also add different elements into it if you wish. Please note though, fantasy is a big no! I would really appreciate it if you were reliable, and tell me if it got boring because then it's fair. If you ghost me, don\u2019t expect a sudden second chance. Of course we will both have our own personal lives but I\u2019ll always communicate healthily and let you know when I\u2019m busy. If you're going to message, be serious about this too and have a clear idea about what you want. I can do first or third person, I can change my preference if needs to be. Honestly, I will NOT accept one liners nor will I respond back to you if you're just gonna ghost. I've had enough of people just coming along for short-term purposes when this is LONG term. I cannot stress that enough.\n\n\nMy list:\n\n\\~Friends from childhood.\n\n\\~Roommates.\n\n\\~Nurse and Solider/veteran.\n\n\\~Prince/Princess falls for a village girl/boy.\n\n\\~Friends with benefits\n\n\\~Rich Entrepreneur and interior designer.\n\n\\~Gang member and innocent girl.\n\n\\~Strangers\n\nAnd of course, any other ideas you wish to tell me about. Yes I know these are mildly clich\u00e8, so I\u2019m willing to spice them up and add a lot more angst, or even some dark themes if it does fit with the idea. \n\nSmut will have a very small element in this, but it won't be too overpowering as I want to enjoy the story at its fullest - so it will be discussed fully once the plot has been established and there will always be a good build-up before any NSFW. When it happens though, I'll make sure to attend to your every need.I cannot stress this enough; Please be literate (more than a paragraph at least). If you deliver on that, I will too. Roleplay is a two-way mutual thing and it has to flow accordingly in order to keep a story going. \n\nThanks for reading! I use discord, or kik. Mainly use kik though. If you have any other platform, I\u2019ll be sure to download it if I can! Also just a heads up, I am busy over the next four weeks with exams but I can reply at least once every day and freely on the weekends.",

Until my tastes change  through a different post, this one may be followed up on at your  leisure.**\n\nFirst, a few things about myself.\n\nI  am 33 come May, East Coast United States (EST/EDT), and I work a full  time job during the week. I love RP when I can get it, and there's been a  bit of a dry spell lately that's been going on since the holidays (yes,  even now 3 months later, there's still been a dry spell). I am seeking  to change that.\n\n*Please  don't be discouraged by everything here. Some things did require more  context to make sense, especially The Catch section. The best we can do  is try with each other. :)*\n\n***Basic Requirements and Options***\n\nThird person RP only, Discord is necessary.\n\nWhat  I seek is female characters (IRL gender does NOT matter) opposite any  of my males/females/inbetweens aka intersex characters. In what, you may  ask? Look below (anything in bold is a big want with me):\n\n\\-Modern (includes fantasy, **slice of life, drama. I love the whole \"love, marriage, baby carriage\" angle in any relationship I do in a story**).\n\n\\-Historical (**Medieval (vikings/Norse/Saxon/Crusades/Plantagenet/Tudors era**), Victorian/Wild West eras, **1940s/1950s/1960s play**)\n\n\\-Fantasy (this goes into either of the genres above)\n\n\\-Fandoms (Marvel/DC, **Friday  Night Lights, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones aka A Song of Ice and  Fire, Peaky Blinders, Harry Potter, Vikings, The Last Kingdom**;  others need ask. But PLEASE ask me on the possibility of playing canon  characters from these shows. There is no guarantee I may be able to play  what you want. Feel free to ask on others!)\n\n***Writing and RP Style***\n\nAs  for visuals, I have gotten dependent on them. Superficial, lacking  imagination on images? It is. But I've played in public SLs over the  years who have regularly embraced them, so it's ingrained on me.  Usually, actors/actresses/models and the occasional art.\n\nI  favor adult writing and want the same from who I play with. Give me the  romantic, intimate, and everything beyond it in detail (those that know  what this means will get it :) ). I also enjoy players who like to talk  OOC.\n\n***The catch?***\n\nPlease,  please, please be someone who can RP and talk on a daily or near-daily  basis. This is a big request. I will understand if you let me know of  anything in a timely manner! Also, be sure to check Discord at times. It  LOVES to screw with notifications.\n\nAnd  one last thing...please be someone that doesn't let much bother them or  likes blocking for small or stupid things. Be someone who is open to a  lot, and doesn't let much bother them, and we'll get along easily!\n\n*Special  Note: I am meeting too many ghosters and flakers lately. If you don't  want to talk after a single session, find your guts and say something. I  give everyone I meet a week to get back to me if IRL stuff happens,  then I move on. All I ask is you let me know something so I can give you  some time to catch up or so I can move on.*\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nFeel  free to PM me for my Discord name or offer yours. I apologize for the  long winded post, but it's the best I can do. Any interested folks who  PM me, please throw in a \"marvelous\" somewhere so I know my post was  read rather than the title. :) I look forward to meeting everyone!",

            "selftext": "Marek woke at dawn, his room in the in had a fire burning when he slept the night before, now it was a pile of barely lit embers, and the chill hit him through to the bone. He\u2019d slept in a wool tunic and trousers, a futile effort to stave off the cold of the pale white north. He rose from the bed, covered in a cold sweat, and changed the dirty sleeping clothes, for clean, and more importantly, thicker, cotton ones. \n\nMarek was a methodical man, and with that method, he covered himself in layers of boiled leather, and a thin coat of mail. He threw a surcoat over that, in the colors his father had chosen when he won a knighthood, green and purple. He tied a sword belt around his hips, and a few pouches on hooks around it. The weight made him more comfortable than he had been with the fire burning. He slid a pair of leather boots into his feet, over warming socks. He covered the skin of his hands with worn leather gloves, And dropped a thick wool cloak over his shoulders, grey and trimmed in white fur. And wrapped a thick and long scarf around his neck. That one was black. He took his bags, slung one over his shoulder, and held the other with his hand. \n\nThe wood door of the room opened to a narrow and short hallway. Marek needed to slump not to hit his head. He walked down the stairs, and into the common room. There was a fire in the hearth that gave the place a nice warmth, one he was sure to miss. He walked to the innkeeper. A comely woman, with grey hair, and crooked teeth. He dropped the bag he was holding with his hand, and slid it into a pouch, to produce two silver coins. He put the on the table and he hung the other bag on a chair. \u201cSome stew and bread. Mayhaps some cheese as well?\u201d His voice was gruff with cold and his throat dry. \u201cAye m\u2019lord.\u201d The woman responded. \n\nHe sat at a table, and waited, no more than ten minutes after, a serving wench recame me to him with his food. He placed it before him, and gave a stiff bow. \u201cM\u2019lord I-\u201c he cut in, interrupting, nothing she had to say interested him, and he had no time to waste. \u201cI\u2019m no Lord, only a knight. Have the stable boys prepare my horses, and if you would be so kind to bring me a cup of something hot, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d He tore a chunk of bread and stuffed it into his mouth. \u201cY- yes Ser\u2026\u201d the meek young girl scurried off. A different one came back from the kitchens with a cup of hot wine. \u201cYour horses will be ready when you are, Ser.\u201d She left before he said anything. \n\nBy the time he was done eating, half an hour must have passed. He took his things, and gave his thanks to the innkeeper, and pushed the door open. *and I thought I was cold before.* the thought would have almost been funny, if the frozen gust of wind didn\u2019t hurt like a knife into his bones. He made his way across the small yard to the stables. His bigger steed was saddled, the other one, had his packs over it\u2019s back. He added the two bags he held, and gave the horse a scratch behind the ear. He took off his sword belt, and secured it to the saddle carefully. He slid his hand into his coin purse, and pulled out three coppers. \n\nHe threw each one into the hands of a stable boy, he shoved his boot into a stirrup, and jumped up into his saddle. The pack horse was a grey horse, older and slower, but a bit stronger in the long run. He rode a black horse, younger faster and stronger in short bursts, though she tired faster. The horses were tied by a leather rope, from his saddle to the other horse\u2019s reins. He gave a tap into the horse\u2019s sides with his heels, and trotted of into the cold road. \nHis mission was  no mission he was on his way to a tourney to commemorate some prince\u2019s birth\u2026 or name day, he\u2019d almost forgotten already. *Who throws a tourney in the middle of a winter? And what fool decides to attend!?* he asked himself as he rode on, his breath frosting in the air before him as he went.\n\n__________________________________\n\nHello lovely people! disclaimer; I am the actual worse at titles. Now onto the post: I was bored, and though, what better than a gritty, dark and realistic low fantasy prompt to drive that boredom out? I am looking for something long term, detailed and descriptive. The topic brings that NSFW situations will arise, be them deaths and blood, or adult themes and sex. Therefore, I ask that any partner be at the very least 18 years of age. I write 2-4 detail heavy and literate paragraphs, in 3rd person exclusively. I can roleplay on reddit pms, though I prefer discord, this is not a requirement, only a preference. \n\nAs far as the setting, I was intentionally pretty vague on that. This could take place in the ASOIAF universe, or perhaps the elder scrolls universe could work as well, though perhaps that would be better for a high fantasy. I am uncertain. There is also the option of creating our own setting, if world building is something you are interested in. And for a plot, I was thinking on an adventuring couple, going into caves, fighting people and monsters, doing odd jobs for merchants and lords, and bounties for the rulers of wherever we end up. Eventually we could work a longer plot through whichever setting we settle on.",

I'm looking for someone who puts effort and detail in the replies they send. I don't expect wall after after wall of text from anyone however! I tend to write about one to three paragraphs per reply. It's okay with me if your replies are shorter/longer. Just no one liners, please.\n\n- Someone who knows the game's characters. This is a pretty important thing, given I'm only looking for people to play canon characters. Now, you don't have to know every detail about all of the characters,  I just ask that you have a general idea of how they look. How they act can be up to you, I'm not too much of a stickler on that, as long as they don't act the complete opposite way they normally do.\n\nPlots I had in mind:\n\n- My character would be a stowaway who ran away from home, sneaking aboard a cargo ship. For the last 6 months, he's been traveling the world this way, before accidentally coming across Watchpoint: Gibraltar.\n\n- Any ideas you have, I'll give them a listen. Whether they are alternative versions of my plot, or something else! (Remember: As of now, I'm only looking for people to play *canon* characters.)\n\nIf your interested, please pm me!",

            "selftext": "## The Antium Empire\n\nAntium is a medieval fantasy roleplaying server set in a land ridden with conflict. A land forcefully taken over by a former military general has left the kingdom and it's towns in a state of disarray. Corruption and crime riddle the land both on the surface and beneath it. Even where it seems peaceful, deep within the roots of every nation corruption runs deep. Set in this world, its' to your character to pick what they wish to do. A land full of opportunity, whether to take advantage of the many in need, or to provide them with the help so desperately seek.\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What is Antium?\n\nSo, let's break down to what Antium itself really is! Antium is a place for those who are looking for a controlled roleplay with an enjoyable story, player connection, and adventure across the large area that is The Antium Empire. Now, of course, there are restrictions that keep the server running well and ensure that characters do not go overboard with their powers and abilities, stray away from edge-lords, and there are a few things that tie into the lore of the server itself. Things like a set list of magical affinities one can obtain, but do not worry these are mere guidelines and magic is not solely limited to this set list and you could just speak to one of our staff about more! \u00a0\n\n## What makes it unique?\n\nSo, what exactly makes us different? What makes our community and roleplay experience something different from other servers? Well, we run off a custom lore and background. This is meant to mean that no other server holds such an environment. Though, in the case of Antium's uniqueness, it entails that no other server will contain the lore we have, the aspects we do, or the set land and its social environment and dangers the way Antium is. This server is set for a more larger-scale roleplay hence due to it's larger map and variety of channels, this means the more the merrier, but this has not broken roleplay down and there are locations to act as hubs for characters to rest back in and converse with one another which will help stray from boredom of being alone in the vast lands!\n\n\u00a0\n\n## What are the 'requirements'?\n\nSo, what are the requirements? We ask that be able to speak English fluently and have a proper understanding of what serious roleplay is! This isn't a place either to go make a PC that can turn into a 76 headed snake that can spit out goblins and giants. There is, of course, a bit of reading to be done when coming into the roleplay in the information provided, but it ensures you know everything you need to! \u00a0\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\nAntium is a new fantasy roleplaying community that provides a unique lore and background for characters to enjoy, along with a friendly community of players within the Discord. While new and small, we hope to build up a playerbase that will allow for the best experience and a large diversity among the characters. The roleplay is set for a more large-scale environment, but roleplay contains hubs as to prevent boredom from character failing to be near one another. It's the perfect place if you're looking for a new active server to get into that holds a unique sense and feel to it! We hope to see some more new faces coming to our community!\n\nDiscord Link: [https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj](https://discord.gg/EEbjSyj)",

            "selftext": "Hey all!\n\nSome of you may remember my original advert for this concept quite some time ago, but if not, this is (hopefully) going to be a relaunch of that idea, though as a group format as opposed to one on one. My apologies if I didn't get around to responding to any inquiries back then. Life really picked up more than I'd expected.  Anyway, let's dive right into it!\n\n***\n\nSet in a fictitious suburban town, this roleplay focuses on the day-to-day lives of people who have spontaneously acquired superpower and how they choose to use their newfound talents\u2014 good, evil, maybe even some kind of gray area in between. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile speculation exists as to why these abilities have come to be, none have determined a single, conclusive explanation. However, unlike the people of this town, we as the overseers of this universe *do* understand the origin of powers and how they came to be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe *contradiction*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA contradiction is a significant aspect of someone's personality/being that exists in a counter-intuitive manner to their power. It is the presence of a quality such as this one that *then* triggers a contradictory power to manifest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example: Someone with an intolerance for cold developing cryokinesis (ice manipulation). Or someone else who gravely fears heights but develops the ability to fly. So long as the contradiction persists, so do the powers. Maybe even someone with laser vision whose blindness renders their power borderline useless. The greater the contradiction hinders one's existence, the more potent their powers become. \n\n***\n\nThe target age range for main characters would lie anywhere from early teens to late twenties (Though older adults are welcome too! The world *does* need them after all!). Ideally, this roleplay would feature elements of action, slice-of-life, perhaps even romance and angst depending on how OC relations are built and grow. Want to be an average student who struggles with the development of their newfound powers? A vigilante taking law enforcement into their own hands? A villain with a self-interested personal agenda? All of it's welcome!\n\n***\n\n**If you are interested in participating, please send me a DM proposing a power with its respective contradiction**. **Though if you're experiencing writer's block, don't fret! I'd be more than happy to help you develop a character concept!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope to hear from you soon!",

I'm 24, female, but playing a male character. \n\n18+, but 21+ is even better.\n \nRelatively active. At least one post a day, preferably more than that. I know life comes up and people get busy, and that's totally cool, just let me know ahead of time if you'll be busy, and I'll do the same. \n\nI want more than one line, but not a book. Too little is boring, but too much bogs thongs down. Depending on the situation, a few lines to a paragraph is fine by me. Quality over quantity. I just want enough to work with. \n\nI'm in a US timezone, and would prefer you be as well.\n\nThe Roleplay plot:\n\nFor my idea, I want to play a character who, due to a birth defect, has been mute since birth. He can hear just fine, just can't speak.\n\nI would like you to play a female who can speak just fine. The idea of this rp is to explore that kind of relationship, and all that comes with being with someone who is non-verbal.\n\nIt's up to you what your character does and how she lives life, but I don't want a 'damsel' type. A stonger, more firey/sassy type character would be ideal. Not someone made of stone, but someone who can make and take a joke. Do with that what you will. \n\nI only RP on discord these days.

            "selftext": "Hello! So I feel like I should give a bit of background here. I've been doing Rps for 10+ years and in that time I've done all kinds of stuff groups and 1 on 1's of all different kinds of RPs wether short lived or long term there's not much I haven't done. That being said thing slowed down for me a great bit over the years and I lost touch with a fair amount of my RP friends till I was down to just doing it with one person for the last few years till things took a rather bad turn and now I no longer have that person in my life. So now I'm kinda in a limbo where I'd love to Rp with someone but it's hard for me to get comfortable. Mostly I don't even know where to start I got so comfortable rping with the same person for so long I'm not even sure how to go about finding partners now. I've tried in the past with places like Amino but those usually back fired pretty hard or the people I tired with just didn't have anything to really add to the RPs. So I'm hoping to get some advice if anyone is willing to share and maybe I can find some fun new partners. \n\nAlso I'd like to add that sorry if the post is kind of long this is my first post ever on Reddit and I'm writing this with my phone. On another note I'm not sure if it matters but I'm a Female but I've played all kinds of character types (male, ect.) so it's not really a big deal to me, and feel free to PM or comment to me if there's anything you're curious about I'm a pretty open book.",

If you have a plot that you would wanna try out I am open to that too. If your not interested in a cyberpunk rp and would Like to do something else all together then I would be ok with that too.

            "selftext": "Hey there. \n\nI guess I should start this off with a little bit about me: my name is Ashley, I'm 21 and happily married. I live in Hawaii, I recently moved here, actually. My husband is military, so I'm here for the next three years! It makes finding suitable roleplay partners pretty difficult since most things I see are Central or Eastern Standard. In the future there will be periods of time where I am back in EST due to leave and whatnot. There will be a period of time where I'm probably going to be in Okinawa. So, y'know.\n\nI really would prefer if you're 18+ because I'm not comfortable with the idea of our RP possibly having adult or mature themes and you being a minor. People get in a lot of trouble for less. I also don't do strictly NSFW, and I don't want a whole rp about NSFW themes. It's not something I'm comfortable with  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af . \n\nI think I'm a good writer, but I'm not George R. R. Martin or Tolkien good. I can have my moments where my writing will surprise me, though. I've been roleplaying since I was about 12 or 13, however I haven't had a RP group or partner for about two years. Just me and my own devices, I guess.\n\nI'm a pretty easy going person, honestly. I do have a life outside of my phone and computer, so understand that I reply when I have time. My husband works from 4am - 4pm and I work as a dog sitter for Rover, so I usually have a lot of time on my hands to get creative!\n\nI *really* enjoy building a world, its lore, and creating interesting characters for that world. I'm big on fantasy: magic, dragons, spirits, you name it. I really enjoy Skyrim, RDR/RDR2, D&amp;D, Perfect World (real lame I know), but I can do almost anything as long as I have a decent understanding of the idea you're pitching!   \n\n\n*^(Also my in laws are in for a week, so you're helping me run away from them.)* My Discord handle is Ohto#8976 \n\nSorry I rambled.

Welcome to my second post!\n**If I didn't reply to your message please send another one, I'm more than open to start something right now.**\n\nI'm female, 20, in the PNW timezone but I can be flexible. I'm very versatile when it comes to my roleplays. I have a few lists of prompts and starters. I like the usual slice of life or overused couple tropes. We can pick a simple line plot and develop from there. We could do one character each and focus on that couple. We could make a group of characters for one plot or pick a few plots and do multiple roleplays at once. I want to build plots, characters, and relationships. I love falling in love with characters - making playlists, moodboards, stories, etc. for the characters or couples. \n\n* If you aren't comfortable with specific themes, please let me know. I have a preference for intense plots and characters which means it usually involves adult themes, gore, or NSFW situations. If you aren't comfortable with something, let me know so I can adjust.\n* I don't expect paragraphs or book length for every reply. I prefer to see you put effort into your response. Don't get me excited for the roleplay and then skip out last minute just as we are starting. \n* I prefer to control my own character how I please. I go back and forth between 3rd or 1st point of view depending on the character or situation. Let me know if you have a preference. \n\nIf you love fandoms, like myself, I have a list of ones I'd be interested in using for a roleplay. This would involve my favorite movies, television shows, comic books, video games, and books. Might be a bit long. \n\nI can roleplay over google docs, discord, tumblr, or just through private message on here. If you have a group you think I may be interested in, let me know!\n\nMessage me and let's start something! Anything!",
